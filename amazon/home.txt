5 #### I love that if I want to just have one cup of tea , that I can accomplish it . It is both easy to clean & quite easy to use with my loose . Thank you for an amazing product .
1 #### Does not work even tho the sun shines directly on it in the afternoon . Tried changes places , but still barely shows up .
5 #### It arrived promptly . We had no problems putting it together and it has been great for keeping all of our miscellaneous grill stuff in .
5 #### I 've owned about a half dozen pruning shears over the years . I 've never worn any out . Mostly I lose or misplace them and then I buy a replacement . About 2 1/2 years ago I was picking up some new tools in a garden shop and I bought a pair of Fiskars pruning shears . I 'd never heard of the brand , but the clerk assured me that Fiskars made good garden tools . ( I might add that Fiskars was about the only brand the shop sold . ) Well , I purchased the Fiskars pruning shears and a Fiskars lopper and I 've been very satisfied with these particular garden tools , much more so than other brands I 've owned . The Fiskars Pruning Shears are somewhat crude in appearance but they 're ruggedly built and maintain a sharp cutting edge . I 've put these shears to a lot of use and they 've yet to be sharpened . Plus , the blades seem to be absolutely stiff and do n't bend under forceful use . I can cut green limbs up to about 3/4 " with these . I 'd say this is the best pruning shears I can remember using , certainly much better than the last two brands . I ca n't help notice " Made in U S A " stamped on one side of the tool . I hope this is still true . Gary Peterson
4 #### Simple to use , Does n't have a lot of settings on it , but has enough to be used with the bug zapper purchased .
5 #### I have needed such a tool for quite some time . This is a first rate piece manufactured in Pennsylvania . Considerably larger than expected , but will certainly open Mason jars with ease .
4 #### A very Handy to Handle Pizza Cutter . Its a Big Pizza Cutter , but sometimes Bigger is Better , compared to the smaller options available . Its easy to use , just go back and forth , In order to ensure the pizza does nt move , I usually Hold the Pizza and use the other hand to do the back and forth option . No regrets , my only annoyance is cleaning it , since its a wheel , I usually hold the wheel and clean it with a rag or wipe , since the wheel will get dirty from the Pizza with Cheese and tomatoe sauce , but its great for what it is
5 #### If you have a pond , this is a necessity . One cup every now and then ( I have a 1500 gallon pond ) , depending on the temperature and sunlight ( Alga love sunlight ) and you just might stay on top of the situation . Add this to routine filter cleaning and adding bacteria and you 've solved most of your pond problems .
5 #### Great project . Easy to use . Durable . I use this tool all the time working on my projects . Expectations met . Thank you .
5 #### The handle and balance of this offset spatula is just right for my hand . Everything I 've ever purchased from OXO has been of superior quality as well as being offered at a reasonable price . I do n't know what more to say about this , except that I would recommend it to anyone , and actually , that 's what I 'm doing right here and right now !
4 #### I bought one of these after my craftsman broke and since they do n't replace them for free anymore . I have been very impressed thus far with this tape 's performance . It is larger , easier to read , and the tape seems more durable than others I 've used . I would highly recommend this measuring tape . I did n't give it 5 stars because the Bostitch tape has the metal tab made to grab onto and hold onto the edge of the wood and this does n't . Since it 's made by the same company , I 'm not sure why they do n't go the extra mile and add this to their FatMax line since it is an asset to have , at least in my opinion .
5 #### Great light this is a second unit we like these so much , only wish it came with the battery but hey for the price it is a good deal
1 #### WASEN'T LIKE THE INFO READ , WAS NOT NEEDED AT ALL FOR THE DUST DEPUTY , ALL HOSES REQUIRED ARE 2.5 INCH
5 #### I use this tea ball for making minty iced tea - I stuff it with mint leaves and steep them in a pot of tea as I 'm running it through my coffee maker . Perfect for that purpose .
5 #### The title of this review says it all . These blades have a separate set of teeth that cut each side of the kerf . You can actually end up with cuts that do n't need sanding ! These cut through everything I have tried them on like butter . They are particularly good on plywood . I use them in my Bosch Jigsaw ( see that review , also ) . I suppose they will fit other brands that have a bayonet mount . If you find a smoother cutting blade , let me know !
4 #### Really good quality , especially for the price . Super easy to put together and holds more than I thought . Really happy with my purchase .
5 #### Well made , comfortable to use , & does what it 's supposed to . Has made it through many many dishwasher cycles without any problems .
3 #### Spinning salad , vegetables and other greens will produce a surprising amount of water still hanging around after washing . This item does an excellent job of getting rid of the excess water . The problem is every time you use it there are 4 separate parts to clean and that get 's annoying .
5 #### Great wisk ... not much else to say about it . The grip was better than I thought .
3 #### Does n't really seam to do anything . Have not noticed any less mosquitos but it is TX and we 've had so much rain who knows . I think we have super mosquitos at this point anyway ....
4 #### Works well . Wish they were just a little more resilient .
4 #### I have always used a vertical potato masher , and I am not the biggest fan of this one where you have to push down . You can not go as fast and because the holes are so small , you ca n't make lumpy mashed potatoes . This is fine with my , but my girlfriend is not a fan ... Overall it works , but I would n't buy it again
4 #### I love the fact that I can have two appliances - blender and food processor - combined into one . It saves a lot of space in the kitchen .
5 #### I go through a lot of these bulbs with my kitchen lighting . They are used in the under - cabinet lights and the pendant above the counter . About a year ago I replaced half of them with LEDs . This increased the life of the regular bulbs considerably ( lower currents in the system means less wear and tear , so the speak ) . But they still burn out . These bulbs are a perfect replacement . They seem slightly less bright than say the GE brand that you get at the hardware store or the IKEA replacement bulbs , but the difference is barely noticeable . I give them a thumbs - up .
4 #### Certainly a very heavy duty ladder hook , but with that comes some pretty substantial weight , especially when using two ( even though they are sold individually ) , which is highly recommended for added safety . Another possible downside is that , unlike most other brands of ladder hook , the wheel swivels , which can sometimes cause the ladder to travel partially sideways when pushing it toward the roof peak . But , unless someone is using these hooks literally everyday , the lower price of the hook ( especially in comparison with other brands ) certainly does offset the issues with it .
5 #### seems like a super sharp effective tool for slicing through bread , love it ! i bought it with a breadmaker but sent the breadmaker back and kept the knife
5 #### Delivered timely and well packaged . OM goodness , what an axe ! I am not a muscle guy , 61 y.o . professional .... , but this axe makes me look like mountain Jim , lol . You sling this axe and what ever piece of wood you are aiming , is going to split . A truly next generation in axes . I persuaded my wife to try it , she was amazed that she could split wood for our fireplace and grilling . I doubt she will keep doing the wood splitting , but that is another story . Need an axe , buy this one ! It even comes with a hanging sheath .
5 #### They fit perfectly and with the early snow I am very happy there covered
5 #### I bought this to keep the sparrow birds out of my snaps and grapes and it works great . Great price on Amazon as well !
1 #### I have a 16 - oz . Perky - Pet hummingbird feeder and purchased this mop to clean it out . Well , it 's too short to reach the bottom of the feeder . You 'd think the manufacturer would have checked this out . Needs to be another 1.5 " long .
5 #### For the price of this set , it 's an excellent product . The blades that I 've used they have cut through nicely .
3 #### Okay product that helps keep the hole centered in the hinge screw hole . If your doing a lot of holes though the drill bit flutes do n't clear the wood very well because of the centering housing around the bit so you have to stop and clear the bit by hand every few holes .
5 #### This summer was really bad for flies and yellow jackets for some reason but this took care of the ( yellow jacket ) problem ! ! ! I actually bought 2 of the fly traps AND 2 of the yellow jacket traps . I purchased them late August and we just had our first FREEZE so I 'm taking them down and throwing them away now finally . I want to take pictures to post but it 's pretty gross . They are all LOADED to the rim . These worked for me and made my time outside this summer a lot more enjoyable .
3 #### Remember the days of high quality items that were made with the importance of longevity ? Well this is n't one of those items . Its cheaply made . Eventually the stiching will come apart around the zipper and it will be trash . Now that that is out of the way , this bag is cheap in price and worth purchasing . I typically use dust collection on my field table saw but when I only have a few rips to cut I use this . I use a Dewalt portable table saw and this Bosch bag fits with no issues . The squeeze type collar should allow it to attach to most any site saw . It catches tons of dust , chips and debris from the dust port of my saw . The material is light weight and honestly I do n't believe its enough to last the test of time . The stitching is really the main issue . Its just poorly done . The bottom line is for the price , the clean up it saves you pays for this in just a few jobs . Being able to quickly pull the bag and dump it and put you saw away is valuable in saving time . For someone that s takes care of their tools this could potentially last for years . I have purchased a few of these and will continue to do so . Please if you find my review helpful , let Amazon know by clicking the helpful button below .
5 #### My favorite tongs and imon my second pair , the first lasted over 10 years . Much better gripping food and not getting the food sticking to the ends . The plastic coated ones are not as good .
1 #### Husband really has a thing for atomic clocks , so he picked this one out to hang on the living room wall where we could see it from all the kitchen , dining room etc We set the clock up per instructions provided in front of a window after we popped in the battery . This crazy clock is consistently 10 mins behind ; tried and true ! We tested and tried it with a new battery and then the same problem . We waited a few days and it still 10 mins slow ..... I ca n't tell you how disappointed we are because it looked great on the wall ! We would purchase another 18 " clock as it was clearly visible from the kitchen dining room and living room ! ! Sadly , it went back . Thank you Amazon for free returns on defective merchandise . Perhaps it would work in another area of the country . We live in a rural area on a mountain top . From all the positive reviews I assume that it would possibly work in other areas where the signal is stronger . I can not comment on how to figure out signal strength though ; good luck on the one ! ! Guessing there are many other folks with the same problem as there are many used ones for sale .......... so you could probably get a great deal ! ! ! ! :)
5 #### We have this exact 30 ounce feeder in So . Calif and need to fill it every day ( use 1 cup white sugar to 4 cups water .... http://www.hummingbirds.net/feeders.html#recipe ) and simply use a funnel to fill it with a 32 ounce Pyrex glass container . I did n't want to get the model 220 because the clear reservoir is plastic ... Glass is better for cleaning and maintaining . We usually have 6 to 12 hummers ( or more ) feeding most of the day . There will be 6 birds eating with others waiting or cutting in . Although there is a newer model 209b that has a wider mouth for filling and cleaning , I 'm concerned that the base , which can be taken apart for cleaning , might leak since it is n't one unit like this model 209 . I 'm picking up another of this model 209 to have two going at the same time , and to have a least one still out when cleaning the other with hot water & bleach .
5 #### I love several features of this salad spinner that are not present on all spinners . It has a brake , which I am surprised that I use all the time and would n't go back to having a spinner without one . The entire spinner comes apart and can go in the dishwasher . I love the convenience of that feature . The main bowl is really nice looking and I often use it to serve the salad in , which is one less dish to wash . The push - button mechanism is really easy to use and my child finds it easier to use than other styles when he 's helping in the kitchen . The spinner mechanism folds flat into the lid and locks into place which make storage much easier . And , it works well , consistently .
5 #### This is the ONE thing that actually kept the deer out of our garden all last Summer . All of the various repellents , sprays , dangly - things , and even electric fencing , only held Bambi and Bambi 's mother off for a week at best , then they would either get used to them or ( in the case of fences ) just jump over them . They ca n't seem to get used to this Scarecrow though - I guess it 's just too unpredictable for them . It held them off all season and I actually got veggies from my garden , whereas my neighbors got nothing but deer - droppings . So I 'm here to order another this year , to protect my flower garden as well . ( I 'm also considering using one to ward off pumpkin - stealing pranksters at Hallowe'en - that ought to be a good " treat " ! ) Oh , yah- that reminds me : do n't set this device up where the mailman has to cross its path . Mail carriers can get a little grumpy about being squirted with water out of the blue - go figure ... :) --- Just editing this a year later to add : Not only is it still working ( imagine that : getting an electronic product out of the potting shed after winter is over , putting in new batteries , and it STILL WORKS ! ) but the deer are also still completely put off by it . Ca n't ask for better than that !
5 #### I 'm upgrading my three star review to five -- why ? Because my first one of these made it through four winters -- I brought it out yesterday in prep for our below - freezing weather , plugged it in -- and nothing . I originally wrote " I guess I should be happy with four winters , " because I was frustrated by de - icing the birdbath with boiling water . But I actually got the second one the day after I ordered it ( love you , Prime ) and realized that even had I paid $ 40 for four winters of use , that ten dollars a winter was a lot less than I spent for bird seed and feeders , and makes such a huge difference . And the original warranty has now been upgraded from one year to three . If you 're looking for a last minute gift and know a bird lover , you could do a whole lot worse . It 's the best de - icer I 've had , turns on when it needs to , and I have happy birds .
5 #### I like the feel of the knife in my hand . It has a perfect balance . Mine is 6 " and it is the right size for me . I have been using it for more than 8 years and it is still sharp with occasional sharpening with a honing steel . I am sure there are sharper , sturdier , more expensive knives out there , but this is the only chef knife I need .
5 #### Beautiful rich sound . Very nice size . Handsome chimes . I 'm very pleased as with all my Woodstock products .
5 #### This thing just works . It staples . Have you ever used a manual staple gun ? This thing makes those look neolithic . Tic - Tic - Tic is all the sound it makes as you drive long staples into hard woods . No effort . Easy on the air . It will keep stapling when there are no more staples in the magazine , my only fault with it . I would buy it again .
5 #### Material has not rusted compared to my other smaller set of measuring spoons . Material is easy to clean , the holding key can easily be taken off and on for easier use .
5 #### What can I say ..... the items are as described . Excellent service .
5 #### I have a lawn trailer with tubeless tires that are just getting older . Plenty of tread , just showing signs of age and leaking air . This tube was an easy install worked great and will give me several more years before I have to replace the tire itself , for substantially less money and hassle compared with buying and putting on a new tire . Very pleased .
4 #### Hard to tell if worked or not . When there 's so many Mosquito 's you just hit them with everything you 've got
5 #### I got this for a friend . He did a replacement for his , and this was a great replacement all the holes lined up . Thanks .
5 #### I had to search to find the right covers with the right dimensions for my outdoor furniture . It had to be something that would withstand south facing sun all summer long , and spring rains , and winter cold . And so far , these are perfection . Seem to be sturdy . Velcro straps hold the covers on , and they have n't blown off . Plus , there plenty of room underneath to leave my outdoor throw pillows on the chairs and sofa . So now , I can use the space in my deck boxes for other things , and I only need to remove the cover when I want to use the furniture ... no more movinng cushions and pillows in and out . Worth every cent .
1 #### Junk . The plastic is stuff and makes the vacuum difficult to pull around . It does n't suck up anything unless you use the tools for the car or furniture . Regretful purchase .
5 #### I went from an electric to this product and I have no regrets . It fits great in the utensil drawer and looks great with everything else that is stainless steel in my kitchen . Also a very good price .
5 #### I have these Gilmour connectors all around the house , and I love them . They are practically indestructable , and exceeds my expectations . I have them hooked up to hoses , bypassing our water softener . I also use the double connectors&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Gilmour-13 - Brass-2 - Way - Connector / dp / B000FJYSHW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Gilmour 13 Brass 2 - Way Connector</a>&nbsp;as well , which are equally as good . A must have for every home . I recommend using this with a small piece of teflon to prevent corrosion at the connectors . If corrosion does take place , it can become very difficult to unscrew it .
4 #### It 's a great vac for our shag area rug and hard wood floors . It does seem a bit light weight so not sure how long it will last but for the price it 's not bad at all . I would n't recommend it for all over carpet , that would take way to much work with this vac .
4 #### Works as expected so far , hopefully it 'll keep working for a while .
3 #### It is very light weight and does not seem to grip carpet firmly . If I carry the canister it seems to work better but that defeats the very idea of it . It is better on bare floors .
2 #### Poor workmanship , threads were poorly done , brass fittings wanted to cross thread every time connected , caps leaked
5 #### The West Bend Stir Crazy popcorn popper is the best electric popcorn popper on the market , in my opinion , and I 've owned others . I bought one at Target about three years ago . Somehow the cord got separated from the popcorn popper ( a word to the wise . . . place the cord inside the popcorn popper to store ! I make caramel popcorn at Christmastime , and when I got my popcorn popper out to make the caramel popcorn last week , the cord had gotten separated from the popcorn popper . Time was of the essence . Amazon to the rescue . I ordered a replacement popcorn popper . I 'll find that cord one day and then I 'll have two popcorn poppers:- ) The West Bend Stir Crazy Popcorn Popper makes great popcorn . I prefer it over the air popper I used to use before switching to the Stir Crazy .
5 #### This is very convenient . I use it to make soup and braised meats . It really cuts the time in half at least ! I cook for a family of 4 so the size is just perfect ! I have a much larger one but this is the one i use almost every day ! I am really glad I purchased this .
2 #### Uh , well its mediocre at best . It tends to tell me its over 110 degrees outside when the temperature is actually 95 . I posted it in the shade on my backyard fence . I think that the fact it has an open back contributes to the error in reading . Once the fence gets hot so does the thermometer , hence faulty reading . As long as the temperature stays in the 80 's or below I think it will be ok . Unless of course the fence gets frozen this summer and then I may be getting a negative reading here in Northern Ca . Which actually does n't happen .
4 #### THE GUN ITSELF IS VERY NICE , MUCH INPROVED OVER MY OLD UNIT . GREAT FOR LARGER WORK , WISH THEY WOULD INCLUDE A SMALLER TIP . THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS WITH THE CASE , IT HAS A CLEAR PLASTIC PANEL , IT LOOKS NICE BUT ITS TOO FLEMSY . I'M GLAD I SAVED MY OLD CASE .
1 #### I was doing some outdoor finish work around the house and decided to rent a finish nailer as my brad nailer was a bit light for the job . Instead of renting I decided to buy the Bostich 15 gauge . Excited to get to work I struggled a little to get the hang of loading the magazine . The magazine is plastic and has a bit of a unique loading procedure . Nothing like my Bostich brad nailer or my rough - in nailer . I finally filled it with nails and went to fire the first round ... nothing . Checked the air pressure , hose and fittings . All was OK . Tried for 5 minutes and succeeded in firing maybe 3 nails , one every 15 tries . I took it back to Home D___t and got another one . Same model , same problem except this one fired once every 10 times . A two hour job ended up taking me all day running back and forth to the store . Never again .
5 #### Love it . OXO are always quality products . You always get your money 's worth .
5 #### I 'm happy with these . Replaced some old ones that had reached their end of life .
5 #### Works great . Is much easier to use than the one it replaced since no pre - mixing of chemicals is required . Results using it so far have been great .
1 #### It arrived for a Christmas present but the labels at the top showing the measurements were missing due to a printing error . I ordered a replacement and it was the same thing . Very disappointed .
5 #### Fit my shop vac perfect and did not let any dust escape .
5 #### Simply excellent . Ca n't go wrong with this coffee maker . Simple to use , easy to clean . Quality of coffee depends on quality of bean and grind .
5 #### Yes it stinks ... and it works ! Once it dries , the smell largely goes away , although pest animals can still smell it just fine . The odor is hard to describe ; not something you want to smell too often . I had a small rabbit eating one of my mums ; it really did a lot of damage . Per the directions , I sprayed on and around the mum , and the rabbit wo n't go near it now . I followed up with another application one week later ( again per the directions ) and then once a month after that . Absolutely no more rabbit problems . I 'm a big fan .
5 #### This pan was just what I expected . I like the design of the pan and the non stick surface . No one wants to clean up stuck on food on pans . This one cleaned easily and bakes well . Highly recommended .
5 #### This stove puts out instantaneous heat and along with the fan , it is distributed very evenly through out the room . Easy to put togrther and a breeze to use .
5 #### Great quality for a great price Comfortable in hand . Stays extended over long distances unlike most other tape measures we have tried
5 #### We use these in our Data Center . Amazon provides a great price and quick shipping . You can not go wrong ordering from amazon . Leviton is a name brand for Locking plugs
5 #### Terrific little scrubber . Perfect size and fits right in to the palm of my hand . I will use it mostly on potatoes . It will be easy to hold on to even when it is wet because of the shape and the material used . I 'm very happy so far and am looking forward to many years of good use .
5 #### Great nozzle . Really puts the water out there in a " gentle " way w/o uprooting the plants . A friend watered our plants while we were on vacation last year , and he ordered two of these nozzles .
3 #### Too small for me , returned it to Amazon and received refund .
5 #### Bought as a present for a hard to buy for Dad , who collects John Deere items . He loves it and it is a high quality Case knife . Looks very sharp literately and figuratively speaking .
5 #### It does what it is suppose to do . Solid basic unit .
5 #### Works just like they did years ago , but we bought an electric model soon after and this one is sitting . May give it to Salvation Army !
4 #### I am satisfied that I got my money 's worth . Solid quality traditional lamp cord . I needed it to rewire a floor lamp we have had for many years . The cord was old and it was time to replace it .
5 #### It 's a pain in the arse to assemble , but it works perfectly to move my Delta 14 " bandsaw around the shop ! ! !
4 #### Smooth function , little rust in the 2 years we 've had it . Still looks nice . does the job well . OK then
2 #### We 've been using these saws in our middle school wood shop for the last five years . In that amount of time , I 've lost track of how many times I 've had these in for repairs . It 's more of a hobby saw that can not stand up to serious use . In addition , one saw that we purchased , stopped working a week after we took it out of the box .
4 #### Surprisingly , these chips have a stronger flavor than the hickory or applewood chips I 've used . I used these chips in a smoker to cook a brisket . Nice flavor .
5 #### Recently I was in the market for a new meat tenderizer . I 'm a down home country girl , and I like to prepare my meat properly prior to devouring . I have found that the best way to seal in the juices on a nice thick premium cut of meat is to pound the hell out of it repeatedly while screaming in German . This not only tenderizes the meat but terrorizes it in to submission . Note : This works esspecially well on meat from a KOSHER deli . The OXO Good Grips Meat Tenderizer lives up to its name , do n't be fooled by naysayers . The violence with which I wield this heavenly instrument of meat rivals that of the Norse gods of yore , and yet nary a time has my grip slipped . It holds up well to blood spatter , vitreole , and even the occasional lymphatic fluid bursting from my tasty nemesis : meat . Anywho , I hope you enjoy the product as much as I have . Further note : do not make the mistake of utilizing this equipment as a sexual aid , as despite it 's name it does NOT cure Erectile Dysfunction . My husband and I had to learn this the hard way ! Bon Appetit !
3 #### This peeler works okay but you need to be careful when using it , it 's very sharp and a little awkward to use . I prefer my old , basic peeler over this . While using it last night , I managed to take a good chunk of the tip of my finger off with it while peeling potatoes .
2 #### It 's great ... until the blades bend . the pusher can contact the blades if you have a large potato that puts torque on the blades ... and then you get bent blades .. would be awesome if they fixed that issue .
4 #### I used this in my shower when i tiled it . Went on easy and has held up great . It was kind of a pain to clean the excess off of the tile but i found vinegar worked really well .
5 #### Have not had a fire yet . It looks like it will work .
5 #### .... the larger surface area is idea for spreading toppings on bread , esp . soft bread that is not toasted . I had an OXO spreader for years and am just about to order another one . All their small cutlery ( they used to sell a mini knfe block set ) is great , and the spreader is no exception .
5 #### Received these cutters very quick after placing the order . They have a sturdy feel and were pretty sharp . I have cut vinyl siding with them and they performed very well . I recommend them .
5 #### 1 st class quality , made of steel through out , no plastic gears to wear down ! The large turning knob is also a plus and very easy to turn . Worth every penny !
5 #### I have had really good luck with Fiskar 's products and thought I would give the grass shears a try . The have lived up to my expectations and then some . The rotating head is a really nice feature that I 've not seen on other brands . When trimming the grass near the concrete steps and brick walkway , the rotating head allows me to get very close so I am able to make an even cut . The blade is very sharp , even after several uses with no sign of rust . The blade locks in place and makes storage easy so I do n't have to worry about cutting my fingers when reaching for it in the tool shed . Great product !
5 #### This is one of the easiest pushing reel mowers I have ever had . I got lucky I found mine at a garage sale for $ 50 and it also had the grass catcher . If I was ever going to recommend one or if I had to buy another one this would be it . I do n't think the previous owner even used it there is no wear showing at all .
5 #### I bought this to give my husband and I a " Spa Day " . This decision came after checking with the spa at the hotel we were planning to visit in Vegas and finding out a " Couple 's 1/2 day " service was going to cost us upwards of $ 600 . So , I said to hLL with that ! I 'm gon na buy some spa quality products that had an aromatherapy benefit and we 'd just give each other the Spa Day ! And it would only cost 1/6th the price for all the products I purchased , including FHF Chocolate Facial ( we both loved it ) , The Naked Bee Orange Blossum Honey Body Lotion , 80 Acres Blood Orange Oil and last but not least FHF Honey Heel Glaze . This scrub is heavenly and smells just right . I tried to get products I could get past my Manly Man . After using this scrub on each other in the shower - we fell asleep ! That 's sensual - right ? You may think that a couple that 's 55 years young would have benefitted more from a spa tech doing our Spa Day , BUT we put a date on the calendar to have the same type of 1/2 day together in exactly 4 weeks . On top of that we have ALL the product we 'll need for at least 6 - 7 " Home Spa Days " ! We had SOOO much fun as this salt scrub was exactly the right mixture of salt and oil . I was very pleased with having found the right combination of products .
3 #### I had to return them , they did not cut what I needed too , bike housing cable . I bought the Park Tools version and they are perfect .
2 #### I 'm not sure what it would be good for , but planing wood is not one of those things . It 's just too small . There 's nothing wrong with the build quality , though .
5 #### If you are into crafting of any kind where you would want to use your Dremel tool , this is a must have . The smaller pen makes it so easy to hold and move around , and the bits are just as easy to change . You can attach it easily , and you can either hang the Dremel tool or just lay it on the worktable to use . Highly recommend it for serious crafters .
5 #### Awesome tongs for the grill ! Easy storage due to the convenient lock . I 've run these through the dishwasher a couple times too ( on the top rack ) and they are still as good as new ! !
4 #### have n't used it yet , but looks awesome and a good height for me ( 6'5 " )
1 #### its pretty pricey for a little plastic remote . someones making big bucks$$$
1 #### It seems people like to review these zappers , but few , if any of them , report their geographic location . That makes it difficult to decide if this is right for you in your particular region . Let me say up front that I am in Houston . Where I live is heavily infested with mosquitoes . There is a duck pond a quarter mile away and the woods and soggy ground are rife with the biting buggers . Too bad none is attracted to this 80 - Watt zapper . I use the Octenal , I have the zapper hanging from the first story eave 7 feet off the ground and horizontally 25 feet from my patio as instructed . At night , we zap an occasional moth or a fly or two . We get some mosquitoes but I think they simply blundered into the light . I leave the thing on all day and night and it does , essentially , nothing . So it looks to me that this is a great thing for you if it works in your area . Where I am , it is useless . I 've read that Lurex is a better attractant , but neither Flowtron nor anybody seems to make it for this type of zapper . If it is so good , there should be a great market for it but where is it ? One would think the manufacturer would be champing at the bit to make the product work on more varieties of bug . This makes me think this zapper is more snake oil than a solution for mosquitoes .
5 #### This item works so well that I bought 2 . One for each floor . I usually use peanut butter on a cracker . I once caught a 14 inch squirrel in my attic with this Zapper . I love it . I talked my bf into buying a rat zapper and within the 1st month he zapped 5 squirrels in his attic . He wants to buy another one .
3 #### Will take care of any rose issue you may have ! Highly recommended .
5 #### This is the 2nd Suncast storage seat that I have recently purchased from Amazon . I decided to get this 2nd product because I needed additional storage to store beach towels close to the pool and out of the poolroom bathroom .
5 #### Purchased this item for my son for Christmas . He was very pleased and it was just what he asked for !
5 #### This is a highly effective product which I have ordered more than once . Eliminates the little critters trying to invade as cold weather approaches !
5 #### found we needed to double up our steak knife set ... had a set of these purchased in 1999 and could not believe they are still offered for sale and are exact dupes of the originals ... great steak knives , and have stayed sharp and useful through many steaks - a true testament to quality design and craftsmanship ... simply amazing ... made in Spain , btw
5 #### This has amped up my game in the growroom ! ! Top dress all my plants with this ... use as a tea to give them a weekly treat ... wouldn't be caught without
2 #### Before I could secure the base , a few rabits had gotten into the garden . As I came out of the house , they made a run for it and I actually watched as one hit the net , was paused for a split second and then kept going . the other rabbit just ran right through . In both cases , there were nice , rabbit - sized holes in the bottom of of the fencing . Great concept , easy install ( I pounded 10 ' lenghts of 1/2 " conduit in every 10 ' or so ) but buy something with more strength .
5 #### I owned the slightly smaller single speed version and ran it for years until it finally gave out with an intractable switch problem which made the purchase of this two speed version sensible proposition . I think this tool has saved my wrist , and it 's a " must have " for any job which requires assembly , cabinet hinges , electrical work , and it will drive surprisingly large wood screws too . 5 stars for simple , logical , robust design ( 9 planetary gears ) , and it 's small size is just right to get into tight places . Thank god it does n't have rubberized racing stripes stuck all over it !
5 #### If you use the Dremel with assorted bits , this is a must
5 #### Oh my gosh , you all have to order this immediately ! It is the most wonderful peeler ever ! I used one at my daughter 's house and immediately looked for the brand and then did an Amazon search . I ordered it before leaving their kitchen ! Got back to my house in another state , and there it was . It peels so well and with very little effort . One of my favorite purchases ever ! !
5 #### I have used this little canister vac for years and when its engine went I ordered another immediately . it is great for car interiors , hard floors , dusting , short carpet . It is light weight so you can hold it while vacuuming stairs or car interior . great suction .
2 #### It was impossible to tighten the set screw against the bit . No matter what I did , the tapered head slid on the bit . It took me a while to determine that the set screw threads were not completely cut . I went to sn auto parts store and purchased a 1/4 - 28 tap . I then re- cut the internal threads . Now it works fine .
5 #### Every son should receive a fine pocker knife as a gift . Case is the Best and their Stockman is their top model . CASE when only best is good enough .
4 #### Do n't know if this product will do the job and it will depend on how it holds up in cold weather .
5 #### Great price for this replacement filter . It cost about $ 3 less than at Lowes .
5 #### This is a great set for a really good price !
5 #### After burning out several " big box store " electric saws , I finally decided to spend the money for the Makita . WOW - what a difference . The in - line motor makes it much easier to cut close to the ground . I 've used this saw to buck limbs for a solid eight hours with no problems . The oiler works well and does not leak when the saw is in storage . After using one at my cabin for a few weeks , I 've bought a second one for home . In summary - it 's smoother , quieter , more powerful , and obviously more durable than other " cheaper " electric saws . Recommend with no reservations .
5 #### I have horses next to my property , lots of flies . These things work great
2 #### Instructions on how to use bait are terrible . Not sure if I have it on there right or not ... Tons of bugs flying around that never come to get zapped . No way this covers 1.5 acres .
5 #### Great product . A just in case the power goes out . I was using my gas kitchen stove , knobs pulled off , to take the chill out . Holding out turning on the furnace for the next 8 months of terrible Michigan weather .
5 #### Not exactly the easiest trap to set , but it gets the job done . I tried to move the set trap with the hooks as much as possible . Be sure to set the safety until the trap is in the ground . Set the pin to the edge of the metal spring plate to be sure the mole springs the trap . This trap will break your fingers if not careful , please be very careful ! Definitely works .
5 #### I have enjoyed the Brinkmann grill for over 12 years . I have used it with and without the water pan . I have found that if you clean it after use and then lightly coat the insides with oil , the grill will give you years of great smoking . I store mine inside and recommend you at least use the cover .
4 #### I like the color coating for the ease of identifying them in my pouch , and it does help a bit when working outside up here in the dead of winter . I do n't think the steel is quite what my old ones were , but then what is today .
5 #### These are great . Amazing how much more enjoyable gardening is with a new set of clippers . My old ones were dull , so these are a treat .
5 #### Husband asked for this for christmas to replace an old knockoff he had . He loves it , uses almost daily .
1 #### I purchased this at BBB . I have an old Zyliss spinner ( > 15 yrs ) that does a much better job of removing water and is also much easier to clean . I can not recommend this spinner .
5 #### Boughtbfor son for Christmas . Stanley makes good quality tapes
3 #### Receive it on time but I have n't had to use them yet . My vacuum is only 2 months old . Great vacuum .
5 #### A good product but not for heavy " stuff " , small hedges calls for these trimmers .
5 #### I made sure I kept the details on this valve for future reference because I 've never had one so quiet and easy to install . Clear instructions and simple installation . Better than OEM , in my opinion .
5 #### Not a better sprayer out there in my opinion . If you clean it after every use it lasts for years !
4 #### It functions quite well . Much better than the cheapies . The brush is very well made with good bristles that are perfect for veggies . It cleans well and does n't damage delicate items . The grip is a little hard and small for me . I 'm a guy with medium - large hands . Probably , worthy of a 4.5 .
4 #### As a ten dollar sensor light , these things do just fine . They are a bit fragile , however , so care must be taken to not torque the plastic too hard . They are about the cheapest sensor light fixture around , so they fill my particular need ( cheap and easy quick install . ) The sensor as such works very well , although they have a 3 - 5 second delay before turning on . Also , one of my units is a little glitchy , it likes staying locked on sometimes , and then I have to power - cycle it off for a minute and turn it back on ( I have mine wired to a regular outdoor extension cord with one end cut off to hardwire it to the fixture , and the other end with the usual outlet plug . ) My main purpose for installing these was for assisting a surveillance camera system . These give the necessary illumination to keep the cameras from switching to the grainy night - vision mode ( using halogen lamps . )
4 #### The product details say it works best with low or non - fat milk , and that is the truth . You can get a decent froth with whole milk , but the thick , lasting froth you want on a latte , etc . , will require low or non - fat milk . Still , to get frothed milk quickly and easily without spending a lot of money on a product , this is the way to go .
5 #### Really excellent product , does what it says it will do .
5 #### I work as an industrial electrician . Sometimes I have to climb up high , sometimes i have to craw in a pit . having a one size fits all tool is essential . I 've used these 6 or 7 in one screwdrivers now for about 8 years , and I 've tried almost every brand you could think of . Craftsmen , Ideal , Dewalt , Milwaukee , they all seemed to fail after any sort of prying was done on them . still worth it to me to keep buying new ones . I eventually gave up and found a $ 3 one i kept buying and replacing . One day i found this used at a discount store for $ 1 . Let me tell you , I have used this as a chisel , pried on it , and have taken channel locks to it to help turn some pretty tight screws , and this thing handles all these tasks easily without any trouble . I 've even thrown the whole thing in a 20v drill and really torqued down on it at high speed , and it still has n't had any trouble . I bought this 6 pack because sometimes i occasionally drop the bits in places i ca n't get to . If you 're on the fence for a multi screwdriver , this one will be the best one for your needs .
5 #### I love to use this for cookies . So thin it slides under like nothing . The only problem is it is so thin and hard to put in the drawer without ruining it .
5 #### Strong because it is steel . Clean and durable . Sharp cutting edges make your pies look as good as they taste . Expect the steel pie server to last a lifetime .
5 #### Although it 's a " Shop - Vac " hose , with the included adapter end , it fit my Craftsman 12 gallon shop vac perfectly . The great thing is the original hose was only 6 feet long , while this one is 10 feet so much more usable when vacuuming the inside of your vehicles .
5 #### Great needle nose pliers . Should last a long time . The tip is serrated , so it can grip . Very solid in the hand .
5 #### Instead of using the crank on the apple cider press , I used a 1/2 " low torque drill with a socket . You 'll never go back to the crand unless just for aesthetics .
3 #### i bought the oxo good grips battter bowl as a gift to my daughter in law for christmas . she likes it .
5 #### Bought this in 2008 . Never had one issue with it .
5 #### Leave it to stabila to come out with one of the handiest carrying cases known to man
5 #### I tried a couple other can openers , but this one is my favorite . Cans are easy to open and it feels like it will last forever .
5 #### Always chose peanut suet . Woodpeckers prefer it ! This suet is reasonably priced and attracts a wide variety of woodpeckers . Redbellied , Downy , and Hairy woodpeckers flock to this stuff like crazy during the cold months .
1 #### This is the second Cuisinart appliance that 's gone from China to my kitchen to my landfill . This blender was terrible . The motor burnt out after about 3 months of use . I purchased an Osterizer that is still going strong 3 years later . I thought the Cuisinart brand name was supposed to be equated with excellence ? I would n't accept another Cuisinart product if someone gave it to me . My parents still have all of their appliances they received as wedding gifts . I wish I did !
5 #### Works great ! Hopefully this is a long lasting can opener ! It feels very high quality .
1 #### Found one cheeper in town after I had recived this bug zapper look before you buy some times you might fget it cheeper in town:- (
4 #### Purchased as a gift - seemed well received ! Has stood up well in the Las Vegas , NV , sun .
4 #### Perfect for the Stanley 5 gallon stainless shop vac . Stanley has a small nozzle diameter inside where these attach . These are the only ones that fit , others will not fit .
5 #### Used my friends older model of this and it worked ok , but I had to take the guard off when going through thick sod since it clogged easily . This model has a cutout so it does n't clog and makes short work of edging . You still need to stay on top of things to make it only take a couple of minutes , but if you edge once a month it 's a breeze .
4 #### Happy Happy Joy Joy ! It was just as it was advertised , so it gets four stars , what else is there to say ! They would get five stars if they went above and beyond what was advertised and expected . Imagine if your grocery store was like this and you had to rate every product you purchased ! How annoying would that be ?
5 #### This product came with the wall mount , and the order was shipped the same day I ordered it ! Thanks !
5 #### I really like this cologne 's scent . Not over powering , but it 's definitely there . The body wash smells like the cologne , so if I use one I wo n't really use the other since it would be redundant and I 'd smell like I poured the whole bottle on myself . This is a great gift set and on par as far as cost with most other sets like this . Other than the cap being a bit hard to pull off , there 's not much else to say about it .
5 #### I 'm an OXO fan to begin with so that 's why I ordered this little brush . It not only scrubs veggies well , it fits nicely into the palm of the hand . It also has a non - slide surface that helps steady the brush for scrubbing . It takes dark spots off radishes saving the time of using a knife to cut them out .
1 #### I sometimes fail to remember that one gets what they pay for and this sander was no exception to that rule . I saw the ' price ' and the ' intent ' of this tool right off the bat . The price was right in that it was practically free compared to its nearest competitor ! Unfortunately , the competitor sander had a lot more ' intent ' , and consequently ... higher quality , durability and reliability in mind during the design and manufacturing process . My new Porter Cable 550 will probably end - up in my Great Grandchildren 's hands in serviceable condition , and I am not a Grandpa yet ! After taking this sander out of its box , and putting it to use , it soon became clear that I could not keep sandpaper on it . As a result of its Billion RPM orbital action , it kept tearing off along the securing clamps on either end of the sander . I tried about every little trick I could think of before tossing this tool into the " lesson - learned pile " of other bargain - priced power tools in my shop . You know , the ones too worthless to really use , and too valuable to throw away ? Do n't end up spending your money twice on the same sort of tool . GO GET A PORTER CABLE , OR EQUIVALENT ! ! ! If you want the Black and Decker Sander above , send me an email and you can have mine for the cost of shipping ! Handy Dan
1 #### This mug does only a fair job of keeping coffee hot . It will absolutely NOT protect your shirt , pants , carseat , or anything else from spills and drips ! The lid does help to keep the coffee hot in that without the lid it is exposed to the air . That slight benefit and it 's attractive appearance are the only advantages I found . If you have NO concern about leaking / dripping , this mug is sufficient , however , the Contigo Autoseal West Loop is a much better product , and for essentially the same price . I have returned my Timolino PABLO-46GREmug and purchased 2 Contigo Autoseal West Loop thermal mugs in 2 of the many colors available ( I like lilac & gunmetal ) . This Timolino thermal mug , in my opinion , should cost only $ 10 due to it propensity to leak !
4 #### Great Product for taco lovers . The design is nice with the ability to bake 4 tacos a time . The only draw back that I had hence the 4 stars instead of 5 is the non - stick coating . It has it 's plus side with the easy clean - up , but the downside I had was the Tacos kept sliding off . I did find a solution for me by laying the taco on Al Foil with a 1/2 inch hem at both ends then hanging them over the peaks . It works for me because I wanted the taco shape without frying them ( trying to control my cholesterol ) . Glad I bought it and would again .
4 #### They look good and sturdy . But how can we really review it until we 've got ta use it in a fire ? ? ?
3 #### A fine little portable grill . The handling of ashes is awkward and messy . Expect to step up to a more expensive version that has an ash catcher .
5 #### Easy to hold , sharp , and the digger tip cleans out potato blemishes fast .
5 #### Stanley quality and measures in tenths . Working in the metal fab industry means measuring things all the time . I do n't have an 8 ft caliper so I wanted something to check things in the shop . I have yet to see a dimensional drawing from out customers that uses fractions . This tape measure is accurate and allows me do measure what I need quickly and easily with no math involved . There are 16ths on one side and 10ths on the other . The 1st 6 inches it down to 100ths .
3 #### Works , but too expensive if used as recommended . I only use 1 at a time in a zapper and seem OK for a couple months depending on temperature ,
5 #### Pretty study baskets . I use in combination with a small shelving unit
5 #### Like a hot knife through butter , this bread knife slices easily through artisan bread . I shopped at the box stores to see how the knife felt and then bought this one . Others even by the German companies are too light . This is nicely balanced , I would tell you to go to the retail outlets , handle the others but , try this in your hand to see how it feels . You buy this one . Highly recommended .
5 #### This is a must in my garden . This will keep your hardware secured and together when running your inline fan & filter(inline grow light tube).Simple ta use and install , Showed up in the mail box in no time at all .
5 #### Works awesome ! Its a small detail but the way my wrist is while I peel with the shape of this peeler make a big difference even with my elbow and forearm .
4 #### I like this tea ball , it is sturdy , more than ok for the price , but I did not pay attention when I ordered it and it is a little bit small : I had bought this ball for eventual bouquet garni .... anyway , when I make dal , or curry , I put pepper beans and kaffir leaves in it , and get rid of the ball once it is cooked , so I do not have to waste my time , practical , no ?
5 #### Solid feel to this stainless cooker , much more so than aluminum ones I 've had . Has a better lid seal design than my last aluminum one , too . ( It was a 4 quart Presto ) . I swear it heats faster . Scrubs clean more easily than aluminum . Handle on the off side makes it safer to lift and carry when full ( and hot ) . And of course no worries about ingesting aluminum , which is not a minor issue for folks with Alzheimers in the family . Why anyone even makes aluminum cookers anymore is beyond me . Yes , I see that they 're cheaper , but is it worth it ? 6 quart size handles packaged corned beef briskets unless they 're VERY large . I always had to cut them up to fit in my old 4 - quarter . Only complaint , and it 's a VERY minor one , is that the interlock pin which pops up when there 's pressure is n't visible from the side . Have to walk over and look down on it to check it when waiting for the cooker to cool .
3 #### a friend told me to put wet paper towel in the George and close it , then go back after cooling and it wipes clean . just a thought .
5 #### Great for fine precision work Also use it to grind my dog 's nails , he likes the extension since the Dremel itself is loud
5 #### Feels good in the hand , cleans up well in the dishwasher . Time will tell if it survives many trips through the washer . What 's noteworthy to me is how sharp it is . My little girl likes to peel veggies so I bought this for her and she actually cut herself with it . I just never used a sharp peeler and I thought they were all sort of dull and therefore safe for kids . Not true . Be careful ! One minor annoyance is that peels can get trapped between the blade and the plastic structure around it and have to be pulled away or shaken loose .
5 #### Been using a few months . Does as promised at a good value .
5 #### works like a dream so far and with only using it for half of my last billing cycle it saved me $ 25 on my power bill . I will update my savings after a full month .
4 #### There are some people saying they did n't even get the right thing at all , while I did n't get exactly what the picture showed , it 's not horrible . Instead of a quilt blanket inside mine was a pink fleece one with little elephants . I like fleece more than quilt blankets so for me it 's not a problem . The blanket covers my feet and reaches up to the bottom of my chin and I 'm around 5'4 so it 's not a short blanket , but it 's kind of narrow . People say they have trouble folding the blanket up but it 's really not that difficult if you pay attention to how it was folded when you open it . The zipper is kind of a low quality plastic and it 's smaller than expected too . Not bad , I like it and I would suggest this to other people .
4 #### Did not use them as yet , but they seem to be of good quality .
5 #### The best product I have ever used . My plants are thriving .
3 #### Perhaps my fish pond , which is stressed by the many natural dropping of its oak tree canopy , is unique . Perhaps the water contains too much to clean simply by floating a wad of straw through it . Whatever , the straw does soak up a lot of water ver fast . I have to lift them out every few days to dry , which is a pain because I have no place to put them out of reach of our frequent rains . I probably wo n't buy any more .
5 #### I bought a bunch of these and put it around the farm .
5 #### I love the comfort of the brush in my hand . I had bought something that shed like crazy before and decided to go to the brand I love and should have bought from the start , OXO . Does a great job cleaning veggies as well .
5 #### The whistle is so loud it almost sounds like a train 's horn . Very beautiful , sturdy and great weight . Easy to clean .
5 #### Love this spatula ! Bought to replace a broken plastic spatula we had and loved for years . Provides a slender surface to get under things like eggs but sturdy enough to stand up to fish or meats . Seems durable and looks classy .
3 #### Product works as advertised but the run - down test on a new Lithium battery was a bit disappointing . With frequent power outages , I want a light that will last a long time . I turned around and purchased the LED bulb kit and resolved this as an issue . The provided bulb 's brightness was mildly disappointing . The LED is brighter but does not throw as wide a beam . But if you add the cost of the floodlight ( $ 35 ) + LED kit ( $ 25 ) , it 's a bit pricey .
5 #### It 's loaded with beneficial biologicals . I appreciate that it arrived with just the right moisture level . I 've bought castings that arrived dry as a bone , which cuts the benefits drastically .
2 #### This is the first garlic press that I have ever had . The one thing that is inescapable is that it takes a lot of hand strength to use it . This fact is the overriding reason for my three - star rating . Admittedly , my hands are fairly arthritic , but it still takes a great deal of force to press the garlic through . For that reason alone , I would not recommend this tool for anyone experiencing ongoing pain in their hands ; this press will surely aggravate it . The tool itself is sturdy and well made , although I 'm also unimpressed with the cleaner feature ; it still needs to be manually cleaned . The press goes through the dishwasher just fine . However , it 's pricey to me at almost $ 15 ; it should be more like $ 10 .
5 #### It was very easy to put together using regular 2x4s purchased at Lowes . I chose the metal brackets over less expensive plastic ones because I believe the plastic ones wo n't hold up to freezing temps over a long period of time -- probably get brittle & crack . I am about to order a second set -- couldn't be happier with them .
3 #### Failed after 1 year of light use . The epoxy coating on the canister cracked , chipped , and lifted off the metal allowing it to rust inside the neck where the hand pump seal washer seats . This allows air under pressure to leak out so you pretty much have to pump it continuously for it to work . Phoned Chapin about the trouble and they offered to replace it .
4 #### Solid . Not too flexible . I hate flimsy nylon utensils , so that was a must . Good grips . Wish it included a ladle though . Price was right !
3 #### I had these before with a little window on top so you could see if there was a mouse in your trap . So , it was an accident to order these without the window . You have to then pick up the trap with a mouse in it and move it around with mouse poop falling out on you . I do not love this product . Get the one with the clear window on top .
4 #### We use the skeeter bits in a small water fountain hanging on the side of the house . Does n't take too many , so this is another product that should last me a long , long time . Be nice if there was a product called " Yellow Jacket Bits . " I 'd buy some of that stuff , too .
4 #### This is the next best thing to our broken ceramic bladed peeler .. The plastic on some of the ceramic bladed peelers die way before the blades do , unfortunately . Most metal bladed peelers just feel like cheapo garbage but we have tried OXO things and so far we like them , this now added to our arsenal of kitchen weapons of choice . I will say that this one is much safer than our former ceramic peeler , though a great peeler , you could shave horse hooves with it and not realize you just lost one or your finger tips in the process . ( OXO is pricey yes , but they seem to stand up better than the rest of the items we have tried . We do have price limits though and are n't sworn slaves to always buy OXO and we do the price research on how long things last and how soon replacements are needed . IE by 3 of these for one of those and we get longer service out of 3 than the one at the same or better price . Of course it 's often like a lottery but the odds are if you can get some mileage for an acceptable time you may be able to get away with non - OXO brands but for the most part OXO is a solid choice as well as a solid feel in hand and usage - it takes the " silverware shuffle " well . )
3 #### Just like someone else said ... I ordered these cooling racks specifically because NordicWare cookware is made in the USA as stated on their website . I was pretty upset upon receiving these to see they 're made in Taiwan . They 'll work well and are made well but I 'm trying to purchase as much as I can from the USA not Taiwan / China etc .
5 #### I have no issues whatsoever with this measuring tape . Great price and product ! It seems to be a good quality product and it has no drawbacks that I can see .
2 #### not built so good I had to fix it up before I could use it update tell the bats I have a room to rent still no bats
3 #### This is an OK knife , but it chokes on crusty bread . Not nearly as good as my older ( seemingly identical ) Henckels knife .
5 #### This has to be one of the best blades I have used . There is little to no tear - out and crisp cuts , both ripping and cross - cutting . I have two of these for my cabinet saw . When one starts to dull or load up with sap , I send it in to be re - sharpened and install the other . Great saw blade
5 #### This stainless stell spoon rest looks nice and washes up great , even with stuck - on food . It 's big enough for the larger utensils .
5 #### excellent heaters . very good and inexpensive to operate a 20 lb cylinder lasts a long time and kept my camper very warm cheaper than any heat I have tried and very efficient
3 #### Nice bowl , but it tips easily . I like the handle grip and the pour spout . It is not microwavable , and I needed a microwavable bowl . I will probably return it .
5 #### Have not used a lot yet but each time has left no un - popped corn . Does n't need much oil worked quickly . Our kids really love popcorn as a treat that 's not loaded with junk ( unless you add it ) . We like this machine so far and will update if there are any changes .
5 #### I asked for this for Christmas because I 'm sick of my plastic spatulas that smell like plastic when they get hot and the pieces get shredded . Gross . I absolutely love this - the handle has a great grip on it and this can be used for anything from pancakes and eggs to pizza ! Great price , too !
5 #### Great items made by Perky Pet . Just with they had kept the old bee guards .
5 #### This a great bit Freud makes great products especially their saw blades for table saws and miter saws their products have always been great .
4 #### I split a LOT of wood , typically using a 16 pound sledgehammer & a " grenade " wedge , plus various splitting axes . Heard about this " super splitter " , read all the reviews & thought I 'd give it a go . Despite all the reviews to the contrary , I 've never had an axe bounce off the wood as much as this one , nor get stuck as often as this does . Oddly enough it still splits most of the time even when it bounces off ( ? ) . Works well enough on not too large , straight grain stuff , ash , willow , walnut , etc , but does n't work worth a crap on elm ; that stuff just laughs at the " super splitter " . A good axe to have in the arsenal , but IMHO over - hyped as a " super splitter " .
4 #### I really like this zester , it feels good in my hand and it works well . I would definitely recommend it .
5 #### Very nice , does not look cheap , get many compliments on it , sounds great and works well .
1 #### Very disappointed with this hose . Kinks very easily not of the best value
5 #### These are the only blades I 've found that are anywhere close to the quality of the blades that come with certain&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Gerber - EAB - Knives / dp / B0016KHW2W / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Gerber EAB Knives</a > . These Stanleys are n't nearly as thick , and the edge does n't hold as long , but they 're good enough .
3 #### The assembly is easy and the design is good but not perfect as it does not stop small chipmunks getting at it . But this feeder prevents squirrels from feeding on the seeds . I have used this over the past one month and we have few chipmunks in the yard to cause enough trouble at the feeder . When a squirrel jumps at the feeder , the metal dome tilts and wobbles to throw the critter off balance . The weight - activated base also tilts to close off the four feeding ports . The feeder is designed satisfactorily and the metal dome and feeding base is well constructed . The glossy heavy - duty powder coated finish protects the feeder from sun and rain . I have rated three stars for its quality and overall performance . 1.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Perky - Pet-336 - Squirrel - Be - Gone - Wild - Bird - Feeder / dp / B000SP2JLU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Perky - Pet 336 Squirrel - Be - Gone Wild Bird Feeder</a >
4 #### blade is nice but not as sturdy as ones with steel handle
5 #### Used it to reinforce wire fencing , that the deer were jumping through . Worked !
5 #### I love this strainer because : it 's sturdy , rugged , holds its shape , has a tab to rest it on a bowl , cleans easily , has a great handle .... Really , what 's not to love about this strainer . I 've even thrown this in the dishwasher . There are cheaper strainers , but I doubt they 're as well built as this strainer .
5 #### Really loved this cooker . This cooks well with less water . It 's timer based and not whistle based .
1 #### Worked decently the first time I used it , but is not holding up . The last veggie brush I had lasted several years of many - times - a - week usage . I 've used this one maybe 5 times and it 's ready for the recycler . If you 're only cleaning mushrooms or cucumbers , it may be just what you need . But for carrots and potatoes , it 's not nearly strong enough .
5 #### Love the simplicity of this feeder ... I got two of them and my Gold Finches favor this feeder .. they wear well and so far the raccoons have not carted them off !
5 #### I bought this out of necessity , figuring that for the price I 'd get what I paid for . Turns out I was wrong , and these are actually very well made . Nice forged steel , soft grip , and the tips are clean and precise . Most surprisingly these are USA made .
5 #### Very large , heavy duty , great for large quantities of mashed potatoes ! I have the smaller version also for those onesies / twosies size serving needs , which also works great for mashing avocados for guacamole or a sandwich spread or dip !
5 #### Original equip replacement Fits Genesis silver exactly . Not much more to say about a chrome plated grill , but must meet word total !
5 #### Built nice and sturdy . Fits nicely over the door . I wish the different hooks were off set for easier hanging of items but other than that , it serves the purpose .
5 #### Excelente compra todo en perfecto estado sin problemas recomendados 100 porciento ninguna queja buen trato bueno en todo sin novedad
3 #### This pad could be larger and thicker . It seems a little overpriced for what you get . When they say ultra light , they are n't kidding . I also left this outside for a couple of days by mistake . It survived , but was the worse for wear .
4 #### Not much to say here . It does the job . I 've used it on a few dozen apples , put it through the dishwasher , and its still working . I wish it was a little sharper , it 's takes some force to break the skin of the apple .
5 #### Best one out there . Use it all the time make salads weekly for the homeless
5 #### Ths s the third of these that I have ad . They are wonderful ... hammers love them . But the sn beats up the plastic and after two , years r so they ave to be replaced .
4 #### The bottom of the pot gets spotty after using even after washing thoroughly .
4 #### This Item described is Cast Aluminum ~ Not Plastic , as described by Amazon . It appears of similar quality as the original throat plate , with leveling screws .
5 #### Great product to set my electric water heater to run off peak times
5 #### Easy to use , great line up and the ring holds the spoons - unless you want to take them off and use them separately - which you can .
2 #### I had to buy one of these about every 5 - 6 months . If it is exposed to the sun , the plastic cover gets " crispy " on top , splits open , disintegrates and then is no good at all . A canvas tarp would work better . Not worth it unless you like buying a new one in 6 months .
5 #### This handle is a great addition to any gardner 's arsonal of tools . The length is proper for easy use while the weight will allow you to stay at the chore until complete . Do n't pass this item up if you are starting to enjoy the WOLF - Garten line of tools .
4 #### This product gets a lot of use , I expect it to wear out , but they last 3 to 5 years depending on usage and abuseage . No noticeable loss of quality after several purchases over the years . Dependable , comfortable for the hands .
5 #### Very handy . I carry them every day on the farm . I keep several pair .
5 #### i got this set as a housewarming present for a friend who is also a chef . the packaging itself is beautiful but the knife and peeler set inside was impressive . the black ceramic knife works great on meats and vegetables while the peeler makes the job so much easier . overall this is a great set to give as presents and one to keep for yourself .
4 #### I did n't pay attention to the thickness , so my fault entirely . These are quite thick , and would work great for tent stakes , line stakes , anything which needed a good bit of solid construction . I however am seeking stakes for actual marking of plants ( to paint ) , having found NO marked which is nearly as durable ( and readable after years ) as a plain fashioned painted wooden one ! .
5 #### My HVAC guy told me these are the best . When I ca n't get to Lowe 's I order from Amazon .
4 #### OOPS , I meant to post 5 stars ! ! I plan to buy more of these bowls . The plastic is durable . OXO makes the very best . This bowl is a nice size- large , but not too large .
1 #### I bought this a few months back , and have yet to make a batch of pasta . We bought the " precise kitchen scales " per several recommendations and followed the directions precisely . The dough ends up a clump of glue that does n't feed through the pasta die holes . Clean - up is a total mess , the pasta dies included are not for any popular / normal shapes , and on the first use my wife cracked one of the plastic dies that was included . We resorted to pulling out the dough , rolling it out , and cutting it by hand on the last use , and that even did n't work right . My advice is to stay far - away from the pasta maker , as the construction is flimsy / weak , its very difficult to clean , and unless you have more luck that us , you wo n't get it to produce pasta . It 's become a $ 65 piece of junk taking up a corner of one of our back kitchen cabinets .
4 #### The vacuum is very light . Easy to handle on stairways . As I purchased it for vacuuming stairways I am pleased . The hose and attachments are very " cheap " in feel and appearance but work exactly as the previous reviews indicated . Great power and easy to handle .
5 #### Using this nail puller is very easy and you can damage your piece very little if it is used carefully . If you are dealing with countersunk or embedded nails , this is the nail puller for you . Simply position the stationary claw slightly behind the nail that is to be removed , pull back on the built in slide hammer and give it a few hits . When you pull back on the lever , the jaws clamp the nail and remove it . Since I have only used it on a few smaller jobs thus far I can not attest to its long term durability , but it feels substantial , and well constructed . I suspect that with careful use this will remain in my toolbox for the rest of my life .
5 #### Excellent grip , especially when your hands are wet . Large handles improve grip and less fatigue while cutting several items . Very sharp for cutting meat . In fact , it is so sharp , you need to hold meat with a fork and not hold meat with other hand . This knife takes less cutting time because of it 's micro - cutting groves ... which cut clean slices and do not mangle or slide off meat . Cutting time is immensely shorter because of the large handles & professional cutting edge . We ordered on Friday and it arrived Sunday in the two day Prime via USPS , Yes , USPS delivered on Sunday to our house . Update Nov. 30 , 2015 : The knife is so sharp that you should not leave it unattended , because someone can easily cut themselves . Lay it away from your work area or wipe it off and put back in storage drawer . Again , the handle gives you an awesome hold and will not easily slip in your hand . Best kitchen knife I 've ever had .
5 #### I hope it works this well for a long time . Very easy to use . Excellent for people who would normally be strained from a regular can opener .
4 #### Used it for the 1st time to dig a 36 inch hole . Worked well through the hard clay .
1 #### The photo shows Genuine Hoover Sweeper Bags . This company sends a cheap knockoff but charges for the Hoover quality bags . Do not purchase .
5 #### What you see in the picture is what you get . Attractive and well built . I do n't put them through the dishwasher , so I 'm not sure how the rubber handle coating would hold up .
5 #### This product works great ! It does exactly what it is supposed to do - take those stubborn skins of of your garlic ! Just stick it in , apply some pressure and roll on a hard surface and VOILA ! Skins are no more ! Just run it under water and you are good to go again !
4 #### The handle on my old knife finally broke after twenty years and I wanted another , just like it . So I ordered the same model . It seems nice and sharp , but they have made the edges of the knife more rigid so it is far less comfortable to hold . I hope that the manufacturing quality has n't gone down that much . I did expect a more pleasant handle for the price . We 'll see if this holds up . Update # 1 : Upon closer inspection , this knife uses half the metal than the older same model knife . It lacks heft . The manufacturer appears to be cutting corners ( pun intended ) .
5 #### I needed the included ring . Worked very well for my still running 80 's shop VAC .
5 #### These work GREAT , just do n't hang them close . The smell is really bad , but if there is a fly on my land , it flys right in the bag . Love these
4 #### I was not expecting much when I ordered this , at best I was hoping for a vacuum for my vehicles . To my surprise this lil ' guy is useful throughout the house . I have used it inside and out . Very powerful . It is on the loud side , but completely worth the power it provides .
5 #### Our CMM1000 pooped out last weekend after we ran over a dirt mound and tripped the circuit breaker . While this has happened on several occasions before , this time the breaker reset itself ( which it does automatically after 1 minute ) but the mower would not start up . There 's no manual way to reset the breaker , so I finally gave up and decided to send the unit away for repairs . We purchased this mower in 1998 , and it has served flawlessly all this time , until now . Despite having this breakdown , I decided to buy a new CMM1000 from Amazon immediately . My wife loves it , though I prefer to use the Honda , which I finally sold only a few months ago . So even if we can get the broken unit fixed at a reasonable cost , it 's still worth salvaging and having as a back - up . It 's held up extremely well given the abuse we put it through .
5 #### This is another stanley tool that is all i use . I have tried other brands and even other stanley models , but this is the tape that i keep coming back to . This is a quality tape for the price so there is no reason to not have a spare or two .
4 #### I purchased this product in November 2009 . in May 2010 one of the bulbs burned and I purchased replacement ones . The replacements bulbs did not work because apparently the actual socket has a problem . I tested the working socket and that seemed to work with the new bulbs but the one side where the bulb burned does not work . I called customer service and the problem is the starter for that bulb ( a small device in the enclosure on top ) and they said they will be sending me a replacement starter .
5 #### Worked for Starbucks for 10 years and own many coffee presses , but wanted to try this as I had heard positive comments about it . Only used it once at this point .
5 #### I 'm composting for the first time , and this stuff is amazing . My produce left - overs are being converted to a wonderful sweet - smelling compost . Well worth the effort of collecting scraps and egg shells for the results !
2 #### I do n't like how this functions compared to my metal whisks .
5 #### Versatile yard bag . Holds a lot of clippings . Collapses for easy storage .
5 #### Makes opening cans so easy ..... the handle is very comfortable and the can opener just snaps right onto the cans .... I like this way better than an electric can opener !
4 #### A little bit small for a Chinese big dish , as there will be more spices than it can hold .
5 #### This worked great for getting the fungus gnat problem I had under control . Too much rain on my deck and my plants did n't get a chance to dry out .. problem is almost gone after just a few days after applying
5 #### Been a finish carpenter for 40 years and have always loved my Estwing hammer ! Just right !
4 #### as expected . Not powerful but strong enough for my purpose .
5 #### This is great toaster oven baking sheet . Perfect for making small amounts in a toaster oven . The non - stick coating works well . Things just slide right off it . Keep in mind , do n't use cooking sprays on it ! It 'll ruin it . The manufactuer must have improved the non - stick coating over the years , as most negative reviews are older ones . It has nice rolled edges to keep it from warping . It 's rather heavy and very sturdy for it size . And the price is very reasonable . I wish I would have bought two instead of just one . Plus it 's Made in the U.S.A.
5 #### , , , , , , , , , , , , , , This Product is a perfect replacement for your dead or dying 35/5 microfarad run capacitor as a tech savvy consumer I usually do n't like purchasing such inexpensive replacement parts for such high dollar home appliances . I was a Little apprehensive about buying such a low priced replacement part but once I received it in the mail within the estimated delivery date my worries were reduced substantially . the product which was sold through amazon by a secondary supplier in Pennsylvania by my memory but was sold under an amazon specific brand name aviditi . this worried me a little but as I stated earlier once I received it my worries diminished because once I opened the package and did an inspection of the product and the white cardboard boxes each capacitor came boxed in I noticed that the products were rebranded . the capacitor and white packaging had aviditi brand stickers attached to the box over top of the name brand Dayton sticker underneath . the capacitors inside the box had a second generic sticker attached over the Dayton sticker . Dayton being a major brand of motor and electrical components this satisfied me and made me feel better for the purchase I made . my best understanding of how the rebranding worked is the tat the capacitors were originally manufactured for the Dayton company and than they sold extra product to wholesalers who eventually sold the product to the pannsylvanian company who finally sold the product to me through amazon .
5 #### I bought the " regular " version and saw this one - how could I resist ? Bottom line : I like traditional trowels with wooden handles . This ai n't exactly the same as my very old USA - made one but it 's the closest I could find . Rivets could be better ( made in China ) . Quite sturdy . Recommend . HOW DOES ONE FIND TRADITIONAL STURDY USA MADE ITEMS ? Removing the stickers is an awful experience - blow dryer technique does NOT work . Use Goop - off ( sp ? ) or dry cleaning fluid ( Angelus )
5 #### If your into organization , then get yourself some five / six gallon buckets and sermon these . Easy access to screws , nails , nuts , bolts , etc
5 #### Product as described . I would order from this seller again .
4 #### From the box to the street / yard . No fuss , no hassle , just clamp on and use ; what can be easier than that ?
5 #### I 'm ordering a second one . It 's fairly light weight and has n't kinked , yet . If the quality holds up the five stars will remain .
5 #### Climate change has kept us varying our irrigation routine every year . Over the last three years we have bought 10 Gilmour hoses . They have been nearly kink free . Only had any problems with one , which was promptly replaced by the manufacturer . Best hose we 've ever bought .
4 #### I Hope i love them . I have no idea as i have not had to use them , they do make me feel a lot safer
5 #### I love it . For the price and elagance . This is a glassy wall lantern . It was easy for my electrician to install it . Now my address can be seen with the help of this clear glass incasement . It looks very professional . I would referred this lantern to my friends .
5 #### I love how comfortable the handles feel in my hand . They require very little effort to use . The blades are very sharp . I like that they lock closed to prevent injury . That makes me feel more confident about putting them in my pants or apron pockets when I need both hands free .
1 #### able to use it as mice can just leave after a good meal , if I ever get the end cap it might work
5 #### Has that extra power when I need to solder larger components on my pinball machines !
1 #### I wish I had n't wasted my money . We had to put our old one , which the Eureka replaced , back into service . Why ? The hose is designed so there is a bend at the end ; the bend is just enough to catch any large clumps of hair , leading to a huge clog in the hose . With two dogs , we needed a decent machine . This is n't that machine by any stretch . Pet attachments , they say ? Why have an attachment when the silly thing ca n't pick up the hair dependably .
5 #### It goes together a little weird , but it works well and prevents the kids from leaving the bathroom fan on for hours ....
5 #### I have 3 cats , 2 ferrets , all hardwood or tile floors , and there was a dust storm last week . I love this vacuum . I love the way it cleaned my floors and I love the way I was able to dust the ceiling fan over the bed and not one piece of dust or crud fell onto the dark bedspread . I wish it came with an upholstery attachment that was a little more robust , but I bet there 's one sold separately and at this price , who can complain about that . This is exactly what I needed .
2 #### The handle on this is too big around to be comfortable for me . ( Maybe terrific if you have large hands . ) I tried it out a little and just did n't like the fat handle , so I gave it away to a friend and he likes it . A truly handsome hammer and made in the USA ! I think the older models of this hammer had a skinnier handle . It 's too bad . I really wanted this hammer .
5 #### This is a great light ! The clamp is practical and sturdy , the neck holding the light is durable yet flexible and I love the two light settings and the EASE of the on / off / switch button ! Very nice value . Provides lots of light !
5 #### I fooled around with my lock for a couple of years , taking it apart and lubing it , filing parts and so on , and finally bought this to fix it . It took about 5 minutes to install it and it works fine . Sorry I waited so long . Look at your lock and see if it looks like this one . If it 's a Schlage and it does , this will work .
5 #### I have owned my original handle and push pull weeder for over 25 years ! My weeder after 20 yrs did rust through but the original rakes I still have and use frequently . I purchased a new weeder and the trowel three years ago . I love the trowel and have found it to be very well made . I even use it to pry out good sized rocks . It is wonderful for planting annuals as you can easily dig several holes in a short amount of time . I also find it very helpful for digging out weeds especially deep rooted ones or those in tight places like sidewalk cracks . It is also great for transplanting in places where you do n't want to disturb surrounding plants . I have recommended these to several people and they also love the tools . For the price you ca n't beat them !
4 #### these knives are ok . they do n't last too long as they are only steel , not carbide . next time i would spend the xtra and get carbide ones . these knives go dull in just soft wood , as is expected from a steel knife . these delta knives are good for what they are . go carbide .
4 #### This is a decently - made spokeshave . It is easy to use and relatively easy to adjust with some trial and error . The blade will need honed when you first get it , it is not razor sharp when it arrives .
5 #### I have a water heater in my house that was connected to a normal toggle switch . It sucked because people would forget to turn it off and I 'd get hit with a higher electric bill . This timer from Intermatic is perfect ! No more forgetting to turn the switch off . It 's much more convient and loks more professional also . I 've used Intermatic products in the past . They always live up to their standard .
5 #### These filters are great . They do an excellent job of removing dust , dirt and pet dander ( I have three dogs ! ) However , I can not wholeheartedly recommend the after market supplier ( Hardware Zone ) . These were advertised as a set of four for a little over $ 20 . However , I received only ONE filter in the shipment . When I contacted the vendor , I was told there was a pricing error and ONE filter was the correct shipment ( poorly packaged and smashed flat ! ) . i explained that the $ 20 price tag for one filter was more than double what they cost locally . The supplier 's customer service was courteous and did provide a full refund . There are other lower cost suppliers readily available on the internet .
3 #### I 've gone through a number of these , which I use in the convection oven and I 've switched to another product . These get scratched and discolored fairly quickly . The OvenStuff grey cookie sheet ( $ 5.99 ) seems to hold up better . I just ordered a second one .
1 #### The way this smoker is built , you ca n't add charcoal if the water tray is installed . Useless
5 #### Appears to be of good quality . Wo n't scratch non - stick surfaces .
5 #### This is the best tool for spreading sandwich filling on bread . I love it .
5 #### After buying dozens and dozens of regular hose outlets over the years , finally - ones that actually work . I 've had a number of these units for several seasons now , and they 're just as good as Day 1 .
5 #### A baby Weber ? NOOOOOOOOO ! It 's a WEBER . I originally bought this to pimp out a Brinkman ... But , this is a high quality grill for 2 . It does almost everything the big Weber does . But , it 's smaller ... I can roast a whole chicken in it but , The chicken needs to be split in half . This is a great small grill ... Perfect for camping , tailgating , and for a family of 2 .
3 #### The description says small . It is exactly that ... small ! ! ! ! By small I mean it is less than 6 inches long . The blade is sharp but this is a tool I ca n't use with the large hands that I have , otherwise I may may have rated it higher .
1 #### Was easy to install but kept turning on and off all by itself , every 30 seconds or so . Had to return it .
5 #### An oldie and a goodie . A great priced , flexible spray nozzle that ca nt be beat . Save your money on more expensive nozzles and buy this one right here .
5 #### Well made , price was nice , you wo n't find anything better for the price and purpose . I maybe should have got the one with the longer handle , but it 's quality made and works great , I like it .
5 #### I read other reviews from people disappointed that this cooling rack was bigger than the stated dimensions . Thanks to those reviewers , I knew what to expect and was in fact , happy about that . I 've already used the heck out of these , cooling 6"-12 " cakes , muffins , cupcakes and cookies on them . I love Nordic Ware and I appreciate that it is made in the USA . This cooling rack is a great product .
5 #### Does what it 's supposed to do . Quality is sturdy enough .
5 #### This is a good size for a pool deck . Big enough to see from the pool area and has all the temperature info I need on one dial .
5 #### What can I say , a saw blade is a saw blade . Works flawlessly . I 'd purchase again when needed .
5 #### definitely go to Kreg 's website and download their plan for an in - built cabinet with slide - out router bit drawers . Their dimensions are spot on and it 's a great weekend project . Otherwise the fence dust collector alone will only capture 20 - 30 % of the dust from what I can tell . You need to box this thing in . It 's easy ( and kinda fun ) to do though . The table itself is built like a tank . The fence is in many pieces as is the table , so give yourself a few hours to get it all buttoned up . You 'll love this thing . Lots of room to work with and very versatile .
5 #### Best pie cutter / server I 've ever had - great product at a great price !
5 #### Took a while , but the humming birds finally found the feeder . I 'm hoping we 're on next years rotation and they tell their friends . I had no idea humming birds were attracted to red ...
5 #### We have used this a couple of times for homemade fry 's and love it , it is sturdy and cleans up well .
3 #### I purchased this because I only have to dig a few holes and this should be fine . If I had to dig more I would have hired someone .
5 #### These are great . In addition to 1/4 , 1/3 , and 1 cup measuring cups , this set also contains 2/3 and 3/4 measuring cups . I do wash them by hand because I 'm afraid the writing would wear off over time if I put them in the dishwasher . I bought one set and liked it so much that I bought 3 more .
4 #### I had a complete set of Henckels that included this knife . A couple visiting my home let their kids take it out and dig in the dirt with this one . I ordered it to replace the one that then had a broken tip . This size knife works well for small jobs like paring apples or pears , taking the eyes out of potatoes that the peeler misses , etc . Henckels makes a good quality knife and this is a usable size . The handle fits well in your palm , also .
1 #### It broke a few days later . Worst product ! Do n't buy !
5 #### I was looking for some new tongs for my husband to use since every time he used the outside grill he complained about my cooking tongs . While trying to figure out something for his birthday present , I remembered his dislike for my cooking tongs . After reading a dozen reviews on various tongs on Amazon , I chose these because of the reviews , stainless steel , and dishwasher safe . My husband has now use them at least ten times and the tongs work great . They look almost brand new still and have held up to being washed in the dishwasher . I ordered the 16 inch size and it is perfect for using on the outdoor grill for flipping meats and chicken .
3 #### Brand new and they already have red tops after only 10 hours of " on " time in warm weather ! Hope they last and red area does not extend down the tubes ! They are in a Flowtron fixture wit burn time control - off , on at dusk off at dawn , , 3 hours or 5 hours on - off . Original bulbs lasted 3 years of summer use .
5 #### These were nice but the print is so large that it was easy to get a product that did n't really look like the picture . Very good quality and true colors
5 #### I purchased this bit to add to my router bits . This bit will last a long time . Freud makes a quality and heavy duty cutting bits and blades at a reasonable prices .
5 #### Sprout great every time . Taste great as well . Highly recommended .
5 #### These bulbs fit my range hood and work - no problems so far . The local stores charge as much for 2 as I paid here for 10 . All of the bulbs of this type seem to be imports , so why pay for the name - brand mark - up ?
5 #### I have owned this product for many years and used it for many projects . It has always been reliable and accurate . It simply works . Adjustments are easy and accurate , power is plentiful and dust collection is fine , using the dust bag . the joiner feels comfortable in use and is not to heavy . I can not think of anything I would change . In the unlikely event that my joiner fails I will not hesitate to purchase another dewalt plate joiner .
5 #### I have owned this tool for a couple of years now , and I am as happy with my purchase now as I was when I bought this tool . It has been used for remodeling , new construction , cabinetry , and several small projects . I think I 've only had 1 jam in 2 years , and that was caused by a bent nail . Fortunately , the opening at the front of the nailgun allowed for easy clearing of the jam . This is a great tool , one which I would buy again if it were stolen or lost .
5 #### I had some decking boards that were delivered but I did n't have time to lay them right away so when they started to dry out they warped . This tool allowed me to tack one end and then straighten the board out as you work down the board . This tool straightened out even the worst of the 5 1/4 " deck boards . Simple , but great tool !
5 #### Makes very nice shoestring fries and is very simple to use . My daughter and I actually had fun turning a 10 lb bag of potatoes into fries that we bagged and froze for later use :) This cutter was very easy to disassemble and clean as well however take care as the blades are VERY sharp !
5 #### Very minimal vibration if any . Change - over is seconds . So far , so good . I 've only used up to 3/4 " stock but the challenge for 1.5 " will be forthcoming . I did not receive a manual or registration card so I am curious how to register my new tool .
5 #### I bought this to go with my new aircompressor for my air nailer and other items . 3/8 " hose is better suited than the crummy 1/4 " hose that comes with most . seems to be holding up fine
1 #### Seems fine - however it is quite small . My fault for not knowing how little a 2qt container is . IN fact , smallest double boiler I have ever seen . Do n't buy it if you plan on making more than one serving of anything ; I wish I could return it for a larger one .
4 #### Works great for our band saw , sturdy and rolls easily and locks in place .
4 #### Typical Henckel quality and durability outside of their International line . Extremely pleased with the quality , cost and functionality of this product .
3 #### Flowtron is probably the best of the " bug zappers " but it does nothing to kepp skeeters away . Mosquitos are not attracted by light . And the human body gives off more carbon dioxide then the little mosquito attractant does so guess who the blood suckers head for ? However they knock the hell out of everything else . And some of these are benificial to flowers and your garden . So if you like killing bugs then this is the one to use , But if its mosquitos your after try some deet . There is no easy way to get rid of these pesky fellows .
5 #### I 've only used this many times on my impact wrench with no problems .
1 #### Blades made of soft metal , got notch and now get stuck all the time . In my book these are junk
5 #### LOVE it . and it was delivered right to my door .
2 #### I 've used these in the past and they worked great . I think the ones I bought from here were , shall we say .... stale .
4 #### I 've made hundreds of cuts on this 6 " dado set over the last 5 years . I 've been happy , but it 's not perfect , and I think Freud sometimes charges for their name when less expensive competitors are about as good . I would try&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mibro-491071 - 6 - Inch - Stacking - Dado - Blade / dp / B000HE9SL6 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mibro 491071 6 - Inch Stacking Dado Blade</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Oshlun - SDS-0630 - 6 - Inch-30 - Tooth - Stack - Dado - Set / dp / B0012YILDQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Oshlun SDS-0630 6 - Inch 30 Tooth Stack Dado Set</a>&nbsp;if I needed another set . The case is well designed . Saves you time , and saves the blades . The red plastic wing nut thingees both cracked , but Freud sent me new ones when asked . It would be nice if the shims were factory labeled . You need to clean , measure , and mark them , and the marker writing eventually wears off . There is sometimes a little blow - out on the cross - cuts , but any dado set will do that . Use a scrap of wood against the trailing edge .
1 #### Designed to fail followed instructions and it fell off the window after about 30 minutes:- ( Dumping the nectar on the deck nice mess ! had to sand down the sucktion cup guards to make it work it been on the window for about 48 hours now without a problem if have to buy this a good electric belt sander might also be help full . how can companies sell this kind of junk ! !
1 #### waste of money and not worth using . this product does not melt anything but a lil pin hole where the pellet goes , you have to use an entire bucket just to do a small area . it maybe safe for pets but not for the wallet .
5 #### good one and the company is so good when I had problem they exchange it no problem
4 #### I have a bandsaw sitting on this and it does a good job . It is stable . Putting the wheels up tends to rock it a little so I am careful to stand on the leaning side to add support . Easy enough to put together .
4 #### Preformend as advertized . A word of safety is needed because it has an exposed very sharp blade . Watch how much you cut as the slices pile up underneath the mandoline . Large vegtables like a cucumber you will want to cut into sections and then slice .
1 #### What can I say it broke , and forgot the warranty to send it in . So I have to pay lots of money on shipping and repair . Not going to happen .
5 #### Love this mower ! Easy to push . Cuts great . Very sturdy . Go green . Do nt let the engines win .
5 #### We used this netting to cover our pond and keep leaves out . The netting itself is a heavier - gauge plastic than I normally see , and the mesh openings were small . It installed easily but I would have liked more than the eight included plastic stakes - I needed to supplement them for our odd - shaped pond . The netting has already caught many leaves and it will make our springtime cleanup much easier .
3 #### Appears to be doing a good job repelling deer from our rose bed although it 's only been a short time since I received it . A feature that is missing is a photocell switch so that you have an option to deactivate it during daylight hours when placed in an area frequented by human traffic .
4 #### What can you say about a tried and true old Stanley utility knife . Ca n't beat it and you get 3 blades to boot . Do n't know about the negative reviews but what do you expect for a 4 dollar utility knife ? Will buy again if needed and for sure recommend to anyone in need .
4 #### Bought this to replace our ancient pot . At first few uses , water spewed from the bottom . Checked the gasket and it 's not quite as thick as the older one . This problem abated after a while ... and it does make a good cup of coffee .
5 #### A great tool . It is accurate and easy to manipulate .
1 #### Weak suction ! ca n't even pickup dirt in the Car 's carpet . Changed to 5 - 8 Gallon Drywall Collection Filter Bags . It can eat all the screw , nail and rock :D ( Brute Vac 5 g 5.4amp )
5 #### Bought these for my wife as a gift and she loves the tones they produce . Sound a bit like church bells or medieval church type sounds as described . They can be a bit overpowering if its windy !
5 #### I have had a speed square for years . This one is so much easier to read than my old one .
5 #### I have both of Eminem 's other CD 's , and after one listen through , this is my favorite . It 's easily his most danceable ( which may earn him more criticism ) and there are even signs that he 's grown . The song Cleain Out My Closet is this album 's message to his mother , and in it you find him still angry , but it 's tinged with sorrow and , dare I say it , perhaps even vulnerability . The song White America is my favorite ( for now , it 's only been 2 days ) . The song poses the question of whether he would be so controversial , or indeed so successful if he were black . It 's a challenge to parents everywhere to ask " Do we just not like his lyrics , or are we ticked that are kid are relating to his lyrics ? " . But through it all , Eminem retains his bratty wit , mocking all the usual suspects , ( he 's got a real grip with Tipper Gore and the Cheyney family ) and , though I sometimes question his logic , it 's still a hoot . If I have one gripe , it 's that he pushes the whole " I 'm a white rapper " thing a little too far . But with talent like his , it 's hard to blame him .
5 #### These are great pruning shears . I 've had to get some bamboo in control after it took over a good part of my planting area . These helped me trim the branches off so that I could get everything in the trash .
4 #### This is advertised as a " Starter " set , but for general homeowner stuff , this will probably last me the rest of my life .
5 #### I just had to put in my two cents worth on this product . There should never be a reason to use starter fluid any more . This thing is so completely fool proof that anyone can start a fire . I like to slow cook a lot of different foods and because of this I bought another chimney starter ( a total of two ) . This way I can always have fresh coals going . I also found it useful during camping trips to take the charcoal grate from a Weber Smokey Joe grill and place it on top of the chimney starter and use it to make coffee or to use cast iron cookware to make various dishes . It also makes a pretty good heater while fishing in the winter . You put in about 1/4 to 1/2 the capacity of charcoal and when it gets low you just add a few more briquettes by doing this you can stay pretty comfortable for quite a while .
2 #### Works nice when it works , which is not very often . I 've had 3 separate failures in 3 years of occasional hobbyist use . I have now spent more on ordering parts for this POS than I spent on the original sander .
5 #### Using this mostly for electrical work . For anything bigger I would recommend a little more weight - 23 oz is a favorite . This one is great for what it is and for electrical it 's a very good hammer !
1 #### Expensive , did not work , but killed some of the plants in the pond and the algae was still there . never try anything like it again
5 #### Definitely the real thing . The package is difficult to remove , however - I cut myself on the knife getting it out .
5 #### This produces small , thin slabs of parmesan - type cheeses that sometimes go well on some dishes where more finely grated cheese does n't . I have cut uniformly thin slices of firm cheeses that are not hard like parmesan . The handle is easy to hold . The ability to cut larger , but not big chunks , of cheese is a great asset to have in your drawer .
5 #### Great price and works well . It 's probably the cheapest knife but works well . There 's no need to buy a more expensive knife .
5 #### Does the job it 's designed for and works as advertised .
5 #### We use this router table along with the Bench Dog lift as a basis of a small unit to custom machine samples for an instrument we sell . I like this table , but with a couple of comments . One is that the table Bench Dog is currently selling does not look like the one in the picture . Current finish is white mdf . I keep thinking it is going to be plywood , but it is not . The second comment is that they ship a table top stiffner that does not fit along with it . The stiffner is from their larger tables . No need and no way to use it on this table . Incidentally , I have not had good luck with the larger Bench Dog tables . The thin MDF table is just not stiff enough for the application . They get buy with it in this table because of the smaller size .
5 #### I love my new peeler . It takes off the perfect amount , and I love the grip . So much better than my old rusty cheap one . I also like the plastic cover for the blade .
5 #### After a lot of trial and error I finally found the best popcorn popper made ! It can make enough for a lot of people in one batch or you can make a little batch too . It is easy to clean . The rod that stirs the popcorn can be removed for cleaning or adjusting if it rubs anywhere . I like to use grape seed oil and add some butter right before it begins popping . I also love to sprinkle nutritional yeast onto fresh popcorn ... try it !
5 #### I 've had mine now for 14 years . I have had to replace the arms because the machine has n't been " coddled ! " It is propelled by the water pressure and the centrifugal force of the rotating arms You can make the thing back up by flipping the angle of the arm direction 180 * I now use it on my daughters yard as they do n't have sprinkler system here . Its eco friendly in that a minimum of water is wasted ..... two speeds and with the ramp and a good hose , very predictable as to time and area . The area can be enlarged by pulling the hose thru and redirecting the path ..... I think it worth the $ $ . Ca nt comment on the newer manufacturing complaint but as it stands now .... this will outlive me ! .
4 #### I like the way this works much better than light sensitive switches . I used this on lighting an outdoor lantern with fortress transformer , dimmer and wiring .
4 #### I would buy again I just wish it was a little lighter in weight . However in comparison to other light weight or feather weight hoses it is far superior in quality to what I 've had in the past . Ii find it does not kink up when extended the 100 ' . All in all a very good product .
5 #### This light makes it so easy to see your work . Great product , I use it everytime I saw . If you do n't have one , get one the price is right and it 's a very useful item . A must have ! !
5 #### Yep ... it is exactly what it looks like . A great way to organize things like screws and nails and whatnot . Not much else to say other then I 've had it for several years and I see no signs that it is wearing out .
3 #### Good quality . Wish it had better instructions . Very accurate , a little difficult to set . I use only one settings . I might look for something easier for me to program .
5 #### Have had one of these for a while . It works well , feels sturdy . And it can go right in the dishwasher . Just bought a 2nd one ( since we do n't run the dishwasher every day ! ) ... Recommend
5 #### Heavy duty , non - stick , excellent quality . Heats evenly , but quickly , so watch closely how fast your items bake . I 've made cheesecakes and chocolate cakes and neither leaked through , baked wonderfully , and cleaned up with a breeze . Highly recommend .
4 #### I used this to cut a bunch of 5/8 tube stock . 200 pieces at 45 * angle . Cut slowly and it will last a long time . Rush your cuts and you will overheat the blade and dull it . Caution when cutting small pieces , Use long nose pliers to hold the cutoff pieces , they can jam the blade if it falls into it . Also the pieces can fly out with great speed across the shop ! I chipped a tooth with the small piece jamming into the blade and the replacement blades are $ 120 + so be careful . I can get this blade repaired and resharpened for $ 40 locally so I will have a back up blade .
3 #### Not the heavy , thick ones that I expected . These are regular thickness .
5 #### Great ax , nice and heavy . Have been splitting 36inch diameter red oak with ease . Have to use a splitter to cut the logs in half but after that this thing gets the job done on its own . Nice long handle improves the head speed nicely .
5 #### I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I love it ! I even take it backpacking !
3 #### I recently bought a Bucket Boss organizer with 56 pockets . I subsequently received a follow up email from amazon that I might like to " accessorize " my purchase with one of the items in the email . The yellow plastic divider CANNOT be used on a bucket which has the tool organizer on it . The thickness of the interior canvas makes it impossible to put the divider into the bucket . I do not know if this applies to the seat unit ... anybody tried it ... denny
3 #### It works but realize this is not something to buy if you are going to use every day . This is a light weight , functional mitre box for those of us that need a ounce in awhile moulding piece cut . For this purpose excellent , as professional grade ; no way .
5 #### These bags are amazing . Be sure to mount away from area that you are in . 30 ft is a good idea . I say , cut my fly 's by 98 % after 2nd replacement ( 1st bag was full ) .
1 #### I have done everything from soaking it in hot soapy water to vinegar to cleanser , and can not get the horrible stench of rubber tires out of this thing . It has never been used yet I 'm throwing it away . The hideous rubber tire smell can be detected from 3 rooms away and permeates the entire bedroom next to the bath where it 's stored . Just awful .
5 #### These are sturdy and easy to use and clean . Each spoon can be removed from the ring to use it individually .
5 #### This pressure cooker is our first one and our first time to cook with one . We used one of the recipes printed in the user 's manual , Herbed Chicken . The recipe calls for basil , celery , oregano , parsley , onions , and garlic , along with other readily available ingredients . Total time for the meal to be ready from food preparation , to the pressure cooker building up to pressure , with the actual cooking time was about 15 minutes . The Herbed Chicken was absolutely delicious . We ca n't wait to try another recipe . We also ordered 2 pressure cooker cookbooks . It really is satifying to own a fine and affordable cooking appliance such as this one in which we can cook delicious , nutritious meals that are prepared within 15 minutes . It was not difficult to use , and clean up was effortless and fast . We did read the user 's manual carefully since this was our first time with one . The price was very reasonable , and this pressure cooker has a 12 year warranty ( according to the user 's manual ) . Thanks Amazon for the fast delivery service , and thanks Presto for the fine pressure cooker . We look forward to using it on a weekly basis .
5 #### I know people are getting away from doing biscuit joints and I do n't know why . This tool is easy to set up and cuts perfect slots . I use it to assemble panels and small table tops
4 #### The sharpener works great once you get it setup . It was n't clear in my chainsaws manual what size chain I had , so a bit of guess work was required ... Also , if you have any different chuck on the dremel , the item wo n't fit ... so make sure you have the original small chuck . Once I got it on , it worked easily and quickly , the guide helping greatly to line up and sharpen correctly .
4 #### Timer prevents extended run times of bathroom fan which people frequently forget to turn off . These timers are now in all 4 of our restrooms .
5 #### I received my Flowtron BK-15D shipment on the 5 July ( order on the 2 July ) . Had the device out of the box and into its temporary place ( awaiting Achia TSW-37 91 single pole for hanging ) at 3 pm . Turn device on and left it running until 7:30pm . Enjoyed a bug free afternoon on my recently renovated patio . I highly recommend this product for those looking to purchase a bug zapper that works as advertise and does nt cost over $ 50 dollars .
5 #### I bought this bucket to seal about 2,000 sq ft of concrete , and it worked perfectly . It holds plenty of product , and it 's very sturdy .
5 #### I expect this bag to last for years . This is very thick canvas type material and I 'm yet to cause even a minor snag after a few months of daily use . I use it for dealt power tools , it makes more sense to have this plain looking bag viable in the back of an sub than the dealt bag to me , as a potential thief looking at a dealt yellow bag with labeling would know valuable tools were inside . With this bag , it 's much more discreet . The inside and outside pockets are great for organizing a variety of tools . The shoulder strap is well made and positioned . I probably have 50 - 60 lbs of tools in mine and with the shoulder strap it 's easy to carry .
5 #### Great feeder ! ! We have the small suet peanut balls in it and so far it has kept it dry with no waste
4 #### Nice design , my opinion only , could be a bit thicker , wish it were longer . Did n't know what to expect , can only use 4 inches of extension , but still , great tool .
3 #### Plastic blast gate , as with all plastic blast gates the have a tapered hose connection . If you use wire hose clamps they do stay put .
5 #### It has all been said . I 'll just weigh in with complete agreement on the 5 - star rating . I use it on the hull of a 40 ' sailboat every spring ; the thing is a beast ! It wo n't break , it does n't lug - down with pressure , the speed range is huge ( be careful of the upper end ) and it 's pad size is common enough that there are lots of 3rd party accessories available .
5 #### With so many bit tip holders out there , it was refreshing to use one that did n't require a pair of pliers to remove the bit tip . The " spring loaded " feature alone is worth the price of this well made accessory . When you pull back the collar , the bit pops out with no coaxing necessary . Priceless .
1 #### Not one ounce of difference in my 4 tier outdoor fountain . I had high hopes for this product but it has not done for me what it is advertised to do . I can not recommend this item .
4 #### Victor fly bait is an easy mix . It does have quite an odor , so do n't have in too enclosed of an area to use . It does draw flys and they are eager to jump into the jar and get to the source of the odor .
4 #### This is a nice little pot for the price- used it for the first time this last weekend . Served its purpose beautifully .
4 #### For $ 15 it works well , but the instructions are ridiculously written and have no bearing on how to use the Chainsaw sharpener . Below is a link to an excellent Youtube video explaining how to set up and use the Dremel Chainsaw sharpener . http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mp7ecQSV32A
5 #### This product is made of good metal with proper thickness . The cutting areas are very sharp , it is comparable with standard razor knives .
5 #### The clock only takes a AA battery . You take the clock outside and it contacts the automic clock and sets itself . The clock shows humidity and temperature . I have two of these that live in my lap pool / greenhouse . They are attractive and peform well .
5 #### Smells great and the price is great ! Just throw them on your grill and you 're good to go .
5 #### Some seem to complain that the lids are too tight . These are for sauces and liquids ; they need to be tight ! You just need to press the lip in when closing them . I can understand a young child having some trouble , but any adult should have the minimal dexterity and mental capacity .
2 #### The handle of my 16 - oz hammer is too fat . This 16 oz hammer handle is fatter than many 20 oz vinyl handle hammer . Shape - wise , the handle of my hammer reach its maximum in the middle section . The hammer shown in the stock photo is thinner , and its handle size peaked at the very bottom . Looks like it is assembled by an inexperienced assembler . Wrong size of leather rings were selected , and grinding / trimming of handle shape is skipped . I would not buy another estwing leather handled hammer online again .
5 #### I always have one of these on my hip . I love the size and quality . I have fancier tapes , but this is my favorite .
5 #### - Have an 8 gallon " shop vac " which had the same bag in it for a couple years due to limited use . - Realized I had filled the bag after cleaning the basement , and looked up shop vac bags on amazon . - I have an 8 gallon , so I chose this replacement , and it fits perfectly . - Good price for two pack , probably last me a long time ! - Amazon delivered quickly .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R2IW3GKBDRZZ07 " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / B1 - tqHa4d7S.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A14Ujqf%2Bi6S.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;It works ! I bought it with the hopes of scarring raccoons away from my bluebird nest . Check out my security camera YouTube videos by searching for these videos : * BCQcWbusJc8 - horrible video of a raccoon eating baby bluebirds before I learned proper predator protection and before I had this sprinkler * A2ZAytvUy20 - sprinkler scaring an armadillo away ( funny ) * _ ieISYi8ZqM - sprinkler scaring a raccoon away A downside is that it does seem cheaply made ... so I 'm not sure of the durability . I 'll give it the benefit of the doubt for now . And be sure to follow the directions and not press down on the sprinkler head or sensor unit when installing it into the ground . Note that you might find it cheaper on a store that starts with " e " and ends with " Bay " .
5 #### Fast delivery ... have used it several times ... the spacers help with difficult fits on dado .
5 #### I use this product all the time . Saves time trying to core the apple - in 1 second your apple is core free , ready to be dipped or chopped smaller .
4 #### My burner has two knobs stick out 2 inches . I thought it may not fit . In fact , it fit well . I love it . Nice quality . I hope this is black color . Most grill covers are black .
5 #### Sturdy and have been using this ever dice it arrived .
5 #### Sure now some local stores have a similar hidden plunger . Hiding it is great !
1 #### Had a similar looking juicer for years that I purchased from a restaurant supply store . Was very heavy duty , worked great , then I misplaced it in my last move . When I found this Mighty OJ it appeared to be the same and I was delighted to find it . Lifting the box when it arrived I thought this ca n't be right . Definitely a ' light weight ' contender . Trying to use it took several attempts to properly engaged the gears . With actual fruit in place it is even worse and rarely aligns . Without the packaging to return I guess it just becomes a Goodwill donation . Very disappointed .
4 #### After reading negative reviews about many of the other Nyjer seed bags , I went with the Kaytee . It 's the real deal . No filler to speak of , and my finches are literally eating it up . I 'm having to refill my bag feeder https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057QMTTC/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage daily . My only complaint is that I 'm clearly going to need another bag all too soon . A big thumbs up .
5 #### I have bought almost every book light on the market . They all take expensive batteries , do n't shine bright enough , shine to bright , wo n't adjust the way I want ( hate them all ) . This one is perfect ! It takes triple A batteries , I use rechargeable , it also has an adapter with a long enough cord that it does n't get in the way , it has two settings , light up the entire house and perfect light for reading in bed , and it will adjust any way you want to . Wish I had found it a long time ago , could have saved me hundreds of dollars .
4 #### This item would have gotten 5 stars if two things had been done ... 1 . You have to buy your own quick - connect ( 3/8 " - BEWARE ) . 2 . The pressure regulator is a plastic unit and seems to me that it will break soon . It 's positioned such that it is easily knocked . Other than those two caveats , it 's a great compressor . Not too loud , and it will power a framing nailer , no problem ( yesterday , I installed 100 fence pickets in a couple of hours , six nails per picket in rapid succession , and it had no problem keeping up ) . Will work well for a homeowner that will use it occasionally .
5 #### This bulb works great in my low voltage mini spotlight that I use to light up my address plaque at night . The temperature was accurate and matched other spotlight bulbs of the same temp .
2 #### I am a former Union construction guy , and I have done some demo in my day . This hammer while easy to use is shall we say gutless , I mean this thing has no power . If you only have a little bit to do , or you 're inside , it is better then nothing but do not even begin to think that this thing packs the same punch as a pneumatic hammer . But it is easier to use and much better inside for light work
5 #### I put in north side of my back yard , and I did see it killed many bugs . Now I put in in the south side garden hoping it to kill those insects which bite my veges .
5 #### Great feel and balance . Great for serving cake and pie . This is the perfect server .
5 #### I do alot of Automotive electrical work and solder almost everything . Soldering is far superior to crimping connections . My tip on my Weller soldering gun is pretty bent up and old . Bought these as a replaced and they fit like they should . NOTE : THIS COMES WITH TWO TIPS , I WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION IS CAME WITH ONLY ONE TIP .
5 #### Much bigger , in a good way , than I expected . Quiet and a lot less vibration than the smaller Rigid unit this replaced . Very happy . The blade tension lever is great .
5 #### Having purchased numerous devices for washing lettuce , we replaced our first OXO Salad Spinner with this version which is easier to clean , includes a brake to stop the spinning and fits in a smaller space ,
5 #### Awesome sander . Well - balanced and easy to grip with either hand . Heavier than most , but that allows the sander to do all the work . I see guys applying pressure to thier orbitals and ca nt help but wonder how fast they burn through bearings and pads . No dust collection but its not a problemm for me because I do 90 % of my sanding on a large dust collection box that I made that seems to get nearly all of it .
5 #### It took a long time to get here , but sturdy little thing . Happy with my purchase .
1 #### Broke within the first pickup load of wood . The axe head went flying and could have hurt somebody very easily . Not safe . Did n't show any signs of damage until complete failure .
5 #### I really only need one but a 10 pack for the same price hardware stores is great . Ca n't beat the price .
4 #### Gas and electricity has gone up so much lately . Pressure cookers can help you save by making cooking a lot much faster . It comes with a compact user guide and a small cookbook . Pressure cookers can be dangerous , so make sure to read the safety precautions . Never fill it more than 2/3 of its capacity . You can not open the lid while it is still pressurized with the built - in precautionary lock , but the rocker valve can easily get toppled and extremely hot steam can escape through it . Pros : - Stainless steel . You do not want aluminum for health reasons . - We have been using this for more than 5 years . We just have to replace the rubber gasket around the lid . - Although not as cheap as we like it to be , if you compare it to other manufacturers , you still save some money . Cons : - The pressure valve rocker . Other pressure cookers ( but more expensive ) has a non - removable pressure valve . It is often get misplaced . - The rocker makes quite a bit noise .
3 #### I get why it 's good for pet hair - it has a very simple design which means that hair only has 1 place to go - the bag . so I bet this vacuum will keep working for years ( I 've only had it about 6 weeks ) . However , the suction is disappointing . I am not a neat freak by any stretch of the imagination but this just does n't get my carpets clean . I 'd be happy with this vacuum for a garage or a car but I thought it 'd work for my apartment - it really does n't .
5 #### The local store sells this with it its mating part as a pair , not individually . I needed extra ! MQC parts . They work perfectly .
5 #### I love these - cheap enough you do n't have to worry about damaging it , Made in USA , and the housing is exactly 3 inches .
5 #### This grill has been working out beautifully . No more flare up as with my older gas grill . Keeps the temperature consistent . Cooks thoroughly . Clean up is a breeze . I just wipe off the excess grease and put it in the dishwasher . Oh , and I do n't get splatter with grease when cooking . I keep the lid on and I do n't get greasy . I do n't have that barbeque smell on my clothes and hair when I use it either . It 's a winner !
5 #### My father had one of these when i was a young boy and i can remember useing it then , and it worked great . So i m doing renovation to my siding windows and doors on my townhouse and i decided to see if they stll made such a tool . I found out that it was available and decided to purchase it . Wow this tool saved a lot of siding and boards that i removed from my home while replacing windows . I was able to reuse the cedar siding and trim boards that i had removed So i have to say this tool paid for itself the first half hour of use . GREAT TOOL !
5 #### We love this spatula , does exactly what it should and cleans up beautifully . Seems to be very well made , as well .
5 #### Worked as described and matched what others said about it . Did so well I ordered a second one for backup when needed !
5 #### You never go wrong with a Presto pressure cooker . My grandmother had one and so did my mother . They are well made So if interested in buying a pressure cooker I would say go with the Presto , they are easy to get parts for . I do have other brands and I ca n't get parts for them . Only ones I never have problems with are Presto and Mirro . So I suggest to buy them ..
5 #### I purchased this for my lanai . I wanted a large clock that we could see from the far end . This clock is beautiful . I did n't realize when I purchased that it was also an atomic clock . What a great surprise ! Love the look and size .
4 #### I HAVE A MAKITA BATTERY OPERATED DRILL THAT NEEDS 14.4 VOLT BATTERY TO OPERATE .. IT NO LONGER MAINTAINS A CHARGE . I WAS AT HOME DEPOT TO BUY A REPLACEMENT AND THE COST OF THE BATTERY WAS ALMOST $ 75.00 .. I WAS ABLE TO REPLACE THE BATTERY WITH A BLACK DECKER PS140 FOR 1/2 THE PRICE AND PURCHASED THRU AMAZON
5 #### About 5 years ago I got into cooking stir fry a little bit and found that cutting carrots , onions and many other vegitables was quite a chore with the cheap selection of knives that my kitchen was stocked with . I had to get sometimes near paper thin slices of various ingredients and there was no way even the best knife sold by Target could stack up to the task . I went to a real cookware store and purchased this knife and the 14 " chefs knife for starters . The first slice through an onion I knew where the extra money goes , some of it is for the name , but the rest is all quality . These knives will amaze you with how well they feel with their perfect balance and with a little work , you can get the blade sharp enough to shave with . When I held the chefs knife balanced on a tomato and just pulled , the weight of the knife sliced through it with a clean stroke . The paring knife is handy for so many more things than just paring ( which it does quite well ) , I 've used it more than once as a steak knife . For some reason I ca nt stand serrated edges anymore . Cut all the coke cans you want with your Ginsu , but leave the real jobs to a real knife .
5 #### Our hummingbirds love this feeder . I fill it with sugar water and our little birds visit from morning to night .
4 #### My wife needed a detailed sander for refinishing a rocking chair for our 1 year old . However most of them at the big box stores get poor ratings even if they were very inexpensive . This one is n't terribly expensive but not terribly cheap either . I love the power this thing has and especially like the finger type sanding pads . The only thing I do n't like is that it 's hard to find paper locally . No worries since I 'm Amazon Prime so I just order new paper when I need to . If I had to do it over again I would have ordered more paper when I ordered the unit .
5 #### This is a stainless steel honer . The idea is it will wear away at the same rate as your steel knife as opposed to a grinding stone which is sanding away your knife . Overall great product .
5 #### Love , love , love this salad spinner . After breaking the string on 2 pull - string ones from walmart , I decided to spend a little more and get a different style . It works wonderfully !
5 #### Good quality salad spinner . Solid product and very easy to clean . Highly recommended .
5 #### Installed along with our new bathroom fan / light combo and it works great . Reasonable price , good product and great seller . If needed I would do the same thing again . Thanks
5 #### This is a awesome axe for chopping medium size wood and splitting kindling . I would recommend this for anyone with a fireplace or wood stove
4 #### There is a clear rust resistant plastic coating on the metal , which chips and peels easily . I took a razor blade and scraped it off , and sanded it down to remove . Not sure why this is added , most people will not need it , or can just use a drying oil spray . Other than that , it is a great hammer , well balanced , and good weight . I got tired of wood and fiberglass handles breaking on my other hammers when using the claw .
4 #### Provides coverage as stated , fairly easy to adjust . Always pick up oscillating sprinklers by base
1 #### Returned this item as I could not use them . They were serrated and I can not use serrated knives on my Corelle dishes .
5 #### Perfect exact replacement . Came preloaded and is refillable . Replaced the one my nephew melted . Saved me hundreds buying a new weedwacker
4 #### While these bags are the correct fit for a canister vac which takes the H type bag , it needs to be noted that these are not genuine Hoover bags . These are DVC Brand . Not Hoover brand . DVC brand made to fit Hoover vacuums . The genuine Hoover bags are a heavier weight , and feel less likely to rip should glass or other sharp material be sucked up as compared to these bags .
5 #### Not sure why you would spend alot of money vs buying this . I love mi Oreck but it was no better than this and cost $ 350 many years ago . My housekeeper knows her stuff and she loves it and trust me she knows vacuums !
5 #### I now have two of these . My husband uses my other one for who knows what . Got the other one just for me . The sticker on the bottom is quite wicked to get off . I am still trying . This is the right size and good quality !
5 #### This 16 - quart stock pot has been my go - to pot for holiday cooking . It is sturdy and the bottom is perfectly flat . The integral handles and pot lid handle are easy to manage . They are welded on so there is no fear of them coming off . The lid fits with a nice seal . I love everything about this pot ... except cleaning it . ( I wash it under the bathtub faucet because it is so big . )
5 #### Again you ca nt go wrong with a Fiskar product . These snips are very sharp and do everything they should do . Fiskar products have a lifetime warranty and they stand by it . Great product and well worth the money . Well stand up to its name and any other like item
4 #### Works well , but the black part does pop out if you let it drop any distance . Pops right back , so no worries . Nice range for my large yard , and the dog loves it on days like this .
2 #### Good quality , but did not produce pin point pressure I expected . Definitely falls short of the one I lost , but I do n't remember who made that one . Works well , but stream is not as powerful .
4 #### I go thru a lot of these here at my stained glass shop in Indy . This is a much better price than buying them at your local Ace or whatever . Genuine Dremel quality .
5 #### We get a lot of hummingbirds since we started using this . We also found out that the birds like certain feeders better than others and have two that helped attract birds better than some others we have .
5 #### This little package of parts is apparently made to cover several Gilmour products . I just needed the little black seal that goes on the end of the pump . It installed easily and now maintains pressure .
5 #### This trap turned out to be a lot nicer than I expected - very clever and easy to operate . It 's easy to set and VERY easy to trip . I even caught a few sparrows that were silly enough to try to get inside and get the bait . Thankfully it is also a humane trap so I was able to release them without harm . One caveat : Though it 's called a " rat , mouse , squirrel " trap , apparently it is not strong enough to hold rats inside once it catches them . The egg - stealing rats in my hen house literally tore the trap to bits and got out by the time I was able to check it in the morning . Either that or I have some mighty strong rats . Anyway I would advise only using this trap for mice and maybe squirrels .
5 #### Works as advertised , BUT , read the instructions if you do n't want to hurt yourself . Does a great job of removing a large amount of material with minimal effort , just what I needed for whittling down a stump .
5 #### For 50 years , I have had high respect for Intermatic electric timer products . Ordered on May 17 , 2013 , this new , white , spring - loaded wall timer proved to be no exception to my expectations . I am pleased with the product and have even bought another for another application since purchasing this one . The only bad experience with Intermatic spring loaded wall timers that I 've had was on the same date , May 17 , 2013 , when an electric supplly company tried passing a defective , used , ivory one off on me as new . I know these timers well enough to know when I get a raw deal . This white Intermatic timer purchase from Amazon was just what I expected , and am pleased with both the Intermatic product and Amazon.com LLC as the supplier . I would recommend this Intermatic timer from Amazon.com to my friends and relatives .
5 #### Have used this product in the past ( 30 years ago ) and had not seen it in a long time . Works great . I do n't know if it mixes as it should but seems to do so .
2 #### It kills mice and chipmonks without a problem . No rat problem so I do n't know . But it quit working after about a year . I cleaned it as per the instructions . It did not help . It does not seem to be weather proof . I took it apart and it looked corroded . It did kill a lot of mice before it died . I would put the mouse to Rat Zapper death ratio at about 50 to 1 .
5 #### Have used Lentek for a number of years . These types of products work , it just takes a few months for the barrier to build up in your home or space . Because some years ago , was not able to mend all the entry points for mice in my home , I called an exterminator and then got many of these Lentek type products . I can honestly report that I have not seen a mouse in my home since that time . I can honestly report that I have not seen mouse droppings in my home since that time . I purchased these products as replacements for another brand that I had in my home . I find that Lentek 's product work the best . Unfortunately I have never tried Riddex , because Lentek was one of the first of this type of pest controller . Lentek 's is so far , in my opinion , the best . While the price point was a bit steep , it is definitely worth the ultimate outcome . The delivery time was good . Would definitely purchase another Lentek product such as this one , and would definitely recommend the Seller for future purchases .
4 #### Hard to screw these up . It does work as advertised .
2 #### Needed to replace for my old grill and the parts do what 's intended , but they are very expensive for what they are .
5 #### Works great . Well made . A good deal for the price . But believe the advertisement when it says it is limited to 200 lbs .
5 #### I do n't really know what to say except this is the best nozzle I 've had and I 've gone through MANY ! It 's heavy in the hand but for some reason , it does n't bother my " old " hands . I 've had workers here who have actually abused them but they keep on working . Hence the reason I just bought three more to add to the two I have . I am giving 2 of the new ones as gifts to my gardening buddies so you must know that I really like them !
1 #### Arrived broken ... the temp was at the bottom ... finally started moving but the calibration seems way off . I ended up going with one of the digital versions and much happier .
3 #### It seemed to heat up very quickly , a little scary for me and I thought it would be much lighter than it was . Very bulky to pull around without it tipping over and the cord hangs up the wheels . It just was n't for me so I returned it .
5 #### installation was easy . Had to buy wire as the jumpers that are included do not fit for 240V application . Other then that , went in very easy . Ability to take timer out of metal box is great and helped during installation . Timers work as expected .
3 #### Clip works fine but would be better if it was deep carry , it will scratch the battery tube . Filters do n't work well with the LED version .
1 #### New 2800 gallon pond , two fresh bales . GREEN Water every where . These are failures . Used as instructed . Do n't waste your money .
5 #### Love it . More sensitive than I expected , just have to let the detector do it 's thing while moving slowly and holding the " pick up " parallel to the ground .
5 #### We needed more light on the counters in the kitchen and these little puppies were perfect . Super easy to install and they 've been working perfectly for quite some time now . | VERY bright for it 's size . Happy customer .
5 #### The mold is well built , just remember to hose it down often so that concrete does n't build up . The instructions state to use 3/4 gallons of water for each 80 lb bag of concrete . That makes it really dry and you have to really work the concrete to fill the mold . Instead use 1 gallon for each bag , easier to work with and easier to touch up when you remove mold . You can refill the mold about every 15 minutes . As others have already stated this mold is waaaayyyy cheaper at your local hardware store .
5 #### Easy to put together . Really sharp blades . Cuts easily . Pushing this quietly across my little lawn once or twice a week has brought new peace and balance to my stressful workday . When I 'm working from home , instead of grabbing a sandwich to eat at my desk while the email keeps churning in and the text messages keep pinging away ... now I leave my electronic devices behind , sneak outside and run this mower across my lawn . After a half hour of this , I actually feel like I 've accomplished something . I 've brought order to the lawn . I 've been outside in the sunshine . No one interrupted me . Ahhhhh . I 'm refreshed and jolly well ready to go back in for an afternoon of conference calls and document edits .
4 #### My wife witnessed one of the neighbor 's cats walk into the coverage area . The cat stopped and shrieked ( as cats do ) and RAN through the rest of the yard . One of the other cats saw this , became frightened , and ran back to the safety of the neighbors house . The device seems to work , but since the audio frequency is beyond human perception , I do n't really know . I paid about $ 45 for this at a hardware store . I 'm glad Amazon has it cheaper . If this works , even for a limited time , I 'll be pleased .
5 #### Has helped several times locate water leaks in the wall and floor . Have to remember to turn it off .
5 #### This bug zapper really works well . I posted it in my garden and it gets all those pesky moths , whose offspring were feeding on my plants .. Low energy use , about 13 watts . Not for mosquitoes . Sturdy and well constructed .
5 #### Very happy with this purchase - comfortable , easy to set up , and so far it seems pretty durable . It is the most popular seat at our house !
4 #### I was n't sure what to expect when I purchased this product , but I used it several times on small projects and it 's great . It took about 10mins to first set it up , after that is easier every time . I use clamps to attach it to the work bench rather than permanently attaching it with the provided screws . It 's small for small job ! ! ! If you 're doing something big , choose a bigger router table and router . Also keep in mind that the dremel has so much power so on soft woods it cuts like butter , on harder wood it jams up a bit and you have to make several increasing passes . I made some small dest - top picture frames and it worked like a champ .
5 #### I was ready to kill my kids when the bulb burned out in my range hood . I had been on them for the life of the bulb about how expensive and hard to find these bulbs are . Often they cost $ 6 or more each . Now I have 10 of them and the light in my hood works again . Peace has been restored in my home as I now have 8 spares and the kids still ca nt turn off a switch . Why is it a kid can turn every light on , but is completely incapable of turning any light out ? Given the price of these I am tempted to find sockets to replace the florescent in my grow bed .
5 #### Exact replacement . Got rid of the old and put in the new .
5 #### LOVE this thing ! ! Easy to use , no back - bending , sturdy , and love the 2 separate pieces , rather than the usual attached scissor - like construction . WELL WORTH THE MONEY .
5 #### These clamps have been around for ever . Any good woodworking shop has a pile of them . Get them in pairs at a minimum and get a variety of sizes you wo n't be sorry . They 'll last your lifetime and longer . Oh yeah the other dimension you need to know is the distance from the tip to the middle spindle on this clamp is 5 inches .
5 #### I am revising my prior review of " Durable and long lasting at a great price . " The price is great ; so great that other bulbs can not compete in price . However , my last batch of these bulbs did not last as long as one would / should expect . My application is 12 volt landscape lighting , using 80 - 90 percent of the transformer wattage . Some 12 - packs of these bulbs seem to last longer than others and I can only attribute this to slight differences in manufacturing runs . My last batch lasted roughly four months ; previous batches have lasted six months . This seems to be a cyclical issue , i.e. sometimes they last awhile and sometimes the do n't . But , for the price and as many fixtures as I have running all night , these are the only reasonable cost choice . There are so many variables in various applications , so they may last longer in your situation .
5 #### What can I say , this hose rocks . Well made and good quality . Even at zero temp the hose is still flexible . Will buy more .
5 #### Use it daily to cut angle and flat strap , works well , just remember to take it slow and do n't force the cut .
5 #### Just what I needed . Good product , good price and arrived on time . Ca n't ask for more ! !
3 #### Have n't used it yet , but delivery was fast , and it is what I was expecting . Nice to know it is on the shelf .... ready to go .
4 #### Good sized whisk . Has many uses . Washes in dishwasher on top rack .
5 #### Great product that worked as expected made int he USA ....
5 #### Perfect ! ! ! ! Even just the pilot on will warm a my van comfortably
5 #### Works great and handles all the pruning I need to do .
5 #### Smell bad , works great . Do not use near where you sit or eat as it smells like a ripe outhouse . Use gloves and do not use or load inside your house .
5 #### worked as desired . use it in cooking to tie up some things in a crock pot or a pork loin in the oven , just what I wanted
5 #### So much more affordable than the Instant Pot ! Yes , it must be watched on the stove , but setting a time works well for me . It is sturdy , and I love that it can be used on the stove .
5 #### Have used these for years for my landscape lighting and always satisfied .
5 #### Works great and creates opportunity . I 'm gon na get a router table ( table only , no legs or anything ) and see if I can make it work without being permanent .
5 #### Well designed product that does the job it was designed to do very well . Recommend it to anyone interested in purchasing a Salad Spinner .
5 #### I was in desperate need of a new can opener and this one does a great job ... very easy to turn !
5 #### If you have to split a lot of wood , I would definitely recommend this splitting axe . It has really simplified my life when slitting firewood . One or two whacks with this beast and the log is split for me no problem , there are plenty of videos online that demonstrate how easy this is to use , and they are very true to the experience I have had . I also really like the light weight carbon handle on this product . Overall , has been excellent .
2 #### Going in the garage sale . Wo n't get up enough steam to jiggle the spinner . I called about this , did n't get an answer . I had one of these for years , updated to a nicer looking one , and sorry ever since I got rid of my old one . The steam leaked out of every possible place it could . It 's brand new , checked the lid gasket was good , just got a lemon .
5 #### We use these at the fabrication shop I work at . Nice and small . All metal construction holds up to the abuse .
3 #### Giving it a 3 - star cause of the price . I highly doubt this is an authentic piece but for 23 $ its worth it . The finishing inside the pot is very uneven and bubbly . The handle is very lite and weak feeling and the finish on the handle is not too good . It still has the sharp plastic edges around the handle that they did n't smooth out . probably cause it 's a local China after market and to save time and cost it 's a rushed piece . Have n't used it yet since it 's a gift for my husband but as long as it makes good coffee and lasts a year or so I 'm happy . This item has to be used on a small burner at a medium to low flame . Other wise the handle can be burnt . In some reviews here I saw pictures of customers using it on a big burner at a high flame . It 's just common sense that you should n't do that . others complained about it turning black . It specifically says do not wash with soap or put in the dish washer . It 's supposed to be hand wash with warm water or very lite soap , and after wash , it needs to be wiped dry or air dried quick . Leaving water on it will tarnish it sooner then later .
5 #### I carefully read all the reviews , was a little concerned about the chipping review , but since it was the only one , I did n't worry too much . I bought 2 . These pans are amazing . I can see why the professional chefs like them so much . Never made these before but said I 'd make them for a special occasion . I used the recipe from Alton Brown , preheated the pan slightly and baked for only 35 min . because they are smaller . They came out perfect . I used cooking spray and they came right out . The pan cleaned up so easy . Soap and water , no need to scrub . Cook 's Country named this company as one of their best value for the price and I can see why . I would highly recommend for even the novice cook .
5 #### using with my skil saws all , nice to have a variety of blades
1 #### received item in two days as requested amazon package was sealed very well the product in side box was making loose sounds the hose box was opened , parts inside amazon box was loose , had to use , was missing valve that connected to propane tank no time to return items needed for party stay away from red draagon hoses shows red in ad but was just another black hose
3 #### It 's alright I guess . I like the concept of the rubber footing and handle but It does n't sit well . You have to be careful because with one accidental touch it may tip over .
3 #### The good is the handle . It is very comfortable to hold and to use . The bad is that it needs to be because the scoop itself has a difficult time navigating through stiff , frozen ice cream . I compared it head to head with a scoop from Tupperware and it just could n't compete . The OXO scoop was much more comfortable in my hand , but it was an effort to achieve results . I would n't say it was any better than average . The esteem I hold for the Tupperware scoop has increased a notch . Disclosure : I have no connection to Tupperware
5 #### this unit really works and I some other brand the performance is not even close this . After the first night of use and see close to 50 bugs bodies on the floor at the balcony . I follow some people 's advice to add the Flowtron MA-1000 - 6 Octenol Mosquito Attractant as well . It is a very useful unit to me . Will buy again .
5 #### I used the same belt sander that I bought from a pawn shop for 20 years . I was sad when it finally died . Now I am happy . This sander is almost ideal . Some have complained about the dust collection . I find it works well if you empty the bag often .
5 #### I know you can make the nectar from scratch but .... When I 'm working long days this is perfect for me to keep my feeders going
4 #### A very good small grill if quantity of cook is few .... better than steel hibachi .
4 #### Nice little vacuum , pretty powerful too . If you do n't have a lot of heavy / shaggy rugs this could actually be your only vacuum . No need to buy a full size one .
5 #### Stanley makes a great product . this one is heavy duty and does the job much better than the cheaper tapes . I can recommend this product to anyone .
4 #### I LOVE this TEAPOT ! ! ! So so disappointed that I have to return it . Very cool teapot just color is incorrect . It 's more navy than any other color - or color reflective in picture .
5 #### OXO is a great brand . One of my favorites for kitchen items . Long lasting and reasonably priced
5 #### arrived on time , exactly as described , and at a great price . these collets allow the use of a wide variety of shaft sizes and are a great addition to your dremel tool case .
5 #### My old pan became warped when put water on to boil and forgot it . Glad to find me a replacement in Amazon . My favorite pan for steeping tea for iced tea .
5 #### This coffee maker fit my expectations perfectly . I needed ( wanted ) a large size Moka pot and this brand , made it Italy , is just what I wanted . It was also less expensive than at a local store .
5 #### This is my second B a E. Aside from the coffee sock this is all I use . Got rid of the traditional drip coffee maker and my Keurig . I bought the 6 cup one so that I could make enough coffee when guests come , otherwise I use the three shot one for just myself . The 12 shot one was too expensive and now I can make a total of nine shots at one time so this set up is actually even better
4 #### Using these can save your ladder and the placement source from dings and other marks . They can pretty much pay for themselves the first time you cause any damage without them . It takes all of 10 seconds to install them on each side . My minor gripe is that they could be a little thicker to prevent marring on them from brick , but for $ 8 - 10 you can just get another pair when they begin to wear and not feel too bad . Only other issue is that they do n't fit as tight as they should . It becomes annoying having to readjust after every ladder placement .
3 #### Bought two pair for working outside . One pair was used with my lawn mowing tractor on the two plus acres around the house , the other pair was used with my compact Kubota tractor . Wearing the mower gloves I was cleaning out the ditch beside the driveway drain pipe underneath . There was a nice mix of deposited soil from rain , decomposing leaves , etc . While simply scraping up damp earth one of the gloves developed a hole on the left hand finger . Not very rugged if you intend to perform physical labor repetitively , which is usually the basis of the need for gloves in the first place .
5 #### I used my edger 3 times before I reviewed it . One of the best investments I 've ever made . Unbelieveably easy to use , and when I think about when I used my manual one ... sooooo sorry I did n't buy this sooner . Two tips . As with any edger , best used when the ground is dry otherwise mud will stick in it , and when edging , ( I learned today ) run it back and forth along the edge as any grass that bends over when going forward , will be cut off when you run back over it ... a nice clean cut . Absolutely fabulious and the price ca n't be beat . Do n't struggle with the manual one for years like I did .
4 #### They fit my hanging unit and perform fine . Price is pretty high but seems the normal .
5 #### Very good feel in the hand & does a good job ! Just wish it had a cover for the wheel for safety while storing- please it would really be appreciated . Many Thanks ! !
5 #### Exactly what I wanted . Right size , cleans well and non - slip bottom is great .
5 #### Great product at a great price . Great product at a great price . Great product at a great price . Great product at a great price . yes
5 #### Where I live there are no privately own vehicles . It 's a small island and everyone has bikes . This is what you use to move things around . I have had several other brands of bike trailers and hitches , but this Foldit one is the first one that hasn ' t deteriorated , fallen apart , and rusted to pieces . It 's worth every penny .
2 #### Almost impossible to unscrew the main screw to open the cutter , almost impossible . Finally did and it works fine but putting it back together the screw bound up the last 3 turns and was almost impossible to get in the last couple of turns . Someone is going to gouge themselves when the screwdriver they are using to open the cutter slips and goes thru their other wrist or hand . BE CAREFUL ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Works fine and do not have any troubles with leakage . Love the glass bottom and the handles on the sides .
5 #### Purchased this item for our non - profit organization 's events and it performs very well time after time . Lightweight and easy to clean .
5 #### It 's surprising what a big difference a good design can make . I replaced my old peeler with a KitchenAid one , only to find out it was so poorly designed it 'd mangle anything I used it on , and barely peeled anything . It was so poorly designed , I ended up cutting myself the three times I used it , because it kept catching and slipping . The less expensive OXO Good Grips Swivel Peeler easily removes the peel without damaging the item being peeled . There was no catching , or damaging the produce , and it took a lot less time . I do n't think I 've ever bought a bad kitchen utensil from OXO .
4 #### I can tell you I got the B&D edger and it looks like a heck of a good purchase . Also , these blades look strong and not some puny little piece of plastic that wo n't last an hour ! These are solid and I 'll be very surprised if they do n't do a bang up job !
5 #### Quality build reminiscent of the Made in USA tools from decades ago
4 #### Shipped very fast ! ! ! Very simple design that works great . If it came w / a case or had some sort of latch so both top and bottom stayed together it would be perfect
5 #### What is there to say about a huge mixing bowl with a rubber bottom ( to prevent sliding ) and a rubber handle ( to prevent slippage)and being durable enough to ride in the dishwasher ? Nothing . Buy this bowl . It is inexpensively indispensable .
5 #### These traps work very well ! We have 11 Cows and 2 Horses . Neighbors have about the same . Needless to say , they attract alot of flies . I place about 6 traps at a time along the fence line ( to trap the ones coming over from the neighbors before they get to our herd ) , and a couple hanging from scattered trees a short distance from the shady areas where the Herd like to lie down . They do smell awful ( which is what attracts the flies ) so place them a safe distance from any areas you 'll want to hang around .
5 #### ... after hauling around my 20 - oz . Estwing , I bought this 16 - oz . model as a spare . I was skeptical about this tool after previous reviewers complained of an annoying ringing sound , but I either can not hear this or it just does not bother me . When I first picked it up , I appreciated the shock reduction grip . It is quite an improvement over Estwing models of just a few years ago . My concerns about 16 ounces not being enough mass to drive large nails were alleviated the first time I used this hammer to demolish and re - frame parts of an exterior wall for window and door installation . I found it comfortable to swing and easy to aim given the decrease in mass . It is perfectly balanced . The one - piece design inspires confidence that I wo n't see the head of this baby go flying by my head on the back swing . If my mind were to wander to thoughts of lunch , I know that a misplaced blow wo n't pulverize some wooden handle or worse , send slivers of fiberglass into my eye . All metal construction , sufficient mass , and quality craftsmanship combine in an exceptional all - purpose hammer .
5 #### I use this hose for dust collection in my wood shop . It is a solidly built hose . I have even stepped on it and it did n't crush . It is fairly light weight and slides on the floor very easily . The hose hooks up perfectly , using a Shop - Vac 90686 2.5 - Inch Hose Coupling to another Shop - Vac 2 - 1/2 " hose .
5 #### If you have a dog in the smow belt you need this and it works . BUT the box the four I Ordered came in was demolished and the handles inside are sharp and could harm the fingers . Needs masking tape .
1 #### Worst product ever I purchased on Amazon . Regulator blasted for first use . do n't know why Amazon is encouraging this kind of products . Really disappointing . please do n't waste your money on such products .
4 #### simple to use , sharpens just like a plane would . I 'm happy with it and I 'm glad i did n't spend more since this does the job well
5 #### The Brotform is very well made out of smooth tight sapinmgs . They hold the flour wonderfully but bes to fall they make your bread look wonderful when it comes out of the oven . The are expensive but if you want to kick your bread making up a notch they are the ticket .
5 #### I mostly use this for demolition at work . Taking things apart , smashing things apart . This does the trick . Good balance . Feels good and natural to hold . Makes my regular hammer look and feel like a wimp . Sad really .
5 #### I just got a toaster oven , it works wonderfully , but its small so I needed pans and bake ware to fit it . these fit it just fine . The food cooks evenly and there 's no mess .
2 #### I purchased the most wonderful toaster oven for my kids and then ordered a few items to go with it . This is a very cute , useful item but is way too small for the toaster over . I guess I should have paid more attention to the dimensions . Ca n't put many tater tots on this one .
5 #### The Lodge Sportsman 's Grill is well designed , well made , strong , and an all around great product . In these times when we have Communists in our White House and they seem to be trying to collapse our economy and to change our nation to a Communist state , we do n't know what is going to happen from day to day in our nation . Perhaps even civil war . Combine that with natural disasters and one should have a means of cooking using charcoal or wood should the worst happen . This grill fits the need . You can burn small pieces of wood or wood chips , or charcoal in it . We have done both . You can put pots and pans or a dutch oven on it and stick in a few medium size sticks , or some charcoal and you can fry , bake , grill , or barbicue . This grill is made to take punishment and keep on a cookin . With our nation in the state it is in where our economy is being purposly destroyed by traitors , you ca n't count on electricity or any thing else . It is best to be prepared for the worst case with one of these . Keep your powder dry folks hard times have just begun .
5 #### Great little machine for herbs , garlic or nuts etc . I visited my daughter for Thanksgiving and prepared for dinner in her beautiful new kitchen ! One thing was missing , a little processor like this ... she has the bigger version , but for quick , small jobs , this is the best around ! What a helper :) She loves it !
3 #### this is well built and serves it 's purpose functionally . my complaint is that the hole inside the shutoff valve / bearing is considerably smaller than the width of the hose connection . when putting this on , you are basically blocking off around half of the capacity of whatever is after it in the chain . i use it at the end of my hose , right before my gilmour quick connects , so that when i change out my sprinklers and nozzles , i do n't have to walk across the yard to turn off the hose so that i do n't get sprayed ( so lazy ) . it works fine , and i have n't seen any real loss of range with the water , but i think the change would be noticeable if i put another hose after this connector .
5 #### It 's a medalion with clean , simple lines . It is cast of plastic and it looks like plastic , but run some sandpaper over it to rough up the surface a bit and apply a couple quick coats of paint for a great look . I ordered one for a ceiling fan that was installed over an oversize cut hole and I 'm back to order 2 more for 2 ceiling fans I 'll be putting up next week . The casting is smooth and uniform ... nicely made , but expect to put on a coat of paint if you do n't want it to look like white plastic . Edit : The ceiling fans are up on the front porch with these gadgets there to close up the way - too - big hole that the construction guys cut in the plywood ceiling . I used some construction adhesive to glue them to the ceiling and had the painters give 'em a coat of light blue when we painted the porch ceiling . Photo is below .
5 #### Been using Stanley Tapes for longer than I like to admit ... my original was in cubits ! Anyway , got another as mine keeps disappearing and ending up in my wife 's tool kit .
5 #### Wisk egg white fast , faster than the handheld ones but it would be faster if I were n't weak LOL
5 #### Good for my work , easy end flexible , potent power for cleaning end is very light to use .... Recomendable for all cleaning
2 #### Was a little disappointed product was n't white as it advertise on the box nor does it state that the product color may come in a different color . The storage box was taupe lightly grey color . If I knew this I would n't have ordered it . Most of it is assembled however the top part could not align to snap in easy & is still sitting with the top cover off until I can get someone to figure out how to make it snap into place or muscle it together .
5 #### It 's such a good product , I bought 2 more for my kids . Easy clean up . Easy to use . Combo colander and spin dryer .
5 #### I 've had them all ! Wood , Plastic and Aluminum and I prefer the Aluminum type . Even though the wood works a little bit better , it 's harder to clean and after a while it starts to look gunky and unhealthy . Hard to wash the wood after it 's been used a while and the wood is no longer smooth . No matter how hard you wash , it still feels slimy and that 's what bothers me . You may have to work a bit harder with the plastic or aluminum but when you wash them , they 're clean and they feel clean .
2 #### the stirring was scraping the bottom and we tried to fix that , the lid seems flimsy and I could see it breaking very easily . Seemed like it took a long time to heat up . We just went back to doing it with a pan on the stove . alot quicker and no worries .
5 #### Bought this for my son who has taken over my 2nd Gen Kindle now that I have a Fire . He lights reading where there is n't a lot of bright lighting which can be a challenge using the 2nd Gen. He loves it and uses it all the time now while reading . The light is not so bright that it glares but is powerful enough for what he needs . Great Price and it is also very sturdy and connects easily to the external cover we have on that Kindle where it does not scratch the kindle itself . The ' neck ' is very flexible as well .
4 #### Not sure where a lot of the negative reviews are coming from ; perhaps Brinkmann had QC issues ? For the price , this is a great smoker . If you 're smoking commercially , or supplying large tailgate parties , this is n't gon na cut it , obviously . Smoking for 2 to 6 folks , it 's right in your wheelhouse . Small , solid footprints great for the deck . The loose fit that 's been mentioned is , in fact , a necessary element ; that 's what is providing air flow in this design . Once you understand that , you 'll get the hang of positioning the smoker to tweak your draw a bit . Assembly is straightforward , fit and finish on our unit is excellent , and the components have a nice heft to them . Did a 12 pound turkey as our first big smoke , along with finishing some bacon , and had great results with both . Last note , with this design and the smaller fire pan , charcoal quality seems to matter ; using top shelf lump charcoal and well soaked smoking wood yields consistently good results .
5 #### super easy to use , easy to clean , fun to watch the popcorn explode , and makes terrific popcorn , is very fast just add oil kernels and cover the machine does it all .
3 #### I wanted a second chef 's knife to pair with my 5 year old 8 " victorinox fibrox . They 're both comfortable knives to use and both seem to maintain sharpness . The henckels knife certainly looks " cooler " than the victorinox . The reason for the 3 stars is that after only a month there are rust spots at the butt of the knife . I hand wash and dry it and it is stored in a fairly dry area .
3 #### Nice but had 2 of 4 bent and I kept them anyway . Good for the money and work paid for them
5 #### This is the best and most useful knife I have ever owned . My hands are small and I delight at a nice well balanced untensil such as this one . Excellent , everyone needs one of these if they spend any time in the kitchen ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
3 #### Mud pan or hawk ? I 've used both in my many DIY projects , but I loaned out my hawk years ago and never remembered to get it back , so I 've been using a stainless pan for some time . I thought I 'd give this hawk a try for my latest basement remodel , just to change things up . I 'm still getting refamiliarized with it , though I have to say I still prefer a good mud tray . I had to file down the rough radiused edges on this new hawk so my knife would n't catch , so that knocked off a point for Marshalltown . I also find the 13.5 " span is just a tad too big for me -- it tends to get in the way when I get up close to a corner , so that knocked off a point for me , the user . So far it 's OK , but I 'm doubtful I 'm going to recognize any productivity boost from this hardware change . I 'll edit this if my experience changes when I 'm done with the basement .
1 #### Not only did this thing not catch more than about 5 flies . It stunk up my entire back deck . A skunk smells better than this thing does . It uses some sort of dead animal technology that really carries when the wind is blowing . And when the wind is blowing it usually blows it on the ground spilling the stinky water all over the place . This was a complete hassle and waste of money not to mention a malodorous nightmare . AVOID .
4 #### As soon as I got them I replaced about 8 that were burned out . That was over 3 months ago and they are still working ( which they should ) so I am happy !
1 #### Bought this to replace my old one that I 'd had for several years now . Either my popcorn is not good or the popper is not working well . So far I have yet to pop a nice batch of corn . My other one popped very well , so I want to give this one a good try , but I have used it 6 times now and have yet to get a bowl full of nice popped corn ! I am very sad about this , may have to return it for a new one , maybe this one is faulty . Want to try different corn in it first to see how that works .
5 #### works great on roof painting- I have a roof with a very steep pitch-
5 #### Perfect from gardening to washing vehicles . These original nozzles are far superior to all those other fat , alien looking nozzles with different settings . They are plasiticky and always break / fail . Buy one of these and be happy .
5 #### This product rocks . A bit pricey for what it does , and the instructions make some odd assumptions for you ( following them on your measurements , for example , will make it way oversized , and I preferred to make it fit my tools exactly , also , the instructions call for almost 3/16 of slop in drilling the bolt holes ; again , opted to make mine fit ) . Also , if you 're assembling it , you might want to plan on having a drill press handy , there are about 20 holes that need to be drilled pretty straight and true . Perfect for a workshop with tight spaces , this base allows you to easily move heavy , awkward tools by yourself .
5 #### A fantastic quality product . The tough canvas and soft lining keeps my levels cozy and scratch free . Holds my 78 " , either a 48 " or 59 " , a 32 " , a 24 " , a 16 " and a torpedo . I love that all of my levels are together to grab and go . I would definitely recommend this to anyone who has purchased an expensive set of levels .
5 #### Just as described , at a great price and delivered on time .
5 #### iI keep this in my tool box with my cordless drill and screw driver . It is very handy to have when needed .
5 #### Worked on my carrot cake . . . & its very good looking .
4 #### This is my very first Gas grill and I only used it once so far ( I just got it :) The grilling area is bigger than I thought and it can actually accomodate 3 people ( 6 steaks , 6 burgers ) I used the 16.4 oz propane vice 14 oz . You can easily find it at Sporting / Outdoor section of Walmart ( 2 packs for $ 4.00 , Cole brand ) I took one star away from this product because of the ignition system . It does n't work too well and it SHOCKS you ... woohoo ... watch out ! be careful ! ( So I use a match instead :) Cleaning up is a pain too :( The other reviewer suggested to start the gas WITH THE LID OFF in order to avoid the BOOM but instead , you 'll get a pretty nice flare coming up . ( ca n't win ) Overall , not a bad portable grill at all .
5 #### I just needed a cheap collet nut - I put the dremel flex shaft on my non = dremel tool and the collet nut is the right thread but too long ... so I needed a dremel collet . This whole set up was cheap and came with the extra vise pieces . Ca n't beat it
4 #### I ordered this hose to use with a dehumidifier . The concerns I have with it are that it does not look like the image for the product . The hose I received was green and did not have the plastic female connector . Besides that it seems like it will work fine .
5 #### They are easy and comfortable to use . We have two . My little boy uses one to help clean veggies , and he is always excited to use it .
5 #### I am very pleased with this product . The assembly instructions were clear , it was in perfect condition , everything is straight and it is heavy enough for me not to worry about it moving around while using my router . The ProLift Router Adjustment System fits perfectly along with my Porter Cable Router making this a complete system . After I have used this for a while , I will add to my review .
3 #### Nice concept , but my house finch and other small birds outside wo n't eat from it ... But if I knock out seeds to the ground the morning doves will eat .
4 #### I bought this mainly to cut sheet steel for tool drawers , etc . They are built well , and feel very solid . It takes some practice to work well . My experience is that it seems to be this way for any electric metal shear . They cut in a straight line very well , but sometimes seem to hang up for some reason , especially on curves . They always have lots of power , but sometimes it takes some force to push it through the material , and sometimes it does n't . It certainly helps to clamp your metal to a workbench . This is the only reason I did n't get it five stars . The dual cutting action ( on both sides ) really limits the warpage , which is great . On pieces smaller than 2 " wide , the warpage is practically non - existant , and _ much _ reduced from my Bosch single action shear . The only problem with the dual cutting action is that it is more difficult to make an inside corner cut . I think I will keep both a single and dual action shear on hand for this reason . It is more difficult to cut in a curve . It seems to hang up more when I do this , but most likely it 's just me getting used to the angle they prefer , etc . It cuts thick aluminum like butter , but has a harder time making curves in the thicker stuff . Overall though , they are very solid and make cutting metal something very easy Vs . hand powered shears . I would n't go back !
4 #### The spinner is easy to operate and very durable . However , I often have to spin my lettuce longer because it does n't get all the water off the first time .
5 #### High quality product . Will cut 1 inch branches with no problem . Just the right size for your wife to use . Recommend it .
4 #### Gave it 4 - stars , not 5 , because I think the " value " part is poor . Air filters for residential HVAC systems are not new technology . The are not made with precious or rare materials . They are not in short supply . Yet they are priced as if they were cutting edge technology using NASA compounds to filter the air and only produced in limited quantities . Why ? Because 3 M can , and because we pay . Do they filter dust , pollen , smoke , microbes out of the air as advertised ? Darned if I know . But after 4 - 5 months when I remember to change the 3 - filters in my home , they 're covered in some grey powder - like stuff I guess they filtered out of the air . No idea what it is .
5 #### Bought these because we live in a rural area where bugs are so abundant they set up schools and shopping malls under our couch and under our cabinets . I inspected these traps after a week and every manner of bug and spider , including scorpions , were found inside . These work so well I have ordered four more sets .
4 #### This is a simple timer that works well . There are two on / off groupings ( so your device will switch on and off twice in a 24 hour period ) , which I like . Our lights come on in the evening and turn off just after we go to bed . They come on again in the morning and shut off when we leave for work . There is a simple override switch that will not interupt the cycle if you want to turn on your device at a time outside of the " on " period . The device is a " wall wart " and if you have another plug that is even a bit over - sized , you will not be able to plug both into a normal wall outlet . For instance , we can not plug our vacuum cleaner into the outlet in which this device is plugged . My only major gripe is that if I 'm sitting in the room at night reading a book or doing something else quite , it sounds like I 'm sitting inside a clock tower ( the timer mechanism if very loud ) .
5 #### Perfect for the Orioles . Only took them a couple days to find it , but they had been eating at my hummingbird feeders . The problem I had was if I took the bee guards off the hummingbird feeders , the bees would swarm . If I left them , the Orioles could n't eat . This is perfect . Yes a few bees come around but not enough to discourage the Orioles .
4 #### Same response as above but I will be spreading on a large area of standing water for which have used the pellets before with satisfactory success . This time I will use the granules as it be much easier just to cast them on the body of standing water .
5 #### I love all of the products I buy from OXO , this peeler is sharp and it fits my hand perfect . The tip will dig out eyes on potatoes . I recommend this brand
5 #### Easy to use . Just take it out of the box , apply enclosed mosquito attractant , hang it up , and plug it in .
5 #### Covers a decent sized circle . Worked very well . Put it on a very dry lawn , and ran it for an hour . The next day , I could see a large green circle in my lawn where the water coverage was . Did very well at resuscitating my lawn . The only issue I have with it is that my golden retriever LOVES it a bit too much , and went after one of the sprayers . She partially broke it , but to its credit , it still works fine . I do n't hold this against the sprinkler , as I would never expect it to hold up like a dog toy .
5 #### Great value for such a fine product , as all the Amco mixing bowls are the highest quality . This " 2 - qt . " size is about the size of a large cereal bowl . It 's sturdy and has a half - inch lip which makes it easy to hold and can be used for anything . I doubled up on the 4- and 6 - qt . sizes . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ CAVEAT : However , if you 're measuring , this bowl comfortably holds 1.5 - quarts of liquid volume , which translates into 1.29 - quarts of dry volume . If you need accurate [ liquid ] volumes for mixing bowls , buy the Tovolo , Roscan , or Cook Pro brands . ( The kitchen industry is riddled with these measuring inaccuracies . ) Or just move up one size and get the Roscan or Cook Pro Stainless Steel 3 - qt . bowl -- they 're exactly the same . It 's accurate and a sufficient size that handles most any job short of the need for a 6 - qt . bowl .
5 #### I never thought I 'd be so passionate about a can opener , but holy smokes , this is the best can opener ever ! I have arthritis and some days have really limited hand strength . This opens cans so easily and smoothly , it 's a miracle for someone with hand pain . Totally worth the money , I 'm buying one for all of my other # spoonie friends for Xmas .
5 #### Like most people , I found this product easy to work with and install . Took me 30 minutes because I had a minor problem with my shut off valve , other wise I suspect it was a 10 or 15 min job , 3 of that reading the instructions . There are YouTube videos that will bolseter your confidence as well . If I had to replace two or three a week , I could get it to less than 5 minutes I think . Worked perfectly on the first flush ; even caught the fill line right on the nose without a second adjustment , though adjustment is super easy . A great choise for the lazy , those lacking self confidence in plumbing , or just plain cheap . Good buy .
5 #### These are fantastic : Sturdy and easy to read . I love the halfway line in every cup --- it comes in so handy when you 're halving recipes fit to feed 10 people .
1 #### I tried over five times to open and close the pressure cooker . After much physical pressure and twisting and turning it finally opened . When closing the same process . As an owner of several pressure cookers for many , many years , I 've never experienced this before . The product will be returned . This is very unusual for a presto , I own many of them . Never had this happened before .
5 #### It 's been fun to change up the loaf shape and once I started using this my husband said he preferred the smaller slices it makes . I always use parchment paper so ca n't address the seasoning and non - stick issues . I use it for no - knead bread . I refridgerate the dough before I bake it , then put cold dough in the cold baker in a cold oven , turn it to 475 and when it reaches that temp turn it down to 450 and bake covered for 20 minutes . Then uncover and bake another 25 or 30 , depending on amount of dough . I also bump the flour to 4 cups ( and the other ingredients accordingly ) for a slightly bigger , fuller , loaf .
5 #### It 's a Oxo cooking tool some of the best tools for cooking ..
5 #### I needed a good boning knife and this one fits the bill . I used it on a chicken and it cut through like it was butter .
5 #### Have owned it for about 6 months . Used it countless times . Spins beautifully , works perfectly . I can now take my salads to work for lunch without getting them soggy by the time I eat them . To have it function better , place it on a flat surface before spinning it . The larger bowl can be used for other purposes in the kitchen and so can be the sieve .
5 #### Does what it 's supposed to do ... ( Honest to God , I ca n't believe I have to write something just to give stars . There 's not much to say about products like this . They 're either faulty , or they work . Nuff said . )
4 #### It 's a good sized ball . Fits more than enough tea leaves for a good sized cup . The hinge worries me the most but I 'm careful and gently hand wash , pat dry , and put up immediately after I use it . So far no worries !
5 #### Not sure how to convince someone reading these reviews that this is a good tool . It 's a speed square and it does what all other speed squares do .
5 #### These are of a much better quality than the insert that came with my Jessem router lift . I bought these to use with a 1 3/8 brass bushing but the bit is slightly off center . Not sure if it is the bushing , insert or the router lift ..... Anyway I was impressed with their quality and am glad I bought them !
5 #### Got for myGranddaughter and she loves the versitality of it , she uses it for all sorts of things . and good Qualit
5 #### Easier to use and clean up for small jobs . I do n't need to take out the big food processor for the small amounts , plus it is mostly dishwasher safe .
5 #### Adding one of these to my nephew 's collection of track pieces was a huge help in making more complex layouts . Fits perfectly with Brio tracks .
1 #### it will accommodate only the smallest of potato,3 " long at the most & is very hard to push the potato thru . Would not buy again . Ann(((((Progressive Vegetable / French Fry Cutter ( Purchased on 10/27/2009 )
4 #### This is a neat idea , if one can figure out the exact range or scope of wetness you desire . My kids and I have had our share of range - testing and degree of how fast one can move before becoming the object of the spray . Have fun !
5 #### I purchased this blade for my elderly Skilsaw . I have a very small shop and have to cut sheet goods outside , under the carport , before I can get them into my basement shop . I 've always had to cut my piece 's oversized and then trim them on the table saw to get nice finished edges , but this blade gives me a nice finished edge without the extra steps . I have used it on Oak veneer ply and melamine sheets and the chip out is very , very minimal and stalling and binding are non existant . I understand that the teflon coated version of this blade is even better . I find that hard to believe as this little blade is simply amazing . This is the third Freud saw blade I have purchased and they all perform beyond my expectations . I also use Freud blades on my table saw and miter saw . I highly recommend this blade to anyone needing nice cuts with a small saw .
4 #### this ark is made pretty good and I like the grapics . I just wish everything was n't made in China . Would like to see more made in USA products .
4 #### I bought this little grill from Amazon in 2007 and use frequently in the summer and on the road in the winter while rv - ing in the desert . I am basically pleased with the performance and quality . However my particular grill does not grill evenly and I find it necessary to rotate items . My friend has exactly the same grill that maintains perfect consistency ! To light the grill requires several tries and then it lights with a flash that is scary . I have tried moving the igniter closer to the burner with - out success . If conditions are at all breezy you can not operate on low . I have an aluminum surround that works great to keep the wind away . It is not perfect but I believe this grill is the best available for the price . I own 2 other grills and a smoker , all Weber . After 5 years of use I am still pleased with the grills performance . I have corrected the lighting problem by treaking the igniter location and the uneven heating by replacing the burner . On breezy days the burner needs to be on med or higher to remain lit . The handle can get hot after extended use on high . The grill still cleans up to like new and there is minimum corrosion of the internal components . Highly recommended !
5 #### I had one of these for years , same Lufkin brand , and it served me well until recently I got stupid , careless and did n't pay attention and broke it . This one seems sturdy and as well made as my last one so I hope it lasts me as long . The markings are distinct and easy to read , it folds and unfolds easily and stays firm but the slide is pretty tight and stiff . I extended it and ran a bar of soap down the slot , it 's better but still a bit tight and I anticipate it will probably loosen more with use over time . I 'm satisfied .
4 #### I bought two , one is in my car and one is on the sofa . Though it is not big enough for me(for children ) no matter when it is a pillow or a quilt , I love it . It is very cute .
5 #### Works as advertised , great has kept the rabits and deer away from the garden . I would strongly recommend this product to anyone who has pest problems in the garden or yard .
1 #### This is the first OXO product to disappoint me . Normally their stuff is good quality and lasts well . The handle came off after 7 months . It had probably been used less than two dozen times and had not been abused . I 'll still buy other OXO products but I 'm replacing the can opener with a different brand .
3 #### Like the way it keeps the angle but the tightening brass knob is to big for nail bag holder Its ok
4 #### Very efficient and easy to use . I use it as a time saver to flush cut in tight places . The pull really cuts deep .
5 #### I love it . Just the right size and really comfortable in the hand . I should have bought more and used them for stocking stuffers .
5 #### They fit great in my hand , are easy to use , perfect for gardening , deadheading , flower cutting . Absolutely I would recommend these to any gardener !
5 #### I have this on my stove everyday , it hold 2 - 3 utensil 's I love to cook and I can not be with out it . So nice that I ordered it twice ! And the delivery was quick thank you very much . I am very happy with my purchase better than the OGGI spoon rest for sure .
5 #### This saw is used for fine detail woodworking . It comes with 2 blades , so the first thing on your shopping list should be more blades , as these blades are very thin and can be broken easily . It can be mounted to a workbench but purchasing the stand gives you much more mobility
5 #### Great value and free shipping the colorful finches are already chowing down very nice the see the colorful birds attracted to the food .
5 #### I bought this as a gift for my brother , the frustrated home chef . He always brings his knives to holiday events as he feels none of us own quality knives . So now , rather than carrying them wraped in a bath towel , he has a proper knife wrap . It 's been two years and the wrap looks fantastic and holds up well . The variety of knives this wrap can carry makes me think it would be good for a professional as well as a home cook
5 #### This attachment is just what I needed for getting in those tight spaces with my Dremel . Pay attention to the break - in procedure ( only two minutes ) which is critical . The thing I really like is that I can adjust the speed with one hand and use the flex attachment with the other . I bought mine to cut off a broken bolt in a tight spot with a diamond cutter ( sold separately ) . The thing I noticed , though , is that I no longer need to compensate for the gyroscopic forces from the motor of the Dremel when doing finer work . Methinks I will use this a lot .
3 #### I bought this potato masher because of the positive reviews in the Cook 's Illustrated magazine . Well , it 's mashing better than spoon and fork , but it still leaves more lumps than I would like . Handle is a bit too short for me . It 's not especially better than any other average potato masher . I 'm planning to get a potato ricer and do n't think I 'll be using this tool much after that .
5 #### I ca n't complain about this product . Everything that I have ever gotten from oxo is great quality and design . One great feature is that the spatula head is removable for east cleaning .
5 #### Well made and finished . I have used this for making beans and this is the only way go . This speeds up cooking time and cooks many things better . I recommend this pressure cooker .
5 #### I purchased this pressure cooker in 1998 and never had any problems with it . I especially like it on an induction range . Nice size , great for barbecued chicken . I mostly use it for brown rice , roasts , etc . I found Lorna Sass cookbooks helpful , with six pressure cooking books , I have n't looked for any recently . This is well built , Swiss quality . I do n't understand the problems some people have had , I used to have an old style pressure cooker with hot spots . This is something you will enjoy for a long time .
4 #### I purchased 2 of the 24 Gallon size , one to use as an emergency medical supply container and one to utilize as a portable survival ( bug out ) box . I found that the 24 gallon size is plenty large enough for each of my intended uses , I kept my items limited to what was most basic and necessary and I still have room for some additional items . I am pleased that I got the 24 gallon size for my purposes because even when they are packed I can still lift them and they are easily transportable , I would think a larger size container that was packed may be too heavy to handle without help . I have posted some pictures , they have hard plastic handles that snap into position and they have a place for you to lock then . Sturdy enough construction and appear to be rugged and durable .
1 #### Worthless product . Bought march 2014 , placed in charger which is new and installed in a motorhome . Flashlight has never been used . Discovered June 2015 that will not hold a charge at all . So got no use from product at all and First Web Sales hides behind the one year warranty .
5 #### Excellent . I got zapped and there is no question once / is enough ! The true test will be if it lasts ?
3 #### The stakes were purchased to help prop garden plants . for the most part they were effective , but given their low price , they were obviously not as strong as I had hoped . If you are willing to put up with a few that break or wo n't go in the ground , this is not a bad buy , and I would recommend them as an inexpensive way to quickly prop plants .
4 #### We love hummingbirds and my husband found that buying this mix and making it were so much cheaper as he is always changing the nectar .
3 #### Cute graphics , large placemat ... But , as other viewers have mentioned , it slides all over the place
5 #### It looks weird to most american kitchens . A beaker , you say ? But once you use it -- you 'll never go back . Ever . I measure things and then shake to mix . Great for drinks , but also especially for cooking . Alton Brown on the TV Show Good Eats uses a similar one ( not sure if they are the same ) . Pouring is a snap . Measuring is a snap . A godsend for anyone whose hands shake too much to pour into a small spoon , or measuring cup that might tip over on the counter . Its sturdy base assures free - standing pouring , even for those of us with carpal tunnel or other folk of uncertain hand movements . Once I used this , I found that many other tools became replaced . It has some classy looks going on too -- nice as well as functional .
5 #### I bought this based on so many positive reviews . But when I loaded it with sunflower seeds , the holes seemed too small for the seeds . But I just hung it out anyway o see what would happen and it took about 15 minutes and 2 chickadees were on it already . A blue jay came and landed on the shepherds pole and looked it over , but flew off . If I know anything about jays , when he sees the other birds on it , he 'll be back . It 's super sturdy , and I really like how the top lifts off and swings down making it easy to fill it .
5 #### This Bundt pan I gave to a friend for her birthday and we baked a chocolate cake in it right away - I love the handles and it 's the right weight ( not too light ) so that stuff does n't burn in it . And it has a lifetime warranty
5 #### seem sturdy . i do n't see myself having any reason to dock a star , a pretty simple tool built the way it should be .
4 #### Good product , just make sure you have large enough trash bags ito fit it if you intend to bad its contents .
4 #### Have not used them for a real task yet , but I can see already that they probably wo n't be pinching / injuring my hand like my old cheap - o pliers have always done .
3 #### I was hoping to get the latest version of this product but I did n't . I received an older version with the plastic lift legs . I read a review from here that said the company changed the design and replaced them with metal lift legs . Oh well , I hope that what I received will last . The only other issues I have are 1 . The instructions are n't worth crap . Be prepared to sit down with a few beers to figure this jig saw puzzle out . 2 . Mounting this to the base of my Ryobi 3000 table saw was a bear and needed two people to do it . Not a one man job . As far as doing what it is suppose to do , ( that is to roll around ) it works fine . The main reason for the three stars is mainly for the lack of usable assembly instructions .
4 #### Great everyday steak knives . They hold their edges well enough for most uses and are pretty tough . Never hand any issues with handles nor blades . This is my second set . First set 10 + years old and still going strong ( dishwasher and all ) .
5 #### Soft and flexible , works great on my Teflon coated pans !
5 #### The only heater that made my 90 year old mother happy
1 #### Bought this hose to be used with a utility pump I purchased in the same order . They claim that it would not collapse when drawing water into the pump ( The sides would be stiff ) . Well when I got the hose it was already collapsed and flat from shipping before using and it was a very cheap piece of hose and cheap fittings , not like the picture ( I know that they say colors may vary but I thought the quality would be the same as pictured . ) Would send back but not worth the effort .... Threw it out ... and bought a cheap 50 ' hose for $ 9.95 at Lowes and a hose repair connector ... cut it to 15 ' clamp on the connector and works great . Still have 35 ' left to make more if needed . Buyer beware .
4 #### This is not a top - quality product , but it is a very reasonable price . Value is therefore high . Fittings seem cheaply made , the rug function is marginal , and the hose is about as thin / delicate as I 've seen . But suction is outstanding - easily the equal of some larger and heavier canister vacuums here . And noise level is surprisingly low for the power . A good buy for the small apartment , dorm , office , or to have around wherever a small , light vaccum is often needed .
5 #### Works well , no problems , works as advertised with no real negative . I like the coating on it , compared with the cheaper version- helps make it easier to turn + less hot if in sun .
1 #### Great clamps . Only reason one star is there is a quantity limit . Why ? ? ? ? Do n't know but you can only order a one time of 5 clamps ... stupid . Had to go buy more at a local store for the same price . Drop the limit and you 'd have 5 stars .
5 #### I have purchased and installed two of these and both have been good quality .
4 #### It works great for what I use it for . I cook the chicken for my dog . It cooks the bones so they disintegrate with the chicken . That way you can feed the bones with the chicken not wasting anything .
5 #### Better than any I 've seen ! automatic open handle is a new standard . Much more ergonomic than my farberware . I love it . .... Do n't fret ; they 're ALL made in China , unfortunately .....
5 #### When I got this I was surprised at how well made and detailed it was . Could n't believe it for the price . It is for a key chain I am making for a relative . I have not seen one like it in the stores and am very happy with the quality .
5 #### Paired with the Freud SD208 Dado set , this little baby helps make a clean cut . Pops in real easy , and levels easy with four adjustment screws .
2 #### According to the manufacturer , these fit a Bostitch brad nailer model SB1850BN , which I have . I ordered these up , but they definitely do n't fit . I ended up having to nail my floor down by hand , which took a hell of a lot longer , and left me scared that I 'd miss the nail and ruin a board with a hammer dent . So , I 'm sure they 're a good product , if you happen to have a nailer that they 'll work in .
5 #### Works as a charm and great to use as a guide for my scrolling saw .
5 #### Finally , a can opener that actually works every time . Very easy on the hands , is well balance and well made . I will buy one of these for my motorhome also .
5 #### I previously bought&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Hoover - Tempo - Widepath - Upright - Vacuum - Bagged / dp / B0009ONZ8G / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Hoover Tempo Widepath Upright Vacuum , Bagged</a>&nbsp;about two years ago . It stopped working one day and I took the base apart to discover a belt had broken . Seems like most people throw perfectly good vacuum away for just a broken belt , and this fixed the issue easily . Most belts wear out over time- a few - dollar fix verses throwing away an entire vacuum should be a no brainer !
4 #### I ordered two of these because I 'm always losing them . I have no idea where they disappear to . Anyway , these are really handy ( when they 're to hand ) . Basic , yet very functional and the price is right .
5 #### This remote control worked perfect especially since the door opener is 28 years old and I did not think that I would be able to find a replacement unit .
4 #### Bought two hooks for my ladder to get on my VERY steep roof . They go together easily enough and hold . Could use a bit longer carriage bolt to hold the wheels onto the step better . As far as using , I felt much more safe going up and down the ladder with these hooks attached . I plan on adding some padding to the angle iron piece just to make sure I 'm not putting holes in my shingles . I have to mention , just as previous purchasers have , make sure you attach together both pieces of the extending ladder ( moving piece to lower piece ) . If you do n't the lower piece will slide out from under the extending piece because the hooks are ment to prevent movement in the opposite direction from what these hooks allow . I secured both pieces on mine before I used the hooks , and when I started to go up the ladder the lower piece moved slightly . Talk about giving your heart a shock !
5 #### Now get this , at the world 's biggest retail store 1 halogen G4 is $ 5 ( with tax ) . I got 10 of them via Cbconcept for $ 5 ! They work great so far . My old expensive one lasted about 13 months . We shall see how this goes . So far so good , 30 days into it .
5 #### Works well in my ikea lamps . Just be careful not to bend the leads .
5 #### I purchased another brand that did not perform like I wanted . This tool cut thru 1/2 " green limbs with very little effort . Keep them clean after use , they show stain if not .
2 #### You may want to check with the vendor about what exactly you 're getting before ordering this gauge : I purchased two because of the metric AND english gradations and the price was right - what I got was an inches - only gauge that did not have nearly the precision advertised . Heck , it was n't even the same shape or color as pictured !
5 #### I purchased this for my mother who loves to cook ( for everyone ) . She uses it and has never complained . It helps her cut the cost of using her oven . A good buy .
5 #### It is well designed for pop - overs . I made pop - overs for the first time and using this pan , they came out great and it was easy to clean .
5 #### Good product . Fast delivery . I will recommend it to my friends .
5 #### Though I normally would prefer a bypass style , this little hand pruner has convinced me about the anvil style . It has a built in ratchett that enables pruning of larger and tougher stems and branches as well . One caveat is that the ratcheting assembly is n't the strongest in the world , so caution should be taken not to over work this pruner .
5 #### I purchased the 3 - inch , 6 - inch and 8 - inch OXO strainers at the same time . I 'm posting this same review under each of the sizes . These are a quality product . They are well built and solid . It 's nice to have the various sizes to fit the need . The strainers likely will last a lifetime .
3 #### I used to find Freud , CMT , and Eagle router bits all to be good now I 'm taking Freud 's straight bit off my list . Even though they cut well I 've had several of these break on the first use . I am replacing this with an Eagle .
5 #### First impression is how well made they are . Thick and strong material . The tortillas come out perfectly and did not stick . Really makes a taco salad taste like , well , a taco salad .
5 #### I 've owned six splitting mauls of various brands and weights by far this is the best
5 #### needed a small hammer this is perfect for small tasks
5 #### As described . Had an intermittent problem with rats / opossum under my deck , which is 4 - 6 inches off the ground . This fabric proved to be light enough to work with in a confined area , yet sturdy enough to securely button up the access points . Had an intermittent problem with rats / opossum under my deck , which is 4 - 6 " above ground . This fence / fabric was light enough to work with in a confined area , yet sturdy enough to securely button up the access points / perimeter . Just what I needed . Just what I needed .
3 #### Its seal degraded after just a year and then stopped cooking ; I know it 's a replaceable part , but still , I expected it to last longer
4 #### I 'm impressed with what a good job these do cleaning without damaging non - stick coatings . I even use it on my regular cookware with good results . They seem to last too ; I have n't worn one out yet .
5 #### I have been building cabinets , rasied panels , bookcases , furniture , built - in shelves , wainscoting , and you name it for my home . I pride myself on accuracy and quality of workmanship like most people . It 's hard to imagine a " power " tool as being elegant , like say a Lie - Nielsen brass hand plane . But , this is one of those rare jewels . When I turned this sander on I was literally stunned at how smooth , quiet and effortless the sanding was . I just let it " float " along the wood using it 's own weight to do the work along with a fine sandpaper . This unit is perfectly balanced and produces truly flawless finishes . I have the Polished Aluminum Model called the 505H Heritage Model . I clean it up every time I 'm done , and I bought a special padded case for it to keep it pristine but useful . I can hardly believe I 'm writing so much about a sander but lets face it , when you 're all done building something , after the final sanding there is nothing like the tactile feel of silky smooth wood on a job well done . This tool will help you achieve that level . Hope that helps .
4 #### Easy to use and works well in getting rid of flies and little bugs like fruit flies .
5 #### Durable and with a great fan size , really cuts down on scrape time .
5 #### These are great sprout seeds . I appreciated the additional instructions they gave me by email as I 'd been having trouble growing other ones I 'd had . I 've been growing sprouts since the 70s , so it may have been the brand I was using because Todd 's were perfect . I 'll be sticking with this brand .
5 #### Works great for cleaning the inside of narrow mouthed Humming Bird feeder . Crimping the wire as described by another reviewer was very helpful .
5 #### Very economical at this size , and so my hummingbirds are well fed ! It was fresh , not clumped , but I did store it in an airtight container after opening .
5 #### Digging postholes are always difficult , but not with one of these . The holes do n't dig themselves , but they 're so much easier that you almost enjoy it . I start the hole with a regular posthole digger , place this in the started hole , apply a little pressure , turn this like a drill , and it just works it 's way right down . You can dig an 18 " to 24 " hole in red clay in a matter of minutes . Wish I had bought one of these years ago .
5 #### Very soft and well made , I 've stacked , split tons of wood wearing these , and they hold up
4 #### This replaced a FluidMaster valve that a plumber installed in 2009 and he charged me $ 139 for the installation . Very easy to do if you 've never done this before , do n't be afraid and save a lot of money ! It took me 10 minutes only because the plumber had tightened the FluidMaster so much it was hard to get the water line and the mounting nut loose . The Korky is easy to adjust for height but at first I thought it was defective because the slightest push and it would collapse . I had to yank it very hard to get it to firmly lock into place for the correct height and just for extra safety measures I inserted the white " landlord tamper - proof key " . The tube is very long so more than likely you need to cut it with scissors and shorten it . Do n't just stick the tube down the overflow pipe . The clip to attach to the pipe is included but it 's hard to push into the tube . This one does seem a lot quieter than the FluidMaster but it also takes a few seconds more to fill after flushing .
1 #### I love most OXO kitchen products , but I am tossing this one ! The wire is just too loose ! Somehow , I ended up with both this one and the Cuisipro around the same time . I put the OXO in our trailer , thinking that it might be tolerable for limited use . However , during our recent trip to Tillamook and Rogue River ( " Cheese Land " ) , the decision was made to buy a second Cuisipro . Although twice as expensive , the Cusipro has kept a nice tight wire , while the OXO wire cheese slicer is so loose ( even after attempted tightening ) that I just decided life is too short ...
5 #### Holds the edge very well . Super replacement blade . I bought an expensive blade for a spare and the Stanley performs just as well so I could have saved some money had I bought two Stanley 's .
5 #### It is quite " BIG " but it should last for quite a while
5 #### This knob worked great for my older Ryobi model 132r electric trimmer . In fact , had I waited much longer to replace it I might not have been able to get the old knob off -- there was only about 1/3 " of knob remaining ! But once you get a grip on it , it 's easy to unscrew the old knob and thread on the new one . All the other parts on the head of the trimmer looked fine , just the knob needed to be replaced . I used it last weekend and it worked fine !
4 #### Perfect reading light for my daughter 's bed . Adjustable arm stays where you put it , and it has two levels of brightness .
1 #### - When I first received my Magnet , it was easy to unpack and set up . I charged that battery , installed the propane and fired it up ! WOW ! It works ! Mosquitos were flocking to it ! First tank lasted a few weeks . Second propane tank installed . - What ? Ran for two days then stopped . OK , instructions say " Reset " the valve / system . Done . Ran 1 day . Reset again . Ran 2 days . Well , let me pull taht tank and put it on my grill to see if the tank is bad . Grill works fine . Tank must be fine . I 'll get a new tank anyway . - New tank installed . Reset system again just for good measure . Ran for 2 days . 2 more days . 1 day . Etc . - Called an acquiantance who has two of these units . He initially told me about them . Turns out , he 's been haggling with the manufacturer because one of his Liberty units is doing the exact same thing ! I ca n't recommend or not recommend a Magnet , but I can say that when they work , there is nothing better ! Mosquito problems disappear . I guess we 're always trading one set of problems for another .
5 #### Good quality and low price but I do wish these could be made in the USA .
5 #### Item is as advertised . I have one for myself and bought this for a friend . She will enjoy it . Great place to store a warm wet tea bag neatly at the table .
5 #### its awesome quality and has been a great companion for my tea !
5 #### I had one and lost it in the garage or lent it to someone , this is a replacement item . Great for spraying chemical around the property .
5 #### I love this brush to scrub my sweet potatoes and boy do they come clean !
5 #### Who ever thought you could get a roll of wire fence delivered to your mailbox ! Arrived on time and worked fine .
4 #### This feeder really works well , it is large and holds a lot of food , I generally only have to fill it once a week despite lots of birds . The other advantage of the dipper is that the larger birds like crows and doves have a lot of trouble raiding the feeder . Its not completely crow proof and I had go to safflower seed until they left after a month , but generally works well . My only complaint is that it is a little clumsy to refill and very heavy to rehang on the hook . Generally well made and holds up well . It is a little on the expensive side but after having the squirrels trash two previous feeders it was worth the money . winter 2013 update the feeder is still going strong and still is squirrel proof . The squirrels now no longer bother to try and raid my feeder , they go after my neighbors . every once in a while they will try and watching them slip slide away is fun . They have tried to chew the lid off and while it is marred from the effort still hangs on . The only real wear that shows is some weathering of the polycarbonate tube and the latch assembly for the cover is a little bent and requires some care to get back in place . Generally could not be more pleased with this purchase it has lasted well for over 4 years now , the squirrels ca nt get at it and the birds like it
5 #### Between the Scarecrow and an electric fence , and my gun maybe I can get a few tomatoes , and a mess or two of green beans . If not , fruit stand here I come .
5 #### I can now use my small bottles on my larger propane appliances . Good enough for me !
5 #### super i can bbq allllll day and not break my delicate back moving around a 20 lb bottle . more bugrz , more dawgz = more beers n ' babez A+
5 #### Outstanding quality . However , I 've seen an Empire set that was even better for around $ 40 . I put that in my cart , but did n't attempt to buy until a couple days later - price went back up to $ 84 dollars . However , this Johnson set was I think $ 15 or $ 20 . For the money , you just ca n't beat that . The bubble vials are fully encased in plastic - do n't think they will ever break or get knocked out of plumb . Overall , very pleased with this purchase .
1 #### Well this thing did n't work the first time I used it . I read the directions , followed the pictures but still the steam came out the sides and then the chicken was burnt when I turned it off . I 'll try again with some beef the next time . It looks just like the picture .
4 #### Just what I was looking for . I broke the one that was in my apartment when I first moved in and have n't replaced it . This was perfect and it was nice because it was less dated and tacky than the one that was here before me . ( It had ugly flowers on it ) .
5 #### This is a very durable blade . I 've had an Edge Hog for 12 years , and have only " needed " to replace the blade every five years . My home is on a large corner lot , so I have a lot of sidewalk to cover . Plus , I also use the Edge Hog to trench along where my flower garden meets the grass of the yard . My practice is to edge about twice a month , from March through October , so the blade sees a fair amount of use . Could I change the blade more often ? Sure ... and frankly probably ought to just to save on edging time when the blade is wearing down . It 's easy enough to do . And then you 've got to figure it 'd be only about $ 2.25 a year or so in blade costs --- less than the cost of cup of drip coffee at the local coffee shop . Okay --- I think I just talked myself into changing the blade every FOUR years . Cheap and easy time saving effort . :-) Durable product . Great price .
4 #### I used this product to smoke a beef brisket in my electric smoker . The chips burned even an smoked very well . Great aroma and hickory smoke taste . The chips were slightly larger than chips I 've used in the past , but it did n't seem to make much of a difference at the end of the day . The flavor of the chips was slightly stronger than other brand chips I 've used in recent past . I would purchase these chips again .
5 #### This is an excellent pan . I borrowed my neighbor 's stoneware bundt pan and liked the way it worked . However , the pan had a rancid smell to it . This Nordic Ware pan performs just as well and cleans up easily . Follow the instructions . Lightly grease and flour the pan before you pour the batter in . When you pull the cake from the oven set your timer for 10 minutes . Flip over the pan when the timer goes off and the cake slips right out . Then wash the pan out with a non - abrasive sponge or dish cloth and dry the pan out and put it away . Store the pan upside down so that you are n't tempted to nest inside any other pan or implement , which might scratch the interior pan surface .
5 #### Take care of your top and it will take care of you . A little thicker than some , heats up pool well .
5 #### It has both standard markings and decimal marks on it . Both are in standard english units . I use this for work all the time and it fits perfectly in my pocket . I no longer have to try to figure out that 7/16 is just above 0.4 " . I would recommend .
5 #### Great charger , performs exactly as claimed and it 's well designed meaning ... It will only tie up one plug in the wall . Charges Android and Apple without any odd message and it does it quickly . I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review
5 #### I am asked to review many things~~ & usually I do n't bother to reply , but this time I want to . This is the best can opener I have ever used . Ever ! ! It is comfortable for the hand , operates smoothly , leaves no sharp edges and~~~well , it 's just a wonderful product . Very well designed ...
5 #### About 20 years ago , an ex - girlfriend gave me a Smokey Joe Charcoal Grill . We used to do a lot of camping and she thought it would improve the campground facilities grill . Well , it did that for certain . In addition , I 've gotten a lot of household use out of it . I always use charcoal as a fuel . I always let the coals get into just the right gray condition then apply the meats , etc . I always grill with the cover on . It takes a sense of timing to know when the dinner is done , but that comes with experience . Yum ! I 've prepared some really memorable barbecues on this thing ! Lamb chops are my favorite ! Steaks can be outstanding . Chicken , oh yes ! The trick is getting them done to perfection and I 'm getting pretty good at it according to my guests . Well , it 's been about two decades , but the legs are now rusting off where they fit onto the bowl . Alas , it 's time for a new Smokey Joe . I 've had so much good luck with this nifty little grill that I 'm going to get the same thing again . I know , I know , my friends have big fancy gas grills etc . , but they do n't produce anything any better than this little wizard . Plus , it 's so easy to keep clean and you can just store it outside . Did I mention that it 's portable ? Nifty unit . Well worth the money . Gary Peterson
5 #### This carving set is just as described , and met my expectations well . The set is indeed very professional , and would probably serve the needs of a true professional chef . Yes , I would recommend this product highly . Oh , and it also came in a truly nice carving box lined in red . Nice to be able to store it safely in the drawer .
5 #### Wo n't be using it outdoors , but I can see where it might crack / rip ... the material is pretty thin . It covers my pressure washer and is great for indoor storage though .
5 #### This is a very nice box - almost exactly what I expected . I do n't know if other manufacturers do this , but mine came without a separate ground bar . To the uninitiated this might not be a problem since ground must be bonded with neutral on a main panel . But as a " main lug only " configured box ( no main breaker ) you would think / assume a box of this size and type would be used as a subpanel - WHERE GROUND AND NEUTRAL MUST BE SEPARATED . The novice might make a very dangerous mistake by combining ground and neutral in his / her subpanel , since there 's nothing in the instructions , pictures or descriptions ( Amazon included ) that indicates a ground bar , if needed , must be purchased separately - like this one&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Siemens - EC2GB152 - Ground - Bar - Kit - with-15 - Terminal - Positions - and - a - Ground - Lug / dp / B007ZZGSQI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Siemens EC2GB152 Ground Bar Kit with 15 Terminal Positions and a Ground Lug</a > . The good news is the neutral bar is separated from contact with the panel by means of a plastic mount - so adding the ground bar is no big deal . Beware if this purchase is for a subpanel ! ! Would recommend to friends and family with the caveat about proper configuration ...
5 #### This is the easiest way to fertilize house plants , with excellent results - my plants started growing and blooming within just a few weeks .
3 #### I have used this templete for awhile , it works but the accuracy of it is not very good . Each templete is a little different in height from the each other which gives you different depths of cut . The one that is off the most is the fourth one I needed to buy . The hinge setting pivot that adjust the width of your door is very loose and some keep falling off their pivot . It is made with a cheap little rivot that does not hold up to use at all . I have heard the older models where better and that they cut back and made newer cheaper ones . It could be a lot better , I was almost thinking of making my own templetes that would be more reliable and accurate . Its hard to beleive that they would sell this on the open market . I have used the Porta - cable , even thou the Bosch is easyer to set up the porta - cable is built a lot better .
5 #### I love my pressure cooker ! I had one for 25 years finally bought a new one , but like the older one better .
3 #### The unit works very well but if you want to pull it with a John Deere mower , the rear basket tilts up so much it clogs the brushes . Being a retired engineer from the metal working trade , I was able to modify the hitch on my JD mowers to effectively raise the hitch point up 3 inches . Now the rear of the unit is much closer to the ground allowing the clippings to pile up in the rear of the bag as intended . The fabrication to raise the hitch point 3 inches took me about 4 hours using scrap metal . If you run JD mowers and are not capable of the hitch mods -- then do n't buy it .
5 #### These are Awesome.have it hanging on the wall with a lantern .
5 #### Line works well and I did n't have to go and get it .
1 #### Did n't work and I sent it back . Maybe an issue with the particular unit I received ... However , even maybe , I might suggest buying the General Tools & Instruments MMD4E Moisture Meter instead for about the same money .
5 #### I just tested 9 oscillating sprinklers at my house and the only ones that survived more than a year were Melnor . This one was the oldest at three years . I looked at the one star reviews and noticed that most of them were for last year . Maybe more people are reviewing or maybe quality as decreased . Nonetheless , I like the weight on this one and trust the Melnor brand so I 'm ordering another one .
5 #### Worth every cent ! Great for everything from little branches to small trees . Glad I bought them !
5 #### This line , with its edging design , cuts cleanly and is tenacious enough to save you bucks in the long run , I use about two spools on four acres cleaning the property about four times , on average . Other lines would cost me another spool , plus .
5 #### It seems , from all the other reviews , that I may have gotten one of the few good broiler sets ! I 've been using mine for years and nothing has flaked off nor has anything rusted , and it 's easy to clean . Though it is a little small for my toaster oven , it nevertheless works great when I only want to cook enough for 2 people .
5 #### Very cute image and stamps nicely . It is a little small , but I do n't care . I am a cat lady .
4 #### These are pretty good kitchen shears . My only real complaint is that the red plastic button fell off within a week or so . This is purely decorative , as far as I can tell , so not a big deal -- still , too bad that they could n't have done a better job pasting that on .
5 #### The first one of these was so great , it was well worth it to get a second for another area . The quick connect is a real plus for various garden chores . Long lasting and reliable .
5 #### Very good planter for the small gardener . I only have so many bend overs left in my back and this product has sure saved a few .
5 #### These magnetic catches work as advertised . I used two of them to secure the doors of a basement cabinet I made and they'v held up fine for over two months .
5 #### I was very hesitant to purchase this product this past christmas after reading the reviews here on Amazon . My mother had wanted one for awhile , but always thought they were well over $ 100 . I found a refurbished one ( which further made me worry , wondering why Amazon had so many refurbs if the product was reliable ) , and decided to give it a try . They have been nothing but happy with it since I gave it to them . It has been used almost every day since Christmas 2003 , and they have not had one problem . Cleaning takes a little more time than a regular maker , but they say it is well worth it for how fresh the coffee tastes . Just remember ... 90 % of people who post reviews are those who had problems . Most people without problems never think to bother . Update - 12/9/08 - Apparently it finally died about 3 months ago , so it made it through 5 years of almost daily use . My parents loved it so much they bought another one . I 'd still give it 5 stars . The main reason I think these do break now and then is because you do have to take a couple minutes every time you use the grind feature and clean it out . My parents did that , but I can certainly see a lot of people getting lazy and not cleaning it every time .
5 #### A bit on the premature side , for not presently having a need for the thing , I must have total faith that it 'll work as designed if & when it 's called to duty . ;-)
2 #### i used better cooker than this . it is simple & small . but any other ones can be small & light , I use it almost everyday to make every thing ( meat , veggie daal curries etc ) .sometimes does n't cook properly . needs a lot of water otherwise burns food . Very difficult to tell when cooking is done . ill eventually going to throw it away one of these days . Look for a better cooker ,
5 #### Great visibility so less chance of cutting . Plug lights up to let you know electricity is going through . Great investment for winter or summer outdoor products .
5 #### I do a lot of garden pruning and I like these pruning shears by Fiskars because they can cut small clippings as well as larger branches . I rarely walk out into the yard without a pair of these pruning shears in my back pocket !
5 #### This is the best , most comfortable variable nozzle I have ever seen . Very comfortable to use , even for someone with arthritis . I bought more than one .
5 #### This was a replacement for one that was dented and showing its age . I love the ability to make only one cup of tea using loose teas . I think this is well worth the money .
5 #### Love it , keeps the neighborhood cats out of the backyard ; as well as a few friends who accidently walk within range . Do n't think the mailman likes it , as well as the neighbors when their mail is wet .
3 #### I really wanted to love this bowl . But I just do n't . It 's awkward , too deep for my hand mixer , and the handle is too heavy , making it fall over . It looks great , but I think it 's kind of a fail . :/
5 #### I just used these last night . I am making some decorations for my daughters shower and these worked really well with the bird seed .
4 #### We use this for camping to wash things off outside , including our sandy feet . It 's much more convenient Instead of having a long hose laying out at our campsite which can be tripped over , and can get muddy or dirty if it rains . This hose is also MUCH easier to pack away Seems to be durable enough so we expect to get a lot of use out of it . Glad we bought it !
5 #### Why waste energy to run the clock motor in the WH40 version when you can go electronic with this one ? You 'll have to replace backup battery once in a while but you 'll never have to reset the time of day after a power failure like you will with the clock version .
5 #### We bought this to experiment with making our own solar system to help heat the water in our excercise pool . It works great for what we wanted . All we needed was a pump to pull water out of the pool , circulate through black piping and flow back into the pool . It works and it was a cheap alternative to other types of pumps .
5 #### A sharp knife makes a difference . I never thought much about my knives since I was a casual cook . A renewed interest in cooking caused me to take a hard look at my knives . I did a lot of research and settled on the Pro S series . I never realized how much difference good knives made . This is a great knife to have , extremely sharp and makes quick work of peeling just about anything . Even if you cook only occasionally , this is a knife for you .
2 #### Better quality control needed . Bought two , filled with water but found one of them was leaking . Had to wrap another plastic bag outside and I am not sure it will make it less effective . Update : 1 . after using it during the whole summer : very effective catching all types of flies . The effectiveness will start to decrease as the liquid evaporates and more flies got in . And in my experience , I had to change a new one every two or three weeks . 2 . Disposal is a big problem because I do n't want the smelly liquid / fly bodies leaked everywhere in my trash and the bag itself is very difficult to seal . My solution was to use a used infant formula tin to store and finally dispose it .
5 #### I love this little whisk . Perfect for so many small cooking / baking jobs . The handle is just the right thickness and length to hold comfortably .
4 #### Works great ! It 's a corer , not sure how flowery I can get here . It works ... design is simple and easy to use . If you need one , this ought - ta do it !
5 #### A bit of arthritis was making it hard to manage my old squeeze style sifter . This one just shakes back and forth instead ... so much easier ! And the plastic lid comes in handy , too . Leave it to OXO to make such a good simple product .
5 #### Nice product . It has good sharp blades for cutting the fruit . I had one where the blades are not sharpened and those are worthless . I highly recommend this .
5 #### I needed a smaller masher for making deviled eggs which I make in a small bowl . This is the perfect size .
1 #### Bought two of these , one for my mother and one to keep . What a total waste of money . Even my husband could not use this device easily . We finally just trashed them both as no use allowing junk to take room in our kitchens .
5 #### It does n't get any better than this . I use this on the Lodge dutch oven metal table ... the wind break helps . This will last much longer than any charcoal grill ever . The cast iron grate is just as good as the pans , nonstick . Wipe and clean it like you would a cast iron pan . Heavy but portable . A great item to bring camping .
1 #### I bought one of these and found the face of the wallplate had a scratch across the entire length right out of the wrapper . So I wasted some more gas to get a replacement , only to find that it does n't fit . Yep , something as simple as a wallplate , which have been around since the invention of light switches . Yep , leave it up to outsourcing to China to explain how this Decora wallplate wo n't fit a GFCI outlet or Decora toggle , or any device with that rectangular shape . Apparently the suits at Leviton do n't bother to check product quality as long as their product costs are minimized . If there was true justice in the world , they would lose their jobs over this stupidity rather than the innocent American workers they laid off to outsource . And I ai n't a union guy , either .
5 #### Kinda hard to review this , until you use it - and due to the nature of the product , you kinda hope you never have to use it . I 'll assume that it 's in good working order . It looks like it is .
4 #### Let 's face it . Unless you 're a baker , you really do n't need to sift flour very much today ( not like we had to do 30 + years ago ) . On those occasions when you might be baking some real nice baked treats , this is the sifter I grab . Unlike the old days with my hurdy gurdy sifter with the red knob on the side . I felt like a little monkey with a tin cup was going to show up any minute . This sifter is easy to use . One hand ... rock it back and forth ... that 's it . Works beautifully every time and is was well worth the money .
2 #### I equipped my entire , three - zone backyard system with Rain Bird Sure Pop 600 sprinklers . They worked quite well for about 3 years , and then the riser seals started to go bad . The seals started to calcify and became warped , causing sprinklers to leak and/or not pop up at all . I tried cleaning the seals and soaking in CLR , but this did not solve the issue . Ordinarily , this would not be a problem . Buy replacement seals , install , and you 're as good as new . HOWEVER , Rain Bird does not individually sell the riser seals , leaving you to purchase an entirely new sprinkler ( $ 3 - 9 ) JUST to get a seal from the new unit . This would be a 4 - 5 star review if Rain Bird would individually seal riser seals .
5 #### I have had this one for several years and still going strong .
4 #### Used it to flatten a slab of mango wood . It worked ok as long as you used at the right rpm and did n't take off more than your router can handle . I had a problem with the blade not cutting truly flat but I suspect that this may be something off on my router or sled . I have another flat planing bit so I will use that with the same router and sled and see what happens . It formed ridges of about 1/64 " over the 1.5 " width but these were easily sanded down on the initial sanding with 80 grit on and r / o sander . Otherwise the bit is sharp and stayed sharp for the whole job , 4'x8 ' slab , top and bottom . Will update to 5 star if it turns out to be my router .
5 #### great item , great stickiness . catches all my little nasty creepy crawlers coming thru garage door opening
5 #### OMG , this device works ! Tried several other " fancy " mole traps , tried poison , smoke , water flooding , everything . Only this trap finally got this little sucker . It 's a little bit tricky to set it up and instruction are not clear how to install it underground , but once you have learned it 's really easy and effective . The track looks like a medieval torture device and works like one :) . But result is guaranteed if you set it up right . Just uncover a tunnel , pale the trap deep enough do the jaws are right at the level of the tunnel , and only then cover the tunnel with the trap inside with soil . Do not compress the soil , let it be loose . Do n't forget to undo the safety hook after that . Again , this is the only mole trap that works !
5 #### This thing made me love coffee with all my heart . Highly recommended !
5 #### nice size,2nd one i own , bright enough for my purpose , lighting an exercise monitor with no backlite
5 #### Use this to break down boxes and open packages . It is very solid and durable in the hand . All metal construction . I am not a professional but this is perfect for around the home use .
5 #### There are not enough words to tell you how much I LOVE this product ! ! ! ! When I can save money I will be purchasing another . The first night , like others , I was like----uhhhh it is n't working ! But the second night the mosquitoes came in droves and the zapping fun began ! :) You definitely will want to put this away from your seating area . It 's a blood bath . ( Pun intended ) . Also the zapping sounds can get a lil obnoxious but to be able to sit on my back patio of several acres and NOT be eaten alive .......... HEAVEN !
5 #### Much smaller tin than most of my magnetic poetry kits . Got this one as a gift for my team 's " ray of sunshine " award winner and he loved it .
4 #### Pretty darn cool ! The one and only thing I do n't like is cleaning it afterward
5 #### Covered our pop up camper perfectly ! Went camping and it rained hard one night . Not a drop of dampness inside ! ! ! It 's a thin tarp but it worked very well for us .
5 #### I love these things , I use them a ton for grilling and have n't had any issues . This size is good for a hotter or larger grill since you 've got plenty of room between you and the heat source .
5 #### This arrived on time it was exactly as described . It is a great size in his perfect for doing batches of cookies etc . The quality is better than I was expecting for the price and I would highly recommend it .
4 #### good design really drys the greens have a large garden and am a vegetarian so gets a lot of use . easy to use large size for a pile of leaves at a time . I would have given it 5stars but I feel the outside bowl bottom is a bit thin and that is what always breaks on ours . after a few months hard use I will review this again .
4 #### This base is well made , sturdy , and works well . The base is readily adjustable for different sizes . You need to take your time with the pieces and lay them all out and measure first , then bolt them together . The directions could have been a bit clearer , but if you study the directions , compared to the parts that you have , it is not too difficult to put the base together . The levers to raise and lower the base work well . When you lower the machine with the levers , there are adjustable rubber feet that lower down onto the floor and make the machine stable . This is definitely a viable alternative to getting a mobile base that is specific to the tool that you have . This base is the only way to go if you made your own machine stand and now want to make it mobile . All in all I was happy with this universal mobile base .
4 #### Original 2 star review : I have loose , sandy soil , so I drove a smaller pilot hole before installing the two " Chasers " in my garden bed as helpful reviewers had suggested . They were certainly easy to install , and once they 're in the ground they are inconspicuous . However , after a month the vole activity is the same as it was before I put them in . In other years we 've been able to reduce the vole numbers by trapping ( a baited snap trap placed under a downturned flower pot atop one of their holes or runs ) , but this year they seem uninterested in the bait , or wise to the traps . We 're still looking for effective vole control . Update after 7 weeks : The vole activity slowed after I wrote the first review . There were fewer roots eaten off plants , then it tapered to none . It may be the heat of mid - summer , or the voles have eaten themselves into a morbid stupor or maybe the Chasers are finally getting them to leave .
5 #### Have worked well with our shop - vac to give it new life . Using this as a " cleaner " attachment set in the home vs the grubby ones from repair and heavy duty jobs .
5 #### Great pump for large yards using a pond for a water source
4 #### I had a Taylor rain gauge just like this for over 15 years and it took a beating during those years . It is tough and accurate . Easy to mount or just stick it in the ground and remember to move it before you mow the lawn !
5 #### Love this thing . The designers much have known the dimensions of all my stuff . I appreciate this more and more every day .
5 #### This is great for wine drinkers . You will taste the difference . Great for enhancing the taste of wine .
5 #### Sharpens chain saw quickly , does n't seem to load up file with filings .
5 #### I went hiking in the High Atlas Mountains in Morocco in the most primitive of conditions . ( We ran out of water and had to use a water filter I brought with me . ) While I did n't mind " scuzzing " it my father insisted I should bring a set of these wipes as he uses them when he is in the wilderness on primitive hunting trips . SAVED MY LIFE ! Due to severe exhaustion ( 24 hours of flight coupled with no sleep due to severe windstorm ) I developed travler 's stomach sickness in the middle of nowhere with no access to sanitary facilities , ( if you do n't count rocks . ) Without going into the gory details , I was a mess . I whipped these out of my daypack and cleaned up beautifully . While I was greatly embarrased , I did not smell of the " fits . " These towletts were the only form of " sanitiation " I had . I did not get further illness , which was a great concern to me . I used these wipes every evening to clean the ever - present dirt of me . They were always dark brown with the dirt they removed . At the end of the trip , I was at least pretty sanitary considering the conditions . ( Emphasis on no washing water or sanitary facilities . ) I could not thank my dad enough for suggesting these . While most of us wo n't be going on these kinds of trips , I will always keep a couple of packs on me from now on just in case .
4 #### This item takes a few weeks to recieve , but its worth waitng for to enjoy some good tea
5 #### works well and comfortable in my hand - I like OXO as a brand and this fits into the brand well
4 #### I 'm really weary of buying things that are made in China . Fiskars is located in the USA . I 'm unclear on the reason ( RICH EXECUTIVES AND GREEDY BOARD OF DIRECTORS ) why they would manufacture these snippers in China . Brings me down . Anyway . These are QUITE nice , very lightweight -- you will not be cutting anything more than thin plant material with these BUT they do reach in very nicely , nice thin blades . This operates on a naked steel wire spring , not a coiled spring , so I 'm curious how long these are going to last . Comes with a thoughtful little orange plastic cone for the business end of the snippers . These are significantly superior to bonsai - type snippers or repurposed manicure scissors . Ideal for deadheading flowers . I love garden tools and these snippers are a real treat .
5 #### Nice measuring / pouring bowl ! ! Sturdy , yet light weight . I love the rubber grip and bottom for stability . Would recommend .
5 #### Great size and the ribber handle is comfortable to use .
4 #### This is a case of getting more than what you paid for ... while product wo n't outlast name brands , it is about 1/3 the price and lasts just about as long ... a good deal to say the least .
5 #### Looks great , have n't used it yet . Wonder if it stays sharp or can you buy a replacement blade .
3 #### It worked fine , but does n't feel substantially better than the Dollar Tree $ 1 Jab Saw . To me , the extra money is a waste .
5 #### Fantasist product - killed a million bugs the first night . Use rubber band and put a gallon baggie on the bottom and you have an easy clean up - otherwise there will a HUGE pile of bugs under this monster .
4 #### Works on Angle Hair algae after several applications . Has n't harmed fish , frogs , or plants .
5 #### Bought 2 and my Granddaughter loved both . The quality is excellent .... fast delivery A++++++ transaction
5 #### I like this perfectly for my use . I first start my seeds in an Aerogarden using their large seed starter kit . Once the seedlings are well on their way , I transplant them to larger containers and then set them up under the grow light system . I could use the system from start to finish but as I have the Aerogarden , it makes sense to make use of it , too . This way I do n't need to go to the covered tray system to sprout my seedlings . I keep the plants under this system until I am ready to move them out to the garden . I then spend a couple of days hardening them off outside during the day and weaning them from the hydrofarm during the night .
5 #### No complaints about this timer it is working very well and it should last for years to come the quality is very good .
5 #### High quality Bird Seed that the birds in our area enjoy . I usually Mix this with high quality bird seed Mix - they really enjoyed the mix !
5 #### Who wants to be stuck in the air on a ladder that quivers and leaves dark smudges where a brush wo n't reach ? But when something works even better than you think it will , gives thanks ! I 'll never use another ladder without these groovy rubber guys that make scaling the heights much , much steadier . Also , they really do save the walls from the black marks . I sure appreciate being a bit steadier when I 'm in the perilous position of being up a ladder against a wall at over 17 feet . Happy climbing . . .
3 #### I thought this cooker was just a bit larger , was shocked at how small it was when it arrived but I will try to use it for small items .
5 #### LOVE these . Just put a few in the 5 / gal buckets I use to fill with rainwater to keep the mosquitoes out . Works like a charm .
5 #### Love the feel of this thing , seems very well made . It works as well as it looks , no drips in the off position , plenty of spray patterns , including a very powerful jet setting .
5 #### I love this ! The shape of this spinner is perfect because you can stack things on top of it . It 's very sturdy and durable .
3 #### Does not accommodate a dado wider than about 3/8 inch . I kept it rather than hassling with shipping it back . I made my own zero - clearance throat plates after getting this one and being disappointed .
5 #### I 've used this for about 2 years , maybe longer . It works great on my hardwood floors and I 've had no problems with it .
5 #### These cups seem like they will last a long time . They appear very durable . I like that they have spouts on either side for pouring wet ingredients .
5 #### These are great - we purchased one for each of our bathrooms . They are a much nicer way to keep a plunger in the bathroom .
5 #### I bought this set to accommodate some smaller drill bits I bought on a jewelry suppliers website . Nice product , good value . And yes , it is a quick change set ; you just unscrew the collet nut ( the black part shown last in the picture ) , pull out whatever collet is in place , if applicable , pop in the collet of your choice , and screw the collet nut back on . Easy .
3 #### I do n't know if these helped or not . The bars seem too far apart to actually kill a mosquito on the zapper . The sticky things also fall off after a week or before . Might be a design flaw in the zapper as there is not a solid surface to stick it to
5 #### This is a great product , it is replacing another Intermatic that broke after years of service . This product will save me a lot of money over the years to some .
2 #### After reading the reviews and the product specifications , I was convinced this was a quality product . Indeed , the unit is attractive , well - made , sturdy , and comes with a lifetime warranty . Unfortunately , at least in my yard ( Florida Gulf Coast ) , it has been totally ignored by prospective avian customers . At various places in my yard , I have 2 Brome squirrel busters , plus a couple of generic Home Depot / Lowes - type feeders . These are filled with black oil sunflower seeds and protected by raccoon baffles ( tough luck , squirrels ! ) . Our usual clientele includes cardinals , titmice , chickadees , Carolina wrens , goldfinches ( seasonal ) , etc . I loaded up the thistle feeder with Nyger seed --- all these birds totally ignored it . I tried moving the thistle feeder to each of the other feeding locations . No interest . Eventually , I removed the Nyger seed , cleaned the feeder , and tossed it in the attic . A waste of my money . One additional minor complaint --- the Nyger seed , intrinsically quite small , tends to slip down between the plastic cylinder and the metal base and is impossible to remove . This ensures there will be some rotting seed stuck in the feeder , no matter how diligently you clean the unit .
4 #### Not only do I have fun with it , I took it to school and put the words on the side of my desk and my students have a blast making up encouraging sentences . My only regret is that the words are n't a little bigger .
3 #### Works good for small light duity jobs but will not cut down large weeds . If you have a small yard and do not want to mess with gas or an electrical extension cord this unit will work OK .
5 #### Worked great for cutting out a circle on some hard porcelain tile and still has a lot of life left in it .
4 #### Meh , bought these for work . I searched metal tape measure . It looks metal . It 's not . Cheap plastic but the tape itself works nicely . I got these because of their price and the more expensive FATMAXes do not last long . They get crap built up inside the housing and keeps them from sliding in and out . > < I can buy of few of these for the same price and last just as long .
5 #### I love this pressure cooker the best for the price . Very good looking pressure cooker in stainless steel for the next 30 yrs .
5 #### A cheap airhose ( made from PVC , usually ) is a pain . They stay coiled when you uncoil them , and stay straight when you coil them . A high quality rubber hose makes a huge difference . It sounds trivial , but it really makes managing hoses easier . When I 'm in the shop , or out on a job I want to be able to run the hose out quickly , and coil it neatly when I 'm done . A high quality rubber hose like this one makes it easy . My Goodyear hoses have been in service for a long time and are tough enough to last for many more years . I also appriaciate the fact that it 's made in the USA . One extra tip - lay out your hose , then connect it to the tank . If you connect it to the tank when it 's coiled , it 'll fill with air and be harder to uncoil .
5 #### " My " birds -and squirrels- love this suet cake . Unfortunately , it can not be bought on Amazon anymore . I am bereft . My little friends will now be introduced to a variety of other " flavors " so I know which one they prefer .
5 #### I never knew I could get this other than the large ( and pricey ) " dunks " - what a great product ! This is just right for my bromeliads and outdoor plant saucers !
5 #### This product works great for the purpose I had intended it to . Both the 4 " hose and the 2 1/2 " hoses fit on it perfectly .
3 #### I myself do n't see that much difference in this hi - efficiency bag to a regular bag at least in my applications . Gone back to the others but did add the additional foam sleeve .
2 #### Had to keep replacing the pressure valve twice in 2 months Stopped using it Worked well otherwise
5 #### Cookie cutters are just as shown in the description ! Very happy with the product and timeliness !
2 #### Says it takes 2 2032 batterys , so I ordered a 25 pack along with the light . It does not take these type of batterys ! !
4 #### For the price , it 's a great addition . The cyclone top does not make a real seal with the top of your 5 - gallon bucket . I took the rubber seal out from my bucket lid and glued it around the lip of the top with some silicone caulk so that it forms a press - fit seal when I push it down on the bucket . This makes a good seal , but the top is still not terribly secure , so good idea -- as others have said -- to wrap a bungee or web strap around the bucket to hold this in place .
5 #### Had this same model for 30 years . When that popper went to popper heaven , I bought the same model . Why mess with what works . This popper continuously stirs the popcorn while it 's popping . Usually have very few old maids and no burnt kernels because of this .
5 #### Love it . Works great . One thing to understand is all the instructions say if you connect a 20 lb propane tank , it should be outside . Only use the small disposable tanks inside .
1 #### this does NOT work for a 1 gal vac . WAY TO LARGE !
5 #### This iFlickTM Monopod Selfie Stick works fantastic . All you have to do is take it out of the box and place your phone on it . Plus its a great size to place in your purse or backpack . Perfect for a selfie or for filming a video . Fully compatible with most smartphones , including Android and Apple . Extendable stick as long as 40inches , with adjustable holder it allows random rotation of shooting angle . Allows for selfies or above - crowd shots Easy to Start Up : Turn on , Pair it with smart phone via Bluetooth and Snap Allows for selfies or above - crowd shots I received this product in exchange for my honest review .
5 #### What can I say - they work ! :) Stanley makes quality products and my heavy duty utility knife is more than a decade old . I 've gone through hundreds of these blades and I really like this new dispenser . Previously purchased blade packs were overly greasy ( oil is applied to prevent rust ) but this one came applied with just the right amount . The dispenser is easy to use and is made from hard plastic that is sure to outlast the time it will take to finish all the blades . The dispenser also has holes to hang it on a shelf so now it is always easy to find .
4 #### I assumed this would fit my pool . But it did n't . But it 's not their fault . I had an interview lounge pool with similar measurements . I did not return . Because I had already tried to use it . And did not contact seller because it was not their problem at all . But seems like durable product .
2 #### Typical of these chinese made garbage solder guns . The two screws that hold in the tip can get stripped and they are almost impossible to find and replace . Funny how my buddy has an American made one from 25 years ago that still works to this day with no issues . Do not buy .
4 #### it is very good construction and safe , comes in handy many times . the only draw back for me is thst it could keep the ladder a little farther off the house , legs could be a little longer .. John Mikosz
5 #### I bought this , mostly as a food prop , for my blog . It 's really functional , too , for cooling pies / cakes . Built with durability .
5 #### I really love the scents that Herbal Essences makes ~ it 's hard to go wrong with any of their concoctions . This one is no exception ~ it truly does smell like sweet berries and is a very pretty feminine scent in my opinion . Also , it does n't dry out my skin like so many others do in the long , cold , winter season . Amazon delivered another awesome product quickly as always ! I got to use the Amazon ' clip a coupon ' for an extra dollar off the already low price ! It was cheaper than Target and delivered straight to my door ! You ca n't beat that ! 5 stars all around with this one !
5 #### I bought this to make radius top window trim from jointed 2X lumber which I first bandsawed to rough shape . I made a circle jig for my router and this bit went through the lumber like butter in one pass .
2 #### Not the desired flavour as expected even after following the instructions on 5 occasions
5 #### Most of the wall timer units state not to use for heaters . What a joke . THis ones has no such a statement . I needed it to enable my home steam humidifier in the furnace only during certain parts of the day ( I did not want it to run at night and cause the furnace to blow cold air while bringing the house humidity up if it dropped ) . I also connected the furnace UV light to it . That way I saved the constant 40W power consumption . I do n't think the UV light needs to be ON for the whole day . That way I have it cycling twice a day for 2 hours . It should pay for itself in 1 year . In addition the devices controlled by it should last longer . The steam humdifier draws about 10A when its internal resistive heater is ON , so that is well within this outlet rating . Check your device power used before connecting to this .
5 #### Very well made new pressure cooker . My wife uses it quite frequently to make meal preparation time shrink drastically . It also makes meat much more tender than oven or stove top cooking in less time .
5 #### Works great . Feels good in the hand . Much better than those small , all metal ones that rust after a short time .
5 #### Very powerful little flashlights . Love the solar capability ! Items were well packaged and arrived in a timely manner . Bought 2 here and they were cheaper than other sites that sell 2 packaged together for about $ 10 more .
5 #### We have three Kuhn Rikon pressure cookers that we use almost every time we cook - this is the main cookware we use . It 's fast , easy , and it saves energy because it takes less time to cook . And the food 's great - I like eating at home better than any restaurant .
1 #### As far as utility blades go , these appeared to be as good as any that I 've purchased . The reason why I 'm only giving them one star is because the package that mine arrived in was saturated in oil . I realize that a light coating of oil is necessary to prevent blades from rusting , but in this case the oil was so prevalent that it not only got all over my shirt , but it also got into a bag of coffee that was packaged with the blades . As a result of the above , I ended up throwing out the blades and the coffee . Keep in mind that it was n't just the blades that were covered with oil , but the entire package as well . Amazon refunded my money on both . The bottom line is that while I 'm sure that these blades are as good as any others , the ones that I received were oiled improperly . Be advised if you purchase these , to open them with care . Otherwise , you 'll end up getting oil all over your clothes and anything else the package comes in contact with .
2 #### There is corrosion around the lip of the pot after just a few uses . This is disappointing .
4 #### Good product .... stays flexible in teen temps .... gets electricity from the outlet to the device rapidly and steadily ..... but then , is n't that what it should do ? The flexibility is the issue and provides this at a lower price than other products I saw .
5 #### Easy to use and very helpful in determine what type of fertilizer to add to the yard !
5 #### Bought this to take camping - you just never know how those ' camp ' grills are going to be . This little guy did a great job . Easy to pack , easy to use , and made some awesome burgers . As usual Weber knows it 's stuff .
5 #### This was much bigger and heavier than I anticipated , but it 's still a great hammer . Arrived on time
4 #### Bought when and if I need it . You never know when a belts decides to go out and then no vacuum cleaner . Very inconvenient .
5 #### I think no kitchen is complete without at least 1 whisk , and this one is it . It 's great when making a white sauce , also for just making a roux . I love the fact that it is still made in America and I will definitely recommend it to friends , I also plan to purchase more whisks from this company , and think they would make excellent gifts for any occasion for anyone who likes to cook .
5 #### This flashlight is perfect for me when photographing at twilight or after dark , for star trail pictures . It 's also helpful in areas where there may be wildlife nearby as the beam is muted compared to an LED .
5 #### I replaced my 45 year old double boiler given to me used by my Mom years ago . It was time ! ! This is the perfect size for me as I cook only for two people . It is very well built and functional . Perfect for my Hollandaise and Bernaise sauces ! Love it !
1 #### Description says " Milton 715 1/4 " FNPT M Style Coupler - Box of 10 " They only sent me one .
5 #### excellent tools as are all the Fiskar tools I 've purchased .... for non - metallic tools , they are very nice and strong , non - magnetic tools ......
1 #### Horrible ! That one word sums it up . Horrible on meat , all it does is shred things . Thought maybe it would be good for cutting fresh tomatoes but it does n't give you a clean slice . STAY AWAY ... do n't let the cheap price and Henckels name fool you .
3 #### Screw holding the cutting blade was too tight . Blade would not move at all ! ! This can be fixed with a large - blade phillips screwdriver and a wrench to loosen the nut that holds the blade . ( But I should n't have had to do that . )
4 #### But after some lapping , polishing and lube work , you can get a useable tool with smoothly operating adjustments .
5 #### Came quickly and was what I needed . I do n't need to use the new - fangled , higher priced bags they are now trying to push on us .
1 #### The real functional opening is about 2 " not 4.5 " . They wo n't do the job for what I ordered them for , but they will come in useful for other jobs . ( 1 start since the description is wrong , but the Channellock plyers are nice . ) By the way , not really a s - Pack , just 2 separate tools received .
5 #### This pan is just as expected , heavy good quality and cakes turn out perfect every time . I will enjoy this pan fo years to come .
5 #### My Amco Nylon Serving spoons were delivered today ! I quickly opened the package washed the spoons and cooked dinner . I have been replacing my cooking utensils one by one with something of a little more quality than my wooden spoons . I always loved my wooden utensils because I knew they would not scratch my non - stick surfaces Amco does n't either - awesome ! . A couple of months ago I bought a Amco serving fork and fell in love with it instantly . I vowed I would slowing replace all of my cooking utensils and being so happy with Amco all of my cooking utensils will be Amco who has a great selection of different utensils . One of my concerns was if the handle or steel part would get hot while stirring something constantly . I have not found that to be an issue at all . My real test was making a homemade custard and having to stir constantly . The handle remained cool to the touch . So that is not a worry anymore .
4 #### Perfect for a 1 - bedroom . Can be a bit awkward to store and move around sometimes but it works great . It 's pretty much 100 % plastic so it does n't feel like the highest quality item , but for what it is it works well . Easy to clean under couches and the various nozzles get to hard to reach places . Works well on hard floor and carpet / rugs .
4 #### The solid construction and easy to dial in settings make this a must have for your shop .
5 #### Good grips is right . These feel good in your hand . I ordered two of them in two sizes . A nice addition to my kitchen .
5 #### Beautiful quality fit and feel - it is almost wrong to use it for the yard work I purchased them for . Now I use them when I am finishing woodwork projects , as they deliver a degree of feel and dexterity I do n't get from my heavy duty work gloves .
4 #### I purchased these to use exclusively with the plants I grow for my cat . Fit well in my hand , and perform the tasks I want with ease .
4 #### Definitely suitable for outdoors . I purchased this for an outdoor watering system and has worked well . The instructions are a little clumsy and small . You 'll have to read it a couple of time to understand what it 's telling you . The most confusion part is the ON / OFF / AUTO sequence - makes no sense and I had to look through the other reviewers here to get a better understanding That 's the only reason why I did not give it all stars . Also , since there are 20 available programs you may want to review all of the programs to make sure that your on / off cycles are working correctly .
3 #### basic no thrills sprinkler . It works . It was cheap . Not much more to say
3 #### Yes , it 's a good spatula , but I later found one at a dollar store that is just as good . Overpaid for this item .
1 #### Complete piece of junk . Fell apart when I opened the package . Feels like it is about 8 oz of plastic .
5 #### This is still the best tape measure I have found , despite being made in China . I have tried a lot of tape measures in my day , but I keep coming back to the 30 foot Stanley .
5 #### I was familiar with this tool and was happy to find a good deal on a reconditioned one . It has served flawlessly for two thousand square feet of cherry flooring , and I anticipate selling it locally for what I paid when I 'm done with this project . Excellent service on the sale as well . No complaints whatsoever.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000224PN/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
5 #### Excellent Freud quality product . Outstanding performance , easy to set up and use , good value . I can thoroughly recommend this product .
3 #### I chose this rating because this product is not so very efficient in my opinion ... I like that it allows good flow but , small bits leak through the two halves at the seam . to frustrate matters , it opened up in my large pot of soup and ruined it by releasing pieces of bay leaf all in the soup . the locking mechanism on this piece needs to be considered , compared to your potential application before you purchase it ( probably great for it 's intended application .. tea ) . Heat and or stirring action may cause this thing to unlatch .. not good .. To be fair , this happened after several uses of no mishap . But one ruined pot of soup is enough to get me shopping for another type . It seemed rather rickety and poorly built at first but I was willing to give it a try ... I bought 2 .. ones in the trash and other is put away for emergency only . Take from this what you will ... it may work fine for you ..
4 #### Sort of clunky , works decent . Make sure you measure the output pipe size on whatever you 're going to attach it to and check to see if it will fit . The squeezable clamp does nt allow for much of a differential .
1 #### I bought this item thinking it would be great . The first time I used it , it overheated and burned out . I was able to get a refund .
5 #### It 's always nice to have a handy tool like this . Do n't actually use it in the kitchen . We have a Koi pond and we use it to get leaves out of the stream .
5 #### Kind of big and bulky but real easy to use and the light is terrific . For being a large book light it is pretty lightweight too so that 's nice . I like it , works great for reading in bed .
2 #### These look like they were stamped out of a piece of metal , had a few edges filed off , and then were put into a box . Undoubtedly the cheapest looking / feeling silverware I 've ever seen .
5 #### Stanley is all i ever buy and this was a good price , They work great on the job doing Construction work .
5 #### These replacement grates , while stainless steel , are not solid rods of metal like most grates but are instead tented metal , with a dull finish . At first I worried that they would not hold up , since my previous stainless , solid rod - type grill grates ( more on that later ) were completely ruined after a couple of years of use ; however , these seem to be holding up well , much better than most . Potential buyers should note that Weber has unique measurements for their grill grates , and you must match them to your particular model . However , I did not buy these grates for a Weber grill ; I have a CharBroil / Thermos grill with strange sized grates that I could not find replacements for two - three years after purchase . The Weber measurements came the closest , although there is a 1/4 " to 1/2 " overlap , which the closed lid rests on . If you find yourself in the same predicament , my set - up works well , even with the grill top closed , with no appreciable heat loss . The inside of the grill still gets darned hot . Obviously , these are manufactured for Weber grills and , because of the measurements , are the only option for those who need to replace Weber grates . I 'm just glad I was able to use them for my situation as well .
3 #### but the quality is so - so . The wooden pieces have several small cracks and breaks . It even does not include have a paper board . Still recommend it nevertheless .
5 #### This brush is easy to use as are most all Good Grips products , and does a nice job of brushing of surface dirt from veggies . For items like potatoes , the bristles get into the little pockets here & there & clean them quite well . I 've purchased another & may yet get several more for Christmas stocking material .
4 #### The cardinals love it but I found it at HyVee for less than half the price .... soooo
5 #### I purchased a B&D edger and also purchased this blade as a spare . The toothed blade seems to cut better than smooth blades . The Amazon price was lower than local stores or online when purchased with other items to qualify for free shipping .
5 #### Purchased this item for my Zilla Mini Dome , its much cheaper then buying the reptile bulbs & works just as good .
5 #### Wish I had bought this years ago . It makes delicate work so nice , not having the big bulky dremel in hand .
2 #### Blade too thick so it 's really only good as a cleaver .
1 #### I returned it . It would not raise high enough to fit the oranges . I had , had a similar one that was plastic and worked fine for years . This one needed more space for fruit and a better drain for the juice .
2 #### i received this product with no product instruction how to wash item etc ..... and it is not worth the money $ 50.00 i paid for ....
3 #### I 'm in Long Island , New York and this product did not work in my backyard . I 've seen the hummungbirds around but they never went to my feeder .
3 #### This was n't the most easy to use , the blade could be better
4 #### I 've had this fork for about a month now and I seem to use it quite a lot . I really prefer to use this over the pastry cutter when I make biscuits . Here 's thought : A lot of my old recipes say to cut the shortening into the flour with a fork ( not a pastry cutter ) and I 've found that difficult with a regular fork - could this be the tool to which they are referring ? So , I 've used it when making biscuits and cornbread , checking if boiled potatoes are done , and browning ground beef . I like it so much that I plan on getting a couple more to give away as hostess gifts when i visit out - of - state friends next month .
5 #### Wonderful mixing bowl . It is very light weight . Using the handle it is easy to lift with one hand . The shape lets you easily hold it to mix . Easy to get all the contents out -- much easier to scrape down the sides that with a traditional bowl . Highly recommed its use !
5 #### This is a lightweight smaller vacuum with the Hoover name which got me to buy it and then I enjoyed the QUIET vacuum sounds and the deep cleaning it does . My cat still does not like the vacuum sounds , though . I can certainly recommend this product .
5 #### This is an awesome piece to have , works real well and easy to clean !
5 #### Works very well to create a movable base for our very heavy bandsaw . Now we can roll it around in the garage / shop and not have to work around it !
4 #### The Quadra cuts better that the standard two blade bits but for end grain , I thought it would have done better on hard woods .
5 #### I purchased a replacement pair of these . The angled head works great to pull brad nails or staples out of framing once the panels / trim have been removed . Apply enough pressure to squeeze but not cut and rock the handle down
5 #### I am so pleased with this . My sixteen year old sun installed it on wooden siding house without a hitch . I have a huge garden which seems to swallow my many tools . Now they are neat and always where I can find them . As an avid gardener , with large and heavy tools , I am pleased with the variety of means to hang and the weight it holds . The construction feels quite durable .
5 #### I bought one for me kids too , and they all just loved them .
5 #### Great design . Fits nicely in my hands . Razor sharp . I have bought several Henkels knives in the past and they have never let me down . They also have a " lifetime " warranty in case you run into any problems .
5 #### I used this bit and the 99 - 015 to make a two piece complex molding for a cabinet . They were sharp and worked as expected giving me a smooth clean profile .
5 #### This worked perfectly ... for a while . I mounted this on a tree to tempt the squirrels . I enjoyed watching them mount the roof of the feeder and then sliding off ! . They could not get to the seed . It worked perfectly until a bear attacked it and demolished feeder . Metal was bent on the spring loaded bar as was the hanger . Of course , the bear ate all the seed in the feeder .
4 #### item blows well ; better than any of my ex - girlfriends . I could n't be pleased more . Just like my ex - girlfriends , it makes the room nice and cold . Item is FANtastic , would purchase again .
5 #### Great veggie brush , nice rubber grip and runs right through the dishwasher without damage . I have never been disappointed in an OXO product . Kudos OXO .
4 #### This is a great economically priced and eco - friendly lawnmower ; easy to setup and works really well with the optional grass / leaf catcher .
5 #### Have been woodworking about 20 years now . Purchased the DeWalt 733 Planner over two years ago and it 's still running strong . Easy to use operation , adjustments are very accurate . I really like the thick large planner knifes which allow for many resharpenings . Have run through well over 800 board feet of hardwood lumber , mostly red oak and not a single problem with this DeWalt Planner . I keep an extra set of knifes always ready for a quick change of blades , which I might add is fairly easy to do . Thanks DeWalt , this is a heavy - duty workhorse in my woodshop . The model 733 allows me to keep the price of fine hardwood lumber down to a reasonable cost since I purchase all my lumber from a indenpendant sawmill .
5 #### Work as advertised ... frying so may bugs just not sure any are mosquitoes . Some piece of mind I guess . Smaller unit that our old one - light and a pretty blue light .
5 #### the price , the precision of the jet , the quality of the material [ durable ] . All perfect to me . I leave it outside all the time
4 #### The description said weatherproof , but it 's not waterproof , which is what I needed . It definitely needs to be protected from rain ( or at least that 's what the accompanying paperwork says ) . I 'm afraid to keep it outside near the pool , which is not covered . So I 'm keeping it inside a window that looks out to the pool . It 's big , but it is a beautiful clock and works perfectly . Just sorry it 's not waterproof .
4 #### Seems to be a good quality hose . A hose reel would be my next thing to make using it a bit easier .
5 #### THIS IS THE PREFECT HOLDER FOR MY BUG - LIGHT AND LOOKS LIKE IT WAS MENT FOR MY UNIT , SO HAPPY I BOUGHT ....... 8-)
5 #### I will keep this short and simple - this is a great sharpener . Simple , fast , and very sharp edges . It 's easy to use , so you will use it often to keep the edge on . I 've been using this for the past couple years and just ordered one for Fathers day . Enjoy
5 #### I know there 's been a lot of talk for many years about Schrades being made in China these days . I 'm here to say that this is a more than decent knife . A little stiff opening , but I prefer that , actually . Blades needed a minor touch up on my stones upon arrival , which was n't a problem . I believe this Old Timer is a good value and quite sufficient . No , it 's not on par with a Case knife , but it 's great for what it is . A great budget , functional knife . And if I lose it , I wo n't be devastated because I can easily afford to buy another at this price . I recommend it !
4 #### Works fine , but no width adjustment which is a little frustrating . You can set this to only cover one side or to cover both sides , which is handy .
4 #### Good quality , holding up in full sunlight for over 6 months now . Now signs of cracking .
5 #### These are much thicker and sturdy than the standard metal mixing bowl I 've been using . I like them so much I bought more sizes .
5 #### I HAVE BEING DOING ELECTRICAL WORK FOR THE PAST 27 YEARS THIS KLEIN LINEMANS WERE MY FRIST TOOL I THINK EVERY ELECTRICIAN SHOULD HAVE 1 IN HIS POUCH , THEY ARE A GREAT TOOL WELL MADE AND TOUGH WELL WORTH THE MONEY , UNLES YOU WANT TO MOVE UP THE LADDER USE KNIPEX , OVERALL THEY ARE GRRRREEAATT FOR THE PRICE , THANKS
5 #### I have used a solar cover for 30 years on 3 different pools . would n't think of having a pool without having a solar cover .
5 #### Great Popover pan . Easy to get out and plenty of space between popovers .
5 #### Purchased these clamps because they are made in USA . Always looking for American made products . Keep Americans working , buy American ! !
5 #### The shipment was extremly fast . The item was as described and has performed to perfection .
5 #### I need ( want ) another one . It gets in the way on the right side of the saw ( 715 ) . The motor is really in the way for use on the right . I use it 90 % on the left - I cut my waste from the right . But I only use it about 50 % of the time - lazy . No complaints about the function . Pricy - but so is a visit to the ER .
4 #### i reccomend this product to anyone cloning ant plants , i have had exellent results alto this container is tiny i would get the larger one
3 #### I like the functionality , but the large center posts is a problem . Either I crush the greens or I spin only a few leaves at a time .
5 #### I bought this at my local Hydroponic store to keep a little of my money local . It was very easy to set up . Well made , easy to use , can be modified to fit your needs . Do not expect large yields under one of these , however if supplemented with two other CFL spiral lights it is keeping my mother in very good condition and inter nodes are close together . Very inexpensive compared to 4 " shop lights . This stand and light will last me a lifetime . OK , maybe not the light bulb . I assembled in my living room in less than 5 min total . No problems at all . But I am a mechanic by trade .
4 #### nice for camping . light weight and great splitting power . not the sharpest edge from new . I have recommended to family
5 #### I have about a dozen different brands of router bits and Freud are some of the best I own . This bit is no exception . Clean cuts with little to no sanding required . Very sharp . I have used it now on several projects and it shows no signs of slowing down .
5 #### As usual , OXo has made an excellent product . I have arthritis and the handle is so kindly . I truly recommend this product .
4 #### It is flexible , can hold 50 + pounds ( lbs ) , and sit on practically any railing up to 6 - inch wide incl . thin panels of thick glass thanks to the clever design of the adjustable attachment brackets . You can ignore the manufacturer 's claim that the bracket can adjust 2 - 6 inches . When using only 1 or 2 bracket 's bolts ( of 3 ) closest to the pot 's bowl - after bending down the end of the horizontal flat ( bar ) of the L - shaped clasp - the vertical clasp 's flat ( bar ) holding the pot can be fastened as close to the bowl as 0 inches . It is safe to use just 1 bolt , as the distribution of even a high vertical load results in a very small horizontal component force , which can very little pull ( shear away ) the bolts , one of which can easily handle . However , the overall look is less than inspiring .
2 #### A couple years ago , we needed a new hose and my wife wanted a reel to go with It . I did n't want the reel . We compromised and got this 50 - foot Spring Hose at our local home warehouse store . This garden hose has not been a good buy and I would hesitate to recommend it except for special circumstances . First of all , It looks like a good idea , but it 's very hard to use . It might be 50 foot , but we have difficulty stretching it out more than 25 feet from the spout . If we attach a sprinkler to it , the sprinkler gradually creeps back toward the spout because of the coils . Plus , the coils are very easy to get all entangled and hard to untangle . It 's a very awkward apparatus and hard to manage anywhere in the yard . One time I turned the water off at the hose nozzle . That was a mistake . Our water pressure then produced an aneurism in the hose and it finally popped . Time for a hose repair kit . Then my wife did the same thing and it responded in the same manner elsewhere on the hose . This time our neighbor had to come over and turn it off because we were not home . Now it 's starting to crack in a third place . I 'll now be glad to get rid of it . Think twice before purchasing this hose . Gary Peterson
1 #### Only used it a few times , and it has fallen apart . Plus getting discolored . It can be difficult to open to put tea in or take out . Bottom line : It 's cheap in every way .
3 #### These bits work great . The taper of the bit is perfect , allowing the screw to spin freely in the first layer of wood and tighten into the second layer . The disappointment came after only limited use , the number 8 bit snapped in two rendering it useless . A replacement bit can be purchased , but at almost the cost of a new set of 3 . Also , the countersink cutters are held in place by set screws , which come loose surprisingly often . I 'm a fan of Dewalt , but my opinion of these is an overwhelming " meh "
1 #### I favor OXO products generally , but this one is a definite whopping disappointment . The rubber material of the plunger smells abominably . I could go on , but I 'm trying to restrain myself . It 's truly horrible . I 've had it outside for over a week now , hoping the smell would dissipate ... it still smells , so I 'll keep it outside for now . I 'd return it , but uncharacteristically for me , I threw away the labels and packing material upon receipt of the product .
4 #### We did fix our problem with this , and my wife thought this was more humane than a snap or glue . I am inclined to agree , as it did work very well and instantly . We used dog food to entice the air duct chewers .
5 #### A must need tool if you are working on objects below 1 " great to have in my tool set
5 #### Microwave popcorn is fine in a pinch and short on time . Air - pop is just that ( to me)--blah ! This makes popcorn like my Mom did when I was a kid so many years ago . My husband bought this for me a couple of years ago and I use it every weekend ! I do n't think I have ever served anyone popcorn from this machine that was n't immediately impressed ! I ordered this one as a wedding gift for a young couple that love popcorn and movies . Now , my grown children have purchased one for their own home as well . I do reccommend to extend the life of the unit , I melt butter in a small glass dish and not in the ' butter - well ' . Then with every use , I simply let it cool and wipe clean with a papertowel . ( Use the top as a serving bowl and wash it later ) .
4 #### Fit my shopvac with no issues . Good price in comparison to local stores .
3 #### Just FYI , the seeds I bought end of March , and which wo n't be " late " until sometime in May , are coming from China . I did n't realize this at the time , if it 's in the ad I did n't see it . I sort of feel like by the time the seeds get here the growing season will be over . I would advise pay more and get the seeds w / in a reasonable time frame . Time is money , waiting does n't pay , IMO .
5 #### It took me a long time to wade through all the reviews of reusable nut bags made in China , to finally find this one ! When I looked through the other reviews they did n't seem like " real " reviews ; many of them had only " reviewed " that one product and others just seemed phony . So I was very happy to have found this wonderful nut bag made in the USA . I am new to making almond milk and was a bit nervous at first ; but it worked like a charm and fit perfectly over my bowl . The bag is also very easy to wash . Great buy ! !
5 #### Love the size of these and they work very well !
5 #### I bought this to fill and put outside for the kids while they are playing so they are n't running in and out of the house every 10 minutes . It keeps them hydrated , keeps the floors clean and keeps the bugs out of my house . :)
5 #### Great bag . Good materials and workmanship , and it had no problem storing 25f eet of 2 gage jumper cable .
5 #### I have had this magnet for several years and still rely on it heavily . I frequently use it in baking to adjust recipes , and I really appreciate the simplicity of it . There 's really not much else to say about it other than it does its job and I love it !
5 #### Excellent blades ! They have held up well over the years . Just do n't nick a nail , as that ruins them . I still have the original set I bought here installed , with another at the ready .
4 #### Not as good as the one I bought 5 years ago , but works okay
5 #### This is my second bug zapper unit . The first one died after two seasons but given its reasonable cost , I did n't mind replacing it .
5 #### So far , the two Milwaukee tools I have purchased ( the 12v compact driver as well as this drill ) have impressed me . The things that have impressed me most of all have been the trigger control , although the power and solid feel are right up there . I really value a drill / driver that I can fine - tune the controls to the point that I can use it as a ratchet with the trigger . The magnum does that very well , with plenty of power to spare on tap if I just squeeze . The magnum is quite heavy , but it has an all - metal gear housing as well as a very solid 1/2 " chuck ... I do n't mind it because it is n't a cordless tool and cordless are the only tools I really care about being really light .
5 #### Not much to review other than these bags are the proper bags that fit my dinosaur of a vacuum cleaner ( I 'm pretty sure it 's older than me ! ) and work just fine . No complaints except that my old vacuum cleaner weighs a TON ! ( NOT the fault of the bag . haha )
4 #### I had two toilets go out on me at the same time . First I installed a Korky Waterwise fill value on one toilet . Those instructions were amazing and very easy to install . Then I to another store to get the other fill valve , but all they had was Fluidmaster . So , I got the 400A and it was nowhere near as easy to twist , but installed relatively easy . From the second I installed , no troubles . No leaking , no running , fills just right , just plain works . The Korky one was not as easy and needed some fine tuning along with working with the weird little red plastic chain that had issues with closing my flapper . Anyway , they both work fine now . Just that the Fluidmaster worked from the get go . Well worth the money .
5 #### A bit basic and has limitations on what you can achieve with the base adjustment , but this fitted to my old Dremel 395 is just about the best way to cut holes in drywall in my arsenal of tools . I 've also used it on aluminum house cladding and downspouts with some success . Fitting it is easy . You mount the bit in the tool , remove the nose cladding on the Dremel and screw on the base . You can then adjust the bit in the collet as there are access ports in the skirt for the wrench , but with practice you 'll have the depth almost right from the start . It 's easier to mount the bit before you attach the skirt in my opinion . It takes a bit of practice to learn how to keep it firmly under control without the use of a fence or guide of some sort , and you must remember to watch for what lies beneath the work surface . Err on the shallow side if cutting into a wall with wiring or pipework behind it .
4 #### Works well as a zester and making twists for martinis . But my daughter found a new purpose for it ! Scraping out the seed of pumpkins and winter squash , works like a dream .
5 #### Powerful little vacuum , great price and arrived quickly . It really has terrific suction and angles around doors and corners with speed and ease . Lightweight and durable , it 's worth every penny
3 #### The zester works OK . I ca n't get the little peeler to take a long slice off the lemon skin .
5 #### I use to use a muffin tin to try and make taco salad bowls how wrong was I. These are super easy to use and clean and have produced many delicious fresh taco salad bowls . I would highly recommend if you like taco salads but want to make them at home .
5 #### I bought this at least 2 years ago . The bristles are still intact . The brush holder ( ? what 's the right word ) fits comfortably and shows no wear . Makes you want to cook veggies !
5 #### Very beefy . They are a little larger than I was expecting , but they 're perfect for cat - proofing your cabinets . Worth it .
5 #### I use two of these for my dryer vent project and they worked well . I also use them in my dust collector system for woodworking with the plainer . Every once in a while you have to clean the slides out as small micro sawdust stuff gets jammed into the slide slot and you have to fish it out or the slide will not close all the way . This only happens on certain physical positions and locations . JJK
4 #### Comes in handy for setting the pitch on the props of small aircraft . Also works great for leveling machinery . I would buy again .
4 #### I 've seen some people who opt out on buying these disposable bags and use their shop vac as is . I find that not having a collection bag shortens the life of your vacuum and it 's a mess to clean up every time . These bags are not too expensive and they last me awhile before having to replace them .
1 #### Despite several attempts , I could not get a seal where the new valve / washer meets the tank ( Kohler , not Low type ) . Tried cleaning the tank , loosening and re - tightening the lock nuts ( hand tight ) , etc . No luck . Never had this problem with Fluidmaster .
5 #### Fits the Intex 1000 - gallon pump exactly . Easy to use . Get the big box so you can have them all summer long .
5 #### These light weight , but heavy duty , loppers enable my petite wife to easily remove green limbs nearly two inches in diameter . The geared action coupled with the long handles make routine pruning almost effortless .
1 #### WAY too heavy to stick the suction cups to the window when first filled . Then , after wrestling with it , and finally making it happen - it tears the suction cups off the window when trying to take it down to fill it again . I threw it away .
5 #### FIT PERFECTLY , COVER THE POND WITH GREAT EASE . WOULD PURCHASE IT THERE AGAIN . LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT . THAT IT
5 #### We used these when we did a pork roast on the grill and it came out excellent . At first I thought the smoke flavor might have been too strong but after letting the roast sit overnight and then shredding it , it was perfect . The smoke gave it a delicious flavor .
1 #### Save your money . The temperature reading is n't even close to being correct , and having no way to compare the humidity reading with another device , I assume it 's incorrect as well .
4 #### My wife has Arthritis in her hands and has a difficult time cutting flower stems . This scissor works good , she is able to use her whole hand and is able to cut any flower stem . The handles feel slightly cushened and are comfortable . Seems to be well made , and should last quite a while . Would purchase again .
4 #### Pros the head swivels the light is bright enough cheap it an original dewalt part Cons it fits the battery pack but its not super snug kills battery kinda fast gets hot
5 #### Remember Grandmom 's pressure cooker with the rattling pressure control weight and all the associated hassle of using the thing ? Well , all that 's history . This cooker is a gem -- about as good as it gets in pressure valve technology , beautifully constructed , easy to use , and best of all , it turns out great meals in minutes . We use ours to cook all kinds of stews , soups , casseroles -- you name it-- and they turn out just as good as the versions cooked for hours . Moroccan lamb stew , chicken cacciatore , braised lamb shanks , and many more recipes have all been delicious . And they all cook in 30 minutes or less -- yes , that 's right -- half an hour . The prep time usually takes a preliminary half hour , so a great meal in 60 minutes with no fuss .
5 #### Great tool . Must have for decking . Especially if you 're working by yourself .
5 #### I received this item within a couple of days of purchase . I hung it the same day . I love the sound . We had family members come over the same day and they noticed it right away . I would recommend this product .
5 #### I use this everyday now . It makes it easy to dry the salad and you can use the outer bowl to serve . Love it .
5 #### I use these apple wood chips to smoke steaks , pork and chicken on my Big Easy SRG grill and the flavor it gives to the meat is nothing short of amazing . I like it better than any of the other wood chips . No soaking needed . Just put into the smoker box on the grill and away you go to delicious smoked flavor . Highly recommend it .
5 #### I like the handle length on these and the added bonas of not having to use my nails for the pith removal . I have had the finger ring style , Already gave 2 away , Hope I do n't loose them in DW .
5 #### I shopped around and this was the best deal going . I am not a pro and I may only use this 1 or 2 times , but I wanted one that would do a good job and was not a peice of junk . This was perfect . Moderately priced , good quality and got the job done .
5 #### Heavy duty quality with heavy terminals that wo n't strip out like some knock offs can . Made from a high quality plastic that wo n't crack even in our cold northern climate
4 #### I use this for small jobs that I do n't want to get a hand mixer our for . I love the fact that it is metal and not nylon , but I wish the very end had a bit of a pointed tip . It would make it much more useful when making gravy on a saucepan on the stove . Other than that , it is great and makes awesome pancakes and scrambled eggs .
5 #### There are times in a construction project when you need a four foot rule . This fills the need . It is sturdy and clearly marked .
2 #### I gave this 2 stars ONLY because it is not suitable for home use . This is very heavy duty , with the emphasis on HEAVY . Even contractors I know will not use it , but rather the much lighter plastic hose . I bought it to connect my compressor in the RV basement to my tires . Way too heavy to deal with ! If you need a really heavy duty hose , this is it . But for general use , get something much lighter
5 #### IMO , the gold standard in impact sprinklers . Buy one ( OK maybe four ) and be done with it . Rain Bird has built this right for decades and it 's a wonder why so many other companies cheapen this simple design .
4 #### It is very flimsy and thin , and therefore able to get under food and flip it over easily . I have concerns about it tearing up soon ... so I could n't give it 5 stars ... only 4 .
5 #### its all good i love it thank you good job
5 #### Wow , I had no idea that this 25 footer would be so hefty . It certainly will do the job for me , but I 'll need to make sure to hang onto it so it does n't fall on my foot and do any damage ( smile ) .
4 #### This is a great nail gun . My only complaint is that it did n't come with the rapid - fire triggering mechanism . Other than that , really a great nailgun . My most used nailgun to date .
5 #### This plant house is excellent for small areas and protects my plants in cold weather . It is very tropical inside !
5 #### works well and secures well the machine in side the bars . locks well too .
5 #### It is what it says it is and works well . There is not much more to say . Great price for filter .
5 #### This was my 5th , and thank goodness , last try to find the right gardening scissors . I have carpel tunnel , arthritis , fibromyalgia and swelling in my hands whenever I work in the garden . All the other scissors I tried hurt my hands after just a few clips . These scissors are the best ! ! ! I was able to deadhead my entire garden without pain forcing me to stop . They are so lightweight and take no effort to use . If you have hand pain , these are a miracle ! ! ! !
5 #### Huge letters , easy to ready , accurate , what more could you want from a hygro - thermometer ? I bought two of these , one for the basement to monitor my dehumidifier and another in the upstairs to make sure it was n't too humid . So far so good .
5 #### This shed box is assembled by snapping together a bunch of flat panels . The panels are each very strong and it goes together very easily on a flat surface . The top has a strut to keep it fully open , or to keep it about 6 " open . You will need additional space behind the shed for the top hinge to open ( the back wall of the shed can not be flat against the wall of building ) - it needs about 3 or 4 " of clearance behind the shed for the top to open . The top closes , but there is an air gap of about 1/4 inch between the bottom of the top and the top of the vertical walls . Thus , spiders , etc can crawl in . It should be rain proof though - unless it is really a horizontal driving rain . I am happy with my purchase . Please pay attention to the size . This is fairly large - it would easily hold two garbage pails .
5 #### I HAD ONE BEFORE SOLD IT . I LOVE THIS ONE IT TAKE OX TAIL ABOUT THIRTY MIN . ON THE STOVE 4 HOURS ........
5 #### It does n't seem like a lot to ask but all of the water nozzles I bought from our local stores this year have leaked within days of purchase and I would come back inside with wet shoes , pants , etc . Since I had exhausted all of the brands sold locally , I took a chance on buying four of these fan sprayers from Amazon and have been extremely pleased with them . Besides providing a variable flow control , the nozzles have an instant shut off feature which I use routinely . Best of all , none of them leak and I have every confidence they never will given the quality of the metal / aluminum .
5 #### First of all you ca n't go wrong with anything that is Nordic Ware friend . The stuff is made in the United States , and very well made . I once had an issue with one of my pans , contacted customer service , and they resolved it immediately . This specific case can works perfectly for making giant Tarts or any other items such as that . Very happy with my purchase
5 #### works fine and easy to assemble . no gas or oil required , which is great .
3 #### 3 stars because it 's nice and exactly as described BUT I was hoping it was bigger . I know , now I 'm one of those people who look ridiculous because I did n't read the description right . But it had the same number of my old 36 " outdoor clock that just gave out so I did n't read description fully . But it works great and is good quality .
5 #### These are exactly what I need in order to manage the space in my small shop . It works exactly as it is advertised .
1 #### White light totally , not as pictured . Insects are not really attracted to it , not more then to a regular bulb . After 2 nights , barely any bugs zapped . I owned 2 before , that had purplish light and it was like bug magnet . This one is useless . Would not recommend .
2 #### Did nt do much for me . And as the item needs to be connected to an electrical source , unless you have multiple terminals around your yard , you will need to run extention cords . Unsightly and needs to be undone everytime you mow in order to mow safely . , A battery or solar powered version would probably be much more convenient .
5 #### This is an excellent tool to mark wood to cut at 90 degrees . Using this tool makes it a snap to accurately make a perpendicular line once you measure a cutting length and make a spot mark . It is coated so it glides easily thru wood and has enough heft for stability while it is not so heavy as to make it hard to use - in other words , this tool is well made and gives you a confidence level you might very much appreciate once you try it . I think I will use this Quick Square very often in my home projects .
4 #### This is a solidly made , useful tool . The only reason for four stars instead of five is that the saw teeth on the end are blunt so they push through the apple rather that slicing . I could sharpen the end but then the plating would be ruined . Generally I like this tool and use it regularly .
5 #### Seems to work well with the other Wolf tools . New to the gardening scene . Anything to make things easier !
5 #### Great gadget . A real back saver . Plants multiple types of seed at the correct depth and covers the seeds too .
5 #### This is a substantial spreader . It is long and has a very good grip . The blade is stiff and will easily cut through bagels , which is what I wanted it for . I prefer a more flexible blade for just spreading butter , but I guess you ca n't have both .
5 #### excellent American made product works well to very well made
5 #### Great stuff ! Use this in my compost for my garden soil and it always works great
4 #### Baked my favourite bread -- worked great as it is sufficiently large for my six loaves of Mother Earth ; 's wholewheat bread !
2 #### I have black finishes in my house so I was obsessed with getting black not bronzed door knobs and hinges . A guy in the hardware store warned me against the black finish as he said they scratch and the finish comes off them . I did n't listen . 2 weeks in my knobs are scratching and I can see the metal underneath . I ended up doing a couple of the doors in bronze and there is practically no difference and this option is readily available everywhere . Go for the bronze version .
4 #### Sturdy , well made , now has a heat - difusing plate on the bottom . You need a good arm to lift this cooker whether it 's full or empty as there 's a lot of steel there . Ours has lasted for years now . Yes they 're outsourced from Wisconsin to China - but someone is staying on top of the process and this is still a good product .
5 #### Love this bowl . I like the fact it has a rubber handle and bottom . Easy to handle , easy cleanup .
5 #### Good product , easy install , use it to keep bears out of my bees . We have had a bear in the yard and he did not hit up the bees . Do n't know if he tested the fence . It has made it through 3 bad electrical storms tests out at 14000 volts . I have the entire wire netting fence electrified around my bees fastened to fiberglass 1 " rods .
2 #### I am a construction superintendant for a pool company . I use my tape for quick measurements maybe 5 - 10 times a day . This tape was great for about a week , then is started to get sticky . After another week it split lengthwise and caused a pretty nice cut on my finger when it was retracting . I thought this was a good deal , I learned my lesson and will be going back to the more expensive tapes .
5 #### I 've been using this feeder for years with success . Recently , I replaced it with the same model bought at a local hardware store , and the quality was terrible as the plastic fingers at the bottom of the hopper that keep the 2 parts together would crack after a few uses . However , the one I bought from Amazon was fine . I suspect the ones bought at the hardware store were sitting in their warehouse for a while as the their boxes looked old . The one from Amazon looked new and fresh . Meanwhile , I tried some other saucer shaped feeders near this one on the same window . The results are very interesting . The Hummers prefer this feeder to all others by a 2:1 ratio . I have to refill this feeder twice as often as I do the others . Same food in both .
5 #### Arrived in a week , packaged well , what a great Heavy Duty Tool , 3 times leverage thru the gear allows you to cut thru up to 1 inch branches just fine ! for years I have been using the Fiskars 15 inch lopper but it did n't have enough Oompf for thick branches + my big Fiskars has to be opened 180 degrees + is very cumbersome + almost impossible to use on a ladder working within a tree , this Lopper is GREAT ! 5 stars all the way
5 #### Our old popover pans were just so disgustingly cruddy from high temp baking that I finally decided to replace the with these . They cleverly have almost no surrounding metal to accumulate baked on grease .
5 #### So far so good - in all kinds of inclement weathers .
2 #### Was disappointed with how hard it is to slice potatoes . If anyone knows of a french fry cutter that works easier I would like to know who makes it . This is made well but I am a pretty strong guy and it took a lot of pressure for me to get the potato to go through . I gave it as a present to my neighbor and they did not have the strength to get it to work .
5 #### Nice addition to grill ribs . Cleans easily in the dishwasher .
1 #### I am guessing the ' attractant ' used in these traps is derived from poop . WORD TO THE SQUEAMISH- this bag will be FULL OF FLIES , and the whole thing will be pulsing from the dying wing - beats of the hundreds ( thousands ? ) of flies inside the bag . It is NOT for the faint of heart . YUCK . It 's giving me the shivers just to look at the picture . Flies are gross , a clear bag full of horse poop smell and dying / dead flies is worse ! Find a different solution .
5 #### My husband & I live in a small apartment & enjoy this handy kitchen aid for its small size & good results ! We attempt to cook the majority of our meals & this pressure cooker helps us eat well & produces wonderful meals !
1 #### I hate these plastic blast gates because lately too much air and get packed with saw dust very easily and is very difficult to clean out . I 'm sticking with the metal ones even though they are more expensive .
5 #### This kill flys outdoors very well . But they do smell . And they look awful . So hide it away and it 'll keep the flys away .
3 #### good but small i had to add an extra cushion to make up the space it wo n't tighten enough . good but small i had to add an extra cushion to make up the space it wo n't tighten enough .
4 #### I just set up my Halloween lighted decor using this timer . It 's very simple and easy to use , no digital programming to remember or struggle to see . There are pins surrounding the circle representing 24 hours . Each pin is 30 minutes . If the pin is up , there is no power ( the circuit is open ) . If the pin is down , the circuit is closed and there is power . Since it plugs in , no batteries are needed to keep time . The hinged door is also nice for outdoor use to keep it dry . I 'm using it for decor that I want to come on at 5:00 and turn off at 10:00 . However with this pin up or down design you could have things on and off as much as you want throughout the day . You could even potentially have something run for 30 minutes out of each hour of the day . Great value here .
5 #### I bought this spatula because I needed a kitchen tool that was non - stick and narrow . It is perfect size for turning pancakes and will not scratch my ceramic pan . I would definitely recommend this product .
5 #### This solved a problem for me . Have two houses and I never had the charger with me when I needed to recharge the batteries . Now I have one at each location and the problem is solved . This is an OEM item so no compatability problems .
5 #### Very Nice Stainless Steel Set of Measuring Spoons that come on a Ring
5 #### Works great for making baked potato bombs on the BBQ . Core out the potato with this tool and stuff cheese , ham , butter and broccoli and bake . Works like a charm .
5 #### Works great for us . Used it to blow the gutters clean , and porches all around the house . Worth the price . In fact the only drawback is the twist on nozzle design is not perfect , so I plan to add a self taping screw , instead of the bump tab they provide . Duct tape would work too .
5 #### I use this weekly to clean my yard . The ones without bottoms wear out too fast due to me dragging it along as I work . I noted my gardener using it too ! ! !
5 #### Always a fan of klein tools in general . The heavy duty square shank makes it pretty tough . I hate to admit I used mine mostly for a beater but klein makes a demo line now so I upgraded .
5 #### Very solid made with multiple security features . The 4 - Qt is much bigger than I had expected . I guess it 's good for at least 3 people . The only thing I noticed ( just used one time so far ) is the handle is a bit lose even after tighten it twice . It should use 2 screws instead of just one .
5 #### I have several Flexogen hoses and have never had a problem . They can be a little stiff when cold , but what hose is n't . I 've never been able to make one kink in normal use . Made in the USA , I really like that !
5 #### What can I say - it 's a Shop - Vac filter that fits in my Shop - Vac and filters . A fine item at a better price than I could find elsewhere .
5 #### I am so glad to own this whisk , my biggest worry is scratching nonstick pans , and my stainless steel pots and pans . I no longer have this worry . The handle is also very comfortable to use for consistent stirring . OXO Nylon products are a great replacement to my metal utensils .
5 #### I put a box of this in my compost box and had good rich soil the next year .
5 #### I am about to purchase this newer model of the Mighty Mite . I purchased one 12 years ago and it just broke ; not the vacuum itself , but the latch that holds the top on or it would keep on working ! It has great suction and I have not yet found another small vacuum that can pick up virtually anything it has in front of it . I am bummed that the latch ca n't be fixed because the vacuum itself is a champion ! I purchased a Bissell a couple months ago and there is absolutely NO suction . I ca n't wait to get my new Mighty Mite vacuum !
5 #### I 've had a pair of Wiss tin snips for ever that I 've used for cutting everything from sheet metal to kite string . They just do n't work well for everything , and now I 've got a great pair of quality shears that do . Every workshop should have a pair of these . I just used them to cut up a batch of old credit cards and it made quick work of the task .
2 #### This was a Christmas gift for my mother - in - law last year . She only got around to using it this Christmas . However , she had several issues with the handle and is not happy with it . She made the rosettes , which were good ( she used the accompanying batter recipe ) , but said if she does it again , she 'll use the cup / bowl shape and make a shell for mousse or something . I 'm looking for a different handle for her because part of the issue was that it fell apart .
4 #### My only complaint is that it does n't hav an on / off switch . You plug it in and it turns on . It is a small price to pay for such a powerful machine !
5 #### nice tool , thin and long , strong tip and a rubber grip , the best
5 #### I love this little pot ! I make a cup of espresso in it every morning . Now I want the larger one so I can make coffee for friends .
2 #### Does n't seem to be working , I purchased four of these and I do n't think they are working at all
5 #### These are as good as factory belts and Amazon saves the hassle of trying to find them in the store .
5 #### MY WIFE BOUGHT THIS BOOK BAG FOR OUR SON , AS HE IS A HUGE ADVENTURE TIME FAN , AND HE HAS HAD IT FOR ABOUT 7 MONTHS NOW , AND IT IS STILL IN NEW CONDITION , NO WEAR AND TEAR GREAT QUALITY , SHIPPING WAS ON TIME , I HAVE NO COMPLAINTS
3 #### I needed a new can opener since the handle fell off of my old one . I was tired of buying junk . I had one picked out with good reviews and my husband talked me into trying this one . It is very cool that the can opener never touches your food and I know the blades on this can opener wo n't rust like other ones have . I do n't need to wash it like I did with my other ones . You ca n't drain food in the can using the lid which is OK except for tuna but still not a big deal . My only real issue is it is a little hard to make it turn . If you have trouble with your hands or any type of arthritis I think it will be very difficult to use . It 's OK . I 'm not in awe of it like some other reviews that I read . I will keep it until it dies but next time I will go back to an old fashioned one that is easier to turn ... unless they improve this one .
5 #### Perfect for starting small seedlings in 4 " pots . The plastic is sturdy enough to hold any excess run off water .
4 #### Saved my sprayer . After losing a nozzle I was about to discard the sprayer . Gratefully , I checked Chapin accessories and found this replacement .
5 #### I 've been using Stanley tapes since the ' 70 's and they have never disappointed . I 've tried others too and always come back to Stanley . This size is great for taking with you to the hardware store or flea market . Stick it in your pocket or use the built in clip and put it on your belt or pant and it 's ready when you are .
5 #### There are other things that need to be smooshed : Avocados ( sans pit and skin ) This does a great job , leaving small bits to leave it with a nice texture .
1 #### This is an extreemly powerful chemical .... unfortunately it killed all 6 of my small koi in a 20 gallon aquarium . I probably used too much .... be careful to use EXACTLY as directed if you have fish . The quote " Will not harm aquatic pond plants , koi or goldfish " is on the front of the label . This is a dangerous statement .
3 #### Still waiting for our Fly Web trap to actually catch a fly . Time will tell . These glue boards do fit into the unit nicely and they are very sticky . I am sure if a fly actually lands on one it will stay there ! !
5 #### When this Kit arrived I was pleasantly surprised at the completness and quality . The blow molded case is not excessive in size and holds everything just right . I 've used many other tools but never have I used a plate joiner . Today I can truely say I made the right choice . The adjustments are all evident and handy to reach . I made the tool ready for the cut in a snap . Placed the tool where I wanted the cut and " bam " with ease the cut came out exactly where I wanted it . I think the price and quality and ease of use makes this a five star winner !
1 #### Bought it in November , had n't used it yet ( no rats ) . Just put it out this week . It does n't work at all . Something is wrong with the mechanics / electrical . The return window closed after 60 days , but I 'll still be calling Amazon to return it for a refund or replacement .
5 #### I love this collection of knives . There are no rivets in the handle ( they are solid ) , so there is no place for bacteria to collect and grow . Professional grade and quality . I have other knives in this same collection that are almost 25 years years old . Other than putting a fresh edge on them from time to time , they are maintenance free and a great knife .
4 #### A good , sturdy tape , easy to read , with at least 10 ' of extension before it folds up ... very handy when working alone . I already have one , which I have used for about 3 years , and bought another ( this one ) to keep in the shop . Only negative is I wish the lock worked better . The lock lever is stiff and does n't lock the tape very well . Not that big of a deal , but somewhat annoying . Previous Stanley tapes I have had ( not Fat Max ) have had very good locking mechanisms . .
1 #### I 'm returning this item because it is not aluminum as advertised , it 's plastic and it is not the 3 " model , it 's smaller . This is a third party seller and is a rip off . However if a plastic small pad is what you need the price is good .
5 #### I would never buy another brand of lawn tool . I 'm never disappointed .
2 #### The reel mower sharpening Kit is okay . I had to call long distance regarding questions . The lady was very abrupt . The instructions are not clear . The instructions have 3 different languages which makes it difficult to read . The instructions were not clear on how to remove the wheel . The handle to turn the blades that came with the kit is really flimsy . I hand turned and hand turned the wheel to sharpen the blades about 10 minutes and did not see any improvement . Kinda disappointed in this product .
4 #### Really easy to use and clean . It is also very sharp
5 #### I am one of those people who , when I find something that works , I buy a bunch of them . So I have six of these . It is the perfect size for just about any utility job in the kitchen . They have all stayed very sharp and are built very well . Highly recommended .
5 #### I am please with the perfomance of this machine o far . The only problem is being mounted in a router table you have to keep blowind the sawdust out of the machine very ofting .
5 #### I purchased this for my daughter who has a very busy daily schedule . To help her stay away from fast foods , processed foods , I decided that this might be something that would make meal preparation faster and easier . She has used it several times with easy pressure cooker recipes and is very happy with her new gift . She can cook a small roast or chicken in no time instead of having to wait hours for her meal to be done . Food cooked in the pressure cooker also tastes so much better than microwaved food . It 's a five star for sure .
5 #### What else can I say . It is a classic that works as well as ever . A bargain and even made in USA .
5 #### Easy to clean : baked evenly - I subsequently ordered a bundt cover .
5 #### I have never owned a salad spinner before . I 'd seen them , but never really understood the need for one . I 've made several salads since purchasing this and there 's a huge difference when your greens are crisp and dry after washing them . Since I have no experience to compare it to , this spinner is wonderful . It 's simple to use and easy to clean . I love the locking mechanism on the top to keep the push part down after use . It 's perfect too , since you can store your greens right in it . I do n't know how I 've gone this long without owning a salad spinner , especially one that works this well , but I 'm happy that I 'm not without one anymore ! I received this product as part of a promotion in exchange for an honest and unbiased review .
4 #### This is not an astro clock , plus DLT is manual , not auto . The part I like is its super super easy unlike most timer clocks that require you to read the manual every time you set it .
5 #### Love this ! Bought primarily for camping , but love it so much use at home sometimes as well . Easy , Fast , Tasty ! The 6 - cup version makes me one large cup of excellent coffee- just what I was looking for . No grounds in my cup either .
5 #### This is the best bar to remove shingles when you are just replacing a few . Bar seems to have a better angle than other similar bars and is very comfortable to use .
1 #### These were advertised and pictured as the Henckels Classic steak knife , which are totally cool and well built . What showed up were cheap knives made in Singapore with serrated blades . Yuck . Returning quick . Disappointed .
5 #### I first purchased this item to mix my cold process soaps in however when it came it was too nice a product to use for soaps so I put it up to use for food . Weighty on the bottom with a nice grip handle . Holds 2 quarts .
5 #### I bought this mixing bowl to use for making popcorn . I got the recipe from Alton Brown , he uses this type of bowl . It works great~
5 #### This is really an excellent hose , heavy duty , well made , flexible . Much nicer than the one that came with my Sears Craftsman vac , which is lighter plastic and tends to fold and kink more . Good length . Good price
4 #### So , I got the compost in the mail . I opened the box , and the composts were all over the place . Good thing that they put the box inside a ziplock bag . If they did n't put the box inside ziplock bag , i 'm sure it would be one messy box . Anyways , other than that , it expedite the compost process . Good thing to have in the yard .
5 #### I use these at the grill . They are long and give a good grip . My wife does n't use them often since you have to slide a plate at the crotch to allow them to open ( the plate locks them in the closed position so then can be hung in a smaller space ) and she finds her shorter tongs that can not be locked are more convenient . If you are dealing with hot coals or flames , and having to reach a long was over them , these are for you .
5 #### want to destroy stuff ? This will do it ! Heavy , solid , does what it is supposed to do !
4 #### It is difficult to set the proper motion detection sensitivity setting . Not being able to do so defeats the purpose of the device and increases the likelihood of false activation . The device seemed to activate independent of movement when facing foliage simply blowing in the wind , but it did detect human movement during testing .
5 #### works great , but larger than expected ( did n't see the measurement i guess ) . use it primarily to catch coffee grounds from my french press to keep them from going down the drain , and the fine mesh does a good job at that .
5 #### OK , It 's a replacement Chain Saw Blade . It works extremely well and lasts a long time if you keep it out of the dirt . Now - a - days , it is cheaper to have new ones on hand as sharpening old blades costs the same or more than a new blade for the non - commercial user . For our lot , one blade has out - lasted 7 trees felled and cut into fireplace logs , average trunk base diameter 23 " ( ranged 18 " to 30 " ) , average height 28 ' and is still cutting nearly as well as it did when new .
2 #### These are exactly like the Coolaroo Shade Fabric Butterfly Clips 20 - Count at less than half the price . EXCEPT the Coolaroo brand has all the male pins on the same side and Easy Gardener has the small male pins on one side and the 2 large ones on the other . This makes it impossible to push the fabric onto the pins before you close it . If you do not push the fabric into the pins first they do n't close as tightly .
5 #### These things are great . Use teeth to create torque . If you can get the pinchers around the branch , it is going to cut it .
5 #### 1st use 4 - 25 - 16 evening . OMG . No kidding . I set it on my porch for 10 min . Took the dogs out for a walk , normally I 'm swarmed with mosquitoes . I did n't see , feel or get bit by one . Neither did my dog , if I saw one on her I 'd put the thermacell by her . It would be gone . Next test tomorrow , walk through the woods back close to a canal where mosquitoes swarm something awful . I live in S.E. rural . Georgia , gnats and mosquitoes are a fact of life . Will report tomorrow 4 - 26 - 16 .
5 #### Until you try these , you wo n't realize how poorly most kitchen implements are designed . I bought there not long after I bought my Oxo can opener , and I 'm slowly buying all their tools . The peeler in particular is a wonder . Unlike most peelers , it does n't cut into your palm or slip , and it seems to just glide over cucumbers .
5 #### Love these as a pocket Wrench . especially with a pair of small channel locks . Have to replace every few years when I lose one . The size reference for both Metric and SAE is a nice feature .
5 #### I 'll admit I was a little leery about buying plastic garden tools , but these plastic ( um , I mean , composite ) tools are VERY sturdy and strong . We 're not talking thin , weak plastic here . This tool is more than suitable for garden and yard work . Plus , the price is right ! It 's a fantastic garden tool .
5 #### Excellent for the two of us and very light vs our larger stainless steel one . I would recommend this item .
5 #### No problems here . It 's a strainer and it strains . It looks like it 's made well and like it will last for quite a while .
2 #### This should have been a beautiful , first quality , chrome blade pocket knife . This item is a second with a bad scratch on the large blade . Not worth sending back but not heirloom quality . The next time I want a nice knife , I will buy from a brick & mortar store ..... which is not my style .
5 #### Well made heavy duty chain clamp . I could n't have replaced my fan clutch without it . Probably will not use it often but will be indispensible in some situations .
4 #### I purhcased this a few weeks ago from Amazon . I played around on scrap while getting the hang of it . It is easy to setup and use . I used it making some fluted trim and the vac port worked ok when working near the edge but hooking the shop vac directly to the Dewalt plunge router worked better . All in all well worth the money . A fellow woodworker
5 #### I could ot believe it --- i NEARLY BREAK FINGERS trying to get these belts on this cleaner - always running over something that cuts the belts ... and then I saw AMAZON had the RIGHT SIZE HOOVER BELT - only I did not know it but for years have used the wrong size - this one size fits all stuff with offbeat brands because it is difficult for me to shop about to find these . I put this Hoover belt in in minutes ---- the secret to easy installatin after it is in place ready to put around the brush roll is to pull the thing down and pushed down on the left side and right side at the same time --- THEN ADJUSTING THE RIGHT SIDE ...... IT TAKES STRONGER FINGERS BUT AFTER USING THESE OTHER BELTS this was easy for I DETEST PUTTING BELTS IN THIS CLEANER --- no wonder ---- this one size fits all is not cracked up what it is said to do . So I can recommend this to those who have a Hoover Windtunnel --- I bought four of these and now watch before I turn on vacuum to be sure changing these belts is a nuisance but this Hoover I remember from the time I was a child in the 1930 time frame and prefer to a DYSON ANY DAY . Connie the seller delivered as promised -- price is good --- AND ITS THE RIGHT SIZE
5 #### Got to love a pruner that is ergonomically correct and puts pressure on the bush and not your thumb and forefinger . Got to love a pruner that stays sharp after many seasons of work . Got to love a pruner that stays rust - free even though we leave it out on the back porch . Should n't come as a surprise : We love anything Fiskars !
5 #### Agreat product that works well on my Fienn . I would reccomend this product to any one in the woodworking trade
5 #### First - Amazon ... you are TOPS ! ! Second to none ! With that said - these brackets are perfect , reasonable . As someone else wrote " the hardware was not sufficient " proved to be true . But I always have that stuff on hand , I used my on hand hardware and saved theirs for some other project . Very study , heavy duty - but not too heavy for the wall . I am hoping to buy more ! !
5 #### perfect cleans the water perfect and buring under ground to hide it was a great idea
5 #### Worth the $ . So much better than most of them .
5 #### I recently bought this mower and I absolutely love it ! It mows great and leaves my lawn looking wonderful . It pushes as easy as my old gas mower and is easier to back up and get around beds and trees . The only negative thing is that due to the wheels and cutter , it does not mow as close but I just trim with a hand trimmer . I would recommend everyone to try this ! Even my dad who used the old time reel mowers was so impressed with it ! You can visit with neighbors and hear the birds singing while you mow ! It is great and it takes me less time to mow since you do n't have to take time to start your mower and add $ 4.20 a gallon gas every time you mow !
5 #### I ordered this belt for my vacuum and it turned out to be the wrong one . GoVacuum customer service researched the correct belt and offered to not only give me a refund , but send the correct belt free of charge . Very nice people to deal with and extremely knowledgeable about products . They get a A+ from me .
3 #### I use this as a primary burner to cook a solution of anhydrous boric acid , borax , and ethylene glycol to obtain disodium octaborate tetrahydrate for wood treatment for mold , fungi and to kill and deter insect pests . It heats the solution to 125 C and keeps it there to crack the water of crystallization from the disodium decaborate to yield the alkaline salt final product fairly well . However , if you leave this assembly outside as I do , it inevitably gets rust forming in the gas ports and causes a very frustrating spitting and flame blowout . Very bothersome to keep lighting this . I usually stick a 2 x 2 oak stick already burning between the pot and the burner to make sure the flame stays lit . Otherwise , it is OK . I would n't cook a turkey using it though .
5 #### Two settings bright and very fricken BRIGHT ! Works great for reading when my wife is trying to sleep and I 'm not . Clips to books or the head board easily . Flexible to find the just right position .
5 #### I 've made about 12 batches of food in this pressure cooker in the last couple weeks , and it works great . Mostly I 've used it to make beans that I 've pre - soaked for at least 4 hours . Use the cooking times in the included cookbook , because this thing cooks so fast , you can overcook your food if you use other recipe guides !
5 #### Probably the best ( readable ) cheap square that you will find . I bought two of these , and compared them against a variety of machinist , and construction squares I have , and found them to be SQUARE !
5 #### The reason I titled this review perfect for me is that this leaf shredder is perfect for my compost pit , and the way I care for my yard . I do not prefer to rake my yard , I use my Black and Decker mulching mower to not only pick up my leaves but keep my yard looking trim . So what I do is , mow and bag at the same time and empty my mowers bag into the leaf shredder . This reduces my leaves and whatever is in the mowers bag to virtually powder form . Within a few weeks if kept moist it makes beautiful mulch . This machine is made for , and works with , leaves and vegetation . Sticks and stones will break the plastic strings so do n't put them in there .
1 #### Then go with the Ninja Master Prep . I bought both and the Cusinart turned an onion into mush . When i tried to just pulse it the pieces were very inconsistant , so I pulsed a little more and it turned it to mush . On the New Ninja Master Prep . It has only pulse one speed , but its more powerful and the mini base has four blades , two like the cusinart and two more above them so if you put a half an onion in and give it one short pulse your done . I had to chop garlic the Ninja chopped it up perfectly . Its more money than the mini cusinart but its a much better unit .
5 #### The pressure cooker works great . The quality is amazing but make sure you add plenty of water .
4 #### It 's a great fan . Way better than the $ 20 box fans from supermarket of CVS or box - stores . The reversibility and the cfms are good . It comes out of its frame for easier cleaning , ... still not easy , but easier . The frame is cheap plastic and it can rattle on some speeds . Overall I like the fan . I 'd get another one if I needed it . I 'd give it 5 stars if the frame were heavier duty to match the fan itself .
1 #### do n't believe all these five star reviews , I 've gone through two bottles of this product and have black spot still coming out on new growth .
5 #### Perfect for our kitchen ! Very well made ! Large size ! This wide mesh strainer will hold up to heavy use . I love it !
5 #### I use it to hog off wood to get down to where my hand planes are more effective , Kinda like a fore plane . Good stuff .
5 #### I bought this due to redoing my back deck . The old deck had rotted over the years from lack of maintenance from the previous owner . My dad came down to help with the deck but he managed to hurt himself while we were ripping up the old deck . So I had to reinstall the new decking myself . I was not aware that this could be done by one person till I was looking around amazon and stumbled onto the BoWrench . I ordered it and got it the next day due to free amazon prime NDA shipping which worked out great since I needed it quickly to finish the deck . And let me tell you this tool is awesome . It is as easy as putting it on a joist and tighting it up against the flooring you are putting in . It allows you to have the extra hand to install decking yourself .
2 #### As others have pointed out , the straps are a joke . You 'll never be able to keep them untangled or consistently connected to the sprayer . After about a year the wand connections leaked . I replaced the wand but the wand depressurizing mechanism would not engage -- misaligned plastic . Shortly after that , the bottom of the tank leaked . In any case I 've moved on to a no - leak Smith sprayer .
5 #### Price is right , they are sharp and work as expected
5 #### This is a well - designed , attractive feeder that does what it promises : feeds the birds , but not the squirrels . I stupidly forgot to bring in the feeder one night not long after I bought it , and it got trashed by a bear . But I got out my rubber mallet , pounded it back into shape , made a couple of repairs and added some reinforcements . The side coil mechanisms that control the weight at which the bunkers close were undamaged in the onslaught , so it still works , even if it is n't quite as pretty as it was pre - bruin . I would definitely buy this feeder again ( and will have to , if my memory does n't improve ) .
4 #### These filters worked great ! I have allergies that flair up during peak seasons and these filters have greatly improved my symptoms and air quality in our home . They are the right size and the exact same quality as filters I have purchased at our local stores . I did do some price comparison and , depending on the weekly sales , they can be A LITTLE cheaper to buy locally . However , if you have Prime shipping , there will be little to no difference . I will gladly continue to purchase these through Amazon , have them conveniently shipped to my door , and avoid any store crowds .
5 #### love , love , love this ... it is beautiful and looks even better than the picture , what a great find and perfect for outdoors ...
5 #### I 've only used it on apples so far , works perfectly and no complaints !
1 #### went bad in one direction after a couple of months . only works going towards me , not towards the sink . makes it rather difficult !
5 #### Wether you are doing furniture work or moulding installsalation , this hammer is for the finish nails that you will be using .
3 #### I have many OXO products , they are generally well made , well designed and competitively priced . I had put this item in my cart yesterday at $ 6.99 just waiting to verify the new ss frying pans I am also purchasing . When I came back today to place the order the price had increased to $ 12.99 . I purchased a Norpro flat whisk instead for $ 8.48 . It kind of felt like a bait and switch . 1 item in your Saved Items has changed price . OXO Good Grips Better Flat Wire Whisk has increased from $ 6.99 to $ 12.99
4 #### As planting baskets go , there 's not much to say . They 're all pretty similar . This one is heavy enough and well made . I expect it to last forever .
2 #### bought this product because it said good for hardwood floors , i do not think it works well on my floors or rug . would not recommend this product .
4 #### They are okay . The way the tong claws come together is very pointed , thus trying to scoup / claw foods that are n't particularly bulky is problematic . Besides that , they are good tongs .
5 #### This little thing kicks butt ! ! ! It has great suction and is very light . After I beat it up sucking up all kinds of sawdust and dirt during kitch / bath renovation my parents stole it from me to use in their Florida garage . They love it too ! ! !
5 #### This popcorn popper pops all the kernals ! ! I love it ! I do n't use the top for butter as it does n't melt the butter enough to go all over the popcorn . I could melt it and when it is almost done ... pour it in where the butter would sit .
3 #### Blade seemed cheaper than the other models . Not as high quality . The handle had very sharp corners , which made it uncomfortable to use for longer periods . I returned it and found a better Henckels model on sale for almost the same price .
5 #### It 's twine that I will be using at Thanksgiving . Looks durable , there is a lot of it , the price was good . Thank you .
4 #### No signal lose or connection issues to report . The sockets are easy to get to and coaxial connection was a breeze .
5 #### Best can opener we 've ever owned . We were constantly buying new ones . They would seem solid at first then would wear out after a few months . Not this one . It 's solid , well - built and required very little force to get through even the sturdiest of cans . Nice looking can opener as can openers go as well . Very happy we bought this . Had it for several months and works as well today as it did the day we received it .
5 #### This set allows accommodations for any size wire bit . Works perfectly and I recommend this collet nut kit to anyone needing to use small guage bits .
4 #### I love this but it is more of a pain than making regular tea . Tastes a lot better perfect for lazy Saturday mornings when you do n't have to go anywhere .
4 #### Its a labor intensive job to set this sprinkler up in your yard . Lots of garden hose placement is necessary but once done it gets the job of watering the lawn done in an easy fashion . Its a well build , heavy duty , unit .
5 #### Love the guide holes so I can work much faster and more efficiently
5 #### Equal to those for sale at the store bur a fraction of the cost .
4 #### Grates fine , but I always pinch my fingers in the hinge .
4 #### Good Price again . Using this for an extension cord for my plasma cutter .
5 #### I bought these to go in our vehicles and they are the perfect size to stow away .
1 #### This worked for two weeks , then burned out . It 's ' WAY too expensive to buy one of these so often ! ! I 'm so disappointed because Flowtron has always been my go - to for things like this . Not anymore .
5 #### Simply put , this is my favorite axe of all time . It 's light weight - so you can swing it all day without getting sore . The handle is comfortable and easy to hold even while wearing gloves . The blade works amazingly well as both a splitting axe and a felling axe . I bought it skeptically 3 years ago - and it has stood up to weekly use with ease . Would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in a new axe . Plus it 's a great price !
5 #### Pros : -cleaver take - down design allows for versatility , and ease of cleaning -very easy to use and manipulate Cons : None
5 #### Beautiful in looks and sound . I have purchased three Woodstock brand chimes now , and love every one . Great price , and great product .
5 #### Works as good as any on my table saw . Will help even a cheap blade cut better .
1 #### Not even close . When the thermometer arrived it read 95 degrees I the pond . I thought maybe it had been Ina warm place so checked back 110 in the pond with swimming fish and plants etc . Right now it is 45 degrees air temperature outside and the thermometer reads 75 . Vendor refunded money and did n't even want me to send it back . The design is nice with a float that is easily attached or removed . Too bad it does n't work .
5 #### My first plate jointer was a Ryobi model , after many months of use it started to whine and sound like the bearing was failing . I got ride of it and purchased a DeWalt plate jointer . What a quality tool this is , far ahead in Quality over the Ryobi model I had . This is one of those tools that once you own it you ask yourself how you ever got any accuracy without it . As far as power , accuracy , and adjustments it was rock solid engineering right out of the box . I use this tool mostly for cabinet construction and fine furniture work . The DeWalt 682 K just does what it was designed to do and I 'm quite happy with this tool . Thanks DeWalt !
1 #### I really have n't noticed any difference after I put this in the pond . I will reserve my final opinion until Fall when the weather cools down some .
4 #### I really like this whisk , just wish it was smaller . Wires are flexible and seem to be fuse well into the handle . Here is a pic of a regular size which compared to the black one .
5 #### This is a great stand , I installed a small table saw on it . The saw is wider then the stand 's base but it is stable and does not move or tip at all . I did have to cut the legs down 6 inches for the saw to be the right height ( a grinder made quick work of it ) . In all the stand is very well built made from heavy gauge steel parts , carriage bolts , and rubber feet , this stand could hold up my truck ! The only con I see is the top of the stand is only 10 " wide . If i were to mount a drill press , grinder , or band saw i would buy and use this stand again .
3 #### I do n't like the rubber handle . I prefer a wooden riveted one . it sharpens just okay . My oil stone gets more use than this does and i bought this so i did n't always have to use the stone but it seem I still do as it just does n't sharpen quite good enough .
5 #### This thing works great .... but after a week , it really starts smelling bad and trust me , I mean it smells worse that a dead animal ! I did not risk just throwing it away in the trash as per instruction .... I did not want it to leak in my trash can . I put it in a zip lock and carefully put it in the trash .
5 #### I had a cheap pruner that became really awkward to use ( the spring bent , and then it kept falling out ) ; the handle was falling apart , etc . Instead of buying another cheap pruner that would fall apart after a couple of years , I decided to spend a little extra and get one that would last . I 'm very pleased with this Felco . I visited their website first in order to make sure I was getting the model that was right for me ( and to view all of their models and their differences ) . I use the pruner for small tree branches , shrubs , and flowers . It cuts clean and easy with minimal effort . It fits well in my hand . And it is built to last . I highly recommend it . I suspect that this is the last hand pruner that I will need to buy ( and that was my intention ) . Amazon was the seller .
2 #### Killed my fish even though it was applied as directed .
5 #### Great clamp for mitres . Hard to get set up by yourself , but once you do , holds work very securley .
5 #### This is a great 3 piece set ... I use it all the time in my Toaster Oven .... which is a lot ! As a widower and now cooking for one , I rarely use my big oven and these make working in the toaster oven a breeze : ... Love Nordic Ware ... super Heavy Duty products !
5 #### Just what I wanted for my indoor fountain . Thank you
5 #### Made building my deck easier . Well balanced fires each time does not jam .
5 #### I used a bundt pan that was too small for recipes and would have batter remaining . Not any more and bakes evenly . Well made construction that conducts heat evenly throughout cake . Original sometimes is best . If ai nt broke do n't fix it .
5 #### We love this product . We live in the country and have 10 wood racks on our property . This is such an easy and stable piece to use . The only change we made is to put a board across the end pieces to keep them stable
2 #### A contractor here bought one of these recently and i tried it and liked it . Smooth with great trigger response . only complaint I had was the trigger was so long that if one gets into trouble you ca n't let go the trigger without letting go the drill ( a bad move sometimes ) . My beloved makita 6303 suffered a mishap ( my bad ) and so I bought the milwaukee but it makes unnerving sounds and some vibration . A sort of clacking sound , sounds like gears . I even compared side by side with the contractors new one just to make sure I was n't imagining it . Nope , sounded terrible . I think it has to do with the spotty qc on chinese made tools . I returned it . It cost more , but I ordered a makita dp4000 since I liked my previous makita 1/2 drill so well . Have n't received it yet .
4 #### These stakes were exactly what I needed to hold up shade cloth to keep my potted vegetables from getting too much sun . The price was great - the ones I found at a local garden center were being sold individually for over $ 1.00 each .
3 #### UPDATE 1 April 2014 : I went to reorder this filter and found that the price had increased by 48 % in the 18 months since I last purchased it . I ordered it anyway and received an actual VF4000 filter made by Rigid . The first time I ordered , I received an non - OEM filter ( see original review below ) supplied by GoVacuum . This time , the filter was supplied by Central Vacuum . I guess there 's a 48 % premium for an actual Rigid filter , but to be honest , the aftermarket filter worked as well as the OEM . ORIGINAL REVIEW : My 6 gallon Rigid shop vac says it takes VF4000 , VF5000 or VF6000 filters . Amazon claims that this one is a " Rigid VF4000 Standard Filter for WetDry Vac , by Rigid " . Pretty clear , right ? You 're going to get a filter made by the company that made the vacuum . Not so fast ... What Amazon actually ships is a filter made by Green Klean , " Designed as a Replacement for VF 4000 " . A note on the box says : " This is not a product , nor is it sponsored or endorsed by RIGID , Inc. " The filter does fit my Rigid shop vac , and it seems to work . Time will tell if it will last as long as the original Rigid filters . I am not happy with Amazon for their misleading product description . I might have bought the filter if they had described it accurately , but I would like the ability to make an informed decision about it .
5 #### So far so good ! These fit well in all my G9 specific light fixtures . For us they are mostly in our bathroom light fixtures . I choose the 25W ones because the 40W ones are damn bright . As some reviewers have noted you have to be careful not to touch the glass as I believe the grease / dirt from your hands reduces some of the life of the bulb , maybe ? Either way does n't take much to use a toilet paper " square " and avoid touching the bulb when you insert it in . For use so far ( its bee maybe 2 weeks ) they are working fine and give enough light that we feel it was a good purchase . Good luck !
5 #### This was a recommended addition to my purchase of the " Frigidaire FAD704DWD Energy Star 70 - pint Dehumidifier " . I use a gravity drain to a French Drain in the basement . The dehumidifier is about 10 ' from a hole into the drain and this hose did the job nicely . It comes rolled up and I had to run hot water thru it and then lay it out on the blacktop driveway in the hot sun to get it to lay straight .
5 #### My house is 17 years old and I had so many plugs that were loose and would not grip what was plugged into them . I have replaced about 10 of these so far without any issues and their " grip " is very tight .
5 #### These work really well getting into small spaces . They are perfect for grass ... even thick grass , but they are not designed for thick weeds or for suckers coming off of trees .
5 #### Easy to use and drys excess water off lettuce . I use this spinner a lot . Definilty a good buy and would recommend anyone who eats a lot of lettuce to buy this .
5 #### Love my vacuum , it has good pick up and helps to make my house work allot easier .
5 #### Those little spaceships really work . This is our 2nd year using them . They have no chemicals or smell so can be set up anywhere in the house , make very effective night lights , and buying the refills is much better than having to purchase all new equipment every season too . We even keep one in the camper . This flea system is an excellent investment for your home . I do recommend it .
3 #### Very precise , but wobbles if you are n't careful . Unless you have a need for this more than once or twice a year , I 'd recommend something made out of steel
2 #### This cooker does not have a pressure control ... 5 pounds 10 - 15 pressure as my old cooker had ... otherwise ok ..
5 #### The router is heavy , powerful , and solid . If you need this kind of power , you are probably going to use it is a table mounted situation anyway , so the weight really is n't such a problem . This router should have all the power you will ever want . Getting the bit 's in and out and loosening and tightening the base for adjustment can put a world of hurt on your hands . It is expensive too ( You might look elsewhere if you are going to use this on just one project ) . Even with the little nags , this is one of the prize tools in my collection .
5 #### Not cheap -- but if you need to do hinges , yes it 's a must ( took me a fraction of the time then without )
5 #### Could not beleive this unit worked for the price . I looked around and found many more for much higher price . This one was awesome .
4 #### Works well with smaller potatoes . Can only use the large size cutter , no possible way to use the smaller size cutter .
1 #### Nozzle did not work . The liquid inside has no odor like it was just water . Have bought in past and was fine . I contacted company .
5 #### I needed to find something to keep my hummingbird feeders clean and these little brushes do the trick . They are sturdy and have gone through three seasons of cleaning so far and still look and perform as if they were brand new . They thoroughly get the little feeding holes clean which I was n't doing with a toothbrush . I highly recommend them to anyone with feeders to clean .
1 #### Bought one of these years ago and loved it . Bought a new one and it 's garbage . The blade wo n't withdraw completely up into the handle . Not making them like they used to .
5 #### Just what the plants needed . Not much more to say . I will update if anything special happens .
5 #### When you buy a new plug in phone the cord to the ear / mouth piece is so short . Now when my Mom needs to get up she wo n't be roped to her desk . Received in 2 days in brand new condition . The seller did eveything a person could do to make purchasing on Amazon great ... Thank You
5 #### have not used yet but i 'm sure I will like it if I get a chance an see a need
4 #### Somehow my old metal version of this kind of peeler disappeared . With the available options on the market , I still wanted the old style peeler like this . Being a lover of OXO products , I jumped at this one , despite it being $ 5-$7 more than the metal one at the end of the grocery aisle . I 've been very pleased with this purchase , and love ( as usual ) the rubber grip of the handle . I had been concerned the " eye remover " ( for potatoes ) would n't be as effective , being thick black plastic , but OXO designed it so well that you do n't notice a difference . It 's insanely sharp , though , so when you peel a potato , for instance , the sliver you just peeled sometimes stays right there in place ( totally sliced off ) . You ca n't even tell you just cut something . . . and I simply brush it away with my hand and continue . This is not a complaint as much as a silly fact . Spend the extra few bucks , and get this peeler over any other standard option ! You 'll be very happy . :)
5 #### Upgraded to this from a bodum press . It was a bigger upgrade than I imagined it would be . The filter worked great , no wasted coffee in the bottom to avoid getting a mouthful of grinds and it pressed incredibly easily and smoothly . I also like how it seemed to class up my dorm 's kitchen counter , it just plain looks fancy .
2 #### To easy to slid off .. Also it 's a touch light - just touch it slightly and you have turned it on .. (Not suppose to be touch light ) . So be Careful , you will run your battery down before you know it .. Not very bright , so if you accidentally turn it on ( by touching it ) with other lights on , you might not see it , then next time you need it - battery will be dead ...
2 #### I have my old machine from Sear Lure is not reguire it was heavy . Sorry to get rid of it . The new one was not really working right . hardly kill bug .
5 #### I bought one of these over 15 years ago . It is still working like a charm . In all this time , I have seen one Squirrel get to the seed , and it was only fleeting . This feeder works . I love watching the squirrels slide off the roof trying to get to the seed . Eventually they quit and just move on .
4 #### I find myself using this handy gadget several times a week . I love the fact I do n't have to stand over a frying pan watching and waiting to turn something . My cooked meats fish and poultry come out more juicy . The one draw back is the cleaning up . Especially the flat basket . Unless you soak it before washing , it will maintain pieces of cooked on foods , out of the dishwasher . Over all the trade off is well worth it . For those watching their fat intake the " air baked " french fries are a fine alternative . This machine has made this guy one better cook .
5 #### The other reviewers were n't kidding . This is ( what I see ) a typical OXO kitchen tool . Heavy duty , good looking , and no groaning or bending when you attack really hard ice cream . Add to that a handle large enough to put some serious carving power behind , and it comes up a winner .
2 #### After looking at these on Amazon at two different prices , I chose the higher priced item thinking it would be better ( wrong ! ) , they are made in China and sometimes they work a little and other times not at all . Do not trust these to keep your plants watered .
3 #### It does help my seedlings if they are all at the same height , but the bulb covers such a small area , the seedlings start to " stretch " to the light .. only a swath of approx 2 " wide is directly under the light . I thought there would be more diverted light . I do like the stand .
5 #### Well , even a blind person can see that its a square . . . What more do you need to know . got these so I can put duck tape on where I want to stop cutting when cutting out my square 1 gain outlet holes in the dry wall .
5 #### Works great as a small pressure sprayer . It saved me from throwing out 2 containers of Roundup weed killer .
5 #### I broke my old one that has been faithfully by my side for years . Was surprised that it would break like it did ( right on the bend ) . Anyhow , this has proven a suitable replacement so far . Combined with a large dead blow hammer , this is a virtual wrecking ball .
3 #### These are not BluMat brand , they are generic . But they work if you are careful to make sure you soak them first and make sure there is water in the plastic tube . Without water in the tube , it will not draw water from the reservoir . Easiest way to do it is to suck it up . Not as gross as it sounds , and it is very effective . There are videos on how to use them , be sure to check the video and make sure it is what you want . We use them when on vacation .
5 #### These are the best filters for us , as they do the job without restricting airflow . At this excellent price , we stocked up .
5 #### I accidentally ordered 2 of these . They are so sturdy , I kept the extra one . Beats going to Home Depot .
5 #### The price is right in the money , handy and a great addition for my little home - shop . thanks I will use it lots
5 #### I put this switch on my bathroom fan . It seems like no one ever remembers to turn off the bathroom fan , so this way there is no way for it to run all day . Also , more people use it since they do n't have to remember to come back to turn it off .
5 #### This works great .... I just need to remember to get it out every time I need it .
3 #### Althought these filter come in a 2 pak . once you open the filter pkg one filter is left unwrapped and exposed . I only have need of one filter at a time but wanted the economy of a 2 pak to save time and the hassle of buying every 3 mos . So I wrapped the unused item in plastic wrap- but I will make sure if I purchase in future the filters are individually wrapped .
4 #### The hummingbirds love this ... they hover in line waiting to feed ..
5 #### Heavy duty is correct . No hyperbole here . This is a rugged heavy duty hose that gets the job done with no leaks , no holes , and added durability .
4 #### This is the best way to measure liquids for recipes ! The blue lettering is a little tough to read if you 're older , but otherwise it works great .
5 #### I bought these for cleaning my George Foreman , and it does work good for that . But I also use if for cleaning other nonstick pans .
1 #### Failure rate is extremely high on these sure pop series sprinklers . I have over 20 of these installed in my yard and half of them have failed within 4 years . Since broken sprinklers are not necessarily noticed immediately , any failure can lead to huge wasted water costs . I 've since replaced all of them with the 1800 series or unibody series sprinklers .
5 #### I resisted buying one of these 'cause , how hard is it to knock the peel off with a knife , really ? But this exceeded my expectations and does it so easy , plus easy to clean .
4 #### The biggest problem in cleaning spots and stains out of furniture and area rugs is lugging around a heavy piece of equipment . This Hoover is small enough to carry with ease and fills simply from the top . It even has a built in mechanism so it ca n't overflow . I liked its performance overall and found it as good , if not better then other household machines . Of course it seems to work best with the cleaner it came with but since it 's an economical product that is n't a problem either . The best feature it has is two separate tanks which means you wo n't end up cleaning your sofa with dirty water . Overall this product is a good investment and pasys for itself in one use .
5 #### I bought this for trim work on cabinets and cupboards . I have no complaints , it 's simple to use and I recommend it to anyone who wants precise angles .
2 #### The idea for this is fantastic - it can measure just about anything and is very handy in the kitchen . BUT ... the durability is pretty bad . Mine has hazed and has cracks and it 's not really made for heavy use in the kitchen . It would be good if this was made of Pyrex or even a really tough plastic . I am not going to buy another .
5 #### Plate joiner .... Should have got this years ago , It cuts exactly as It needs too , makes me feel stupid for ever trying it with a router .
5 #### We used the garden cloth to construct a bunny cage . Works well , does n't aggravate our rabbit and it 's easy to clean .
5 #### Bought this check ph of soil but have not used it yet has have garden inn already and seems to be doing fine
4 #### For something so lightweight , it works very well to deter birds from eating the fruits on the tree . The netting is so thin and see through that it does n't get in the way of watering and checking for growth . I also like the long yardage which made it easy to wrap around the tree to get a complete coverage . Will definitely buy again
4 #### Works real well . I would almost advise getting the version with the fixed metal handle . After putting a screw in it generally breaks and the handle is free . I put two in and it still broke . It actually is not a big deal to have the handle loose and I 'm not surprised the screw breaks .
5 #### This is a great tea ball , easy to clean , easy to see inside . Only improvement would be to make it a bit larger .
5 #### This is a major improvement over the OXO natural bristles vegetable brush . It feels comfortable in the hand and does the job well .
5 #### I was at the end of my rope trying to beat the squirrels . I was almost ready to give up feeding the birds when I purchased this feeder . It is really squirrel proof for me . I hang mine from a large pole . Holds a big supply of food . I did attach some small clamps to the handle on the inside of feeder . The handle was only held in place using tension . The clamps make sure that the handle can not pop out . Not a big deal , and the small clamps were inexpensive ,
5 #### This works great for carrying just a few knives or items . I also have a larger Shun knife bag that 's rather large and carries more equipment . The Shun is great for travelling with a lot of items , but sort of bulky if you are just needing to take a couple items with you . The Henckels works much better for less items and easier to access your knives . Also I think my Shun bag was $ 50 + . Regarding some of the reviews saying this is cheap and knives fall out , I would guess the people are not using as intended . You knife handles go in the mesh , not the blade . The mesh is tight enough to hold the handles to prevent them from falling out ( plus the flap for the blades ) but is not tight enough to hold a blade in and not durable enough to prevent them from cutting through . That 's why there is a large flap , to go over the blades to prevent them from cutting or touching other blades .
5 #### I added the pull switch to a 4 foot fluorescent fixture , retrofitted with LED . Seems to work well and has an easy pull .
5 #### i have used these before they work great if the birds do n't eat them
5 #### This flashlight should be on every 18v DeWalt owners must have list . An excellent value combined with outstanding function . Nicely done DeWalt . A nice upgrade would be a LED bulb kit , otherwise perfect .
5 #### Great because I can now read the scale without my glasses .
5 #### We have a small 12x15 yard and a neighborhood alley cat was using it as his personal crapping ground . I had to shovel up + \-5 patties every time I went out there . Ever since I installed this sprinkler there has n't been a stir in my back yard without the perpetrator getting blasted . I would have paid 100 bucks for this thing if I knew how well it works . Our nasty yard has turned into a nice clean area .
4 #### I had suet feeders at my old address , but left them behind . So when I bought a suet for here , I tied it around with twine , it held very well , but did not interest the birds . So I got the cage , they seem to recognize it better and have since been using it .
5 #### If I had bought this sooner , I would have washed way less quinoa down the drain . This is a great strainer and I am really pleased with this purchase ! It is going to pay for itself very quickly !
5 #### This is what I needed in my 4 X 4
2 #### The cheap plastic gears in this break almost every time the sprinkler goes off the hose track and ends up grinding itself up against an object until it breaks the gears . Nelson is very unhelpful in fixing it or telling you how to , and they obviously make a lot of of after sales money selling very expensive motor / gears kits to people who are dumb enough to invest more money into this cheaply made sprinkler
5 #### This is a great product which is exactly what I wanted . The product is well designed and manufactured .
5 #### I love this whisk ! The handle is a comfy rubber that does n't tire your wrist . It more tines than any other whisk I 've owned which is a good thing because eggs and cream whip faster .
5 #### No more putting up the grill everynight when camping and this cover is heavy duty also .
4 #### Excellent value . It 's compact with lots of suction and easy to maneuver . I use I in my workshop as a shop vac . Recommended .
2 #### Sorry . After three weeks I have caught 4 yellow jackets . I wonder how long the trap was hanging around before I bought it . My guess is the attractant was just tired and went to sleep .
5 #### Very good high efficient , filter that traps most all the dust trapped inside our holmes .
5 #### Works at keeping deer and coons out of the garden . Need more than one for a large garden .
5 #### have nt used it yet but looks well constructed and durable . super fast shipping
5 #### I have tried many nutrient systems over the last 2 years . Techniflora gave me almost instant results , with at least double the growth compared to others I have tried .
5 #### Fast delivery , good price and works great . What else can I say
5 #### I love Weber grills - in my opinion a good value for the money . And , for the price I think this Q200 is an incredible deal . The design is phenomenal : simple and sturdy and I 'm confident this thing will last for quite a while . I have friends who 've used the Q series for years and swear by them for portability but top notch grilling as well . Is there a better tailgating or car camping grill ? Show me . I bought this because we 're low on storage space so I need to be able to put this away periodically without it taking up the entire storage shed . I still ca n't believe I had this grill up and running out of the box in 5 minutes . The last grill I bought took me a heck of a lot longer to assemble . I recommend ! ! Do n't delay .
5 #### Excellent , will greatly extend the life of my ladder , stop damage to existing walls .
5 #### Every one of the hose nozzles I 've used has failed in a few years . Except this one . It 's the only one I 've left out back over the winter and has survived the freeze thaw and the snow . I 've left it through two winters of snow and ice attached to the hose and it still works great . Plus it functions so well . The worst thing I can say about it is it 's tricky to fit under some car wheel wells but that 's fine for having a functional nozzle that does what it is supposed to do year and year . EDIT : 10/16/13 and I have two of these nozzles and one still stays outside all winter and both still work perfectly .
1 #### I will never buy this particular finch sack again ! Thank God I had some thistle that I could use because these are only half full and not ready to hang . I find the cost of these is ridiculous for half full socks .
4 #### This is our first bug zappy . We 're very happy about it . At night , we can hear it kills hundreds of mosquitoes and other bugs . And we feel the quantity of mosquitoes is less when sappy is in use at night .
4 #### This is our go to popper at work . Love it .
4 #### 4 stars only because we had to replace our other one . It fell on the ground and the way it hit made it snap in 2 . I have dropped lots of Henkles , but none has broken before or since . This knife stays sharp . Never sharpened our last one in 10 years . This one has not needed it either .
5 #### This is the second doweling jig I 've owned . It centers on the wood ( front to back ) far better than my first jig , but is more difficult to use . The viewing ports for aligning left to right are small and difficult to see through . Although using the alignment marks is tedious , I ca n't complain because I 've drilled about 100 holes so far and the pieces have lined up very well . You will need a set of drill bit collars to go with this jig .
5 #### So far so good . Made of durable metal and have a nice feel in your hand . These are a great length and strong enough to pick up heavy pieces of meat .
5 #### This is a really nice lite and it really helps to see what you are doing . I think that it should come with the saw for what the saw cost . Not sure if I`d buy again .
5 #### Good , sturdy pair of tongs with a nice feel in the hand . Evenly balanced and stays closed in the drawer for storage with a simple push of the top . I was leery of paying so much for a disposable kitchen utensil , but somehow I think these will last quite some time . They are good OXO quality and grasp the meat / whatever you are grasping with a firm grip . Came out of the dishwasher looking brand new . Do n't know how the black plastic on the handle will hold up over repeated use / washing , but am willing to give them a try . I bought the 9 " and the larger pair 12 " , and both work extremely well and feel like a good sturdy pair of tongs .
4 #### Work great plus their getting expensive so buy in bulk !
3 #### Seems to work fine , went together ok . The red lifts can be in the way unless you rotate them to your advantage . Other than that , I 'd do it again .
5 #### This product does a great job . It is priced right and well constructed . I would recommend heartily . A real buy !
4 #### does what i need it to , but be aware there is no gasket on the seal so it is not air / water tight ... handles clasp firmly and no worries of coming undone ... if i changed one thing it 'd be that i wish it had straight sides inside
1 #### I bought this ten years ago . Does n't mash well , since it crushes into gooey pulp rather than cutting through . Waste of time ... waste of money .
4 #### Still too early to say how well this product works overall , but given that my growing medium has no base nutrients , this product ( along with fish emulsion and a few other additives ) have kept my plants alive and thriving . If my plants succeed after this growing season , i will definitely be buying more .
1 #### This thing is now in my recycle bin ! I broke my other OXO salad spinner and replaced it initially with this OXO Good Grips Salad Spinner , which is suppose to be the best . NOT ! Fed up I then replaced the Good Grips with the SoftWorks , via Amazon , and it is way better . I was completely disappointed the Good Grips . I was like " how could they even sell this thing and what is up with all the good reviews . " I do n't know . The Good Grips does a horrible job of drying the lettuce whereas this SoftWorks is terrific . This SoftWorks basket spins way faster and is easier to get it spinning . The pump action is easier to use and the basket really gets spinning fast . I could hardly get the Good Grips spinning at all and I am a pretty strong dude . I think it spins faster because of the curved bottom where as this Good Grips bottom slows down the spinning action , not sure but the result of the SoftWorks is much better . Also , I was concerned about this supposedly being smaller but it is not . It fits quite a bit more lettuce . I think that is because it has a taller basket . With the pump protruding down into the basket taking up space , basked height becomes critical and creates more room . This is the salad spinner to buy !
5 #### Pamper your power tools ... they deserve it . Buy at least 12/3 for your short runs , and 10/3 for longer than 50 ' and for higher draw ( over 10 amps ) tools . This is especially true for air compressors , table / miter saws , etc . If you 've ever experienced your power tools bogging down , try a better ( heavier gauge ) cord , you might be surprised .
2 #### It has been 14 months since I purchased this item . Both batteries will no longer hold a charge . I am going to have to either order more batteries or get another vacuum cleaner . I am very disappointed , I had a Eureka the Boss Lite that had one battery , it lasted from the late 90 's until 2014 when I purchases this one . I was not able to replace the battery on the Boss Lite or I would have done so . I was so thrilled that this one came with 2 batteries , but I only get about 5 or 6 minutes use before the battery gives up .
5 #### Great product . .It is very important to have this tool at home . Comprar essa ferramenta um bom investimento . I recommend .
1 #### I own at least a dozen Oxo products and I love every one - except this one . It does n't make opening jars easier at all . It slips on the lids and only opens jars that I could easily open by hand . After the first week I gave up in disgust and this utensil has n't been out of the drawer since . Do n't waste your money on this one .
3 #### For the price , it was good , however , be aware that this is just a thin , vinyl black cover . I would expect it to last only about 2 seasons . I have it on a 4 burner Char - Broil grill and it only covers about 3/4 of the grill - the bottom is open .
4 #### I ordered them with another item , so it took a while . While waiting , the local store got their spring stock in and my wife picked some up . Now we have stakes to last for years .
5 #### Exactly what I was looking for ... I read other reviews which said plastic was very thin . Yes , it is but it can take a little abuse ... I 've had this sprinkler out in my yard for about a month and it does a great job of watering a two of flowers ... if I had more spickets in my back yard I would order more ...
4 #### Mounted this in my Jeep Wrangler rock crawler / weekend toy . In an older vehicle such as my ' 93 with original wiring , you never know what might happen . In 2014 , I had an electrical meltdown under the hood which turned out to be caused by a headlight power lead coming into contact with a moving pulley on the engine block and shorting out the entire electrical system . While it did n't catch fire , it melted a good portion of the stock vehicle wiring harness and the entire under - hood fuse box ( power distribution center ) was destroyed . An eye opener like that will cause you to think about the what - ifs , so I picked this up for that just - in - case moment . Hopefully I never have something like that happen again , but if I do , and if it leads to a fire , I am now prepared .
4 #### I have n't had an opportunity to use the baking mat yet but think I 'll really like it
4 #### Arrange in any fashion you like ! For the price order a few , combine them , and get creative ! The monkey 's are very cute and the decals easily come on and off to re - stick and re - do . Looks great in a babies or kids room . Ours is against a sage green wall and matches well .
5 #### I received it sooner than I expected and it came in full . Hopefully I do n't need to use it .
5 #### Absolutely beautiful mixing bowl ! I had a momentary buyer 's remorse where I tried to cancel ( in order to upsize to the 6.35 quart version ) . Luckily it was too late to cancel the item , as this was exactly the size I wanted . I read the concerns about metal utensils leaving marks on the bowl , but my own intention is to use hands , wooden spoons and silicon whisks only . I wanted something big enough for hand working dough and I like the fact that the sides are n't SO tall on this . It will also be a great large salad serving bowl . This piece clearly had the sticker which indicated " Made in Portugal " for those worried about China as the place of manufacture . The bowl is lighter than you would think ( for its size and thickness ) . This is a plus if you are going to hold it and whisk . Still heavy enough to not move around the counter . The glaze is great and even inside and out . Tiny roughness on underside ridges , but this helps it not slide and I do n't intend to use it on scratch able surface .
4 #### Got both of my Dewalt light back into service . Best price I found .
3 #### Can be tough to use with certain thick liquids to mix in the container . I never quite got it to work properly .
4 #### If you like to make your own woodworking jigs you know you got to have em . These are of very high quality , and this is the best price I 've found .
5 #### Love love love this product . I get so frustrated with kinks in my hose when pulling it around the yard . I have had this for about a year now , and no kinks at all ! It makes watering things in the yard a lot less stressful , and it rolls up very easily !
5 #### Wow wow and wow ! First night we turned on it zapped like crazy , left on over night and next morning looked like a BEARD ! I got this as a gift and he is thrilled . Works great . Just need to find a good price of the bait traps on bottom of unit .. Thanks
5 #### Gets the job done . Nice grip . Do n't slice off a chunk of your finger , though . It 's very sharp .
5 #### Love that this is flat , so does n't take up much space in my utensil holder , but works like a normal whisk ! Perfect !
5 #### These filters are great and much cheaper than buying locally at retail prices .
5 #### We had two pizza cutters that were both over 5 years old , that this replaced . We typically eat at least 1 pizza a week in our household , so it gets a fair amount of use . The one cutter we had was about an inch smaller diameter wheel and required a lot more effort to cut through pizza ( this is about 4 " ) . The other had some special coating on it that had worn off over the years and parts around the center bolt had begin to show rust ( yuck ! ) . They had both had obviously become dull over the years slowly , and I guess you just become accustom to having to make 4 + rolls over a line to get a complete through cut . Immediately was blown away when I started using this , as it was cut through in a single pass ! Sometimes I have to make a double pass , it depends what kind of crust and how it was cooked . Additionally , besides the need for multiple passes , it requires much less downward pressure to achieve the perfect cut . I will probably replace my pizza cutters every few years now , and will reconsider this one next time .
5 #### Unlike the Fiskars Ratchet Anvil Pruner , this baby is ' all metal " like it 's grand - father ! Could n't be happier , especially with the lock . Much better than grand - pa !
5 #### Bought 3 of these and caught 2 moles the first 24hours . Love these things .
4 #### good product . not too tough to assemble . supports grizzly bandsaw well .
3 #### These blades are pretty sharp , but only for the first few times you use them . They dull very quickly , and need to be changed more often then not . If you 're in the market for good quality blades , I 'd skip past these and keep looking .
5 #### Worked great repairing a damaged 10 lb . sledge . Nice solid feel .
5 #### Great bug light . My dad lights it up every night for the last three summers - makes good bird food they LOVE it .
5 #### I was reluctant to buy a pressure cooker with a separate pressure rocker after having used one with a one - piece lid and pressure adjustment by only one hand . But I wanted stainless steel , big enough to make a batch of chili yet small enough to be frugal with shelf space . Another consideration was the weight of the kettle -- both empty and full . Though a larger size might seem more versatile , I decided I would use it less if it were heavy to " drag out . " Budget was another consideration . I am very happy with the 4 qt Presto and would not change my mind about it at this juncture . I did also order a stainless steel basket and trivet to be able to cook more than one food without blending flavors . The insert that came with the pot was aluminum .
5 #### i make my own herb butter and guac this lil guy does the job very sturdy and easy to clean
5 #### My favorite vacuum for my small place . It get uncarpeted areas and carpeted area clean . It 's light for carrying and plenty of suction power for trim and high places . Love this vacuum !
5 #### My kids are taking Chinese , and this has been a nice little gift to their friends who are also taking it .
5 #### I own many IMPULSE Tortoise glassware items . They are all so luxurious , richly colored , and pleasureable to hold . My guests all rave and remark how special they feel when they drink out of IMPULSE 'S glassware . The look and feel is so luxe , and generous of proportion , they make every glass of wine , or martini feel like a special occasion . You have to see and hold these items to appreciate the superb craftmanship , and bespoke - handmade feel . They will blend beautifully into any decor , yet hold their own from a design standpoint . I use the rocks glasses as votive holders for my rechargeable tealight candles , and the make the artificial candles appear real and warm .
5 #### Works fantastic . Done in minutes . Just sweep up after use and the driveway ans sidewalk look great . I have a large state sidewalk and this makes it look good .
5 #### Nice set of cooking utensils . Comfortable rubber handles . Sturdy nylon . I purchased these for a vacation rental property . They get a lot of abuse from people who do n't take care of other peoples property very well . They have held up well .
2 #### It cracked pretty soon after I put it up after falling off the wall , which it does often . Not good suction . I would n't buy this again .
5 #### LOVE - LOVE - LOVE it ! I am now trying my hand at carving gourds ! So excited ...
5 #### This stuff is amazing , It attracts fly 's very well , it has a pungent smell but it is effective .
5 #### This is n't going to eliminate an infestation . I use it as an indicator . I keep it near where the dog sleeps and if I start to see fleas accumulating there , I know he needs a bath and a flea treatment . Also attracts sewer flies as a bonus .
5 #### I 'm sometimes marginally handy but not always . I had to replace an outside fixture that had cracked where the sensor bit attaches so was no longer adjustable . Just flopped around . This is a rental property and I do n't really want to spend a lot of money . This one was priced right and I was able to install it pretty easily and it is working great . We have n't had much rain so I will keep an eye on it but I think it will be fine .
4 #### This pesticide is Bacillus thuringiensis var . israelensis and is labelled for Fungus Gnat , which are occasionally problematic in our indoor plants . I had previously used Gnatrol which I could not find in original packaging this time around . Wo n't purchase from resellers who wo n't guarantee viability .
5 #### I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine , and it works great . He is very pleased , and it has helped him enjoy apples more often than he would otherwise , if he did n't have this great device . A great tool :)
5 #### We 've been using these for about a month now , and they are great ! I am NOT a big fan of the huge heavy forks . These are neither too big and heavy , nor are they cheap and lightweight . They are just perfect ! Great quality , especially for the price !
5 #### This box is heavier than expected -- which means it will probably last a lifetime . My husband is very happy with it . It 's just the right size and we would not hesitate to recommend it .
4 #### I 'm in a household of bacon - lovers , so good tongs are a kitchen necessity ! After buying and trying several different kinds , I ended up with this model as the keeper . After about a year , I bought an extra pair in case the first ones break ( and they have n't ) . If you love cooking , you know a perfect utensil is hard to find , but these tongs wo n't disappoint . The locking mechanism is great for storing the tongs in a crowded drawer --- why do n't all tongs have this ? ! I think it also has kept these tongs in their proper shape , instead of getting bent and useless . The length is perfect to keep me safely at a distance from popping grease , while still being manageable . I prefer the bare ends to the rubber version also made by OXO , these steel ends allow me to pick up and manipulate thin strips of bacon with ease . UPDATE : after several years , the rubber sections started to degrade and feel " sticky " even when clean . Not sure if this was due to heat exposure , hundreds of trips through the dishwasher , or what . We simply pulled off the rubber parts and continued using it as is , but eventually bought a replacement . Still , a great set of tongs !
5 #### I ve been using it for a few months now and its still kicking lol . I needed a small hose to run around my garden to supply water to my watering system . so far so good .
5 #### I have been using this food for about 2 - 3 years since I got my Canary and researched about pellets being better than seeds . My Canary loves it and I now have 2 Parakeets and they love it too . I was buying the smaller bags until now . I used to get my Canary the nibbles and the Keets the mini , but I just got the 10 lb of crumbs because of the reviews . They say there is less waste with the crumbs . Then they can all eat the same food . I did n't have any trouble with any of them switching from seed to pellets .
3 #### Well , this apparatus is nice to look at and certainly easily fit into the camo holster I ordered as well ( which arrived in two days - Prime ) . It also hooks easily onto a loop on clothing or backpack . However , I honestly ca n't review how well it actually works because although it was a Prime item , I did not receive it in two days , in fact it took over a week so I did not get it in time to try it on my vacation and had to go back to using DEET spray instead:- ( I will update the review when I do get the opportunity to actually try the Mosquito Repelling Device as I bought it based entirely on other 's reviews !
5 #### This is a great alternative to the typical lawn mower which puts out more pollution in one hour than dozens of new cars . No gasoline or oil to keep this mower running , therefore no accidental spills that could make there way into local well water . Just wish I could switch out the battery for recharging and have a spare battery ready to go . Push mowers are great exercise , too !
5 #### These are great tape measures that are built well , and made to last . I have a twenty five foot model that I have had for six years , and also a thirty foot model that I have used for a year now . While the longer one is handy for some things I find its just too bulky for most tasks . Being heavier and bigger the 30 foot is just a pain to carry , so you guessed it , I do n't . It stays at home while the older and shorter 25 foot goes with me everywhere . It 's much easier to maneuver as well . That being said they are both top notch accurate , stand stiff for a long distance without under support , and are just great tools .
5 #### My favorite shears .... great for snipping flowers of all kinds ... I love them so much I give them as gifts to all my gardening friends .
5 #### Does what the product was designed for . The longer handle also allows you to avoid getting potatoes all over your hands while mashing . The handle is also great quality and I 'm able to maintain a constant , firm grip . Would highly recommend .
5 #### I just received my Briel ES35AB Chamonix Pump Espresso Machine With Auto Espresso Flow and had it up and running in 5 minutes ( that included : rinsing the reservoir and attachments , plugging in the electrial cord , pouring the water into the reservoir and turning it on ) . Every part of the espresso maker is working wonderfully . The reasons for purchasing this machine was so I could have a reservoir of water and also to use the espresso pods in order to make numerous individual cups of espresso for our dinner parties . It is very easy to clean afterwards , and in just a minute or two after turning it on , just put the espresso pod in the pod holder , insert and turn , press the button , and in 20 - 30 seconds you have a cup of espresso . I am very satisfied with the product and would encourage others to purchase it as well .
4 #### Seems OK but have n't used it yet - doubt it really works though .
5 #### This works well and will likely last forever so 5 stars from me !
3 #### When you wind it up , it likes to move and you have to stabilize it . Too light for my tastes .
5 #### The spikes work well for plants which are non - flowering . I used them on the green plants and those that bloom infrequently . THEy all seem quite happy .
5 #### Worked as I expected . I needed this to for a corner area area of my lawn . I wish it had better ability to adjust the distance it sprays to but overall I am happy with the product .
4 #### OXO delivers yet again ! This is such a high - quality , well - made product , which is no less than what I 've come to expect from OXO . Not only have I been using this pizza wheel to slice homemade pizza ( yum ! ) but it 's also great for slicing cheesecakes , flans , quesadillas , etc . - anything that needs a steady hand and a sharp edge for cutting a straight line . The grip is comfortable and the blade stays sharp with really minimal maintenance ( it rinses clean quickly and has n't needed to be sharpened even once ) . The only thing I 'd change is I 'd make the guard between the blade and the grip bigger and closer to the blade to protect your hand while slicing . Other than that , this is a perfectly - made product that I 'd gladly buy again and again . Luckily , I think this is the last pizza cutter I 'll ever need !
3 #### Belt sander has great power , does n't bog down or struggle and tracks very well with no fighting . Huge fan of the noise level , very quiet and a pleasure to use . I was greatly surprised by the noise level , ca n't say it enough , and as a whole very satisfied with the unit all in all . I gave it three stars simply because of the item shipped to me . Was as described but clearly was an open box item . The power cord was not coiled and there were a couple scuffs on the side of the unit and had sawdust all over it . The item still functions perfectly and everything was included but i wish Amazon did a better job of singling out open box items as opposed to unopened , new , items . So as a whole i give the transaction three stars but the item itself deserves five .
3 #### Takes awhile to get smoke . Its a waiting game , but in the end it is good .
4 #### I had one of the spinners that you had to crank , was tiring and slow . This spinner works very easily by pushing the button on top . My only complaint would be that it does n't completely dry the lettuce but it is dry enough to use .
5 #### I would buy again . I have found you do n't want to buy cheap when using them on a dewalt 1/4 " impact cause they just bust the tip off . These do n't . If I just would n't lose them I would be better off .
4 #### This item matches my lamp better than the original one and is more suited for the space that it needed to go through . I do n't recommend rewiring lamps as I had my daughter help me figure it out and she did most of it . But when your puppy chews off the plug , you are left with UTube videos and doing it yourself ( a lamp repair would probably have cost me more than I paid for the lamp ) . I could have thrown the lamp out but this was a inexpensive fix and I am happy with the results .
5 #### Just rearming my bug catcher . These glue boards work really nice , and whatever you catch stays absolutely glued . We even catch those measly little fruit flies . We use it in our RV and would n't travel without it .
5 #### It 's winter so I have n't tried it out but it looks like it will do the job and arrived in great shape thank you so much
4 #### Like the gloves ; but the thumb is cut a little too long . Be nice if they were cut shorter with an expansion pleat for the chimps with really long thumbs .
5 #### Just as good as original if not better . Fit my S6640 12.5 Gallon two tank Hoover perfectly and a decent price . Ca n't find this locally .
2 #### I left it in the path that the ant usually take , for a week or more , and none got caught in the trap . Instead I tested the surface with my finger , and it was hard to wash my hand ... had to use some kind of solvent , soap was not enough .
4 #### Works as advertised . I love it , except I wish it was pyrex . It looks like it will scratch up and become less transparent over time . I guess I 'll have to buy it again .
5 #### These Pony cabinet claws are absolutely perfect . There is nothing more I can say about them ! They made my cabinet install a breeze to be sure , BUT I could n't help but notice that Menards has the same Pony claws for $ 59.98 . The only difference that I can tell is that these have a " vise " type bolt handle on them , whereas the model 8510 at Menards has a different handle more akin to a bicycle handle , and these are painted orange instead of bare aluminum . Other than that , there is no difference . To be quite honest , there is no need to wrench down on these like a vise . They work just fine hand tightened . These appear to be some sort of updated version ? I do n't know . I ordered mine from Amazon prior to noticing them at Menards , and immediately felt like a sucker . Do yourself a favor , unless Amazon reduces the price of these , save yourself a few bucks and just go to Menards . Save time and shipping , and walk out of the store $ 16.84 richer with a great product in hand . Other than that , these Pony claws are the way to go !
3 #### Have had it for a year and it works fine for most purposes . No need to repeat pros here . Two things I do not like , comparing it with some other pressure cookers used : 1 ) the handle has very slippery contour , even hard to lift up the cooker when it is empty . Worst design ever seen . 2 ) there is no mesh screen / filter at the pressure release valve under the lid . This results in the valve holes blocked easily if the food is boiled up . Presto product engineers should really use them before releasing .
5 #### Just like the ones in Lowes , but at a much better price .
5 #### I 've had other salad spinners and this one is far better . Very easy to use and effective , the brake is a great feature . I like mine so much I purchased one for my mother as well .
5 #### Building a log home . This works perfect and after watching youtube , it was a breeze to use . Going to use on window and door trim . Will work good for picture frames too ! Instructions were strange and print super small . I do n't need Spanish French and Chinese .
5 #### Gift for mom , she has all hardwood floors in her home and this works great , it has 12 amps which is comparable to much more expensive canister vacs . She is very happy with it . I 'm considering buying one for myself because it is so easy to use
5 #### Perfect size for 1 or 2 people household . Works well . I used to have an older model that was n't designed well for cleaning - it ended up getting moldy under the plastic molding , but this one was designed without any those flaws and cleans up much better .
5 #### This is the 2nd one of these little bbq 's we 've had . The first one lasted about 12 years , so I think that 's a pretty good track record . Just the fact that they are making them still , means a lot to me .
5 #### This size spatula is great for getting the last bit out of jars or out of a yogurt cup or something like that . This particular spatula has a solid handle and the white part is not too stiff or too soft to do its job . I 've only had it a few days , but so far , so good . It made it through the dishwasher on the sanitary cycle okay , too .
1 #### Trapped not even one fly ... and we had tons of them .
3 #### I bought this to use with the Pizza / Crisping Sheet and it fits together nicely . However , it 's a bit too shallow to allow enough air circulation to really crisp foods on the bottom that you would normally deep fry . I either use it with a deeper pan or prop it up on rolled aluminum foil on each end to improve the air circulation . Wish Nordic Ware would make a deeper pan as a companion to the Crisping Sheet . If they did this I would give it 5 stars .
2 #### It serves the purpose that it was designed for but a little flimsy for my taste .
5 #### These pans work really well , they are non - stick and easy to use , and are a fun addition to my baking equipment . You can use them for other things besides baking a tortilla ( which works great ) . So as in experiment I made naan dough and made soup bowls for lentil soup . That came out great ! I can imagine baking other kinds of flat breads in them . My next experiment may be making giant formed masa cakes ! This thing probably wo n't change your life , but it gives you a few more options in the kitchen for what shapes you want to bake things in .
5 #### Not the filteree - est filters around , but they do the job , and are relatively inexpensive .
5 #### What a miracle I had a knockoff rose bush struggling to produce roses now after applying to the bush I have a thriving plant with lots of roses great product it has my blessing
5 #### I gave these as a gift with the measuring spoons . These are so nice and durable and easy to read . They would make a great bridal shower or housewarming gift .
5 #### this is a great product I would order again if needed .
4 #### I really am not qualified to review this type of item , because I have never owned one of these before purchasing this one for my son last Christmas . Were I skilled with these , I might have rated it a five star . What I do know is that it does seem to be sensitive enough to be useful . My boy does n't use his nearly as much as he thought he would . I probably will end up borrowing it some to clean up nails from my yard and such , since I got hit by a tornado last April . I shopped around for a good while before ordering this particular unit , and I am not disappointed in this purchase .
5 #### I have no idea why , I do n't understand it all , but I put these in each spring and my water clears up . I have a large pond and I coral them in areas in the rocks to keep them in one place . if I do n't put them in , the water dosent clear up . I like to keep my pond running naturally . I have two bio filters . my fish do n't seem at all bothered by them in the pond .
5 #### If I could give this rotisserie more stars I would . I 've had mine for eight years now and it is the best possible accessory you can buy for a WEBER KETTLE . It will transform your barbecue cooking experience . I rotisserie chicken , duck and turkey on a regular basis . I suggest buying two additional spit forks ( for a total of four ) so you can cook two chickens or ducks at one time . Buy the spits with four prongs not the two prongs . When cooking chicken , close the bottom vent and leave the top vent fully open ( this will maintains the temperature at about 325 - 350 degrees ) and cook for one hour and 45 minutes to two hours . To cook a 12 - 14 pound turkey do the same as chicken but cook for about 3 hours or so . When cooking turkey you will need to add some briquettes hourly to maintain the temperature for that long a period . I just time my rotisserie meats and leave the lid on to maintain temperature . Once you use a WEBER rotisserie you wonder how you did without one !
5 #### I purchased this for my daughter 's jungle theme nursery . It worked out perfectly . Now at 16 months she points to it and says , " monkey " . The best part is when she becomes too old for a nursery theme , I can simply remove the decal without repainting because I chose a neutral color .
5 #### I bought these knives for a vintage JD Wallace jointer I restored . I always buy Freud knives , and I always get them from Amazon . Great knives at a super price .
1 #### These are very poorly constructed . Maybe it 's the hot TX sun , but all five I purchased broke within just a few uses . The plastic is cheap and split apart or broken . Not abused as I set them up and left them . Used no more than 10 times each . May be good in a cooler climate , but definitely not a product for use in the hot sun .
5 #### Pleasantly surprised at the numbers of crispy remains each morning . Before hanging this the skeeters were driving us in doors , now they 're tolerable despite the wet weather . One night it stormed and the gutters overflowed onto this device . I was resigned to it 's loss but it survived good as new . Did n't know it was made in the USA but that was a nice bonus . Going to get one for the camper .
5 #### well made , keep indoors so they do n't rust , work great
5 #### These are a must have - you can transport your trash across rooms without carrying a heavy , leaking bag . Strong and sturdy and have held up well !
5 #### Nice easy to grip handle . Sharp blade end cuts easily into apples .
5 #### They work Very Well . I already had to change mine 3 times . Good Price
5 #### We 've had our OXO Steel can opener since early 2003 ( almost 14 years as of this review ) ! Blade is still sharp . Turn knob twists with no issues . Handles look and feel new . Wash once a month or so and scrub the cutting blade with an old toothbrush or potato scrubber . Survived four moves , two marriages , and countless cans of vegetables , soup , and cat food !
5 #### High quality meat tenderizer . Ca n't go wrong with OXO - i love their products . Pounding was simple and easy . It 's heavy so you do n't have to put much effort in the pounding . It 's very easy on the wrists and easy to clean . Because it 's stainless steel , it does n't trap odors . Everyone was impressed with my tonkatsu ( from pork tenderloin ) . Great product !
4 #### larger than expected , but appear well made and solid ; have n't used yet
5 #### I use these for cutting 45 degree miters in plastic ( polystyrene ) picture frame moulding . Absolutely the best cuts in that material of any blade I have ever used , including much more expensive TCV and similar " for polystyrene " blades from specialty manufacturers . One quick chop makes a perfectly clean cut with no melting or fractured edges . There 's just no comparison to the ragged results one gets from ATB and similar " for wood " blades used with plastic . TCG is what you need for poly , it keeps the temperature way down . I get about 100 + perfect corners per sharpening in 1x4 poly moulding , then maybe another 100 or 200 cuts that are less clean but still cosmetically acceptable . That 's impressive for polystyrene , which is slightly abrasive . I 've got 10 of these and they still sharpen well after about 6 trips each to the sharpening shop . I guesstimate 8 sharpens may be the practical limit . Also can be used for wood moulding , but you need to go a little on the slow side .
3 #### Did not ship screws so that the gage could be mounted . I will be very easy to read once I find screws so that I can place it outside .
5 #### The Judy clock is a marvelous teaching aid for children learning to tell time . This is a perfect size to have at home for practice .
5 #### With tools it either works or it does nt , and this pry bar gets the job done ! Not a cheap quality tool at all .
3 #### What can I say ... CHEAP CHINESE JUNK ! Yes it works but very cheap quality compared to the very old Gilmour that finally leaked . If made in USA and a couple dollars more with better quality casting it would be 5 star .
5 #### Have tried this item before and have decided it just is n't very good for our high temperatures . Drys out to quickly even in partial shade /
4 #### These are great fans -- I bought one for the upstairs hall , and one for the downstairs dining room of my colonial home . WIth both of them running on exhaust , the whole house is cooled off within an hour on a cool summer night . There is a bit of understanding needed with the dimensions though . I had no choice but to mount the fan on the inner window frame for both windows , because the extensions do not reach far enough to mount on the outside of the window frame . The windows can not be shut with the fan mounted , because they have a " lip " at the bottom , that overhangs a bit and runs the length of the window , to make opening and closing easier . The lip interferes with the window closing while the fan is in place , so the fan must be removed from the mount if heavy rain is expected ( Hurricane Irene , for instance ! ) Even so , the fan is easily removed , once the screws are in place .
5 #### I needed to purchase a good ripping blade to do a bunch of projects I have on my list , The Freud blade came fast and works very well , a lot higher quality than I had before . thanks
4 #### It does what you want it to , albeit with a fairly cheap feel . It was cheap though , so I am ok with that !
5 #### Arrived quickly and allowed me to complete my project ahead of schedule .
3 #### Not the worst and not the best filter . Its a Minnesota product so I have been loyal for now . Still seeking out a better more effective filter without paying more .
2 #### I have another Mighty Mite that 's at least 20 years old so I purchased this one as a backup . The vacuum makes a really loud whining noise . I hoped it would go away after a few uses but it has not . I love my old mighty mite , that 's why I bought another one , but I ca n't recommend this new one .
5 #### I have a Porter - Cable sander and biscuit joiner , and this hose works perfectly with both . I hook it up to the shop vac , and wow . At least 95 % less sawdust in the air than with the little bags . Highly recommended .
4 #### My Mosquito Magnet broke -- again -- , and this time I got tired of spending a fortune to get it fixed . After reading reviews this device looked great , and so far I 'm quite happy with it . I bought 2 , one in front of the house , and one in the back , and I keep them on all day . Every evening at dusk , you can begin to hear the mosquitoes getting zapped . A beautiful sound , indeed ... Like the Mosquito Magnets , you ca n't eliminate ALL mosquitoes but it makes a big difference . The light is VERY bright , so you may want to consider where to place it . Only flaw : The way the octanol pellets are attached I am sure could be improved . They 're stuck to the bottom of the Flowtron with double - sided tape . Pain to peel the tape cover off , and I 've had at least one fall off .
5 #### Worked well - used this and one of another size to remove a brake line fitting I had been soaking in penetrating oil for months .
5 #### These are great for any hike that is two nights or longer . I can not begin to tell you how refreshing they are ! The towelettes are very durable and well sized . I use mine at night before I change into my sleeping attire . Keeps my sleeping bag clean . I also use at the end of multi - day hikes . I always keep a set of clothes and a pack of these wipes in my car when I 'm out on an over - nighter . When I return back to my car at the trailhead , I use these to clean up before putting on my travel clothes . The only negative about these is they are quite heavy , making them a luxury item in my backpack .
5 #### This knife is EXCELLENT quality . It 's important to pay attention to the actual inches in measurement given , because the actual knife can be quite a bit larger than you imagined it to be .
5 #### Wow what a pair of shell tortilla pans , very well made and a nice large size , wash up very nicely . I must say this was a great price .
5 #### I have wanted one of these since I was about 10 . Now at 45 I finally have one . It works well and shuts of on its own , making it nice to set it and forget it ,
3 #### Strong little vac . But the hose kinks easily which is a hassle . Also the on / off switch is very stiff.sometimes have to get the big strong man to turn it on / off I 've used this same model cleaning for the last 23 years , it has strong suction I just wish they could make it with a hose that would n't kink . I would rather pay more for this and not be hassled with the kinking .
5 #### I have a similar tow strap that is around 20 years old . This strap started to fray and does n't look trustworthy anymore . This new strap will replace the old one and it looks to be a good quality strap .
5 #### I use this for icing cakes , transferring cookies to a cooling rack , serving cake , brownies , etc . I love this tool and I plan on getting a couple more because it 's used so often .
5 #### Used this as part of a month long Secret Santa at work , worked great paired with a small decorative magnet board . She immediately pinned it to her pffice space and people came by to post messages . Easy to mix n match with other magnetic word set , big hit as a creative gift . Durable and great little box for storage , too .
5 #### I purchased this hose because the $ 10 value hose I bought at HomeDepot burst within one day of use . The fist day I used it , I accidentally left the water turned on over night , and the hose ripped open from the pressure and flooded my yard for a few hours . This hose is tough and does a good job . It does n't kink and reels up well on my hose crank . It was worth the extra money . I have left the hose on over night by accident a few times , and nothing has happened . No , leaks , bumps or protrusions . I would highly recommend this hose .
3 #### It 's very light weight and it picks up dirt . It 's a cheap vacuum and it kinda feels like it , but I guess it does what it 's supposed to do .
4 #### Too big for many countertop ovens so needs to be cut down to fit , but does the job .
3 #### ok - will still leave a mark - if I keep - em clean -- I still put a couple of clean gloves or rags works best
5 #### Hard to find a set with 6 measures ; good price
3 #### Loved it , but broke the second week I had it :(
4 #### I purchased this fan to replace a fan I had on my kitchen window for over 20 years . After much research ( the original fan 's company went out of business ) I found this fan was the closest to my old one . It does not fit properly in my kitchen window , but I managed to hold it on by pinning it from the top to the bottom with the window . The sides are fine I had lot of lee way and did not need much . I must say it is easier to clean than my older one and it does what is promised . The three setting work great eliminating odors and recycling air . The fact that is reversible is very useful . Please keep in mind that my review is for an apartment window not a house .
5 #### This light is amazing . I bought it for bedtime reading since my husband goes to bed much earlier than I do . However , I find that I use if for so much more . For example , I clip it onto my shirt when I am doing my nails for more direct light . I was worried it would be too heavy for my paperbacks but as long as I clip a chunk of pages together it works no problem !
5 #### I do n't why it took me so long to buy a set of these vice grips ! They grip extremely well but do not slip , as other " traditional " vice grips tend to do .
5 #### I bought these hickory chips to use with my new Masterbuilt smoker that was ordered from Amazon . It was a guess as to the flavor since I was a relative " Newbie " to smoking meats and started with these to try . I will say that these ships provide plenty of smoke and lots of flavor - maybe a little more than we wanted as my clothes and I smelled smoky for a couple of days after using them . My next attempt used pecan wood chips from our front yard tree and they provided a much milder flavor . These will be used again , but maybe with less smoking time . The bag of chips will provide hours of dense smoke , enough for many sessions .
5 #### This is probably my favorite and most used kitchen item . I was so said that my first one broke after 12 years that I had to replace as I have felt lost in the kitchen without it . Easily picks up items such as cookies and is flexible to get under food in the corner of pans with destroying them .
4 #### Very necessary when ripping sheets of plywood . Directions are poor . This attachment should be put on before table saw is set up as it says saw should be placed upside down to install . My saw was already mounted on a rolling stand . I got it done without taking the saw off the stand but it was a pain in the butt . This support could have used a little more design time , it works but it is not great when compared to other brands .
5 #### keep this in the house for emg and carry one in my pick up , it works first time every time
5 #### Going on for two years now ; through heat and very cold winter with 2 + feet of snow storms and still going strong ! Love it !
5 #### This whisk gets into the edges of my pan and I love it ! I use it all the time and hardly use my older whisk .
5 #### Item arrived on time and was as advertised . Completely satisfied
4 #### The is one great inexpensive little " weapon " and works as advertised . Yes , its cheaply made , but it was n't meant to be swatted against something . Yes , the 2 buttons may be annoying , but its for your own safety ( speaking from experience ! ) . I must agree with another reviewer that the wires are a little TOO far apart for smaller bugs , which will easily " slip " through the wires . May be better if it were a mesh type pattern . But all in all , for the price , you ca n't argue with the practicality of the product !
5 #### we actually use this to keep dozens of stray cats out of our yard
5 #### Typical Bosch quality : excellent . The release mechanism has a precision feel . I love that you can do a one - handed eject of your bit by simply pulling on the blue rubber gasket . In the past I used a Dewalt quick - change and it required two hands to free your bits .
5 #### I use the absolutely excellent melon baller to make Daisy 's Potatoes Noisette from the Daisy of Downton Abbey fame . The recipe is online , and this is the best melon baller to use for Mrs. Patmore approved " noisette " style potatoes ( work with sweet potatoes too for the more health conscious ) .
1 #### The spring broke in about a month , had to throw them away , look for another set of grips
2 #### Not what I expected . This is to be added in sitting water . My mistake . I thought it was a dry type of killer feed .
5 #### The Dewalt bulbs are the best out there . They are brighter than other flashlight bulbs yet are very tough and can withstand being dropped while on . I do n't have a Dewalt flashlight but I use them in my Porter Cable and Bosch flashlights and they out perform the bulbs than came with those flashlights . I highly recommend these bulbs you wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### Have not used a veggie brush in years . mainly use my hands to a toothbrush to clean my veggies . This this will work much better and I have retired the toothbrush .
1 #### This is very inhumane product . I had a mice problem on a 6th floor high rise apt . ! ! The maintenance man introduced me to this . One little cute mouse did not get the memo and ended up on one of these . I felt sorry for the little creature , but he was stuck on this and ended up dying just hours later from the stress . Since I am single with no pets , I have decided to place moth balls around the stove where they were coming from . For small mice , this works like a charm . Only problem is that moth balls in large numbers can be quite toxic , and I did have a really bad nightmare where this stuff must have gotten into my brain , but I must 've grown immune because I 've had no problems since .
5 #### Bought these with my DEWALT DW304PK 10 Amp Reciprocating Saw . They do what they say , real tough and ready for action !
5 #### This really is THE best hand - held can opener on the planet ! Easy to grip , VERY smooth operation and minimal effort are what make this opener so easy to use . I have fairly large hands so I do n't really know how well this opener would work for someone with small hands , but I suspect that it would be just as easy to use for anyone else as it is for me . HIGHLY Recommended !
5 #### It has a lot of power and works well on pet hair .
3 #### I did n't realize the metal would be so thin and " bendy " . I did n't like it at first , but now realize it is very useful for certain jobs such as baking .
5 #### Wonderful , very high quality bundt pan ! ! ! It works great , does not stick at all ! ! So nice and heavy duty ! I just got another cookbook to try out some more recipes that I ca n't wait to try ! !
4 #### Love that these do n't leak and are small enough to fit perfectly inside a bento of any size yet big enough to hold a decent amount of dressing or peanut butter . Our 4 & 7 year olds both have a hard time opening and closing these though .
4 #### I bought this with my new mower , and it works just as I expected . It does n't pick up every blade of grass that is cut , nor do I expect , or want it to . It does prevent me from having to rake by reducing the amount of clippings falling back into the yard , and still leaves some behind , which I 'm told is good for the lawn . I noticed that the metal loops that snap together can come apart easily , so used a pair of pliers to close them ; the instructions do n't mention doing this , but they should ; it took like 30 seconds , and makes a world of difference . It can easily dislodge from the mower if you kick it or bump it against something , but I think once you I get use to it , it will be easy enough to avoid . So given the price , I 'm happy with the purchase , and think it makes a nice addition to my new reel mower .
5 #### The durable solid brass construction speaks for itself . Forget silly plastic nozzles with no pressure and parts that can break . More than worth the price .
5 #### Best axe ever made . Lightweight and plows through everything my old 6 or 8lb'er would . Will never pick up a standard maul again .
5 #### I live between two creeks and mosquitos are inevitable . I like the idea of preventing baby mosquitos from hatching on my stretch of the creeks by sprinkling these Bits in pockets of trapped still water where mosquitos love to breed . With all the rain we 've had this year I 'm afraid my Bits get washed downstream almost every day . I want to believe it is helping downstream neighbors but I keep having to order more ! Even so I believe it is making a difference and know it will make outdoor life a lot more enjoyable once the rains lighten up .
1 #### Ended up returning this because it got super hot and I worried it may catch on fire . I had only one low wattage item plugged into this thing .
5 #### I had a 150 - 200 lb . vertical router that needed a mobile base . I got the Delta kit from Amazon , and assembled it one evening using pine 2x4s that I 'd ripped to the right size . Let me tell you , this base works great ! Everything fit perfectly . Typical Delta quality . I 'd bought some tool stands that were from another company , and I 'd almost lost my temper putting the darned things together ... nothing fit . On this base , everything fit perfectly . The specs call for the use of hardwood , but on a light tool like my vertical router , the pine worked fine . If you 've never used this type of base , they are a dream to use . A simple foot lever lifts and lowers the tool once the base is installed . This is MUCH better than having to individually lift each corner by hand - tightening plastic - handled screws . I also have a Vega base that requires a long handle to move the unit around , and I 'm telling you ... this Delta system ca n't be beat ! In fact , I 'm going to replace my Vega base with one of these . After nearly 3 years of using this type of base , I prefer it to the others I have had . MUCH easier to move stuff , and for those who say you 'll trip over the kicker , you 're walking too close to your machine ! These levers rise up out of the way ... I 've NEVER tripped , and my shop is crowded ! Happy Woodworking !
4 #### very high quality and well - made set . They fit both my Dewalt and Milwaukee routers easily . My one complaint is that they reduce the distance a plunge router can plunge due to the size of the screw on flange .
5 #### This is what I needed for my Dremel 4000 rotary tool that I just purchased Nice to have . Just to let you know about the 4000 tool it comes only with a small Collet with collet nut . So if you are using any bits with larger shank you will need this collet nut kit .
5 #### Maybe the bathroom is a bit humid for these little clock mechanisms , the old one ( a different brand ) died after 5 years . So this new one has a louder ticking sound . It works just like promised , turning on a heater in the ceiling vent and then turning it off after the set time .
5 #### After reading all the reviews on here , I wanted to thank everybody . This vac is even better than I thought . I kicked the Swivel thing to the curb ! EUREKA -- please keep this little vac , its great ! Great suction , on carpet and on tile & wooden floors . This thing is fantastic ! ! !
4 #### Very nice and of good quality I do a lot of research usually before I buy something and this is recommended by me !
3 #### I was hoping it would be as flexible as the 22 - year - old nylon spatula I purchased at Wal - Mart long ago . It 's not . It 's firm and stiff like the others . On a scale of 1 - 5 of flexibility , I was hoping for a 2.5 . This is a 4 .
5 #### I purchased the Kuhn Rikon 7 - Liter Stainless Steel Pressure Cooker because I wanted to cook the meals my father ( Hungarian ) had made whilst I was a child . Namely , goulash ... And gee , is this a lovely item ! Sure , you need to regulate the heat , so did he ( and his grandma ) . This one is _ so _ much easier though .... With this model you do n't have the steaming and the hissing , moisture leaving your dinner . This baby is so _ very _ quiet .. I have made so many meals with this cooker , and my wife loves it . Regulating the temerature is easy , the two bars ( high and low pressure ) are so very easy to read . Just adjust the heat . I had an electric stove top first , it was harder to use with a pressure cooker . Now I have gas , and easy easy .... Of course , I needed to cook more than goulash ... Great value , more than yes ! Quick cooking , good cooking . Do yourself a favour , this is a great buy ...
5 #### Helped tremendously ! Great tool for bending boards into position . Would have been impossible to build my deck without it , period .
5 #### I did n't think I 'd ever again buy a German or French made kitchen knife : too heavy , too thick compared to Japanese knives . The reviews suggested that this knife was well made with a thinner blade and it was half the price of the next closest Japanese knife . Worth a try . Very nice knife . Light , sharp , good in the hand , and easy to clean . Initial very sharp edge has stayed sharp a long time where the French blade it replaced would have had to have been sharpened at least twice . Worth the money .
5 #### Mosquito bites drive me crazy , and it 's a short drive , so I got this bug zapper to hang on the front porch for when I 'm working on things out there , and each time I hear the " Zap ! " , I smile . I even bought an extra bulb because I 'd hate to run out of ammo right in the middle of a bug fight . I live in the woods , in a log cabin ( honest ) and the bugs around here are pretty relentless sometimes and this thing really does the trick for me .
4 #### Great space heater . Very quiet and warms a room very quickly . Like many heaters though the thermostat seems a bit too easily fooled by its own heat output so it can sometimes go into a mode where it keeps quickly switching on and off . But it 's not bothersome as the heater makes so little noise to begin with . Great buy .
3 #### Just about what you expect from a replacement electric weed trimmer spool . It has string that spins real fast and trims weeds .
5 #### This is a great little device to keep away the deer from our flower beds at night . This one we just bought was added to the other two we have had for a couple of years that have worked flawlessly . We have them all three connected , using two timer that are set to go on at 8:00 PM and off at 6:00 AM . The pass - through on the Scarecrow allows us to daisy - chain two on one faucet nozzle . The only difficulty is that they gobble 9 - volt vatteries and there is no way to tell that they are dead is to walk in front of the device to see if it clicks .
4 #### We use this timer daily for outdoor light decorations . It does a great job . We have it located on our front porch so it is never exposed to rain or snow . It works exactly like you would expect it to .
5 #### Really like this spoon rest . It it large enough to rest a few utensils while cooking which is what made me purchase it . I like the clean look of stainless steel too . Easy to clean and dishwasher safe .
5 #### These are just what we needed and could n't find locally .
5 #### Great design , I broke my older tried and true box grater that I loved . This was a great replacement and easier to clean than my other one .
5 #### This is just the sprinkler head I needed to replace one hit by a mower . I could not fine it at local hardware stores . The one I ordered is placed in the center of the grass strip between the curb and sidewalk and covers a rectangular area . Most other outlets sell heads to place along the side of the rectangle .
5 #### I love this grill . I 've been a fan of the Weber grills for many years . There 's nothing like the taste of charcoal grilled food . I think most people choose gas grills for convenience but they ca n't hold a candle to the flavor produced by the Weber charcoal grill . For me it 's definitely worth the extra effort . I like the ash catcher . It makes it much easier to clean up afterwards .
4 #### Good vacuum ! The hard floor piece does not have enough of a brush on it to protect wood floors , so I bought a different one from Amazon . Other than that , a real decent vacuum .
5 #### These are pricey but if you 're going to make quality raised panel doors , they work great . Also provided with a DVD for instructions , and a full color brochure with the same information . Solid wood case base is a nice touch .
5 #### Excellent . I had been using plastic shut offs , but they were leaking and blowing apart . I use these shut offs at the end of garden hoses , and leave the Bibb on .
5 #### I purchased these because I needed to hand sand my front porch . I use them very often just to scrub the floors . I was working on a window using a folding ladder I put my kneed to rest on the corner of the the folded ladder and it felt the same as any other surface . These are worth every penny and I wish I had known of them sooner .
5 #### Great tool for the price ! I use this for my Electrical Wiring college class . Has treated me well so far !
5 #### Easy to use easy to clean and made of high quality material .
5 #### This miter finder takes away all the thought and lets you do the cutting . Comes in handy for multiple aplications . Worth every penny , and a penny is worth even more than that .
3 #### This is very thin material that goes on the ground to protect the bottom of your pool . It is not very thick material but it is better than having the pool skin ruined by the ground .
5 #### I use this and my 695 m porter cable instead of a table saw some times . It makes nice straight smooth cuts that do n't need refinishing .
5 #### Work great for helping to rid the area of insects and flies .
5 #### These Akro - Mils 8212 Six Pack of Plastic Bins are identical to the bin that is included with the Hornady Lock N Load AP press . They 're exactly what I wanted , and it 's great to have six of them for sorting various items when I 'm reloading ( bullets , cases , etc . ) . Each bin can easily hold about 50 .223/5.56 cases , which I like . I also use one to pour my bullets into . The open front makes it easy to grab them during a reloading session , but they wo n't roll off the benchtop because the flared sides keep the bullets contained . Same goes for the cases . And they 're fairly easy to wash also . What 's not to love ?
3 #### It works great , but very overpriced . If I had waited , I could have gotten the same thing for $ 1 at the hardware store . Oops .
5 #### I bought this cart to hold my new 287 pound band saw ( reviewed earlier ) . The wheels are smaller than the poly wheels I 've been buying to support my home made tool carts but they run a lot smoother . The front wheels swivel smoothly . The locking devices work as though cushioned by some unseen magic and the operating tabs are large and easy to move . A great accessory for any shop stand .
5 #### I love the wildlife and these filled socks attract beautiful finches of many kinds.seed is fresh and socks are easy to hang on tree branches ... arrived fast and free delivery . :-)
4 #### Great little machine so far ! Would like better if crevice tool was longer , and plastic hose more flexible .
1 #### It fits fine on Char Broil tru infrared BBQ pit , but the material is very thin and frankly is disappointing quality . Char broil should consider that consumers see this cover and how thin and flimsy it is and it leaves a thought that there pits have the same quality in them . Char Broil should be embarrassed .
3 #### Crescent tools made overseas ? I never thought I 'd see the day . Disappointed
5 #### my wife was injured at work and the only thing she was able to do was go out and water her garden but was not able to turn water on and off so we just left the cheep Walmart hose 's on they kept bursting and breaking and kinking . This hose does none of that . no waking up to having a geyser in the yard . No having to get up and unkink it for my wife . It works perfectly ! it does n't break and it does n't look half bad ! Great product , Great price !
5 #### I 've been using Filtrete a / c filters for about 8 years now and always thought I had to buy them one at a time at a retail store . Since they are n't cheap and I do change my filter every 2 months , I loved the idea of ordering a 6 pack online and saving money ! !
5 #### I 'm loving this nozzle . I have a good , heavy duty hose and good water pressure . I 'm really glad I purchased this nozzle . I 'm going to buy another one or two . Although I have sprinklers , I like watering my back lawn to make sure I get under the trees and water plants where the sprinklers do n't reach . With this nozzle , I can water my lawn , trees and plants in less time and feel confident that they 're watered sufficiently .
5 #### I 've used used this several times ( mostly scrambled eggs ) and love it . I like the fact I do n't have to worry about it rusting if it stays in the water a few days . Ok , so I 'm a guy , old , divorced and not into cooking but I found if I spray it with ' Pam ' is is very easy to clean but y' all probably already knew that . I have learned , ' Do n't skimp on quality ' of kitchen utensils , you 'll pay more in the end . Not gon na tell you about my cheap ' melted ' spatula ! Good product . Hope my comments were a help .
3 #### I thought I would use this a ton to scrape off little edges here and there , but it 's just not that effective . My unit arrived with a poorly calibrated blade , and the adjusters are DEFECTIVE . They do not properly align with the blade making them useless .
5 #### After eating popovers fresh out of the oven at the Jordan Pond House in Acadia , Maine , I just had to buy a popover pan ! Spread them with butter and a good quality strawberry jam and you 'll think you died and went to heaven ! This one is fantastic . It 's non stick which is great and the individual cups are big so you get nice large popovers . It 's very well made . Easier to use than the old fashioned cast iron pans . The batter is very simple and you can get a good recipe on the internet . The hardest part about this is waiting for them to come out of the oven !
1 #### I 'm laughing so hard . Why would Amazon.com even list this item since no one likes it .
4 #### Wonderful tool . Had me cutting corners for crown and floor molding like a pro .
5 #### One of the youtbers that I follow had one of these . I have been looking into them for a while . I found this one . The price was great . I used a few times and the pancakes come out as the faces . It is easy to clean . It does take a few tries to get the faces to come out perfectly . They are great bite size pancakes .
5 #### I purchased the door cover to show of more decorations for next years holloween stravaganza I do every year was a must add on
5 #### my girls split an pretty much every night after dinner . This makes it super quick for me to core the apple and slice it up ! ! ! Saves me lots of time at the end of the day !
5 #### I purchased an orginal Garden Rocker a few years back . Hey , this little seat saves much back pain and makes yard chores a bit easier . I use it when ever I may be kneeling or low to the ground . Maintaining the flower beds .... I would not be with out it ! If you have a green thumb , and a creaky back , be wise and make the purchase . I recomend the cusion cover , just because it is a cusioned cover .... now my rear end is happy , too . Now , let me tell a story about the company , Vertex . I had a problem , I contacted them , and they did me right ! They did n't make any hoops for me to jump through , at all . The only question they asked was , what is your address . I related a problem , and they responded with perfect customer service ! You can bet I am happy with them . And , you can bet I 'll consider the other products they offer . And , nope I do not work for them . Amazon ... great company , perfect customer service ; Vertex .... great company , perfect customer service . Thanks Vertex .
3 #### Weber makes this grill line so confusing with all of its " Silver " " Gold " and " Platinum " designations . The most appealing feature to me about this grill was that I could move a lever and the ashes would magically dump into an ash bin that I could detach and empty out with no muss or fuss . Well , as it turns out , that feature is only on the more expensive versions but the product description is not that clear . With this lower cost version , there is a lever but the ashes just fall out the bottom onto the ground or whatever you put underneath to catch them . I end up just picking it up and turning it upside down into the garbage .
5 #### Only had to replace because it 's such good quality , friends keep borrowing and " forgetting " to return . Locking feature works well . Length is long enough to be versatile without being so long that case is too bulky to conveniently carry or store .
3 #### If you do some medium stuff I do not recommend that table . The rotary tool is easy to insert yes , but even if you tight it you can still move the bit . So in action the router bit ( in my case ) will move if it hits some harder areas inside the wood and changes the direction slightly but very well visible after you are done . That s bad ! You be able to get straight lines . I think that this is only for very light tasks and super soft Woods .
3 #### This bag is huge ! I was going to use it for my car tools , but it is big enough to hold a small car :-) Although it has several pockets , most of the bag is the undivided center section and is probably 2 cubic feet in volume . Many of the outside pockets are so small , you 'd be lucky to squeeze a screwdriver blade in them . As opposed to another reviewer , my bag does not have any plastic or rubber feet , just the nylon material . If you 're used to carrying your stuff in a bucket or large box , this is a big leap forward . If you 're looking for something to carry a set of special purpose tools , than one of the smaller sizes might be more to your liking .
5 #### Love Lysol products . My son & I are allergy sufferers . Sometimes your allergy congestion can turn into a nasty infection & it 's more than dust that you 're sneezing and coughing out . I use the Lysol wipes & spray to keep the germs at bay so that our sniffles do n't go any further than they have to . I have to say that the smell of the solution is fresh & pleasant . I recommend both of these products highly as they are a staple in our home !
5 #### use for some big pool fittings and it does the job well .
5 #### Easily harvested the insides to replace old unit in water proof box . Works great . Comes with 1 set of on / off pins .
5 #### This cutter is a blast to use . Just remember to be safe .
5 #### Good solid hose , takes being run over and is easy to clean . Do not buy craftsman or Kobalt hose , they do not come close to the quality of this hose .
5 #### I bought a mini maglite and wanted this accessory kit to go with it . These items iin the kit work great . I just wish it had a carrier case instead of a clip .
2 #### The bottle broke on the second use . Had to find another bottle . It stinks too .
5 #### This 8 ounce glass hummingbird feeder is made very well . I plan on ordering another one for the other patio door I have off the office . It has an elegant look to it
4 #### Been playing with this all day , wish there were more rpm , but it does the job , and worth the price
4 #### This works so much better than your standard run of the mill window box fan . The fan this is replacing is about 6 years younger than me when fans were made of American steel by Americans in America for America ( and the home of the , brave ) But after 38 years , even that one eventually died . This fan fills the gap of the window opening allowing it to efficiently move rather large amounts of air . This is a bonus over regular box fans as without sealing the opening , you 're not really moving air as effectively as possible . IMO , the best way is to crack ( 4"-6 " ) windows in opposite parts of the house and let this pull air . In the mornings , I have this set to intake and open the attic door so that the attic can ventilate up and out the roof vents very well . The only real drawback is that it 's a rather flimsy construction . But once it 's in place , there 's really no need to worry about such things .
5 #### We capture rain water in barrels and use these to prevent mosquitoes from breeding in the barrels . They seem to work .
4 #### I 'm usually all thumbs when it comes to things like making fire happen but even I could figure this thing out . The ignitor was a little tricky the first couple of times but I eventually figured it out . I bought this thinking that a little grill this size is great for a single person but when I had to cook for seven people it had enough room to handle several pounds of chicken at a time . It cooks very evenly and having tackled everything from shrimp , tuna steaks , burgers , and chicken I have n't burned anything on it yet . The propane tanks are cheap and easy to find locally so that 's a plus . To enhance the grilled flavor I use some soaked wood chips placed in tin foil and the flavor turns out just as good as larger grills I 've had in the past ; I think the smaller space in this little Weber concentrates the flavor so it cooks the smokey taste into the food quickly . I often use&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Fire - Wire - Stainless - Steel - Flexible - Grilling - Skewer - Set - of-4 / dp / B003NHBFTM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Fire Wire Stainless Steel Flexible Grilling Skewer , Set of 4</a>&nbsp;which helps me take the most advantage of the heat and space . I have n't found any flaws in performance in two seasons of use . So far no issues with rust or other cosmetic issues but I keep it out of the elements under a small patio table when it 's not in use . Very pleased with this purchase and highly recommended .
5 #### I would give this popper a 5 for sure - does a great job - follow the directions do not use any extra oil or extra popcorn - I would not recommend making 4 servings of this at a time as our lid popped off and popcorn was popping all over the kitchen - I must admit it was entertaining - so much better than microwave popcorn - fresh - you control the salt - butter so not necessary but a nice option .
4 #### Great little stapler . My wife , who had arthritis in her hends , really appreciated it when reupholstering our dining room chairs . I ca n't believe Porter Cable did n't provide some staples with it to get started , however . Finding a local source for the staples has been a problem .
5 #### I can not explain the hours of fun my roommate and I have with our magnetic words . After a bit of wine , the creativity really flows !
5 #### Works great , I spray around the foundation of the house twice a year , the only bugs that I see are dead , I did not spray one year , and the carpenter ants and the termites tried to move back in , ounce I sprayed , they were gone . I will keep using it
5 #### This knife is beautiful . Like all of the Shun Ken Onion knives it is well weighted and extremely sharp ( straight from the box ) . However it is not 10 - inches as the above title and description outlines . It is instead only 9 - inches . This of course does n't impact at all on its functionality ; it 's still incredible . But it begs the question of who measured it for this description ... perhaps someone who likes to overestimate in other areas also ...
5 #### got exactly what I ordered quickly . I needed a new battery because I lost mine so this is exactly what I needed
5 #### I use these to hang my Polaroid pictures up and they are a great conversation starter . I would purchase again if needed .
5 #### OK , I 've owned 2 Sharks and a Swivel Sweeper , all 3 were Cordless vacs , and this Eureka cordless vac beats them all hands down , period , bar none ! It 's well constructed and is n't loud and noisy whatsoever like corded vacuums are , the sound is more like a hum . The dirt cup is easy enough to empty and rather than just shake the dirt off the filter I use a hand brush to get the filter good and clean . I can vacuum approx . 500 sq ft of carpet , which is the amount of traffic area in my house , then when I 'm in the last area the battery starts waning so I 'd really like to see Eureka make a longer lasting battery . That aside though I recommend this Eureka cordless vacuum highly !
5 #### These are really strong and will do 1.5 - 2 " limbs easily .
4 #### I bought these to haul my two kayaks . Works great . I would have given 5 stars , but it does not come with any reflectors or padding material . Also , the flag it comes with was missing my first order , Amazon sent me a new one , but the flag is real cheap ... just a piece of red thin plastic .
2 #### I 'm an avid tea drinker and I drink 95 % of that from loose tea so I really need a few good tea strainers . I assume that all tea balls would be the same because I 've bought most of mine from dollar stores or other cheap places anyways - tea balls are not all created equal . This one seemed pretty cheap and flimsy . Its a nice size for doing a whole pot ( 2inches ) but I do n't think I 'd recommend unless you do n't have dollar stores in your area .
4 #### I 've had one for about 3 years . It works well the vast majority of the time . I use it weekly , and enjoy it very much . There are two minor annoyances : 1 . The nailer jams once or twice almost every session of use . That probably averages to one jam every 75 or so shots . The jams are not difficult to clear , but sometimes result in marring my work . 2 . The tool puts a dent in the wood beside the nail unless I hold it in a particular way . I have looked for the cause and played with the depth adjustment , but to no avail . The problem is minor , but I wish I did n't have to remember to tweak it just right before I pull the trigger . This is the only finish nailer I 've ever owned , so I do n't know if level of trouble is normal for them . In any case , I am glad I own the tool .
4 #### Ok , for some uses , but does n't work well to hold kreg jig . Had to buy the kreg clamp for that .
5 #### This is a very good mobile base , especially for the money . It was a bit challenging to assemble given the very poor documentation . They did n't even have a clear photo of it to go by . Once I had it down , it works well . I plan to build a box for it to mount my table saw to .
3 #### Valves work well and reliably . However , I had 7 of 16 split on the output side from the hose barb . The split did not happen right away , but over several weeks . This is possibly my own fault , but I have a very large nursery , and have installed well over a hundred solenoids over the years , and never encountered this problem before , so it makes me suspicious Just be sure to go on the light side when attaching the male adapters and hose barbs , and stay away from metal hose barbs .
4 #### Area birds like the majority of this mix . They leave the oats and large corn kernels untouched , though . We do n't get too many squirrels but we do get rabbits and hares who feast on the leftovers . However , because of the large variety of seeds and other edibles in this bag , leaving this out for wildlife attracts perhaps too many critters to your property , luring in the predators . Some municipalities and counties fine residents for feeding wildlife . Squirrels tend to scare off the birds , so be careful where you place this stuff .
5 #### Easy to use especially when the fabric and garden staples are used .
5 #### Great gloves for just about any application ! I personally have ordered three pairs of these gloves ( a pair in each vehicle ) as I live on a farm and often have to fix fence or cut firewood . They hold up great and I love the way they fit as well as the look !
5 #### Good tools make the difference . This dado set cuts perfectly straight and smooth .
5 #### This was the best purchase I 've made in a long time ! With me working by myself about 95 % of the time , this has saved me A LOT of time and frustration ! Worth every penny I paid ( around $ 50.00 with Dewalt sale )
5 #### This is a nice little gadget . My husband ordered it and I thought it would be silly . Now I 'm the one using it every time I pull and apple out of the fridge . Good quality and handy to have around .
5 #### OK .. I 'll admit it ... I doubted that the George Foreman Grill would work . Let 's be honest , it 's advertised on an infomercial . But after the thirtieth time of seeing the informercial , I began to wonder . So , I bought one . I did n't use it for weeks , and then when I finally did I was shocked to find out that IT WORKS ! Better than I even hoped . I cooked two chicken breasts , and they were done in 4 minutes or so . Tasted like I had BBQed them outside ( of course , ca n't do that -- live in an apartment ) . Then I tried veggie burgers -- worked well too . Hot dogs , hamburgers -- so far everything has worked . What i love about this is that it cooks so quickly -- faster and more tastier than a microwave ( healthier too ) . Clean up is simple , just wipe the grill surface . One tip -- clean the grill immediately after use ... if you wait , it becomes more difficult .
4 #### When we bought our house , my wife complained that the tub would drain while she was taking a bath . after pulling the old drain apart , the rusted replacement bolts broke and it was obvious that the existing drain was corroded beyond repair . When putting in the unit , the drain lever piece was challenging to put into place without the metal retainer pulling into the tub hole . It was not clear from the instructions how tight these should be nor was Moen support very helpful on this . In the end , I managed to get this in place and it has not leaked over the course of the last year . The actual assembly appears to be good quality and I am happy with the purchase .
2 #### Used this product only once but it worked out fine . Nice stainless steel finish . Will have to wait to see how it holds up . Good price and free shipping with Amazon . Bottom is solid . I was worried cause some reviews indicated a thin bottom .
5 #### Replaced a very nosy mechanical unit that kept people awake at night . Very easy to program and it works perfectly .
5 #### Good Battery seems to be working fine . Came right away .
5 #### OK but not much range to it , but if you buy that hose its the only nozzle that wo n't leak on your hand .
5 #### Really cute feeder . Good quality . The golden finch love it ( although not as much as the socks ) . It looks exactly like the picture .
5 #### This is very sturdy and a good size for scooping soil from bags . I would recommend this product for it 's easy of use .
5 #### We use these with a light that attracts bugs in our basement when we plant plants , works well with the Fly Web Light .
5 #### This is a great drill , but know what you 're getting : This model has a big motor yet only spins up to 850 rpm ( which is 1/3 the speed of a " normal " drill ) . It can power - through most anything and is perfect for spade bits , auger bits , and hole saws . For all your other drilling needs , a light duty model is what you want . Bottom line : this is a great tool at a reasonable price .
3 #### Not the best at getting rid of ice , however I think the one I got was from a previous year . Might be better off getting this at a big box store in order to ensure its freshness . Pros - If its a new jug then its works well - Does n't hurt my dogs feet - Never had problems with " blue " coloring being dragged into house Cons - Jug off Amazon was old and did n't work at all It works , but not as well as traditional salt . I will continue to buy it but probably at store to ensure its fresher .
5 #### Sharp enough to make clean cuts while pruning a plant . the action is springy and precise , and the safety catch is solid . Stands up to repeated wear and tear .
5 #### This bowl is a dream . I can whisk up my egg whites perfectly in this and it cleans up super easily . I 'm buying the bigger sizes next .
4 #### Only used one so far , but it worked . much cheaper that the hardware stores . As long as one does not touch them with your fingers ( where CLEAN gloves ) they should last . They are just a common halogen bulb .
4 #### I got this to sharpen my chain saw . It looks well made , but I hope it holds up and lasts awhile ? It 's my first one from them . SW
5 #### Who would have ever thunk that a salad spinner could bring such joy ? Tried it last night with an assortment of lettuce , baby greens , spinach , endive ( yes , I love the stuff ) and hit the plunger a few times . The salad was exquisite with no wet leaves . Was able to use less dressing , some crumbled Feta cheese and went back for seconds .
4 #### Works very well and seems to hold up well .. Is light and easy to collapse and store .
4 #### So far so good . Have used a couple of times and it fits in our " knife block " . If it was longer , we would have to find another place to store ...
4 #### It 's exactly what I want . I have had J A Henckels cutlery made in Germany and agree this series is lesser by comparison but the bread knife blade is slim . I find this an advantage in some situations and and happy it 's steel blade and handle are in order for this type of knife . It performs well and washes as it should without rust .
5 #### I replaced one of my wall switches with the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Honeywell-7 - Day - Programmable - Timer / dp / B004SOZHXY / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Honeywell 7 - Day Programmable Timer</a > . Amazon suggested this item for fitment and I can confirm it fits flush with no issues . Extremely happy !
5 #### Fits vacuum and works just great , the same model I replaced on the vacuum that lasted over a year of light use
5 #### I got this to save me money on my Dewalt planer blades . Set up is straight forward and easy . I have used it now for 2 yrs and it works great . Pull it out and set it up and you can have your planer blades sharp in 15 to 20 minutes . That 's alot better than spending $ 50.00 a pop on blades . I have already paid for this with resharpening the 5 blades I had purchased before getting this . Great tool , it does kinda make a mess though .
5 #### Agree with the other users , yes the apple MAY turn brown a little but still tastes the exact same . This tool is great . Takes a little practice to shoot right through and get it all but after a few times works great .
3 #### Hose is good and resists kinking / deforming well , but they do build up a good amount of static cling :) Can get these for about the same price at your local big box stores ( about $ 20 to $ 25 ) .
5 #### Honestly , the best potatoes friend cutter I 've ever purchased . Easy to clean and use .
3 #### I have not used my Bundt pan yet . I can tell you it is very heavy .
5 #### This is the exact bunt pan on America 's Test Kitchen . They never say the size or what they are using but this is it .
5 #### Fits perfectly in the palm of my hand and works great . The bristles are stiff so it is not meant for soft - ish stuff but I love that I can actually use this on a carrot instead of peeling half of it away . And it does a great job on potatoes -- regular and sweet .
5 #### I purchased this as a gift because of the great job OXO does in producing their products . From an earlier experience in using this particular product I 'm sure it will be used for years to come .
5 #### I finally have a yard of my own and with it comes the maintenance . I purchased a lawn mower but quickly learned that there are lots of areas that the lawnmower just ca n't reach or fit into . Since I do n't have a weed wacker , I went back with a pair of regular scissors to touch up the corners of the yard and around ornamental plants and rocks . I quickly developed painful blisters around my fingers - not to mention sore hand muscles . I could have gone out to purchase a weed wacker but it did n't seem worth it for such a small area that needed touching up . I found these shears on amazon that are basically over - sized scissors made specifically for grass . These were perfect . The handles are much more comfortable and I do n't get anymore blisters although I still get the sore hand muscles . The blades are nice and sharp and can be rotated so you do n't have to twist your hand in an awkward position to use it . It cuts easily through the El Toro Zoysia grass as well as any small weeds and sticks that are laying around . I 'm glad to have found this on amazon .
5 #### I bought this to replace the same model which I 've used for quite a few years , until the ravages of time and mistreatment led the handle coating to split . These days , I have no confidence in replacements ( mainly from other countries ) but this appears to be essentially the same item . If it lasts as well as the old one , I 'll be delighted , because it 's comfortable to use and sturdy enough for the chores it 's designed for .
5 #### I much prefer snap connectors thought they tend to be overpriced . Gardena is my favorite brand . I usually remove the autostop valve inside .
5 #### Used this to install new bamboo floors . Worked excellent at helping to remove trim and molding . I was quickly able to remove nails from the floor and walls . This is one of those tools you 'll get a lot of use from .
5 #### So far so good . I have had this in use for almost a year and even though the squirrels try to get to the food they ca n't succeed ......
5 #### Great bar . I 've used these bars for 25 years . I got this one for my grandson to do some remodeling .
5 #### Unbelievable flavor . I just recommend to everyone to get a smoker box as it allows 1/3 of the normal usage to occur during a normal session . Saves material big time . Plus it is less offensive to the neighbors , I am for certain .
5 #### This is a quick and easy way to have mashed potatoes without whipping out the hand mixer . You control the lumps and general texture . First , this is easy to use . Unlike a vertical masher , the OXO has an easy grip handle which is comfortable to use and requires far less " muscle " . I like the fact that I have more control over the texture of my mashed potatoes . I like basic mashed potatoes that are on the lumpy side and the control you have using this masher will produce the perfect lumps . However , when I make my holiday mashers with cream cheese I can go as creamy as I want . This also can be used on sweet potatoes , squash , pumpkin , and even cooked apples . It is easy to clean due to its simple design and lack of crannies . Additionally , it is well made like all OXO products . It 's not easy to find good mashers , but I do n't need to look further since I found this gem .
3 #### I live near the woods and have a very large back yard that my dogs and kids love to use , so it 's no surprise that we can get a lot of flies . I wanted to test out three different fly traps to see which would work best for me . I tried this trap , the 20,000 rescue fly trap bag , and a larger bag . This one came in second place in my mind , which is why I rated it with three stars . First , the amount of flys caught was not bad , but it was n't very good when comparing it to the 20,000 rescue fly trap . Second , I saw that some flys were able to get out ( which was not the case with the previously mentioned product ) . Is this a good trap ? Yes , it will catch flys . However , it 's not the best from what I saw . It 's recommended if you ca n't get the 20,000 rescue fly trap bag .
5 #### This was a replacement for my lost FatMax ... so I already knew what I wanted . For a motion picture focus puller , this is THE long range , small metal tape measure , that is so handy for our jobs . Good price , very fast delivery from this dealer
5 #### Great for keeping birds out of your berries and so forth .
5 #### Safest product for de - icing decks and sidewalks for pet owners . It does the job of melting the ice and is safe for pets .
5 #### Works well so far . My husband likes it too . It cooks fast especially if you are Asian and you do n't want to cook your white wood ear for half a day to get it soft .
1 #### It 's cheaper to purchase Russian sunflower seed in the large 25 pound bags and cracked corn and mix your own , adding peanuts in the shell . There were only about 20 peanuts in the 10 pound bag of Kaytee that I bought . Very disappointing .
5 #### Excellent quality ! Very sturdy and built well ! I love this fork ! Great price !
5 #### I believe for the price , it 's well worth it . However I took it upon myself to file down the edges on the bottom half for better slide power under our thin metal .
3 #### Plugs too close together to plug any two significant plugs next to one another . Otherwise works great .
4 #### You can buy [ less expensive ] versions of this clamp ... The plastic wears off and then the metal edges show through . Then the plastic comes off and gets lost . The springs are barely passable when new . Not the Pony . The plastic does wear off , but not until after a long time of hard use . It use them at the miter saw table all the time . Makes it easier to cope molding when it is clamped to something solid .
5 #### Works great . Move my compressor all over the place with ease .
5 #### This is my " go to " tool for measuring while working on many projects . You do n't have to completely unfold this ruler to use and still lays flat on your workpiece . When folded it fits in your back pocket and for many applications is much more handy than a tape measure .
5 #### Bright and easy to position . Just what a book light should be .
4 #### Works well for small jobs . Better to have a longer handle for larger bowl .
5 #### I love this stuff - stinky ai n't even beginning to describe it so handle with care - the deer , bunnies and squirrels are staying clear of my garden this year . Ca n't tell you all the things I 've tried over the years that did not work . Now when I go out to pick some big juicy tomatoes or beautiful crisp peppers I can find them unmolested . Last year the deer not only ate the tomatoes but even ate the tomato flowers so I had to wait for more flowers ... Also I am spraying the hosta ( deer like the leaves ) and spraying the hosta stems , which the bunnies like and that is working nicely . AND I HAVE PEACHES THIS YEAR - the kid next door suggested I put this spray on them and yes , I 've got nice size peaches that are beginning to blush . Usually by this time the squirrels have totally stripped the ( sour ) under - ripe peaches and thrown them all over the ground . To mix : be sure to have a bucket of water handy to quickly submerge your measuring cup . Never overfill the sprayer as when you put the plunger in , it can backsplash on you and with this stinky stuff , that involves an immediate shower and hair wash ... do n't ask how I know this . So yeah it stinks but after it is mixed and sprayed you wo n't smell it but your freeloading vandals will ... heh heh - I even have my lilies this year .
5 #### If you are doing any dust collection , particularly from stationary machines , you 've got to get one of these . It lets the large chips from planers , jointers , lathes , table saws and floor sweeps drop into a 30 gallon galvanized trash can ( that you supply ) . This is so much easier than endlessly dumping the bag on a dust collector . Another great reason to have one of these ; how many times have you accidentally sucked up an important piece of hardware and spent hours sifting through a dust bag trying to find it ? Metal parts will drop to the bottom of the barrel where they are easily found . This also saves the impeller blades of your dust collector from damaging impacts . I always empty it before sweeping the floor , just in case I encounter a stray chunk I want to recover . You should keep the barrel dumped fairly often , as this will increase efficency . The only thing better would be a cyclone system , but they are more costly and take up more space . This unit is also quite portable , which is handy in a one - hose shop . I do n't think you 'll be disappointed if you put one of these to work in your shop . You 'll wonder how you ever worked without it .
5 #### Fantastic light .... bright ! ! ( do n't know what reviewer was complaining about- even on low setting it is sufficient ) I have purchased three of these and going back to get more . The perfect light for reading in bed without keeping partner up with lamp .... the perfect light for reading , period, ... especially for " Boomers " that wear reading glasses . Great little gifts ( stocking stuffers ) without spending an arm and a leg . This light is VERY easy to use and manipulate . I also use it to read outside at night . Perfect ! The batteries last a long long time . I gave my dad one for his birthday September 2008 . He uses it almost every day and battery still working nearly one year later . Update October 2009 : Even though the battery and bulb were still working after one year , ( and it says only 40 hours for the battery here on Amazon ) I ordered replacements for my Dad thinking they had to be getting close to running out . Everyone living in his house kept trying to confiscate Dad 's Mighty Bright . I bought them each one so they would leave his alone ! The replacements came quickly . I love these things- Just ordered two more . ( for a total of 6 now ) They are the perfect gift that " keeps on giving" .... at the right price ! And easy to replace bulbs / batteries . Highly recommended !
4 #### First one leaked ... the replacement one works great . Good heavy spray for cleaning and light spray for watering . Way sturdier than all the other ones we 've had that were plastic and broke .
2 #### The feeder was evidently designed by a fashion designer rather than someone who knew anything about hummingbirds . The flowerets stick up so high that there is a danger of breaking them off each and every time you remove the feed container . THEN there is the minor detail of the flowerets being the wrong color and the birds not being able to find the food . The hummers would buzz the feeder and look all around it , but could not locate the feeding ports . Fortunately for us , the wife had the bottom of an old and cheap feeder that just fit the threads on the container . Its a red bottom with flat yellow flowerets , but the birds can find the food and are regularly feeding on it . The Woodlink NAH6 Audubon Glass Mini Lantern Hummingbird Feeder is a much better buy . I bought both , just to give the wife some variety in the feeders and the birds are feeding from it more than any other feeder we have .
5 #### works great . requires about 1/10 the effort of my old harbor freight 6 lb . maul .
2 #### Not happy with this . It turned like as ash color fairly quickly . I would recommend it for a lower price .
4 #### We bought this for a back yard that has many narrow paths that are grass , curving around flower beds . We usually use a weed whacker , but that is tedious and noisy . I thought this was worth a try for the money and I 'm very glad I bought it . It is not only blissfully quiet , but it also does a great job on grass and most weeds . If you try and whack anything to hearty the stalks will get caught in the blade and immediately stop it . It 's for light - weight mowing , not clearing a weedy field . Anyhow , we still use our weed whacker for tight spots , but this has taken its place everywhere else . It 's so easy to just shove it around for a few minutes that the yard seems to get mowed without even thinking much about it .
5 #### I have had the Intermatic 60 - minute spring timer installed on 3 different bathroom fans for the past 6 years . One finally failed and would not count down when you set it above 30 minutes so I replaced it with this unit which is the same model number as the original installation . I have had it installed for about 4 months now and it works fine . I will probably buy another one to have as a spare . update : 09/04/2013 still working fine .
4 #### We have about eight glass diamond faceted crystals . Getting the light to produce rainbows is difficult . Considering buying or building a light box . This one is a straight through rainbow . It throws many rainbows in a large ring on the floor in line with where the sun would hit otherwise . Since it is plastic I do not have to worry about it falling when the suction pads fails . Until I find better this is my favorite by far . Happy Trails
5 #### This works great , sharp blade so cores apples easily . Handle is comfortable .
5 #### I have surely enjoyed gliding on my porch this past summer , thanks to this really well built glider . Ca n't say enough good things about it . I 'm definitely in the realm of old age and I was able to put it together easily . Ca n't imagine that anyone would be unhappy with one of these .
5 #### This item is replacing an aluminum 5 QT cooker . Stainless steel is far superior for cooking and cleaning , and the 6QT size is perfect when four are being fed . Even spaghetti sauce is a snap with this unit , something I never attempted in the old aluminum pot .
5 #### If you have a real pond investment , you need this !
5 #### No more unsightly mounds in my yard ... this did the job ! Fast , inexpensive and an efficient solution to rid my yard of those pesty moles .
5 #### This is a very solid brush . I got tired of buying ... and replacing ... the cheaper toilet brushes . I spent the money on three of these for each bathroom and really like them . They are solid , no flexing or breaking and do a great job of really scouring the toilet bowl to ensure a thorough cleaning . Definitely recommend to everyone . I bought these probably close to a year ago and they are still as solid as the day I got them .
3 #### Good threaded clamp . However , it does not allow for spreading applications , only clamping .
4 #### easy to set up and use . Zapper scored on the first night deployed . To date Rat Zapper has 7 kills
2 #### A clever design , but you have to turn it upside down for the water to contact the tea . Unless it is very tightly sealed with no stray leaves in the threads , you have a big hot mess on your hands -- or in your lap . This will only get worse as the plastic ages . As others have noted , filling to the line only gives you around 10 ounces of tea , not the nominal 12 . The strainer is considerably coarser than normally found in tea brewing baskets , so I had to line it with mesh from a permanent coffee filter to keep leaves out of the brew . My advice is to get a wide - mouth thermos with a standard tea - brewing basket .
5 #### Bought three of these since I seem to break off the perches often . Then I found that the perches on this one are actually flexible and forgiving rather than rigid . It also seems much easier to fill and reconnect the tank than the old ones . Good product .
5 #### Good veggie brush cleaner . Fits comfortably in my hand and scrubs good .
5 #### Love this bowl . I have rheumatoid arthritis and this bowl is just perfect . Light , easy to handle , the rubber bottom is great !
5 #### great bags . wish i would have bought a bigger vacuum but its does the trick . had it a year , no issues except for cleaning it out ... gross sometimes .
5 #### 3 - M is a company that we have great respect for . You get what you pay for . No more - No less . Phil
5 #### I had an old Oxo that finally bit the dust and was looking for a replacement- thought it would be easy . I mean , how hard can it be to find a decent tea kettle ? Well , I found out it 's much harder than I thought . I bought an Oxo good grips and burned my hand on the handle the very first time . I make a lot of tea , so I returned it . I wanted a whistling kettle that was not made in China and was of decent quality . The Chantal is beautiful and I love the harmonica whistle . The quality of workmanship is impressive . If you do n't put the kettle on a burner that is too big for it , the handle barely gets above body temperature . Even if you do put it on a big burner , the handle gets quite warm , but not hot enough to burn . The only downside is that the capacity is a little less than my old one ( not a problem , just noting it ) and the price- which I must admit the the most I have ever paid for a tea kettle ! Nevertheless , I am VERY happy with this kettle and it looks gorgeous in my kitchen .
5 #### Amazing bags , if you are vacuuming up drywall dust , concrete dust , etc . these bags are for you .
5 #### Use this all the time for seasoning stews for venison dishes or fish stews that have seasoning that do n't get dissolved into the dish . The clasp holds well and I do n't have to worry about the large pepper corns or other seasonings falling out . Easily washed or thrown into the dishwasher for cleaning .
5 #### Great little espresso maker ! We were at a family members who also has one . And whenn they made some my husband had to have one . This size is perfect for 4 espresso size cups or 2 coffee size cups . Where you could then add steamed milk , or make lattes and such . Also it really makes it up faster than you would think .
5 #### This is a great fork . There are small barbs on the tip of the fork to prevent the meat from slipping off . The grip is also great , like on all OXO products . Edward Post
4 #### Great handles for the price , although there was a slight twist from head to handle with the one I used on my 10 lb . sledge .
5 #### Whisper - quiet , mechanically simple , easy to maintain ; it leaves just the smell of freshly cut grass and the chirping of the birds in its wake . I 've been mowing a 1 - acre lot this year using only this mower and a scythe for cutting around the edges and under shrubbery . Early in the morning when it is still cool is the best time . The hour just before sunset is also good . Your neighbors will not mind . The birds and squirrels will not mind . Keep at it , mow a little more frequently , and come at the lawn from different directions and pretty soon it will look like a golf course . You will want to take off your shoes and mow barefoot . This is n't as burdensome as one might think if you enjoy the outdoors and do n't mind a little walking . It is not a job , as mowing with the power mower in the heat of the day once was . I do n't really care that much what the lawn looks like ; but just enjoy the quiet meditation and exercise after a long day sitting . And if the lawn ends up looking great afterwards , well there 's nothing wrong with that .
5 #### These are the bags I needed at the right price .
5 #### Just an awesome tool to have in the pouch . You can use it for many things .
5 #### I purchased this replacement chain as I needed a new chain for my 18 " electric chain saw . Seems to be correct as it resolved my worn out chain issue .
4 #### First couple times it worked great . Now the water turns brown and it does n't work at all . I followed the directions so I 'm really disappointed
2 #### Not terrible , but it does n't work the best . It does n't hold all of the leaf pieces in , so it gets into the water ad you have to wind up straining it anyway .
5 #### These gadgets work great . I use them to make empanadas ... I used to seal my empanadas with a fork , so time consuming and tedious ! ! I used these today and I was amazed at how fast I could seal the empanadas ... probably cut the time in half ! Love it ! Seems sturdy enough , and they are also very easy to clean .
5 #### This is the best popcorn popper ever . We bought a microwave popcorn popper that did not work very good . This pops nearly all of the popcorn up . We would recommend it .
5 #### This peeler is mega sharp . When delivered it had a plastic sheath over the cutting edge . When I used it , I needed almost no force . It was very easy to peel carrots with this . I have two other high - end peelers one of which is ceramic and the other Grove which is serrated . This one needs less force them both of those . I bought this one because it came recommended on the website review as the best model . I am not disappointed .
5 #### These cabinet face clamps are extremly useful for installing cabinets . They do what they claim . They work very well with a cabinet lift I bought [ ... ] Awesome .
5 #### Works real well , I used this for 3 5/8 " crown , but it looks like I can cut larger pieces as well . Easy to install and does not move .
4 #### Works fine , has a nicer look than most . Uses less power than the ones that are really made for livestock watering troughs , but can still keep an open area at -10F. Slightly small size ( especially height ) would be useful in smaller bird baths .
5 #### Almost without exception , this is the volumetric measuring device I reach for first . It is also a standard gift for friends who enjoy cooking ; I typically keep a couple on hand so I can just hand them to friends . Now the Bad / Good news ... Bad : It only achieves * almost * perfect because it will retain about a quarter cup of water ( with assorted gnarly food bits ) once the dishwasher cycle is finished . Good : This sole shortcoming is so easily corrected I 'm surprised that the mfr has n't done it already ! Simply drill four holes in the base ( ~1/8 " does nicely ) just below where the bottom of the measuring compartment meets the base . The plastic curves such that it is would actually be hard to drill into the measuring volume . I 've done this to about six of these and never had a problem .
5 #### I have two of these at work in my garage shop . They are really great for moving heavy things around in a confined space . I bought one for my Jet drill press first . I mounted the drill press directly on it , and although it was stable enough , I later cut a piece of 3/4 " plywood about six inches larger than the tool base and expanded the frame for added stability . I screwed the plywood to the mobile base from underneath with some # 12 x 1/2 " pan head screws . I then bolted the drill press down through its corner holes . That is a nice feature about these bases - you can change your mind with a wrench ! I bought a second one for the radial arm saw I have been dragging around for 20 years . I should have done it long ago ! On the radial saw I discovered that you really should overlap your rails by at least 4 inches at the corners to keep the weight of the tool from " sagging " the joints . I am considering adding a sheet of plywood under the saw to provide space for a storage cabinet . I also have an HTC base for my Jet table saw . It is the one specifically built for the Jet with the 52 " fence . I could n't live without it either !
5 #### Works as advertised . I no longer have a dog but use this anyway for my plants and neighbors dogs . My only beef is that it is hard to apply evenly . Someone really needs to invent a great pellet sprinkler . I recommend you use it lightly . A lot goes a long way . If you sprinkle in a hurry or forcefully , you get big piles and it is uneven . Try doing it lightly and focusing on being even . That will save you some money . Needs to be cheaper Two stars on price ! If they made / sold it in bags at a lower price ( not necessarily bulk ) , that would be nice . Keep in mind that , temperature also is a factor . Also type of ice or snow and thickness . I found if I put it on surfaces before the storm hit , it worked better as I could shovel better . But for the most part , it is more for slick and icy surfaces . Not snow or sleet . More for ice , visible or not , on concrete and walkway surfaces . I like that it is green . I bought another brand that is just white , but it is hard to put down and you can not see where you put it ! Has been fine on my stained back deck for 10 years . The hot summer sun does the most damage to wood on my deck .
5 #### it still amazes me that this thing , a product of 19th century industrial design , is able to do all it can do : neatly peel , slice and core apples . this particular one is sturdy , and i think it 's vise clamp is more secure than the suction devices that supposedly stabilize other ones . if you 're backing apple pies or tarts , making applesauce , sauteing apples for german apple pancake , you 'll find it a delight to be apple to process the apples you need in just a few minutes . make sure your apples are firm . mushy apples just fragment and fall apart in chunks if you try to send them through this device .
5 #### This nail puller is a great product . It is sturdy and works perfectly for large or small nails . We 've had ours for years . This was a gift for someone just really getting started with their tool collection .
5 #### Great Knife , perfect for fileting fish , cutting tomatoes , good for most cutting tasks . Highly recommend to any chef !
5 #### This is good for cleaning veggies . Good size for a women 's hand and easy to use . Typical OXO , good quality .
5 #### My biggest challenge will be not losing these in the back of a drawer somewhere before I use them all up .
4 #### I got this to cover the Intex Easy Set 8 - Foot Pool . At first , I was not pleased . I kept trying to get the cover to go over the pool , but it did not fit . I could cover about 3/4 of the pool , but one side always slid off . I was going to return it , but decided to keep it until I could buy a tarp . I 'm glad I kept it . After a few uses , the cover stretched out and now it 's no problem for just one person to cover the pool . As other reviewers noted , there are small holes on the surface . They do n't bother me . Not much gets in and when we do get a summer storm , it 's nice to know that the weight of the water wo n't collapse the cover .
4 #### I am delighted with the suction and the lighter weight of this vacuum . Did n't care for the metal arm that attaches to the sweeper head and also did n't like the sweeper head . The metal arm adds too much weight and the head is bulky and weighty and also did n't pick up well . So I simply ordered two extra extension arms which fit fine and also ordered at 12 inch floor brush - voila ! I now have what I want - light weight and not bulky little vacuum with suction . The extras were worth it and makes the vacuum just what I wanted .
5 #### I have n't fixed up a vacuum feed yet , and this bag has certainly cut down the amount of sawdust flying around . Not completely though , I still need to vacuum after each session . So , a big help but not a complete solution .
1 #### You can not juice oranges with this juicer , mandarin oranges perhaps but not regular sized oranges . The juicing part does n't even open up high enough for you to put in the orange half and then when you try to juice it , the juice spills all over because it 's too large . This juice is really only for lemons , limes , do n't purchase it if you 're serious about orange juice .
5 #### Great bit ... a challenge to set up ... unless you know how . I calculated that the bit height should be .650 " + 1/2 of the material thickness . However , that still leaves the fence . With Infinity Tools Lock Miter Master Jig Set ... both bit height and fence setting are spot on every time ... regardless of material thickness . The jig put the bit height at .998 ... the math put the bit height at 1.02 ... that is a great tolerance . This bit makes a great profile cut with very minimal chip out ( what chipping did occur was caused by me feeding the material too quickly ) . I 'm now making perfectly square humidors with ease ! Thanks Freud !
5 #### Stuff works great ! Just be aware for those of you who have purchased a jar of this in a grow store ... it is not the size of the regular one that say , fits in your palm . It is smaller than a golf ball . Nothing wrong with that but it is quite a small amount .
5 #### I live in a mosquito infested area and they frequently get indoors . This is the greatest invention since air conditioning .
5 #### I previously had a " Brand X " melon baller which , with occasional use , developed a cracked handle which I had to tape to keep together and later , the scoop end broke off ! I broke down and got the best ... the OXO is really sturdy and , as with all their products , comfortable to use . I can tell I 'll get years of use out of it without it falling to pieces like my previous one . It just goes to show , even with a product that only gets occasional use , it does n't pay to get a cheap one !
5 #### I use this whisk for almost everything that needs mixing ! I highly recommend this product . Handle is very comfortable and whisk itself is sturdy . Good purchase .
5 #### Used it today for the first time . LOVE LOVE LOVE IT . It grates beautifully ; is comfortable to hold and is n't awkward at all .
5 #### Works really well , easy to hold and use . I use it to scoop cookie dough . I 've come to expect I will like OXO products and I 've never been disappointed . Good design .
3 #### We purchased this clock for our new back deck area . Very nice looking and seems well made . We originally hung it on our fence while it was setting the time but unable to see from the deck . When we moved it up to the deck it lost time about 20 minutes . We have tried resetting and are still waiting for the time to correct , has gotten as close as 7 minutes . We are very conscience of the location for the reception to Denver . Will see what happens but sad to have a clock that is not keeping the correct time . Should have just gone with a regular outdoor clock .
5 #### It holds tea , the tea steeps , the tea does n't fall out . A+ in my book .
5 #### We love this vacuum . It 's efficient , light weight , inexpensive and strong . It really does the job . We have a large house and have to clean rooms constantly for short term guests . It 's easy to carry , set up , use and return to its storage space . We 've had them for over a year and they 're going strong , and we use them constantly . We especially like the hepa filter which helps us reduce allergens . dragonflyhill.wordpress.com
5 #### I have an older vacuum and was worried that I would n't be able to find the right kind of bags for it , but I looked around on Amazon and found these . They are allergen filtration bags and trap dust mites , mold and cat dander . The Type A is still used in quite a few vacuum cleaners from what I read on the bags , so these should be available for some time .
4 #### Great product for the price . It certainly does not cut down on all the dust entering the shop vac , but it definitely removes probably about 60%-70 % . I tried doing some modifications like others have mentioned with adding another 90 * bend on the inlet so the dust would n't be so close to getting sucked back up into the vacuum , but this actually made its worse for me . In addition , if your hoses are stiff you may have an issue with the cover coming off of the bucket , but once you turn the vacuum on the suction should bring it down to create a nice seal . But if your worried about it coming off you could just attach a few screws in your bucket and put a bungee strap over it to secure it in place . I did something similar to this when I built a little cart for the bucket and lid to ride on above my vacuum to it would all move together as an assembly . Overall I would highly recommend this is for an economical dust collection option .
5 #### Great light nice and bright . I used mine under a cabinet and it worked out great .
5 #### Very good quality knife . Bought the sharpener with it .... also excellent . I had lost this knife in my Henckles set months ago and missed that size for slicing a variety of items
5 #### The bulbous handle fits very well in the hand and makes this very easy and non - fatiguing to use , but might not be for everyone .
4 #### good idea it just takes awhile to get the process down
5 #### I 've been using these hoses for years ( with the Goodyear badging ) and they are the best I 've used . They stay flexible in cold weather , do n't crack , and coil up better than other hoses I 've had . Since Continental bought the whole business , including the manufacturing facility , I 'm expecting the one I just bought to be the same quality as my Goodyears .
3 #### Did n't work like I hoped guess my Texas clay is to tough for it . Works good for first foot in top soil though .
4 #### I love Droll Yankee products and this one was no different . Well thought out and well made . I have several feeders that are squirrel - resistant but some of them are filled with larger and more aggressive birds , like Blue Jays , Grackles , Northern Mockingbirds , European Starlings , etc . I wanted something just for the little guys . Where I live we get both the American Goldfinch ( mostly passing through ) and the Lesser Goldfinch . They , along with Purple and House Finches have the feeder pretty much to themselves ( yesterday I saw a Painted Bunting at the feeder , WOW ! ) . Bigger birds , like the ever present White Wing Dove ( similar to Mourning Doves ) attempt to sit on one of the perches and then they slide off when it " dips " . My only complaint is that the perches seems a little TOO sensitive . Northern Cardinals can barely sit on one without it dipping , and then only with the help of a lot of wing - flapping . Still , I really like this feeder for finches and other small birds .
5 #### Heavy duty , great quality and perfect size for me . Love it .
4 #### I am so surprised that this flex shaft works well even when it is set up almost in a circle . I am right - handed and on occasion , I can only hang the drill on the left side so the shaft forms a circle from the drill to the tip , and it worked fine . No vibration . I wish the rotary tool had a ' reverse ' rotation switch but that 's not the flex shaft 's fault . The only reason I did n't give it all 5 stars is the internal coil falls out if you do n't have a collet on the end .
5 #### I have a waterfall in my front flower bed that I wanted to highlight in the evening . This product lets me do it perfectly . It allows me to set the time to begin at dusk and shut down 2 , 4 , or 6 hours later .
5 #### this item works like a charm , but beware that you have to through it away with in a month or it smells like death around your house .
5 #### Kidde is a great brand , and this multi - purpose fire extinguisher is a must - have for homes ... and thankfully , I have never had to use it . :)
5 #### Bought this to go with my snoopy and Woodstock characters . We added them to our outdoor Christmas display this year . The product worked very well . And for the price , it ca nt be beat .
5 #### Fantastic little vacuum for hard floors . Works amazingly well . This little vac can suck a bowling ball through a soda straw .... not really but the suctions it develops is amazing . I have two long haired Cavalier King Chas Spaniels and porcelain tile floors on two levels and the hair accumulates daily . I have to vacuum every other day and this thing makes it a breeze .
5 #### Whoa this thing is sharp . Watch your fingers ! But it peels well and has a great handle to hold onto while peeling those potatoes or carrots . Great , high quality product .
2 #### Worked for a day , my cat would jump over the spot I sprayed , but now it does n't repel her at all , even after a fresh spray .
5 #### If there 's a better jig saw blade out there , I have n't found it . These blades are sharp . They zip right through plastics and other synthetic materials without melting the material . Even if forced , heat does not build up in the blade . The down cutting design keeps the cut line clear to view .
5 #### As the others have said , this product is attractive , heavy duty , and an excellent buy . It is plenty large to hold everything from a spoon , to a spatula , to a ladel . I ca n't ask for a better product .
5 #### Its a short cheap hose . What do you want already .
1 #### THIS DOES NOT FIT INTO THE 3/4 YARD BUTLER BASE , THEY ARE DIFFERENT THREADS ! WHY WOULD YOU SUGGEST THAT THE TWO PIECES FIT TOGETHER WHEN THEY DO NOT ! ONE IS HOSE THREAD AND ONE IS PIPE THREAD YOU NEED AN ADAPTER TO HOOK THE TWO TOGETHER ! ! ! !
5 #### Great idea and works well - instead of using two hands to sift flour over your cooking , can use one hand to stir and the other hand to shake flour out into the pan .
4 #### Most will state the french press is a little small , that is somewhat true . Its about 3 1/2 cups of coffee . I live alone so for me its perfect even if I have a guest over . Easy to clean , good value . I use to have a coffee machine , yet a couple of years ago I tried a plastic french press and now have upgraded to glass . I am a true believer that French Press coffee is the only way to drink coffee . I recommend if you drink on a daily basis without being rushed for time , then upgrade your life to a Bonjour French Press .
5 #### Works great . Quick snips to prune some of my bushes and trees here and there , ca n't beat the price . After all , its fiskars , not a knock off thing . I 'm sure I 'll lose the things before they break / wear out / need sharpening !
5 #### Took the old one off and popped this one in place . Excellent . Not super quiet , but it does the job and I have 5 zones .
5 #### Very useful . Like the fact that you can take it apart and use it as a flat grater .
5 #### I have a 1800square foot home that is all tile floors and this MM Vac works great ! Best buy in years . * * * * * * * * * * 2 years later and I will tell you I turned this vacuum into a backpack vacuum ! Using a baby carrier and buying the aluminum S shaped hose and 14inch brush and I have the best Backpack vacuum around and all together for about $ 175.00 ! ! ! ! ! Many of the commercial backpack vacuums are only around 8 amps , This vacuum is 12amps ! ! ! ! Eureka I love you for this ! ! ! !
5 #### I do n't know if I would buy this if I owned a lot of land ( would get pretty pricey ) , but if you live in the city and only have to maintain a section of sidewalk then you should buy this . You have to buy this . A lot of people walk their dogs , like having dogs , in the city so it 's bad enough they have to walk on concrete everywhere so help 'em out .
4 #### For the most part it works well . Sometimes the skimmer has a tendency to rise up out of the water while the pump is on . This is not good when it happens because air gets into the pump and if not noticed soon enough could cause major damage to the pump . Lately it has been working fine . We used to tie a weight to the skimmer to keep it below the water . When it stays below the water it works great .
5 #### The instructions for this block plane are pretty weak . Butafter sharpening the iron and getting it set up , it works very well . The iron seems to take a good edge . I 've used it quite a bit , and I have n't had to fiddle with it again . It shaves nice long curls of maple and douglas fir .
1 #### I would give this pan an additional star for it 's generous depth and sturdy handles , but why would I do that for a pan that destroys every cake that goes into it ? I have a perfectly good Wilton pan that 's a bit shallower and has no handles . I has a dark coating that has never failed to release the baked goods in one piece . I 've tried the G&F and the spray method and neither worked . I would gladly sell this pan for ten dollars to anyone who believes they 'll have good luck with their prep methods . It 's a shame to throw it away , but worse than that , to pawn it off on someone else . I 'm contemplating it as a part of a junk sculpture .
5 #### Genuine replacement , not a generic . It works great , I do n't need it for most of the winter , but they lose some effectiveness after about 6 months . So need to be replaced once a year .
5 #### I 've presto cookers for over 30 years , this one is an improvement , with weight being lighter , the new handle works better than my last one which was 20 years old . The pressure valve is an improvement being in the handle .
5 #### I have wanted a new pressure cooker for ages but was n't able to buy one till now . As a young adult I got to cook my familys dinner . one of my favorite meals was meatloaf . My mom had this fantastic recipe that was just the best ! ! . So when I giot my pressure cooker I made meatloaf like my mom made . It turned out great ! ! . I am so glad that I bought my presto 3 quart pressure cooker .
5 #### We own a bunch of kitchen stuff from OXO and have generally been pretty impressed with it . This set is no different . It 's light to hold , comfortable to use and comes out of the dishwasher clean ... what more do ya need . I very much recommend this set for anyone just " getting started " . We bought it for our daughter when she moved into her " first place " and she loves it . You will too .
5 #### I purchased both this 2 quart bowl and the 4 quart bowl . I really enjoy cooking with these bowls . They are an improvement over the standard glass or metal bowls that I use to have . The rubberized bottom is the best feature , you can actually run the mixer with one hand and not have the bowl move all over the counter top . The handle has a nice feel to it and the spout actually works without the dribble . I really like these bowls , except the same size bowls do not stack very well . Not a big issue , I have enough storage space , but it would be nice to have a stacking feature . Also , another color other than white would be nice . Even with these two small issues , I will purchase more of these bowls for myself and as house warming presents .
5 #### We have the outside on our fence near our pool . It does exactly as advertised ... tells the time ( it sets itself ) , temp , and humidity . Love it and easy to see .
5 #### I 've only used this on about 10 knives including 2 fish filet knives ; however , it worked great . It took a few minutes to get the hang of it , then I easily sharpened the knives in about 20 - 30 minutes . I used paper towels before and after to determine sharpness -- simply place the towel on a cutting board and , with moderate force , cut the paper . A dull knife will snag the paper and generally do a poor job of cutting .
5 #### Great area coverage . Noticed significantly less mosquitoes in the backyard after stetting this up . Please note , you have to keep the lamp on 24/7 for it to be effective .
5 #### Our coat closet is a hugh double wide door that shuts with magnets ... these knobs worked perfectly . Nice quality and finish
5 #### This is THE best spoon rest ! It will accommodate any cooking utensil -- large or small . I use it every day . It goes into the dishwasher and comes out looking shinny and new . It sits on my counter next to the stove , looks great and is always ready for use . I 'm going to order three more for Christmas presents . A truly great product .
5 #### We bought these to put small parts in around our warehouse , they actually worked perfect and fit on the side of our shelving units so they can hang off each level of shelving .
5 #### OUTSTANDING PRODUCT . I 've had several competitive brands and this is head & shoulders above the others . Really resists tearing . Should last several seasons .
3 #### This is good if you do n't have a lot of humming birds . We only had a few so it worked for us . I also found that it tended to leak and drip the sugar water to whatever is below it .
3 #### Thinner than I Thought , seems tuff enough to keep out birds and squirrels .
3 #### The tea ball is okay . It 's kept its shape , the mesh is good , and the latch and seal on mine work fine . Seeing all the complaints on these two issues , I guess I got lucky . Mine has rusted a little bit , but I probably need the iron . ;) I would n't buy another one , given the complaints and time frames . It took over a month to get here . I inquired of the company after about three weeks of waiting . I received a reply in broken English that it was shipping from China and would arrive soon . Okey , doke , it came about ten days later .
1 #### No dead rats . No interested rats entering . Maybe I have Einstein rats ? Whatever , it did n't serve its purpose , but at least Amazon has a great return policy .
2 #### I like everything about this light EXCEPT the bulb ! Come on MAG get with the program and start putting LED bulbs in all your flashlights . These lights are too well made to put such a dim old - fashioned bulb inside .
5 #### I 'm no tradesman and my use of it is not daily , but possibly weekly . However from my point of view it is a great hammer with a good comfortable feel , shock absorbing construction , and good head that has no deformation even with continued use of driving 4 " steel nails into Australian hardwood ! It will be interesting to see how long the leather handle lasts , but so far I have no hesitation recommending it .
5 #### I 'm not a big Porter - Cable fan , but this thing is the bomb , as my kids would have said about ten years ago . I work mostly with hard woods like hard maple , it keeps right up with it by adjusting the power draw to maintain the RPMs you set it for ( 10 K - 21 K ) . Expensive bugger , but definitely falls into the category of getting what you pay for . Makes my other routers look anemic ( so much so I gave two of them away in disgust ) .
5 #### Nice bought this an like it . Then gave it away to a family member , will get another one
5 #### I love this thing . It is top quality and works well on everything I 've cooked so far . I also purchased the charcoal holders from weber that makes indirect cooking easy . Great investment .
5 #### Love this pan ! Its a nice heavy weight , substantial . Cooked our sons birthday cake and it came out perfectly !
5 #### I ca n't complain about this product . Everything that I have ever gotten from oxo is great quality and design . One great feature is that the spatula head is removable for east cleaning .
5 #### I 've been trying to replace my mother - in - law 's big yellow Tupperware Bowl which I borrow all of the time ! This is the perfect size bowl for bringing fruit salads and large salads to family picnics and for tossing popcorn in to butter !
5 #### we had an OLD outdoor thermometer that the plastic turned yellow and it was really time to get a new one . This looks so nice on the side of our garage where we see it every time we open the door to see what temp it is . It did get some moisture in it when we had an extremely heavy rain , but luckily it cleared up . Tells the humidity also , but i't 's a very nice pretty thermometer .
5 #### I love it , and more importantly , the hummingbirds love it ! The new improved larger mouth on the jar , makes it easier to clean and refill . I have a few different feeders in my garden , and the hummingbirds seem to like this style best .
5 #### Believe me , I 've tried many deer resistant products and this is the best . Be sure to wear gloves , though ... it stinks !
5 #### The breaker on my pool filter kept tripping and at first I though it was the pool filter motor causing it . Turns out the circuit breaker was the culprit .
5 #### The workmate serves great as a portable workbench . The workbench is very sturdy and can hold any tool . I am not a heavy duty handyman but when I do a task I hate leaving tools laying on the ground and forgetting where I put them . The workmate saves me time by giving me a bench where I can set my tools while performing a task . This is the perfect bench for light weight handy folks .
2 #### Yes , they 're 4 feet long , but their diameter varies in the extreme . Some are thin as match sticks while others are quite sturdy . I will not buy them again because about half of them are n't strong enough to do the job I wanted them for .
5 #### I hate mosquitoes with a passion and this works well !
3 #### I got this for my son to help him learn to read German . The first phrase I wanted to put on the refrigerator was " Ich liebe dich " , but I could n't . Someone decided the word " dich " which means " you in English was not an essential word ! There are plenty of mich , sich & ich , but no dich and not even a single " d " to make the word . There are several other important words missing . The magnets also can bend easily , especially if they get stuck in the hinges .
4 #### Works just like it is supposed to . I use this on a back corner of my house and need the wide angle sensor .
1 #### the hummingbirds did not like it . We usually have dozens of Hummingbirds but as soon as we switched to this product rather than make our own , they stopped coming .
5 #### This is my 3rd wind chime from Woodstock . I have the Venus for the low , the Earth for the mid , and now the Pluto for the high . I love to listen to these when the breeze kicks up . I definitely recommend these wind chimes . They 're also beautiful to look at !
5 #### Is what it says it is ; would buy again , works fine , cuts well . Not quite sure what to say for reviews like this ?
5 #### A must have if your going to use larger bits . I leave this one on my router all the time . I only put on the stock plate when doing dove tail work
5 #### Did they job at a tenth of the cost of buying from Home Depot . 6 more words required 6 more words required
5 #### Used to have a Mosquito Magnet but the Flowtrons are so much more effective . I found it necessary to replace the bulbs each year , and these replacement parts work perfectly
5 #### We recently completed major landscaping project in our backyard . The landscaper created a special hammock area down by our little creek for me . The hammock poles were a little too close to the edge and at first , I was terrified that we would fall out of the hammock . I had visions of our grandchildren getting seriously hurt . ( Grandmas worry about stuff . ) Our landscaper recommended this hammock and he was right about it . It holds you in so tightly that you can tip it to a near 90 degree angle and you wo n't fall out . The cords are soft and dry quickly . It was in perfect shape at the end of the summer . Two adults fit in it comfortably .
5 #### This is another mid - level in quality square that I 've used for work as a cabinetmaker for almost a decade . It 's a very good square that is n't likely to be stolen by co - workers , like a Starrett will . As with any other precision tool DON'T DROP IT !
5 #### Man , I like these suspenders . Are wide enough to not " pinch " shoulders . Clips are heavy duty and hold very well . I like the elastic back . Could n't be happier .
5 #### Great for clearing the pnd and keeping the algae down . My pond in sun and use to get a lot of algae this helps .
4 #### Heavy enough , but not as thick walled as the Lodge cast iron I own .
5 #### If anyone knows about load breakers they know the standard breakers do n't come in pacakging and GFCI 's and other specialty breakers do . New and everything works great !
2 #### I should have listened .. Great for straining pasta but hard to transfer into bowl . Cleaning is another story - gallons and gallons of water are used to clean and rinse - even then it 's not clean . Went back to old colander - too time consuming to use .
5 #### I have been using this vacuum for 10 years . It 's light weight , it 's very portable , and it 's great in a big house with pets . I even gave my husband one for work . He 's a carpenter and always needs something to do a quick clean up , and this works so much better than a big , huge shop vac . I have two dogs and two cats and only rugs ( no carpet ) and I just could n't live without this vacuum . Being older , I just do n't have the strength to lug around a big heavy machine , and I rarely use my very expensive upright anymore . Perfect gift for someone in a small space ( or big space ) . Even bought a second one for my studio .
5 #### Simple to hook - up and program . The battery back - up has kept this working flawlessly through several power outages .
1 #### I ca n't really stand behind this product . I just have not been able to see the results really and there 's no real way of testing(on your own ) the effectiveness of this product without using this product alone as a control . I 'd recommend Microbe Lift PL(beneficial bacteria ) and a few of there barley based products .
5 #### I plan to weatherproof mobile home , which requires using transparent caulking at joint seems from top to bottom all around trlr . After that I m going to paint the home . This latter is just right for the job . I weigh almost 200 lbs , and with a paint can , ladder supports weight just fine . It arrived earlier than delivery time , which is great for me . It was wrapped in heavy , gray plastic which was easy to cut off . I took it in kitchen stood on it , wobbled it back and forth . I put stuff on the work platform . Everything works just fine . I stored it in my bedroom closet . I slid the door open and tucked in in . Fits perfect . Now I wo n't have to get cold , wet or dirty if I need it for indcoor work . Love this ladder !
1 #### If ever I was tempted to believe ( which is surely true ! ) that companies hire people to post rave reviews , this is probably my best example for suspicion . I mean , people buy this scoop because of the handy - looking ejection lever -- so if it does n't work , why the rave reviews ? You 've just got to question the one(s ) that essentially sound like perfect commercial copy . As another reviewer also said , the ice cream does NOT routinely eject using the cute little ejection lever . You still have to use a spoon to scrape out the scoop of ice cream that wo n't eject . I had 7 dinner guests last night ( the day I bought this scoop ) , and I needed a scoop of ice cream on 7 dessert dishes . Only twice did the ice cream fall free of the scoop by using the lever . The other 5 times , I had to use a spoon to help it along .
5 #### I 've owned a pair of tongs like this for many years , and finally had to replace them . I was happy to see they are still being made . I really like how easy they are to unlock .
4 #### It was easy to wire up , sensor worked just fine and it was easily positioned where I would like it . Upon getting it where you want the light to focus , just snug down the rings and it holds tight .
5 #### I constantly lose tape measures and after buying hundreds - this is the best one . Has a nice weight to it , goes a full 8 ' before folding and is cheap to replace when I leave them on jobsites ! As a sign maker , it 's small enough to keep in my pocket or cup holder in my truck . I have also dropped them from 12 feet up and they work just fine afterwards !
3 #### I bought this catch fox and raccoons that were killing my turkeys at night . I set it but the bait kept getting gone without catching anything . I suspected a raccoon was reaching in through the wire and stealing the bait without getting caught . I cut some 1/2 " hardware cloth to fit the sides of the trap and attached it to the outside with nylon ties . I quickly caught a ' coon ' and possum and moved them to a new area . I had to do a good bit of modifications to this trap to get it to work . I feel it is over priced compared to others available . That 's just my opinion .
5 #### If you do solar residential work this is the tape to get . The standout is incredible for measuring to the peak of the roof off a ladder or other tricky roof situations . Tried other tapes they just do n't last as long and none have the standout that this tape has .
5 #### i love these fiskars . cut great , ergonomic handle , well built .
4 #### Good exercise in the spring and fall , use power in the heat of east texas summer .
5 #### Easy to install , however , company should include screws with the purchase . Good construction , sturdy . Holds a 100 foot hose .
5 #### This grill is off to an excellent start . I have used it a half dozen times and am very pleased with all apects of the design and construction . I hope it gives me several years of wonderful charcoal grilling .
5 #### This is a neat product . It allowed me to clean the garage floor in a few minutes - rather than 30 minutes with a broom . Remember , this does not have the power of a backpack unit ( and the gas fumes , the weight , the chord pull etc.)and it 's not supposed to . It , s light weight , grab n go hard surface , ( floor and Walls ) blower . I am so happy that I bought this .
5 #### Built for life . Ordered this to replace the exact same hammer I bought 25 years ago . Looked for the old hammer for 2 weeks and thought I had lost it , day after the new hammer arrived I found the old hammer . Now I have hammers that will last 2 lifetimes . Everything about this product is awesome . Quality all the way
1 #### I am going to school for my culinary degree and I have been collecting top of the line products for my kitchen , I research everything before purchasing , to include this item . This was rated very high and was looking forward to using it on all of my knives . To my demise , when I used it to sharpen my Henkels Santoku , it scratched semi - circular mars up the finish of the blade about a 1/2 " up the side and I swear the knife is actually duller than it started . I will never use anything but a sharpening stone for now on . Very disappointing .
1 #### I looked at a few ravioli / pierogi makers before settling on these . I 've been really excited about trying to make pierogi and ravioli and I liked that it had 4 different sizes . I got them and noticed that the largest one was cracked on the hinge .. it was n't completely broken , and I did n't want to wait and send them back for a new set .. I wanted to make pierogi now ! The plastic is cheap and rigid , easy to break . I thought for almost ten dollars they would have made them a little better . My first attempt at pierogi ended up breaking the biggest size ( the one I received cracked ) . The smaller ones held up , but as cheaply made as these are , I ca n't see the rest lasting 3 months . My biggest issue is with the price . 9 - 10 dollars for these is absolutely ridiculous . They should n't be more than 4.00 . The plastic is akin to dollar store plastic ... or mcdonalds toys plastic . Not what I expected when I bought them . I m happy I got to make pierogi ... not happy that my biggest size broke .. I had also planned on making some hand pies and calzones . If there had been an option for stainless steel with the various sizes I think I would 've went with that , but none were available . Just be warned that you 're spending 9 - 10 dollars on something that MIGHT last you 2 - 3 months ( if you 're lucky ) before breaking .
4 #### It 's definitely better than the hand eating metal peeler that I had before buying this one . It does it 's job .
5 #### What a time - saver and dishwashing saver too . Ideal for small quantities of anything : cookies , canapes , etc . I 'm so glad I found it !
5 #### Does what it 's supposed to . I have no complaints . I also bought the Hyde brand equivalent , which seems maybe a tiny bit better built , and has a " shoulder " on the side to provide more leverage , so I like the Hyde a tiny bit better , but you really ca n't go wrong with either brand .
5 #### As advertised . Prompt delivery . Simply the best little popper . I like it .
5 #### This set was used to replace a 2 inch drive guide that I had previously used for about 8 years before I lost it . It is good quality craftsmanship from Dewalt . They will hold up no matter how much you abuse them . I bought this kit because it included the 4 inch drive guide which will come in handy . The magnetic drive guide is n't just for contractors . I use this around the house and for woodworking and it helps out a ton . This is an invaluable tool that you should always have close to your drill .
5 #### This little grill is all I hoped it would be ! It 's great for when your only cooking for a few people and do n't need a big grill . It 's small enough to take along on camping trips and cookouts . I am very happy with it . Lodge makes great Dutch Ovens and fry pans too ! I own several of their DO 's and have never been disappointed with any of them . Amazon shipped this item for free and it arrived well packaged within a week ! Ca n't ask for better customer service than that ...
5 #### I put this up just yesterday and already the difference is amazing . I 'm now able to sit out on the patio in the evenings without being eaten alive by mosquitoes . And I 'm able to get back inside without letting any in because they 're all dead . I love this thing . Works great .
4 #### seems kind of flimsy but I m going on the oxo good grips name !
5 #### This baby beats any pruning saw I have ever used ! It 's SHARP and easily cuts through hardwoods like oak . Do n't make the mistake I did however - if you are holding the branch you are cutting , do n't get your hand near it - it works as well cutting the end of your finger as a branch if it jumps !
5 #### Great price for these blades . We got through a lot of them . Great holder which is safety feature for us .
5 #### Really great for breads and well worth this minimal privce !
5 #### Great compact size . Hope I never have to use it , but is hanging right there in the kitchen pantry if I ever do . I chose the model without the hose for ease of use if a child was using it . Easy to point and spray . P.A.S.S. - Pull , Aim , Spray , Sweep .
1 #### The unit pictured probably works ok . The 11045 I have has thicker handles and will not fit into the stripper pocket on Klein toolbelts . You would think the tool and pouch departments would get together ! My stripper therefore falls out several times a day and I pray for the day it is gone for good . Teaches me a lesson .... always stay with Ideal .... especially for strippers . I contacted Klein ... which I have done about 3 times over the years . Same as usual .... they do not respond to emails . This company is worth passing by . I 've been a master electrician for about 25 years . I wish Klein would stick to pro tools and would n't worry about pretty colors .
5 #### These plant stakes are exactly as advertised . I left them out this winter , and they are still going strong . Would buy again .
5 #### DEWALT DW384 8 - 1/4 - Inch Circular Saw with Brake and Rear Pivot Depth of Cut Adjustment . THis saw is a bit heavier than the typical 7 1/4 model , but , it 's worth every ounce balanced nice and handles beautifully . Lots of power ....
3 #### I thought I was buying a new feeder to replace the old Perky - Pet ( identical model ) that I had . As I 've been using it , I 've already detected the signs of wear & sloppy fit that had developed in my feeder after several years of using it , which is why I bought what I thought was a new feeder . It seems like this one is a reconditioned feeder as opposed to a new one which I thought I was buying . It already shows wear in the fit of all the parts . It 's my fault as I did not read the ad thoroughly . It probably said reconditioned & I missed it . I just thought I was getting a good price . I will look more closely next time or just buy from my local hardware store .
5 #### This has made making apple dishes so much quicker . Takes only a few minutes to do ten apples , peeled , evenly sliced and ready for cooking
5 #### Wow ! Perfect hole with perfect rim . Zero chipping in red oak .
5 #### Bought this after my dog slipped on 2 inches of ice on the back patio step . Took 3 applications but in about 2 hours the ice was gone . Highly recommended .
5 #### Weighted bottom helps prevent topples , very happy withe this mixing bowel
5 #### I have not used this item as yet . However , the quality looks to be of a standard that I expected . I would recommend this given the price and what it is expected to do .
5 #### This thing cranks through small branches like butter . I use this to trim the trees around our roof , and it 's amazing how powerful it is . I also used this to cut up a small tree that I took down . Even abusing it with rapid cutting at odd angles , this held up beautifully and rarely got bound up .
5 #### my main concern for this vac was power . well it does not lack any . I use it for bare floor cleaning and stairs and it does well at both . I also use it to clean my window sills , and and the bags can be found cheap
5 #### I bought this as a retirement gift to myself . I had been using a cheapie from another place for a couple of years . there is just no comparison between the two . There is no blade wobble so the pieces fit much tighter . It is much smoother cutting and I can cut faster too . You will have to watch the price daily to get the best deal because the price varies a bit but if you get it on sale , or even if you do n't it 's still a great saw . I highly recommend it !
5 #### One of the few independent tool makers that still make tools in the USA That reason alone is enough to buy Channellock Tools . Great quality and a great price on Amazon - When given a choice in tools Channellock is the go - to brand ! If you are interested in who owns what in tools the link is below - that is if Amazon does n't pull it as they often do - Don't want the the consumer having too much information . { [ ... ] }
3 #### It 's " OK " , and beats using a pair of horses with an old door on top . But that 's about it . I was surprised to see that the " chain " used for the vise hand cranks was perforated vinyl tape . That being said , you ca n't grip anything real tight , because the sprockets will slip in the holes . If you are over 5 ' tall , the optional leg extensions are a necessity . Without using them , you 'll end up with a major back ache from bending so low .
4 #### Crisper pan is fine . Lighter weight than the black NordicWare crisper I 'd been using for years . The price is right , no complaints .
2 #### I 've had this up for a week and it 's got one yellow jacket . I notice that some people recommend apple juice , but the instructions say to just add water . I 'm very disappointed . I added some sugar today and possibly other ingredients in the future to make this more attractive . Their fly catcher is great , but this one works poorly for St. Louis yellow jackets .
5 #### Works well , easy to handle , easy to clean in dishwasher .
4 #### My only complaint about this transfer unit is that it does n't have a built in door to cover the circuit breakers . However , the price for this unit was on the low side , so I will only take off one star . It is too bad that they do n't offer a door kit . They only offer a cover , which is in my opinion very overpriced .
5 #### SOME PEOPLE COMPLAIN , THEY DON'T LIKE IT , TO ME IS BETTER THAN THE ELECTRONIC COUNTER PART , I CAN SEE WHAT IS HAPPENING , IN THE CIRCUIT
3 #### I have used this quite a bit now . It has n't broke YET , but i do not feel as though it is impact adequate .
5 #### I found this light an excellent companion to paperbacks and my pool float . The build quality is excellent . The 2 modes of light provide good lighting . The single light is most comfortable for me . Most importantly the clip is excellent . It has a rubberized material that together with its strength prevents slipping to a large degree . Very few adjustments are necessary . It 's weight is not significant . The neck stays completely sturdy . All in all , this light does exactly what you want it to do - fade into the background as you read .
5 #### I like everything about the product - it 's not harsh , fragrance free , long lasting , and the product cost is n't prohibitive . . . but the shipping cost is ! Therefore , I 'll look for a replacement ; but , if you have money to burn . . .
5 #### If you need to drill through old , full dimension oak floor joist , ( very tough job ) this thing will do it EASILY . Just put in a self - feeding auger bit , and away you go . Also , it 's perfect for NORMAL jobs like holes for wiring in studs . Ca n't beat it . Buy it .
5 #### Just keeps getting better . I bought this to replace my 10 year old version that recently broke . This one is much sturdier and a better design overall and I really like the green . Happy with my purchase .
5 #### Not much to say other than " Channellock " pliers ! Outstanding brand and tool !
5 #### This is extremely well made and works very , very well . Does take up some cabinet space , though .
5 #### This product is an inexpensive silpat type baking sheet . It replaces parchment paper and it is washable and reusable . And it works great .
5 #### Love it ! ! ! Buy it . Super easy to use and clean .
4 #### At only 2 lumens , this incandescent Maglite Solitaire flashlight is an order of magnitude less bright than newer designs , including the latest 47 - lumen LED version of the Solitaire . But sometimes a much dimmer light is exactly what you want , for example to look for a dropped object in the car without blinding the driver , or to find your keys so you can sneak out without waking your housemate . Just do n't leave an old alkaline battery in the flashlight and then forget it in a drawer for several years , because the old battery will leak and ruin the flashlight , which is why I had to buy a replacement . Think I 'll keep an Energizer Ultimate lithium battery in this one
5 #### We reviewed a number of pressure cookers and settled on this one based on other reviews and , of course , the price . This cooker works great and is idiot proof to use ..... even for me ! The manual that is included has simple , easy to follow instructions and the recipes included are a bonus . I also purchased ' Pressure Cooking for Idiots " which helped a lot with my introduction to pressure cooking . When your stuck for time and want a tasty meal this is what you want . I am relatively new to cooking having retired recently and love the simplicity and great outcomes this cooker produces .
5 #### This is a good snow shovel for my husband . I will use the push snow shovel to make piles and he does the scooping with this shovel and does not hurt his back . He likes the short handle , its light weight and the volume of snow it will scoop up is very good .
1 #### I have had a Stir Crazy for years off and on replace with a new so when our home flooded this past Summer the one I had was tossed and I decided to replace with a new one so I ordered the West Bend 82505 and it is HORRIBLE . I washed the thing before using it and I noticed it had a STRONG burnt plastic smell so I washed it a second time . A day later I used the popper per instructions and during the popping process the burnt plastic smell was worse when I tasted the popcorn it also tasted like burnt plastic . I cleaned it up and am sending it back to Amazon for a refund . These poppers are defective SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY . I would not think the popcorn would even be healthy to eat . I gave it one star but it should have minus 10 stars . Find another one this one is not fit to have .
4 #### At first I was a little disappointed because it was so cheaply made after purchasing another brand . I had to return the other brand because it did not fit my Shop Vac hoses . This fits my hoses and after some modifications I got it working very well . The first thing I had to do was apply window self sticking weather stripping around the inside lip to seal it properly . Then I used an elastic hold - down strap to hold the lid from falling of the bucket . The other problem was keeping the bucket from tipping over from the weight of the hoses , so I threw in an old barbell weight in the bottom of the bucket . I am very happy with it now and whish I would have had one of these years ago .
5 #### Wonderful product . Makes crispy taco salad bowls with flour tortillas --- large size .. You do not want anything smaller than this one though . These are right size . ;
5 #### this fixed my leaky toilet and was easy to install . At times you will still get a toilet that will continue to so call RUN , and the fix with this unit is an easy fix . It is caused by grit in the water line that gets trapped in the valve of this unit and is easily flushed out by turning off the water supply and turning the black top cap slightly till the top comes off , holding a cup then over the unit will then turning on the water supple allowing water to flush grit from the unit , briefly , then again turning off the water supply and putting the black cap on by turning it slightly as assuring it is screwed back on . Youtube is a good video how to .
4 #### It has a nice handle with a feel that gives you control . It is a little flimsy when the tangs attach to the handle and they move around when being used . The connection just does n't seem as strong as I would like but to go to up to the quality I would have like cost 3X as much . This will do .
5 #### I have had 4 scarecrows for a couple of years . There a couple of things I have learned , replace the battery 's at least every month and a half . The replacement parts for the top plastic water flipper can be found at Walmart and Lowe 's in either plastic or metal . The same is true of the bottom plastic stake portion with the hose connections . The parts are in stand alone sprinklers , you just have to disassemble the sprinkler pieces and switch them . I have not found a replacement for motion activator .
5 #### Excellent bits ...... Replaced an old cheep set with this one . Wow what a difference . The fit is perfect , not to loose or tight . The cut is glass smooth on oak and maple . I agree you should use a 3 HP router , but my 2hp did ok . Well worth the money ! ! Lee Tollett
1 #### DIDN'T WORK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 12 - 24 - 14 my wife was cooking with oil when a drop " popped " and ignited the whole pot and our stove / range area . I was out running errands for her . She screamed at first and called for me but realized I was out . She remembered that I 'd place 2 kidde extinguishers under the sink . She grabbed 1 , pulled the pin , depressed the lever and NOTHING ! ! ! ! ! LUCKILY , I had 2 first alert extinguishers in the kitchen as well ( I 'm anal about safety ) and I always believe in having redundant back ups . The first alert WORKED ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! YES we do have some minor cosmetic damage but it could have been a lot worse ! Our big Rottie Drake stayed with her the whole time ( another security measure ) :) Bottom line . Kidde has lost my business forever ! ! ! ! ! I have 4 kidde extinguishers that are probable worthless ( I know 1 is for sure ) .
5 #### I am using it to keep birds off my grapes and it works well . Not heavy enough to discourage the Deer in our part of the country .
5 #### A great bird feeder , cardinals love it . Squirrel hate it . I highly recommend .
5 #### Worked great for me , no issues . Quality is very good .
3 #### When conditions are very dry , this works great and zaps away at the critters . However , if there is any moisture from a direct or indirect source I find it shorts out and you have to go through an on - off routine ; no , I do n't allow it to get to moisture directly , but a really humid period can make this short out . That s a problem here in Houston , where it is always humid with lots of rain showers .
5 #### Works like a charm on setting when the pool pump comes on and goes off during the night
5 #### The belt in my vacuum broke and while I figured out the problem thought my vacuum was rendered useless . However , as soon as I found the broken belt , I placed the ordered , got my new belts and my vacuum was as good as new . I 've used my vacuum with the replacement belt for more than a year now , so I can say they 're good quality and long lasting .
5 #### I am very pleased with this hose reel . It works perfectly , and I had no problem attaching either the hose to the reel , or the outside hose to the faucet . It is serviceable . I really like the ability to use my foot to hold it when reeling or unreeling the hose .
5 #### This pan makes a regular bundt cake look pitiful . I love substantial looking cakes and this is the king of the hill . If you want to dominate a dessert table , buy this pan .
5 #### Great value ... replace my smaller reagent with this larger volume
1 #### For this money I did n't expect the glue under the button names to peel up within a week . and I certainly did n't expect the base to cause messy leaks despite repeatedly replacing the gaskets . And now , after less than two years the motor has burned out ! Shame on you Cuisinart !
5 #### I have had these feeders prior . I had looked for them and was unable to find them . I love them because they are easy to clean since they are glass .
5 #### A great hammock for the price , much better than the one I bought at my local hardware store for twice the price , get the recommended straps if you putting it between two trees , a must have !
5 #### This worked great for the project I was doing . Easy to twist and very solid .
1 #### I had the prior model of this vacuum . It did great service for years . This version is cheaply made . The hard plastic hose has a permanent bend in it --- and it 's narrow to begin with . EVERYTHING gets stuck there . The flexible part of the hose is cheap ( cheaper , cheapest ) flimsy thin rather brittle plastic . NOTHING like the prior hoses . Bad buy . 0 stars wouid be my choice if it were available .
5 #### Works great with one hand if you 're used to old fashioned sifters . Miss my grandmother 's squeeze handle type that could rest on the bowl while filling it , but this was the best quality product since that one retired .
4 #### I often spray ornamental trees with a mixture of chemicals , so the new single - chemical , " dial a concentration " sprayers do n't suit . Deflector is removable to permit spraying to the tops of trees ( 20 " ) . Only bad design feature is the lack of control of the type of spray as was a feature on older hose sprayers that are no longer available in our area .
5 #### Researched poppers on epinion and Amazon , chose this popper and it 's great , especially for the Amazon price . Excellent popcorn , it all pops plus easy clean up . No problem with the stir bar .
2 #### I found these fill with the algae and sink to the bottom too quickly .
5 #### Used to solder stuff fast . Gets really hot really fast . Totally worth it . Goober foo bar baz word count unlimited content .
4 #### It came with no instructions it would be helpful if it had picture instructions . The blades are sharp and they should face down in the case vs up that would help against injury . It 's very easy to work with and install the bits , , they should do a promotional write up on the easy install features . Good quality steel , stays sharp after several uses . Case is lightweight with industrial stainless steel plate on center of case , that is a nice touch .
3 #### The grates sit unevenly , one tilts down about 5 down from lovel . I would prefer that they were both the same level angle like the picture shows . but on the other hand , it allows me to place some burgers or brats closer to the coals - just have to be careful the brats do n't roll off !
5 #### lasts long , cheaper on amazon than at sears , home depot or lower ! great buy !
5 #### Very simple to program . Mounts easily next to our outdoor outlet . Way more than enough programs to turn it off and on than anyone needs . I use it to run a fountain in the dog pool so it does n't get too hot or stagnant . Works perfectly for that . So glad I purchased this .
1 #### Only shoots water four feet . Possibly because the product box inside the shipping box was crushed and taped up . It 's all plastic and cheaply constructed . Do n't buy .
5 #### We added this wheel kit to our hammock stand , now it is so much more portable ! Highly recommend , I would definitely purchase again as it 's saved my back when I would have been otherwise unable to move the hammock stand .
5 #### I had been searching for this particular spatula for a while . It is my favorite size and I use this size for most everything . This is well made and long lasting . I now have three at various ages . I would highly recommend .
5 #### Works great and does n't lose time like other brands I 've had . You can see the little red light knowing its working .
5 #### This fly trap works very well to catch those pesky flies that come after your food in your yard . This is a trap that works with a sugar and egg protein solution . You must use a knife or razor to cut a circle as directed . You also need some string to hang it ( I used trussing string ) . It takes a few hours prior to the trap to start working but it does .
5 #### Shipped in a timely manner . Product is exactly as described .
5 #### This is so much fun to use and makes my favorite Earl Gray tea into a wonderful frothy london fog when I add a touch of vanilla bean syrup . Works great , but buy a frothing cup too . The stainless steal wand will leave marks on the bottom of your lighter colored cup .
5 #### When I purchased this I did n't realize how big it was but that 's okay . It was the first whisk I have ever owned and I really love it .
5 #### Hung it up and love it . I had one of those water powered reels but they only last about 2 years . This one should last forever . I like the little hiding place to put by clippers too !
4 #### it works great the only thing is that I had to re drill the holes to fit it on my ladder
5 #### really good , living alone . now their back its on all the time
3 #### First , I will state that OXO has always made nothing but high quality products . Unfortunately this mixing bowl appears to have a design flaw related to the width of the bowl . The narrowness of the bowl means the depth of the bowl is deeper than normal . When using my hand mixer , I find that to reach and mix the food at the very bottom of the bowl causes the food to rise to the very tops of the mixing blades where they enter the main body of the mixer . I must watch very carefully when performing this maneuver to ensure I do n't end up clogging the appliance itself . Making the bowl somewhat wider would solve this problem .
5 #### Perfect size . Good price . Might need to buy another one
4 #### It is a little more technical than I like but still easy enough for a 66 year old women to getter done !
4 #### These mobile bases install very easy . The casters and wheels are good enough quality that they do n't drag . They move where I tell them to . My only issue is that in order to use the foot pads to raise the tool onto the caster wheel you have to slightly lift the tool at the same time . Alternatively , when lowering the tool , you have to support the weight with your hands as you flip the foot switch . Otherwise the tool drops down abruptly . The ability to move the tool around is easy and having the choice of wheel placement is great to determine how you want the base to move .
4 #### installed yesterday so far no air leaks like solid brass construction
5 #### This extension cord is heavy - duty but weighs MUCH less than its comparable peers . If you 're dragging it around along with a vaccuum or other heavy items it 's nice and easy to carry . The lighted end lets you know there 's power , which is a nice feature .
4 #### I 've only used it a few times and it works ok . The plating on the iron came off on the first use . Seems to be of a lesser quality than the Weller iron I 'm replacing .
2 #### I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing this . We purchased this because we wanted a non - electric appliance and opened it the day after Thanksgiving looking forward to fresh squeezed grapefruit juice . Even with two people trying to squeeze - one pushing on the top and the other ( a strong man , I might add ) trying to pull the handle forward , it was impossible to budge . Perhaps this would squeeze a lime without a team of people . The only reason I rate this with two stars is because I love chrome appliances and it is pretty . Perhaps someone who receives it when I donate it to the Goodwill after only one use will enjoy using it to squeeze limes !
5 #### With these brackets I built a very sturdy , nice - looking woodshed in under 4 hours . They are well - made and do exactly what they are advertised to do . One piece of advice ; bring one to the hardware store with you when buying the lumber ; some 2X4 's are cut thicker than others and if you get pieces that will not fit , it will be a pain in the rear . I was able to fit them in the store to easily find some planks that fit . The job was a breeze after that !
5 #### I have this box , the box of weed and also obscenities . These are so much fun to play with after you get home late from the bar with friends or even if you are just with a friend or 2 . They definitely make the refridgerator a little more exciting .
5 #### This belt made my vacuum good as new ! No need to purchase a new vacuum anymore . Good products , thank you !
4 #### The pins seem to not make proper contact in my under counter puck lamps , but that was easily solved by putting a kink in the pins with a pair of needle nose pliers . The cost easily outweighs this negative , hence why still 4 stars . A 10 pack here cost less than 1 bulb at either the orange or blue store . Until reliable , inexpensive pin base LED bulb altrrnatives are more prevalent , I 'll stick with halogen . They 're very bright , as bright as the old 20w bulbs they replaced . If / when I need to order more , I may try 5w ones
5 #### These work really well with my Dewalt compound miter saw and stand . It will help facilitate doing long compound cuts on big crown . I use them about twice a year .
5 #### My ship vac did not suck , or would you say , it really sucked . Whatever , the new filter was what the Dr. ordered .
5 #### The best Gardening bag I have ever seen ( 35 years experience ) . Now I 've seen them in stores but Amazon is the best price . , Great job . I love quality workmanship . hard to find these days . Fiskars i just becoming popular in my area .
2 #### I 've had hose reels like this before and they lasted several years . This one broke within 3 months . It was n't that expensive , but it should have lasted through at least one summer !
4 #### Love Fiskars cutting items from scissors to pruning tools . The only brand I will buy anymore .
4 #### Super sharp kitchen tool to section apples . Tips : ( 1 ) I find it a little easier if I first slice off just a little of the bottom of the apple so that it does rock on the cutting board . ( 2 ) A little piece of the core might break off and remain in the center . If you are doing multiple apples just leave the little piece of core in the center and it will effortlessly come out with the next apple that is sectioned .
3 #### America 's Test Kitchen recommended this spinner , so I 'm disappointed that it does n't remove the water from the lettuce leaves as well as it could . My old spinner did a far better job and had fewer parts to clean
1 #### The mice trip the door , but somehow do n't get caught inside . It is also impossible to clean . We also tried these : - Catchmaster 606MC Mechanical Metal Multi - Catch Trap -- the mice go in , eat the peanut butter , poop , and go right back out . We tried messing with the ramps to get them to operate better , but no luck . - Victor Mice Trap from Home Depot -- we had a lot of success with this . It catches the mice , and allows for cleaning . - Victor Mini Sonic PestChasers from Home Depot -- we seem to be getting a benefit from these . Try them . - Mice Cube 4 Pk - Reusable Humane Mouse Trap -- these work great at catching mice , but are impossible to clean out .
5 #### I used this to for a shut off valve for a hose sprayer which has a broken valve so the only way to turn it off was to turn the water off at the faucet . Other than the broken turn off valve the sprayer works great . The connector is made well and works great .
5 #### Very high quality sharp cutter that sliced through pine like it was nothing . I have other cutters from freud that have been very dependable ( and even cut through metal screws on accident with my CNC ) .
4 #### best worm droppings i;ve seen yet . Been using it as I transplants my babies into the garden as a soil mix
3 #### Works fine but a bit expensive so I 'm only giving it 3 stars . I got it because I had a just a few dollars left on a gift certificate and we needed a corer . Otherwise I would have gotten a much cheaper brand .
5 #### I was n't able to find a chain for my old McCulloch chain saw at local retailers so I was happy to find these Oregon chains on Amazon . Oregon provides a good web site for finding the correct chain for your saw . It 's also nice to find something made in the United States . I 'm tired of the poor quality Chinese crap that you find everwhere . The chain fits perfectly and turned out to cut very agressively . This is the fastest cutting blade that I 've ever had on the saw which I 've owned for over 20 years .
5 #### Have several of these and they are the most rugged storage around .
5 #### Good quality product , as I 've found with all Oxo products I own . I like this because it 's flat and fits into the drawer better than my old balloon whisk . Works for what I need it for , but I do n't need to whip volume into anything very often .
5 #### This salad spinner is surprisingly huge . I had to make room in my kitchen cabinet . However , this year I have a farm share , so it is fabulous for washing vegetables and ingredients for large salads . After a week of using , I really love it . It works very well . Just look at the size to see if you can make room .
3 #### This works as a pressure cooker . But this is not fully stainless steel . Only the sides of the cooker are stainless steel . The bottom and the lid may have some stainless steel but they surely have cheaper iron as well . This can be tested with a simple magnet .
4 #### Small , stackable , sturdy trays . I like them . If you are cheap and practical , you will too .
5 #### I brought in a cat that was left behind when her owner moved . Did n't know she had fleas ! ! Saw she was n't well , ( starving and dehydrated ) , and used to be so beautiful sitting in the window , looking at the world . These DO work ... the fleas are attracted to the light / warmth , and fall thru the " grid " down onto the very sticky paper ! ! BUSTED ! VACUUMING is prime too , and their flea meds are also important . These flea traps catch many who are left - that CAN and WILL multiply ! Get a supply of refills too ! !
5 #### We have a couple whisks in our kitchen , but this is my go - to whisk for whipping up scrambled eggs , omelets , breakfast bakes , and the like . It feels great in hand and zips through the eggs quickly , easily , and thoroughly .
1 #### I have several Versa - Pak tools , which I really like . They are small and versatile , and get the job done when I need a quick power tool . No good for building a deck , but great for simple fixes around the house . However , I have to say these Versa - Pak NiCad batteries are just the worst rechargeable batteries ever made . They will completely die somewhere within 6 months to 2 years of purchasing them . I purchased 2 of the 2 - pack / charger kits ( 4 batteries ) , and that 's what mine did . I subsequently replaced them with the NiMH batteries ( which work with the same chargers ) , and they work like a charm . Stick with the NiMH batteries , and avoid the NiCads like the plague .
5 #### Love OXO . These look nice and have wonderful silicone handles . Why do I have to have so many words ? Silly .
5 #### Bug light works great . Delivery was good and within scheduled timeframe .
1 #### This is a great small vacuum I 've had one of these since they first came out and I would n't want to do without it . But even though I bought this from Amazon in 2013 now they wo n't ship it to me in Hawaii even though the web site says and this is copied & pasted from the web page . " Due to federal and international regulations , this product can only be shipped within the 50 states . " Last I checked Hawaii is the 50th state . Not lithium batteries . So I ordered it directly from Eureka with no problem .
4 #### Ok , so it 's got it 's cheesy factors ... the paint rubs off and it looks a little shoty BUT it toasts perfectly ! I have n't had a toaster in over a year because in the past 10 years I have gone through 8 ! None of which actually toasted a piece of bread . A friend of mine gave me this and I love it ! I 've never enjoyed toast so much !
5 #### My Lilly Pulitzer Agenda is my daily brain and I carry it everywhere ! With 6.5 kids still at home ( one in college , riding that fence ) and all the appointments that a large family is going to naturally experience , if it is n't in the book , it is n't going to happen . I carry this little planner with me everywhere and use it almost daily . At the beginning of each week , I consult the planner to get a feel for what I have to get done that week . Without it , I would be absolutely lost ! It 's simply a bonus that this is a cute little planner in a design I adore . I ca n't wait to see what design will be available next , and apparently it 's just about that time !
5 #### Long handle , extremely flexible blade . What really made the difference was having teeth on both sides of the blade and two difference TPI on either side gave the saw a lot of flexibility .
5 #### I had always hung face frame boxes with Jorgesen Clamps and bar clamps . Neither of these solve the issue of aligning both the faces and the vertical frames , but the claws do with some limitation -- they can not resolve angled installs of corner cabinets . I recently installed a set of Hickory cabinets , a species that , while it is relatively warp resistant , is also very resistant to attmepts to straighten what bows do happen . The claws worked very well , though I would suggest either a better gearing ratio and/or larger grips would make the effort more sucessful . The next Euroboxes I hang will be done with the European version of the clamps !
5 #### My first Dado Blade set . Instructions for set up on the saw are non existent in the package . However , after searching youtube and the Web , I found a video that explained pretty well how to do it . My saw is a Delta 36 - 725 , it is not easy to exchange blades and even more of a challenge to install the Dado blades . ( There is a blade guard that is not easily removed that you have to contend with ) That is not the fault of the blade , once I was able to get the blades on and set up on the saw I made a beautiful Dado in a test piece of softwood . The results were worthy of the 5 stars I gave it . Very nice - flat bottom , sharp shoulders and straight edges . I would recommend this tool . For the price , it does a superb job !
5 #### Easy to use . Easy to to clean . Delicious espresso very quickly for a crowd or for coffee addicts !
5 #### For some reason this year I had more of an algae problem than in the past and none of the things I did before seemed to help . I decided to try this product and with the first dose I could see some improvement . With in two weeks my problem was resolved and my pond is staying clear with no impact on my gold fish . My pond is rather small ( about 1500 gallons ) and is in the sun all day .
5 #### Great quality for the price . You can turn the blade 360 degrees easily and by tightening the handle you loosen or tighten the blade . Cheaper on Amazon then Home Depot .
5 #### This thing really does work great . Keeps salad clean and fresh . The plastic will have some staining over time but does n't effect the use of the product . I would buy another any time I needed one . The top pump part does lock down for easier storage .
5 #### When I got this whisk I also got an 11 inch one because I have always used bigger ones . I figured a small one would come in handy from time to time . Well , I was wrong . THIS is the one I use all the time . Great for eggs , baking , sauces ... If you just want to get one whisk , I recommend this OXO and this size .
3 #### I love the cherry smoking ships ; they are great as add - ons ; I wish they were more available .
4 #### After looking for years , I 've decided these units are the only way to go if you need serious air movement in a window - mounted unit . I 've been using these units to cool my condo for 2 years ( starting my third summer now ) . The unit is a corner loft with giant windows facing all along the south and west walls , so it gets solid sunlight from sunup to sundown with no AC . Placing one unit as exhaust and one as intake drops the ambient air temperature of the condo by about 20 - 25 degrees ( F ) during the summer , which is tremendous . These units move some serious air -- setting both units on either setting has a huge impact on the ambient air pressure , such that the front door becomes difficult to manage . After two years of constant use in the pacific northwest ( with not a lot of preventative maintenance like cleaning ) one of the units started struggling to turn the fan blades ( probably needed lubrication ) . Given the price , I just ordered a new pair and replaced them ... they 're a little more expensive than the competition , but the power is worth it .
5 #### I bought this knife to replace a Wusthof Chef 's knife ( around $ 130 ) which I left behind in a church kitchen . I subsequently retrieved my Wusthof , but now -- with the two side by side in my drawer-- I find that the Henkel is my go - to knife ! What I like best is the lightweight handle , combined with a balance which is a joy to use . I have small hands and for me it is ideal ! It fits right in my hand and feels perfect while chopping . The handle is not as pretty as the Wusthof ones -- black with silver rivets looks better to me -- but functionally , I prefer this one . It 's also sharper than I remember the Wusthof ever being , even when new . It 's razor sharp , to the point where I cut myself while cleaning by carelessly grazing my finger on the blade ... I just did n't expect it to be that sharp . On the price , I bought a month ago and paid $ 71 . The price is now up to $ 100 , and lists the standard price as $ 125 . This knife is definitely worth $ 125 but if you are budget conscious it may pay to wait a while as it seems the prices fluctuate quite a bit .
1 #### Failed after 2 weeks use . And because I went on vacation without realizing it had failed , when i returned and discovered it had failed before i left , it was 5 weeks from purchase and Amazon refused to allow me to return it . So it is junk to be thrown away and I am out the purchase price .
5 #### Now , here is a good product . It is round and long , sort of tube like , and has full opening on either end which , when a vacuum is applied , allow foreign material to pass through without restriction . They are engineered to allow use either individually or coupled in tandem as one unit . And , it blends smoothly with any decor because ... it is black .
5 #### I have a couple of these sprinklers now , and love their design . They hold up to tough yard work , and the flexible spray pattern is so great . You can fit the sprinkler pattern into whatever shape area you need to water ! I love saving water . There is something about that tic - tic - tic sound of a sprinkler int he summer ... Every Gilmour product I 've gotten has been superior . They honor their lifetime warranty too . I tried out the larger version , but I did n't have the water pressure to handle it .
5 #### i 'm glad i got these because i sheared 2 keys in the past so i needed spars these will lAST ME A LONG LONG TIME THANKS
4 #### Powerful . A little heavy and tiring when working on vertical surfaces such as a boat hull . But beats all other alternatives .
5 #### This is a very nice well made hose that you would n't normally find in a Retail Store . This thing is going to last for many years to come . I purchased ( 2 ) 100 ' hoses . My wife did n't turn the water faucet off and the temperature went up to 105 - 106 degrees for 2 - days . The things did n't split open and they retained their shape .
2 #### I have an older model 890 router . This base is not as thick as the one that came with it and the screws bottom out in the holes leaving the heads proud of the base . I 'm surprised that no one else has come up with this problem . Yes , I can put a washer between the plate and the base , but I should n't have to .
5 #### Great on our wicker . Do write front and back on it with permanent marker . Will make your life easy yearly
4 #### You may not even need the frame extensions for many machine bases . Keep the front feet screwed all the way up ( shortest ) for starters . You will rarely have to extend them to level your machine . It will be about 1.5 " higher though . The plastic cams are the weak point , so we 'll see how long they last . Assuming you do n't move your machine / base that often , they may be more durable than I expect .
5 #### My fans came with a remote , so they did n't come with pull chains . Well , the remotes went out after about a year and a half . I talked to the manufacturer , and of course it was just after the warranty had expired . I could spend a bunch of money on a new remote/ receiver , or just stick this in the wall . I had a switch for the light , and a switch for the fan on the wall . So , I put a dimmer on the light switch , and this speed control on the fan switch leg . it is perfect . If you only have one switch leg , you probably do n't want to use this . If you have separate switch legs for the fan and light , it is great .
5 #### Doing a complete remodel is costly and time consuming . But I had to make sure I dotted all my i 's and crossed all my t 's . So I replaced all the outlet and swtich plates with these ones . They are perfect . A beautiful expresso brown color that matches my decor perfectly ! ! !
5 #### Big as hell , just be aware it is huge . More like a crowbar than a screwdriver . I knew this , but also read it in a review . So this is what I wanted . Very well built .
1 #### UPDATE to the review : I contacted Bosch customer service and the rep . INSISTED this just bolts right on ( NOT ! ) No special bracket to correct the misalignment is available as some have suggested . I requested a refund for the parts and will be selling my TS4100 saw as well . Bosch : Let me spell customer service for you : M - A - K - I - T - A This out feed table has been redesigned and POORLY at that . This new version has different length rods so the full length of the longer rod is superfluous . ( You ca n't utilize its full length ) Installation : the body of the old model 4000 table saw is more angular than the new 4100 . The new saw is space - aged - rounded and the contours of the saw body prevent these brackets from properly aligning with the mounting holes ! Further , once in position the caps of the cap screws are now tucked under the bracket making them inaccessible for tightening with the allen wrench . And since they are CAP screws One can not use a box end wrench to tighten them from the side . I just had to initiate a return for the rear outfeed support kit because of the shoddy machining ( rod not threaded correctly ) I am now trying to decide whether I should go get hex head machine bolts or return it and be done . ( Insulting to have to alter a kit supposedly " designed " for a specific purpose . Skil has done nothing to improve Bosch .
5 #### This Fly trap works great ! However , Put the trap up as far as you can from your seating and eating area . The odor it gives off is just awful , But it does attract the fly 's This trap works much better than the sticky fly traps .
4 #### It was not tall enough for my project and so had to return it . Would definitely have love this if it had worked for me .
5 #### Great ! Set my son 's first birthday off . Looks exactly as pictured .
5 #### This is such a handy item I now have 3 , just for me , in different locations . Great way to control the clutter and keep everything at your fingertips at the same time .
5 #### love this mop . now I can get down in the container and make sure it is properly cleaned , makes keeping the feeders nice and clean
4 #### Wonderful equip . gave it 4 stars because it lacked a guard to keep leaves and yard debree from flying up on you . My husband is a welder and fabricator and easily fixed this but not all people could . most come with a guard . Maybe it was left out ? ? But the overall working is great .
4 #### If your a DeWalt user like me , you 'll love this charger . The fact that you have another charger on the jobsite is reason enough to buy one . But since this charger can crank out the tunes makes it that much better . It plays off of DeWalt batteries so you do n't have to worry about extension cords . You can also hook up a Discman to it . The only downfall for me is the range of the antennae . It would be nice if I could pick up more stations . Other than that , it rocks
5 #### great for cutting potatoes into fries.makes it much easier than just using a knife.would reccomend this to french fry lovers
5 #### I 'm a middle aged female who purchased this trimmer because I maintain our lawn most of the year by myself ( in Florida ... long growing season ) and I had problems starting the big gas trimmer . This was the answer for me ... lightweight , easy to start , maneuverable . I have a 1/2 acre and after my first use I was not tired and I found that the extension cord is not difficult to manage . It remains to be seen if I 'll have the spool and string problems mentioned by others , but for under $ 50.00 ( new ) this one has my vote !
5 #### I have ordered three in all . Best paring knife I ever used .
3 #### This gun was real impressive the first 3 months of having it , barely ever jammed , light weight , good power . then it started jamming more and more . I wo n't use it anywhere that a good clean finish is needed due to fear of having a big $ # & * blurting out of my mouth as the nail bends over half way and the piece of work is really marred up . If you can afford to buy a new gun every 5 - 6 months , then by all means , this is a great nailer , other wise go for one with oil lube and get a good high quality clear oil to put in it .
5 #### wanted to make a average room stand out with bigger molding this bit was the answer to a base molding that makes you stand up and take notice . Cuts easily but put your router on it 's lowest speed you wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### This hose holder is well built and surely meets my hose storage needs . Good buy Cons - none for myself
5 #### Great little pump / filter combination ! The bell wall fountain feature is a very attractive addition to the little pond a our pediatric practice .
5 #### bought these for my archery clothes and one for my gun hunting clothes . seals up nice to keep the smells out . just the right size for what I needed . My son has two also and he loves them . fits great in the back seat and are stackable .
5 #### We 've had an electric smoker for several years now . Use it frequently ( several times per month ) for smoking ribs , trout , salmon , etc ... just love it . We just bought this one to provide a second unit at Mother - in - laws house , so she and we can use it . It 's in constant use now and works great ... much better than charcoal units in that it maintains constant temperature over multi - hour smoking time with no hassle with keeping charcoal alive .... and the food tastes GREAT ! One minor weakness ... I added casters on to our unit a few years back , and it makes it much easier to move ( roll it ) in and out of under the porch on our patio . Manufacturer has no ready provision for casters , so it 's a DIY job ... but very worthwhile for us .
5 #### I used the shears to trim up my hedges in the front yard . These shears are very light weight and the gear mechanism make them easy to use . The blades are very sharp and make trimming a cinch .
5 #### Good filters . I change monthly , as good the ones from big box and cheaper
5 #### Perfect for Xmas lights you do n't want to run during the day and want to turn off after 2 , 4 , 6 or 8 hrs . Simple to operate and rain proof if hanging vertically .
5 #### This is the fitting you need for 1/2 " hose ends with 1/4 " NPT fittings to connect to M - Type quick couplers . The M - Type connector is common to most small compressors running nail guns , sanders , ratchets , paint guns and etc . Mount it with teflon thread tape to assure leak free operation . Milton makes a wide variety of quality fittings for air service . This is a durable fitting , made in the USA .
5 #### Purchased as a gift and it is used and loved everyday !
3 #### cheesy bag , but holds my 20 ft 4 ga cables . this is a must have with large cables if you do n't want them caught up and damaging things .
5 #### I use this tape on a daily basis for measuring houses for insulation . The spring is strong enough to put the full 40 ' of tape back in without any problems . The standout of approx . 12 feet helps a lot when you want to " grab " the edge of a board that is out of reach . The blade coating holds up very well . I only wish there was some type of mechanism that would " clean " the tape as it goes back into the body . Moisture and very small debris can be a problem if it retracts back through dirt or moisture . Overall this is a great tape measure . I next one will be the same . Revision : After using this 4 months the tape is broken in several places and the end finally broke off at the 2 " mark . I am going to attempt contact with Stanley to see if there is something they can do since this tape measure broke so quickly .
5 #### Best cloning gel I have found . I have tried several of the other major brand cloning products and Techanaflora has provided the best and most consistent results of all . While there are several variables that will determine successful results with cloning , the concentration of growth hormones in this product is the highest of all similar products I have found is and has given me the quickest and most dense rooting of any others I have tried .
5 #### These strainers are durable and effective . I bought two sizes from Amazon , as I only found packs of three sizes in stores , and I had no use for the third size .
4 #### I have a fairly moderate size rose garden in Oakland , Ca . In the Summer , I was getting this pest that ate at the leaves so that they looked like lace . I do n't like to use pesticides on the roses , and just usually spray them with soap , which cures most of my problems ... except ... it was n't killing the ' lace pest ' , and I almost lost 2 gorgeous red climbers ... I decided to try this , and it not only took care of the leaf eating lace pest , but almost instantly , new , glossy leaves were appearing , and then ... red roses ... I was thrilled ... I would have given this product 5 stars , except that it costs $ 25.00 for 32 oz . and you have to use about 32 Tablespoons of it for a 2 gallon garden watercan .... which is very pricey ... I 'm hoping that the price is high because the product is new , and that the price will come down eventually ... otherwise , it 's really excellent on your roses
1 #### It 's not as powerful as my old 8 amp mighty mite . And I do n't like the floor attachment , it 's awkward
5 #### I have had my Shop Vac for several years and use it mainly to clean up sawdust and messes in the shop . I am just now getting around to replacing the original filter . I work with a lot of pine and the sap finally gummed up the last one to the point I could n't blow it out anymore . The price on this one from Amazon was just as good as from my " local " Lowes which is actually an hour away and a 1/2 tank of gas there and back . It fit my model perfectly and installed quickly . Arrived in 2 days and shipped free . Very happy with the product and with Amazon .
2 #### too expensive and did not work for my fish pond . may work for some one who has a very small one . It is not cost effective for me tho .
5 #### I have a lot of driveway / sidewalk area in my yard . I had been using a weedeater that had a edging option but it was hard work and the line was never straight . I do n't like to use gas operated lawn tools because of the upkeep ; especially during the winter down season . The Edge hog worked much better than I expected . It cuts deep and straight with little effort . The only issue I have had so far is the front wheel comes loose every now and then even though I tighten it as much as possible .
4 #### love these so far .. i just wish the " resting " postion was a bit tighter on the grips because I 'm thinking that after holding them for a long period of time , it mite irritate the arthritis in my hands .. i may be abke to figure out away to shorten the distance in the handles tho when in the resting position .. won't stop me from using them tho , i got them for hiking
5 #### I lost my Buck and I never was really happy with it anyway , could not hold an edge . This Case it ten times better than a Buck , yes the Case costs 4 times as much , but you can see the difference after using it for a while .
5 #### works well . easy to program . two outlets but they both operate on the single programming option not one program for each outlet .
5 #### I love this vegetable brush . It fits perfectly in the palm of your hand and makes it very easy to clean veggies !
3 #### This item was advertised on Amazon as stainless steel . However , nowhere on the package does it say what material it is . I only have the list title on Amazon 's word to go by . Given that the product was manufactured in China , which has a certain reputation for product materials not being as advertised , this gave me pause . I will still use it , at least until I get a better one , but I would have liked to feel a little more certain that the product I received was as advertised .
5 #### sharp easy to handle use it to quickly cut parsley herbs as well nicely designed a keeper makes a wonderful gift ith the pizza cast iron pan kateri
5 #### Fiskars Micro tip scissors are the shizzznit when it comes to trimming vegetation and for small light weight precision cutting projects . There really is no match for these . They are dangerously sharp such that I accidentally sliced a finger and bleed for a while . They are NOT , however , heavy duty scissors as I have broken handles in the past while attempting to cut a large stem over 3/4 in in diameter . These will outlast any other pair of trimmers on the market as long as you are diligent with maintaining their sharpness and cleanliness .
5 #### Could not be more satisfied . Purchased two of them so that we always have one " at the ready . " Easy to use , no need to look for where to plug something in . Keeps our place clean of the residue from our beloved cats . Excellent product .
4 #### I figured that if this thing survived the job I purchased it for , it would be doing good . It has that and quite a few more that were just rough . So far ( knock on wood ) I have n't experienced the switch problem or dust attachment problem that other reviewers have had . We almost always use it attached to a vacuum . And that 's one of the reasons why it probably gets more use than some of our other sanders . The vacuum attachment works better with it than on our other sanders . So far , despite a lightweight appearance that would make you suspicious of its durability , it 's still sanding through some rough territory for us .
4 #### A nice bit that cuts cleanly . A bit expensive though ...
5 #### Unless you 're big on coordinating colors , this is the one to get Get a few while you 're at it . We have four of different sizes and they 're always in the dishwasher ... We have some Le Crusuet " Spoonolas " and they are identical except that the handle is wood and you can get them in some pretty nifty colors . The downside is the wooden handle starts to look iffy after umpteen trips through the dishwasher . I have n't broken any of their handles , but having broken a number of wooden spoons over the years , it 's just a matter of time . The stainless handle looks as good now as it did when we bought it and I tend to think it 's also more sanitary than wood .
4 #### Helpful for weeding for these old - lady bones , doubling the time I can endure gardening . Lightweight and easy to move , while still sturdy .
5 #### Got four of these now . They beat the quality of the old Craftsman one I bought in the late 90 's hands down and so far , they 've always had at least enough hardware - typically more . The heaviest things I 've used them for is a 6 in jointer and a 10 in table saw with extensions . The levers for engaging the casters are heavy duty plastic or glass - filled plastic ( not sure ) and work well - unlike the POS Craftsman base .
1 #### Tried screw / unscreww the parts ... Regardless , it leaked too bad to spray enough water when it sensed the motion . Returned .
1 #### We had house leaks and needed to continue to monitor the moisture level in the wood ( ceiling ) and drywall . My home inspector recommended this one as an inexpensive alternative to his $ 400 + Surveymaster moisture reader . However , this device was so inaccurate that made me doubt its usefulness . Off the dry wall , when the reading from Surveymaster was 22 % , this one 's was 15 % . Two locations off the ceiling wood , Surveymaster vs. Sonin were 18 % vs. 8 % , and 12 % vs 8 % . All the readings were done on the same day by my experienced home inspector who used the devices in the exact same location w/ exact same direction ( when pining into the ceiling ) and tried to use the same force to minimize the error bar caused by mishandling . Sonin 's readings were the same 8 % even though there was a 10 % difference in the readings from Surveymaster . 8%-12 % would be considered ok for wood , but 18 % is not . For example , mold remediation company would dry the ceiling wood below 16 % before they put on the final coat . W/ such inaccuracy , I found it nearly impossible to have a good assessment on the situation and to take necessary actions . Another drawback of the product : the pins are not sharp at all comparing to the Surveymaster 's . In test , the pins could n't penetrate into some plywood area under the roof , and hence could n't get any readings . In short , it is cheap for a reason . Use it w/ bucket load of grain of salt .
5 #### We have woodchuck and bunny problems in our garden and this is a great way to keep them out and our lawn watered ! Our dog will set it off and run like crazy so hubby gets wet , so we are having fun with it also ! So far , our tomatoes and my flowers are looking much happier and healthier .
4 #### While it 's an 8 quart pot you really ca n't pressure cook 6 quarts because of the fill line , which prevents the boiling liquids from clogging up the vent pipe . Cause , yeah they will clog up . My complaint is that I would have bought a bigger pot had i known I had a filling line to contend with . It works great and I am very happy with my pressure cooker . No slight on the product or its function , its fabulous . Just wish I would have known about that fill line
1 #### Very disappointed in this purchase . The popcorn is not crisp but chewy like it 's stale . It 's a hassle putting the stirring piece back on after washing . The plug broke apart after using it only two times .
5 #### I use this and it has not broken yet . The blades are very sharp and you need to be careful .
5 #### Well , to be honest " I " do n't really love this .. in fact , I could n't care less for measuring tapes , however my son - in - law uses this regularly and he does love it ! His quote " Stanley 's the best Ma , This will hold up forever , and I 'll be able to hand it down to my own son one day if we have one ! " He seems very happy to use this as often as he can !
5 #### I love OXO products for the quality and durability . These tongs are no exception . Nice soft grip and sturdy locking mechanism . Reasonable price too . I have several sizes of OXO tongs for different uses and they all have performed perfectly for many years .
5 #### Wow . Can hear the zaps from quite a distance . This thing really works . Have had other brands but this one is much better .
5 #### My husband says these work as well as the more expensive ones available elsewhere .
5 #### This is one awesome can opener ! I was very reluctant to order the Kuhn Rikon Auto Deluxe Satey can opener after reading some of the reviews . We have had it at least a month , it has n't broken like one reviewer said hers did . What could be easier than setting the opener on top of the can , turn the handle and the Kuhn Rikon does the rest . To take the lid off it is just a matter of placing what looks like " mini pliers " onto the lid , push the button to hold the " mini pliers " onto the lid and pull up to release the lid . The handle turns very easy .
5 #### Just what I 've come to expect in terms of quality . A brand you can trust .
5 #### Personally , I think woodworkers around the country should trade in their power tools for credit and replace them all with Bosch . I started using bosch tools over 12 years ago in a furniture shop , and my first experience with their tools was a jigsaw , which apparently has since reached legendary status . This particular jigsaw was thoroughly abused every day for years . We 'd burn through all the sears brand stuff , replacing them every few months , but the Bosch tools only needed the occasional cleaning and replacement blade . I saw first hand the kind of torture Bosch tools could withstand and have been a devoted fan ever since . In addtionl to the durabiltiy inherent in nearly ALL their tools , i 've also found them to be highly ACCURATE , which is absolutely required when crafting furniture . This particular tool carries on the long tradition of high quality , tough , accurate and well designed tools from bosch . I 'd give their tools 6 stars if i could .
5 #### My old Paslode batteries both died at the same time . Go figure . So I had to buy new ones . This is the original battery for Paslode angled finish gun . It works great , and holds in the gun like it should . I 'm glad i bought these two batteries , because i was getting aggravated with the old ones falling out , plus these last a lot longer . I recommend this original battery to anyone .
5 #### Every problem is a nail when all you have is a hammer . This hammer is top notch in quality and construction . The leather wrapped handle feels great in the hand , and the hammer deals with the " Nails " in your life quickly and efficiently , using the hammer end to pound your nails into submission , or the claw end to remove the nails from your life . I would wholeheartedly recommend this hammer to anyone looking to use brute force to " fix " their problems .
5 #### Love this grater . You can even shred motz easily . As a matter of fact the first two time I used it I grated way too much because its pretty effortless . Cleans easily and love the compact size when folded down .
5 #### Now this is one great watercan , if you need a big one . Holds a little over a gallon and has changeable spout ends . Good heavy plastic , good balance , a pleasure to use .
1 #### Seriously ... It 's a tea Ball ... That does n't keep tea inside of it . It is incredibly cheaply made , and routinely spilled tea leaves all into my drink . This ball hit the garbage basket faster than Kobe can sink a 3 .
5 #### Works . Very well made . Price was good . Balled melon to make a fruit basket . It came out beautiful . It makes perfect balls with skill .
5 #### Mr. MVP and I eat a lot of dehydrated fruit . This apple corer works wonders . I usually have problems with kitchen tools that require upper body strength because I have a medical device in my chest , but I can easily core apple after apple . I line the corer up with the stem and push firmly down until it reaches the cutting board on the other end . Usually I need to push the core out with my finger if it does not slip out with the corer . The whole process takes about 5 to 10 seconds . We do n't soak our apples with any lemon or extra chemicals , we just core them , slice them and then toss them in the dehydrator .
5 #### Does what its designed to do . Made my table mounted router more versatile
5 #### This Freud Quadra - Cut bit is no doubt the best round over bit I have used . In my shop are bits by CMT ( also excellent ) , Freud , Craftsman , Jointech , Jesada and a few others . Pros : Even though none of my bits are prone to vibration , this one is the quietest of all . It is safer to use because it is so exceedingly sharp it requires far less effort to move the work piece than my other bits so I always have total control . The vacuum port on my fence is small ( 1 - 5/8 inch ) and sometimes clogs due to splintering etc . using other bits . With the Freud , the shavings are consistent in size and there has not yet been any chatter or splintering with this bit even when I machine through a knot ; shavings flow smoothly through the dust collection . Freud has become both my favorite bit supplier ( and saw blades too ) . I am convinced the Quadra - Cut bits are what router bits should always have been . The bearings on all my Freud bits are higher quality than most other suppliers . Cons : None that I have noticed , but worthy of mention is that the picture for this product is not a Quadra - Cut bit ( at the time of this writing ) , however the bit I received is a Quadra - Cut . I just hope in the future there will be no confusion since I did notice one woodworker say he received the bit in the picture when ordering the Quadra - Cut as per the description . Nuff said . Definitely recommended .
5 #### I live near the coast an this is great as it protests from mildew .
5 #### I picked up the basic Freud SD206 6 " stacked dado set on sale at a local hardware store . Despite what some reviewers have written here , I had no problem mouting this dado stack on my DeWalt 746 table saw . Granted , when all of the chippers are in use the arbor is completely filled - but it does fit . After making many 1/2 " deep and 3/4 " wide cuts in white oak I found the performance of this dado stack to be excellent . There was no chipping or tearout whatsoever when I was cutting with the grain and only very minor chipping when cutting across the grain . The dado cuts were very smooth on all surfaces and the bottom of the cut was perfectly flat . Also , I was happy to see that the shims included were of very high quality ( thin metal rather than paper ) . I chose the 6 " model because I will probably never have a need for a dado so deep it requires an 8 " set . Overall I am very pleased with the quality of this product and recommend that you shop around for a deal like I got ( twenty five bucks less than the Amazon price at a local store ) .
5 #### It 's an Oxo - so it is well made and has a very comfortable grip like many of their kitchen tools . I have had one of these mini whisks for years . This purchase was a gift .
4 #### only disappointment is the lid gets really hot to press down you need a towel or potholder where i did n't on my 1st foreman Now i purchased a big round grilling pan for the stove top just a store brand it 's amazing chicken and steaks just perfect but George is great for my hotdogs , quesa dia 's and such you have to try these grill pans they do n't take up both burners i can cook for 4 easy and it does n't dry or harden the chicken like the foreman can ......
5 #### Sharp as hell and saws through thick branches easily . Impressed . Cut through a jungle of a full yard on a rehab house and has not lost any edge .
4 #### works well , mostley plastic which is what I wanted because I use it outside
5 #### Great for work in the woods . Re - enforced palm and leather flexes with the hand very well
4 #### This thing gets the edging job done . It takes a bit of practice to keep the line up against the concrete edge , and it wo n't turn gradual corners very well , but it seems to have plenty of power . I have a corner lot with quite a bit of bermuda , and that stuff will take over the sidewalk in a month or two . Personally , I would n't care , but my wife thinks we need to keep it edged , and so we do . Not sorry I bought it , and do n't wish I had something better . It gets the job done , and I can get replacement blades at the big box hardware store , so no worries there .
4 #### I have owned this saw for a couple months . I have played with it enough to get a feel for it but I have not worked with it enough to be an expert . Strengths : 1 ) The cast iron table is nice ( large and smooth ) 2 ) The saw does n't vibrate hardly at all in fact I do n't even have mine mounted yet . I have simply put it on a work bench and the saw stays put . 3 ) The saw does make very nice cuts Weaknesses : 1 ) It 's heavy for moving ( is also part of its strengths ) 2 ) It seems to be a little underpowered for larger stock Overall it is a nice machine with a fairly hefty price tag .
4 #### I really like these measuring spoons . The ergonomic grips are really nice and I appreciate them much more than I thought I would , especially when pouring into the spoon from a large jug , etc . They are OXO quality , so you can beat them up pretty hard and they 'll stand up to the torture from scouring to the dishwasher . I actually found the keyring to be perfect , it keeps them together without making it really hard to detach if you need to . I suppose a caribiner - style clip would make it better , but I had no issues . They are well balanced and I think the only drawback is that the metal is a bit thin , so they can bend . If it were maybe half - again as thick or of a harder steel , it probably would n't be an issue . They could also just forge them with a spine to make bending much more difficult . I really like them and they are way beyond those cheap plastic ones that cost a buck at the mega - marts . 4 Stars because I do n't think they should bend at all at this price .
5 #### Although a little heavier than the usual leaf rake , this one takes care of twigs and extra leaves with gusto !
1 #### Startled by all the positive reviews . Influenced by the encouraging reviews , purchased this product on two occasions ( the second time after our memory had faded about the poor experience the first time around ) . Besides the cheaply - made sensor housing , the mechanism is erratic and does n't closely reproduce its stated intent . In an effort to create the ideal ` conditions ' for the ScareCrow , we even purchased a pressure reducer as well as a new set of 9V batteries ( as suggested in the manual ) . To no avail . At best , this item may have amused our local wildlife ; certainly did n't trouble them . The ScareCrow ( at least to us ) was a waste of money , highly unreliable , and not effective in its intended purpose .
5 #### I like it . Keeps my arms away from the grill .
5 #### Best BBQ tongs ever . Long enough to keep you away from the heat . Gripping part of the tongs are properly sized . Well made .
4 #### I had to adjust the trip mechanism so it would work better , Otherwise it was all good and the packaging and the shipping lead time was good .
5 #### This risk makes whipping cream a breeze . We ate ' real whipped cream ' throughout the holiday . Everyone enjoyed taking a turn with the whisk
4 #### Like many of you I have used an electric mixer to make mashed potatoes , and what I ended up with was a mess of glue like potatoes . Not appealing in any way . I had an old potato masher that I used , but it broke . I look upon that occasion as a stroke of luck . This potato masher is the best I have ever used , and makes the best mashed potatoes . First of all , you should always make sure your potatoes are as dry as possible . After draining the potatoes , leave them in the pan over med heat until you are sure they are dry . Then place them in a receptacle that is deep and wide enough to mash . The oversize handle is so easy to use and is great for mashing . The wide head of the masher eliminates any lumps , but if you want a few lumps leave them . Mix butter and a small amount of warm cream , salt and pepper into the potatoes , and you will have the most delicious mashed potatoes you have ever had . Oxo is the brand to buy for most household / kitchen tools . They are well priced , and always well made . You can depend upon this brand . I found this brand after reading Jessica Seinfeld 's blog . You can either hand wash the masher or put it in your dishwasher , it is your choice . Recommended . prisrob 08 - 16 - 14
1 #### I bought it for the narrow rectangle setting and the spray was very uneven . I have used a couple of others of this design and this is worse than one and no better than the other .
5 #### Great product for anyone looking for a pressure cooker . Easy to get the replacement accessories . Well worth the price for this cooking appliance .
5 #### I love this thing For small jobs works like a champ
5 #### Picks up loose dirt , pet hair and crumbs from floors . Can be used for hardwood as well as tile . It 's not great on rugs , but I had n't intended it for that purpose . Definitely order an extra battery as one only lasts about ten minutes . With two , I 'm able to do all of the floors in my house . The batteries are easy to charge and to change . I highly recommend this for quick clean - ups .
4 #### So far works good . the only reason I am not giving it a 5 star , is that it does n't have a bug catcher on the bottom . A small removable plate or something would have worked . If its outside , not a problem , but I have it in my garage since we were having mosquitoes get in our garage and eating our kids . After a good night , I have a pile of dead bugs on my floor I have clean . I usually just blow them out with the blower , but a $ .25 piece of square plastic on the bottom to catch them would have made it great .
5 #### Nicer fry cutter than I expected . A bit of effort is needed when you start to cut the potato , but once past that all is well . Shipped well and arrived with the cool daddy fryer I also bought .
5 #### My daughter is filling the tub from the outside hose , and then loading up her water guns . Super ! This was the widest pocket on Amazon that I could find . & a Nice handle grip to make it easier to carry .
5 #### This is the only angle strap that I have ever bought and it does exactly what I wanted it to do .
5 #### Happy so far . They seem to have significantly reduced the amount of dust and lint over the cut - to - fit ones we were using previously . Was great to be able to find our size on Amazon as we had no luck locally and the cut - to - fit version generally did n't fit properly either .
5 #### Replaced an old waterpik filter of the same design . More durable and filter works great !
5 #### Loved it - heavier so the wind did not know it down . The face was perfect - i could see what time it was in my pool without glasses . Perfect for what i need .
5 #### I am in my seventies , and have small hands , so I love this fine tool . I can cut through 1 " branches as though they were butter . And the long handles gave me sufficient distance from my rose bushes so that the annual blood drain was somewhat reduced . This is a lovely , finely weighted tool . I had n't previously used bypass technology , but I 'm sold now .
5 #### Good sponge holder . Looks the part , easy to clean , wo n't rust .
5 #### Just finished assembling this evening . Appears to be well designed and expect it to give good service . Went together fairly easily once I figured out the stretchers . Awaiting a 14 " band saw to place on it .
5 #### Great tool . Have been using one for years but needed a new one .
5 #### I got this because I needed it for a Christmas Party . It worked just fine !
4 #### I have another OXO grater that is quite bit narrower and has more of a bow to it . This one just totally lays waste to a chunk of cheddar in no time flat .
5 #### Great for single serving baking . I use it in my regular oven .
4 #### THIS PEELER WORKS FINE . JUST AFTER ORDERING IT FROM AMAZON I SAW IT AT WALGREENS FOR 4.99 .... THE EVERYDAY PRICE . I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF IT COULD BE FOUND EVEN CHEAPER THAN 4.99 AT DISCOUNT STORES .
4 #### The metal blade broke after two years . Sure the branch was a little too big with hindsight but still I would expect metal blades to be stronger than my grip .
5 #### I have used this knife for years and passed it on to all my niece 's , sister and in - laws . Every time I visit family , they pull this knife out to cut anything . I slice through tomatoes and cut through frozen meat . I love it but there is one flaw . After a while the tips break off . It does n't interfere with the slicing and dicing but maybe your engineers can develop a thicker and stronger tip so this does n't happen . It is still my favorite knife to do anything with .
5 #### This bundt pan is perfect ! I like the traditional shape and the nonstick coating makes it very easy for the cake to slide out .
5 #### This is very attractive in white for next to our fish cleaning station . Flexible , but not easy to kink .
3 #### Pretty cheap looking up close . The only thing I can say is it served the purpose for the price .
5 #### This product was just what I was looking for and at a great price . Great people/ company to deal with .
5 #### I started camping with an RV and my wife can go through firewood like butter melts on toast . I bought two of these to keep up with the work . I do n't know how to sharpen but these fit well and seem to eat wood pretty well .
5 #### I would have called an exterminator . I had a bee problem in my attic . These things got the job done at a fraction of the price . They are easy to use and work really well .
2 #### Ordered just to get another spool for modification to .080 " line . To modify , use a .080 " screw to change one of the holes in the top of the spool . Twist in the new .080 " line . Manually rewind the line unto the spool ( not hard & it does n't take long ) . Put the end of line in the slot after winding so it does n't unwind . B&D must have had the razor blade concept so successul for Gillette in mind when they made their weed eater . As in , price the weed eater cheap , and then sell a lot of line spools . They could just as easily used .080 " line to begin with , but then the line would last too long .
4 #### It 's a spatula and so being few comments can be made . I am very happy with this particular spatula . The size , quality , and comfort are superior to others I use .
5 #### My mother in law got me this for Christmas ! I love it . It completely serves it 's purpose .
5 #### I 've always liked this design - easy to read and use . I own five or six of them so I can leave them in different places and still spend time looking for one !
5 #### Used this with my plants this year and I really think the extra nutrients in it have helped them grow .
5 #### This timer is fantastic ! Works well and you can set different times for each day . Very easy to program as well !
5 #### Works as advertised . Used it to cut a quartz slab for a bathroom sink with ease . Not like butter , but maybe a slightly dry steak with a good steak knife .
5 #### It covered the pool , was easy to use , and no beasties got into my pool
5 #### WE LOVE THIS LITTLE GADGET IT CUTS DOWN TIME AND THE FRIES ARE AWESOMELY CUT
5 #### My $ 250 vacuum cleaner just needed a couple of belts to get it back to working condition . No problems with installation .
1 #### There are much better choices at a lower cost . The padded handle covers slide off easily making the product much more difficult to use , and the although the cutting blades are sharp , they wo n't cut cut through larger branches without bending them out of shape . Nice try Fiskars , but it should be back to the drawing boards !
5 #### This was exactly what I was looking for . It is perfect for frosting mini cakes ( 4 " round ) . The blade is sturdy but flexible . The grip felt comfortable to me .
3 #### A slight bump , will turn it on / off . Do n't know why , only had it for 2 weeks . We 'll see . The photo sensor is working fine . But next time I will probably get the one with the remote .
5 #### This was quite a change for me . I 've been using a round whisk for 20 years . Now I wonder why . This whisk is easy to handle , gets to the bottom of pans or skillets wonderfully , and is one of my fav kitchen tools now .
4 #### I wanted a glass hummingbird feeder and decided to try this one on my window before springing for some of the more glamorous - looking blown glass ones . I mounted it on my kitchen window , under an awning on the northeast side of the house , not at all expecting anything to happen . A ruby - throated hummingbird found it the very first day ! It took some force at first to separate the mounting bracket thing from the feeder itself . In fact , I had to drop it first for it to break loose and detach ! Fortunately , nothing broke . I probably could have just soaked it in some hot soapy water and it would have come apart easily . You ca n't beat glass . I 'm just totally getting away from plastic these days ....
5 #### I used this exact tape measure for many years while working for a contractor . NOTHING comes close . I 'm delighted that these are still being made .
5 #### Fantastic . Bought 2 as I have two different dog foods . They are handy & hold a 38 lb bag easily . They stack well and the doors are wonderful- no twisting needed which makes it very handy and quick . I hope they keep to food fresh and so far it appears it does so . They were packages well and delivered on time .
5 #### IF YOU HAVEN'T EVER USED THIS PRODUCT . . . THEN YOU ARE MISSING OUT ! ! IT REALLY REALLY WORKS ! ! ! . . . AND SINCE THIS SIZE HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED BY THE MAKER . . .. AND THERE ARE ONLY 3 OF THESE SIZES LEFT ON AMAZON . .. YOU BETTER STOP THINKING ABOUT IT AND JUST BUY IT ! ! ! THIS IS A HUGE SAVINGS AND A GREAT PRICE FOR THE CONCENTRATE ! ! !
5 #### I bought two of these to add to my new woodshop , I plan for one near the drill press and the other near the lathe . I hooked up one so far into my 3HP Grizzly dust collection system with a Woodstock blast gate , and used construction adhesive to secure the floor sweep to the concrete floor . Turn on the dust collector and - whoosh ! - away goes the dust and wood chips . Great accessory for any shop , should keep you from having to bend over to use a dustpan .
5 #### Works great . A little smaller than my previous pressure cooker which I had for over 30 years .
5 #### Important . This product is intended for use with ladders with rung spacing of 12 " . Be sure to check your ladder rung spacing before buying . It is also intended for ladders with round or " D " shaped rungs , and not flat ones . Neither of the ladders I am using the jacks with are Werner brand but they both have 12 " rung spacing . The jack comes with a 1/4 " bolt and wing nut to prevent the jack from being lifted from the rung when in use . Since these loose parts are easy to lose , I replaced them with a 1/4 " x 2 1/2 " square lock pin that I can attach with a lanyard .
4 #### It 's good . I would have like a little more cushion but it serves the purpose .
1 #### I ordered two of these Gilmore sprayers via Amazon and received promptly . Both units had air pressure leaks where the handle part of the unit screws onto the liquid holding portion ; One sprayer air leaked moderately , the other unit air pressure leaked severely ; I was barely able to use the moderately leaking unit to do a " rush job " by very frequent pumping . The severely leaking unit was not usable because it lost pressure so fast . I called Gilmore customer service and requested a new unit and was told I would be sent a new replacement sprayer if I would prove recent purchase by sending them a copy of the concerned invoice via email -- I did this and quickly received a new identical replacement sprayer . I immediately added pure water to the reservoir , operated the hand pump to pressurize , and immediately noted this new replacement sprayer also had a severe air pressure leak making it virtually unusable .
5 #### My MIL came to visit and had us buy her one as well while she was here Stays sharp for a long time Great quality , comfortable to use
5 #### This is the second light we purchased . My husband kept taking mine ! We love the choice in dim / high and that the light covers the whole page . We just love these lights !
5 #### Work great to turn on shop lights under my car port where we park .
5 #### I prefer this to my old bar . It 's better for pulling nails and has better leverage for prying .
5 #### A very well made , and different design . Please be careful this tool has a very sharp edge , I brushed it against my thumb and laid my flesh open . This edge is more like a knife , but chops and splits very well . A great product , just watch out for that edge ! ! !
5 #### works great , my shop is alot cleaner now that i have it on my saw .
4 #### This was a gift , but as far as I know , she likes it .
1 #### the design of the valve employs 2 sharp angles which reduce the water pressure to very low , too low to use the hose to clean a patio for example . a shame 'coz the item looks reasonably good .
4 #### The product works excellent mechanically but the squirrels and birds just laugh at it and continue on eating my garden but it 's a quality product . I 'm trying to think of other ways to use the motion sensor since it does n't scare anything .
5 #### You pretty much ca n't go wrong with the Korky flapper . It really seems to outperform any other brand I 've tried .
5 #### the cardinals and finches love this feeder . its sturdy and holds lots of feed . easy to assemble and hand for easy viewing
1 #### They collect saw dust at the bottomwhere the closing is completed , After some dust collects there it will not close , need to be romoved and cleaned . It helps if mounted upside down as long as it does not open wiht the handle in the down side .
5 #### I use mine the most to haul wet blankets & laundry around . It is nicely water tight . It does n't leak when I carry wet blankets thagt I pre - soaked in tub out side to bring inside to really wash up . Very well made and worth the price .
5 #### It 's a Ridgid steel pipe wrench . Nothing but the best and made on the USA
2 #### Does n't have enough patterns , especially gentle patterns to not disturb topsoil . Would not recommend for gardening . It 's also a pain in the butt to turn on and off if you forget which end you 're at , and also a pain to switch all the way over to get to the other end . It may be sort of comfortable to hold , but there are also multi - patterned ergonomic nozzles out there .
5 #### I love this spoon because it has a flat handle and will fit in my utensil caddy well . I would recommend this product for what it is as well .
3 #### This kettle boils quickly , has a whistle that flips open , and is loud enough to wake the dead . The rubber diaphragm that keeps the seal degrades over time and is tricky to replace but this is a rare event . Bad design with a narrow base leaves the metal handle so hot that you almost always need a potholder to pour . I would have kept mine -- given as a gift -- but I looked inside and found that the enamel had degraded the bottom was a graveyard of rust . I had puzzled why my blood iron was so high and this is the likely reason . Chantal gives no warranty against corrosion and a review of this product on the Chantal website noted that corrosion is a known major problem with this model . See photos and decide for yourself . I decided to buy the Oggi Bordeaux Stainless Steel Whistling Tea Kettle and am very happy with it . See my review there .
5 #### Brought the ppms of my runoff from roughly 2100 to maybe 100 with one flush ... I could taste the flavor of my veggies and not the nutrients .
5 #### This stand works great for the De - Walt scroll saw . It is sturdy and allows you to be able to work around the entire front and side area of the saw . The legs come with welded plates at the bottom so that the stand can be lagged to the floor or a wooden platform . Very well made .
5 #### This pizza wheel is so much bigger and nicer than the little $ 2 pizza cutter I had that I uploaded a picture for comparison . First of all , it 's huge and makes quick work of even your deepest deep dish pizza . You hardly have to apply any force at all . It has a very nice weight and quality feel to it . I hand wash and dry this so that it will last a really long time . I have been adding Oxo kitchen tools to my arsenal over time , and it has become one of my favorite brands along with KitchenAid , Cuisinart , Calphalon , etc . If you are willing to pay $ 12 for a pizza cutter you wo n't be disappointed with this one . It may be the last one you buy .
5 #### These bags work great for drywall . Regular cartridge filters clog up but these do not .
3 #### I find the Eureka Mighty Mite easy to handle , as desired / wanted in a compact tank vacuum cleaner . This was as expected and I plan to " keep it " , in fact I ordered a pack of replacement bags . The hose and tools are clearly economy quality , I 'll share the better tools I have from a full size tank vacuum to extend the usefulness of the Mighty Mite . I find the air relief at the top of the hose handle problematic . I normally want to operate the vacuum at full suction , and the relief port twists too easily when handling the hose to carry out cleaning operations . I gave the unit only 3 stars because of the lower quality of the touch - and - feel of the machine . But , given the low cost it may deserve a higher score , at least a 4 star .
5 #### I use this nightly and it is nice a bright . Very handy !
5 #### I replaced one that was about 20 years old , with this one , that is exactly like the old one . Just love love . I have small hands , so this is easy to handle , and I cook a lot .
5 #### I bought this to replace my old handled bowl which had cracked along the handle due to the handle being thin and bending when the bowl had any weight in it . This bowl is much stronger and I doubt the handle will crack . Great quality and feel . Always happy with OXO products .
5 #### Excellent product I would buy it again , and recommend it to anyone who 's looking for something like this especially for this price Works exactly like it should be not much to say about it ! I would recommend to a friend !
4 #### They need to be modified with nails to actually work !
5 #### Nice timer that has worked as described without issue . Multiple settings are nice . I use it for 2 led spot lights lighting up my 30 ' flag pole .
5 #### I have a source of creek water with the spring 20 ft before it and this one is the best I have found that does not clog from fine dirt when it rains . We live in the mountains and the spring and creek are on the property .
3 #### Expected a little more precision ... but does well for a rough cut tool .
3 #### The Eureka belt slipped and I had to use a different spare .
3 #### I love the hard plastic bottom . The sides are already punctured by twigs . I wish they used ballistic nylon sides like other barrels .
5 #### It does the job . At this price it does not have a manual flow adjustment so I had to buy a separate PVC valve for that . I like the low profile straight - through design .
5 #### Great ... it works well in tight corners . Good for gravies and sauces .
5 #### I love this bundt pan . The shape is beautiful . The handles are helpful . Cakes and breads release nicely from this bundt pan . Its a quality piece of kitchen equipment that will last for years .
1 #### It 's the right size and I wish more bakeware companies made these smaller sizes because the " normal " size pans do n't fit in our convection oven and we ca n't use glass or that plastic stuff . It 's hard to find smaller size metal bakeware . But this one , and all the others with a non - stick surface , become useless after 2 or 3 uses -- the non - stick surface starts to flake off ( onto the food cooked in it ) which is not healthy for you . And we do n't have a dishwasher so it ca n't be blamed on that machine . We use the teflon - friendly utensils etc . but the stuff still flakes off . The manufacturers ought to just give up on the non - stick stuff and let us have plain ol' stainless steel -- at least it 's tough and can withstand scouring when needed , you can use Oven - off on badly burned crusty stuff , you can soak it in an ammonia - baking soda solution to lift off cooked - on food ; you can still use the pan . These non - stick pans just start losing their non - stick surface within 2 or 3 uses , and the non - stick stuff is stuck to your food ! Not good , not good , not good .
5 #### I have a large pond with a variety of plants , fish , frogs , and in full sun . The Algaefix has worked well . To keep down the amount of ' chemicals ' , I use this in conjunction with Barley Straw pellets , adding only enough Algaefix to make up for what the pellets ca n't handle .
5 #### These tortilla shell pans was exactly what we wanted . The size is great for large tortillas . It baked the tortillas evenly . just follow the instructions on seasoning the shell pans and washing it . We have used it about 5 times now and each time it comes out a nice golden brown .
5 #### Bought this to move new bandsaw with and it works well . Wheels will roll over some stuff as long as it is n't to large
5 #### I bought this to replace the one that I bent . A piece of angle iron got jammed . This one works as well as the Milwaukee blade that came with the saw .
5 #### I was a pressure cooking newbie , and I recently purchased a ( Fagor 6 quart stainless steel ) pressure cooker for myself and was bragging about it to my best friend . She was so interested being a pressure cooking newbie herself and kept saying she wanted to get one too . I could n't wait for her to try it , so I bought her this cheaper 6 qt Presto and had it shipped directly to her . She loves it and uses it all the time . She says she uses it almost every day . She used to cook pinto beans ( for example ) from dry all day in a stock pot , but now she cooks them so fast in the pressure cooker and says the taste is so much better . She said it was like tasting a pinto bean for the first time , it was so much more flavorful . I do n't know what I 'd do without mine either ! I personally try to stay away from aluminum products , but that would be my only reservation .
4 #### It 's the same as my old one , but I do n't like the zip - tie . I do n't have a collar on my old model 51587 blower / vac and the old one had a canvas strap that was easy to put on and remove . I 'll have to but something in it that I can twist or tie closed for easy changes . Do n't think I 'll find a collar that will fit .
4 #### We are trying to keep our energy consumption down and decided to buy this water heater timer . My husband installed it but the " clock " part was n't keeping accurate time . We notified the company via Amazon and a replacement arrived within the week . The second timer is keeping perfect time and we now know when our water will be the hottest and are n't wasting energy heating water in the middle of the night when we are sleeping . Great product and great customer service .
5 #### This is perfect for my lady bug bird feeder . It is fun to watch the birds hanging from the feeder to get to the nutritious seeds .
5 #### Great for rinsing quinoa , which is why I bought it . Perfect . Sturdy , well made construction .
5 #### Its a Crescent ......... How can it not be great . Amazon makes it too easy
5 #### Love this hose . Had some new landscaping done and needed to make sure all the plants got watered . The holes in this hose are easy to see so you know which side to put up . The water will shoot out a good height .
5 #### I was replacing the switches for the bathroom fans with timers , so I bought these . Good quality , color was correct , plenty strong , came with screws .
2 #### Before we got thru the first season with this product , it was leaking water from the inner connection . We 've tried uncoiling the hose to it 's fullest extent so we could make adjustments to the leaking connection , but to no avail . We just could not stop the water from pouring out of that connection , no matter what we tried to do . What a waste of water ! We 're looking for a replacement product , or a less leaky way to store the hose itself .
5 #### While at a dinner party , my friend ( who is a gourmet chef ) used a corer similar to this . After seeing the ease in how he cored an apple with this tool , I just had to have one myself . This one did not disappoint and works great . I use it all the time .
5 #### Great timers , but bummed their is n't any day / night light sensors on this thing .
5 #### The price was right and finding them on here was easy . I would buy these again for a friend or family to have a good time with these ! !
5 #### Five star transaction , great price , fast shipping , product was as described . Purchased this motion sensor light for use on a large parking area . Coverage and sensor response are great , highly recommend .
4 #### I have had this cover for several months , and it has held up through several high wind heavy rainstorms . It performed perfectly . My only complaint was that the cover ( when first opened ) STINKS . The smell goes away after a few days outside , but my advice is to figure out which way the wind is blowing and open the package downwind of anyone you like .
5 #### very good stuff just not enough of it you will find in this box that you have everything you need to grow whatever you need to grow just follow the instructions and you can not go wrong I highly recommend this to anyone just starting out
5 #### I love the thickness of the handle , it is easy to grip and easy to use . I have had one of these for over 10 years , I just now feel like I may need a new one . Grateful that they still make it ! When my children were small , they also were able to use this peeler . In fact , one day at elementary school , we were making a salad for a feast and I brought this peeler , many students ( and teachers ) were happy that the students were able to peel themselves . The teacher had even asked if it was pampered chef .
4 #### For Christmas , my boyfriend wanted a new knife and cutting board , romantic , huh ? More , I was not in the Christmas spirit and let him pick out his gifts . I even let him use it before I gifted the knife to him . He loves this knife and it seems to be really good quality .
4 #### This planter lasted for 3 years . it faded and crumbled due to sun exposure so I had to take it out . Till it lasted it worked well . Easy to assemble . Bigger challenge is finding a small enough plant to put inside . I managed to put 4 - 5 tomato plants and all of them thrived and have given good yield . The planter does not hold lot of water so have to water them everyday in this sunny ca weather . I wish I could buy it again for the price I paid 3 yrs ago . It 's 4 times that price now
5 #### Measures correctly , well balanced . What else is there to say ? ?
3 #### It seems to be accurate provided you heed the instructions and ONLY install it somewhere in FULL SHADE . Once the sun hits it , it will start telling you that it 's 20 or 30 degrees hotter than it actually is .
2 #### to assemble and set it up ... Planned to hold the pot lids but in the end they are my kitchen towels hanger . Can only hold really light items .
5 #### First time I had a popover was at a quaint country restaurant in Wisconsin and they were so good and unique I knew I would want to make them . This pan works great . Popovers are delicious , but really do n't turn out well without the proper pan . My biggest issue was having a pan for only one use so in order to justify this purchase , I have also used the pan to make tall cupcakes , mini chicken pot pies and layered jello towers for the grandkids and anything else I can think of .
5 #### geez ! Hard to find a can opener that will open those cheap aluminum cans ... drives me nuts ... this was the 3rd can opener I had purchased ... and it is great . Will buy again for my cabin and motorhome
4 #### I will have to review this product at the end of the summer to give a better idea of the help / quality of the product . My first impressions were that this was a small amount of stuff . I also think that it stinks . I am going to use it in a compost bin , rather than the recommended ground idea . I do n't like to leave compost on the ground , as it attracts rodents . So far my stuff has been in there for three weeks . Will update again later .
5 #### i purchased this hose almost 2 years ago . i usually follow up my purchases with reviews but somehow this product slipped thru the cracks . what has prompted me to review it now is that after almost 2 years of use the leader hose burst . tried to fix , failed . called the company , and after confirming i had indeed purchased the product , quickly sent me a new leader hose to replace the broken one . rare customer service that you do n't see all the time , at least i do n't . i 've been happy with the hose so far , and can not complain about the company backing up its products . highly recommended
1 #### The advertised pictures show this tool being used on joists that are not taped . If you plan on rebuilding an outdoor deck and want to last you will probably want to use deck joist tape in which case this product does not work . It just slips and tears the tape . Use an f style clamp and a flat superbar instead , it is the same concept as what Jorgenson just came out with in the Pony Board Boss . Then you can straighten anywhere along the board and not ruin your tape ! Be sure to use the deckmate spacers as well .
5 #### I 've used chimneys for 50 years and this one is the best I 've ever had . It 's construction is solid and its handles are positioned to keep ones hands and arms away from the heat .
5 #### it is fine bracket is not as sturdy as older fire extinguisher bracket
5 #### This product works as advertised and does a good job turning on at dusk . I am pleased with this purchase and would recommend it .
5 #### Easy to use and worked great . Best on smaller sized apples but , I usually choose smaller fruit anyway . Love to core an apple , slice in thick rings and spread almond butter and semi - sweet chocolate chips for a snack . Definitely would purchase again .
5 #### These filters are the best ones I have found . They really catch a lot of stuff ! I have people in the office who have severe allergies and since installing these filters , seem to do a lot better in the office .
4 #### I 've tried all the other brands , this is the only fill valve that adjusts short enough to fit in my shorter than average tank without interfering with the tank lid . So if you have a short tank , this is your only option . Runs quiet too .
5 #### Bought these for my husband for Father 's Day . He LOVES them . They are so sharp and snap off branches with much effort . Would certainly buy again .
5 #### The extra blades are inside the utility knife . Easy to assemble , easy to use . Cuts right through boxes , vinyl planks , etc .
4 #### Others have noted that the actual usable area of this pan is fairly small . But I use it with a compact toaster oven ( the Breville BOV650XL Compact Smart Oven ) and it fits the bill . It has a good surface ( so far ) and is , again as others have noted , stamped from 2 pieces , so not sure how long that will last . But so far , so good . To give you an idea , I can heat up 2 chicken cutlets for sandwiches , side - by side . That 's about it , but that 's all I need . Anything for 2 sandwiches . You can extrapolate from that , but for small portions ( I live alone ) , it really works very well and is easy to clean - up . So ... yay . Dimensions are : outer the whole sheet itself ) 10 " by 7 " but the actual cooking surface is 6 " by 8 "
5 #### This coffee maker is great ! Freshly brewed coffee and after the unit cools off , you can just use a paper towel & water to wash the removable parts . EASY ! !
4 #### Nice clock . My clock blew off the wall with 15 mph wind speed 20 days after I hung it , Take caution and secure the clock with wire or something to prevent it from coming off the wall in average weather / wind . I bought a second clock and secured it by threading a drywall screw just above and against the clock body . I hope this works .
5 #### i 'm so glad they make this . paired with a hepa filter , this is the perfect way to suck up nasty dust around the house , especially in the basement and even in the chimney
5 #### hard plastic and yet so strong , LOVE this item for my pond
5 #### I struggled trying to make popovers with a muffin tin ( fail ! ) because I did n't want to clutter up my kitchen with extra pans and tools . This one is 110 % worth it . It 's a high - quality pan , that produced several rounds of sky - high , flaky popovers . Definitely worth the purchase , and the space in the kitchen .
5 #### If you do pressure treated decking , then this tool is a must . It lets you bend boards back into shape prior to screwing down . The only minor problem was the plastic end caps all fell out after first days use , but that does n't really affect the function .
5 #### This is a great pair of pliers to have , I have trusted Channellock for a very long time , simply because they make great pliers , I only buy Channellock and Craftsman pliers , simply because they can stand up to any working conditions . I have used this comfortable pair of pliers for a lot of things , not just wiring , it helped me with my car a whole lot as well . A very good and useful tool to have , does n't slip and feels like it belongs in your hand ...
5 #### These work real well and I bought the bigger pack for replacements . I like these cause they come right to your door and are cheaper than you can buy at home depot .
5 #### I was n't sure what I was going to get for the 3 or 4 bucks I spent on this item , but I am very happy with what I have . I connected this to my 4 " dust collection hose , turned the dust collector on , and started sweeping stuff towards it . Just like that it was all sucked up inside without any issues . I ca n't think of any downsides to this product .
5 #### Not quite what I expected , but they work great , on a multitude of smaller projects and items
5 #### Ca n't be any easier . Plant size determines how many plant spiked each plant gets ! Just insert them in the ground , then water .
5 #### The best there is in Pressure Cookers . I was hooked when I saw it perform at a friend 's kitchen making risotto .... FAST ! I am looking forward to making stews , rice congee , etc with it !
5 #### I 've had this pressure cooker for a while , i have been using it since i bought it . no complains . this is great little pot
4 #### Easy to use . not hard to clean up . Still have n't found the perfect popcorn maker
5 #### This is a very durable net due to the rigid frame that it mounts to . I have tried many others with little success . I 'll buy again .
2 #### Sure would have liked some instructions for those of us that are not normally finish carpenters
3 #### Too Short ? Seems like every time I use my sawzall , it 's to cut through something thicker than what these blades will handle . 6x6 posts , pipe , downspouts . . . For the thin stuff I use my jigsaw . That said , these blades are fine . But next time , I 'm buying something longer .
3 #### I like it OK , but the charcoal rack has already started to rust . Here in the deep south , we try not to cook inside the house but grill or cook outside to help with the cooling bill . The only problem with these is they only last a few years before rusting out .
5 #### after 21 years it was time to get a new can opener andI read all the reviews and picked this one -- am not unhappy - does just what it should -- i tried one from the local big box store and it just did not work - so this is a pleasure .
5 #### Do n't buy much Stanley . Planes are what they do best . By far .
5 #### Ladder is replacing older aluminum unit . Most of the time , newer products today are of lesser quality and substance than older ones ; not in this case . Ladder is superbly constructed , heavy - duty , was shipped intelligently and makes me thrilled I finally acquiesced and purchased a replacement . Well worth the price-
5 #### I 'm using this blade on my Bosch GCM12SD and it leaves cuts glass smooth .
4 #### These function well . And the price was great compared to what the landscapers wanted to change to replace a bunch of these . They were very each to install if you are replacing older or broker heads . My biggest complaint is the sticker that you see in the picture . That is stuck on and on some of the ones I bought the sticker would not come off . So I just installed it figuring it is outside and with the rain and such it would wear of quickly . It has been over 6 months and some of them still have the ugly half york off sticker on them in my flower beds .
5 #### I love this sprayer . It is finely engineered , with metal parts used for key components , works great , and has a lifetime guarantee . The spray pattern is very nice and even , and adjustable . When the spray deflector is removed , you will get a powerful stream to reach 20 or 30 feet into trees ( depends upon your water pressure ) . The bottle is only 16 oz , which is smaller than some other products , but that is not a problem for me , and is a good tradeoff , to get a product that works so well . I do recommend carefully reading the instructions that come with the sprayer , and you will avoid most of the issues seen in the lower rated reviews here .
4 #### Solid tank , but look carefully at the connector to ensure it is what you need . I had to buy and adaptor for my small Weber Performer series low pressure line . Tank seems solid , but you may need to buy a $ 15-$20 adaptor as well .
4 #### Although I was surprised to see that birds , other than finches , can stand on the bottom platform and feed , this bird feeder still has several other ports where only the yellow finch can feed . The snowbirds seemed to be the ones standing and getting the food on the bottom , so I did n't mind it at all , since they are welcome winter visitors . The bottom holes were made bigger , though , by some non finch birds who pecked at it , and I had to put a bit of duct tape over the bottom holes . BUT ! This bird feeder is the most handsome finch feeder out there . In addition , it has a canopy to keep out really wet weather , which can be a problem with small niger seeds . Most niger feeders do not have this canopy , and when the seeds get wet , they clump together and get moldy . All in all , I enjoy looking out at my yard and seeing this feeder filled with finches !
5 #### It works as it should . It snapped into the panel without and problems . I used it to feed my detached garage .
5 #### I bought a dozen when I found them on sale that way and mounted them on three different lengths of pipe : 28 " , 40 " and 52 " . That way I have 2 ' , 3 ' , and 4 ' clamping CAPACITY with each . I also threaded both ends of the pipe , so with 3/4 " pipe connectors , the possibilities are expanded . I do use wood strips to pad the jaws , otherwise they can damage wood under pressure . I have mounted them backwards on the pipe and used them to spread joints a couple of times . With a simple 2x4 rack , I can glue up wide panels with them . You need a few of these in your shop , too .
3 #### I did n't listen to the other reviews when they said this hung a little low . In fact , it does and you can see the light bulbs . It was a little cumbersome to install , compared to some of the higher - end light fixtures I 've installed elsewhere . It serves the purpose and it is less of an eyesore than an exposed bulb , but if you 're looking for a high quality fixture this is not it . You get what you pay for .
5 #### This base is pretty decent for what you pay . I also have the all - metal Delta mobile base for my jointer . It is much stiffer , as you would expect . That being said , I tried using some 2x2 scrap , and it ended up flexing too much under my 14 " bandsaw . I replaced with some hickory , and problem solved . I DOES say to use hardwood in the instructions ;-) Overall , if you do n't have a crazy heavy tool , this base is great , very ( infinitely ) adjustable , and easy to lower / raise , and at a good price .
5 #### This is such a great whisk ! I have had it for almost six months and not a spot of rust . The wires are sealed making this a cinch to clean and it stays looking new . It is light weight and the wires have great spacing making it perfect for mixing just about anything . The handle is comfortable as well . Since this purchase I have n't used any of my other whisks !
5 #### Great little vac . Just what I needed for quick cleanup daily . Works like a charm ! Battery does n't go dead as fast as the last one I had ( different brand ) . Lightweight so I can carry it from room to room . I love it ! !
5 #### Bought this because I wanted a smaller corded circular saw with the blade on the left , like my ridgid cordless circular saw . I was tired of the batteries being dead all the time . I like the blade on the left because I am right handed and like to see what I am cutting when I am cutting it . I think this is a perfect saw for small jobs . It is very lightweight and small unlike the bohemoth 7 1/2 inch circular saws . The only possible problem is you can pretty much only cut through 2 " stock with the 5 1/2 inch blade . This is however not a problem to me . It has great power and feels very sturdy . If I dropped it I know it would be a problem because it would bend out of alignment , but any circular saw would . I would definitely recommend it to everyone who is looking for a light duty compact circular saw .
5 #### This little gadget put a smile on my face . It is the winter season , when we are staying healthy by enjoying our fresh apples . I know it only takes a minutes to scrape out the core with a knife as you cut them up , but that is so yesterday . This gadget works like a charm . It even makes it easier to peel the apple , after the core is removed and no stem is in the way . It works best if you twist it in , rather than simply push it in . With a little twist , I prepped 2 really jumbo apples in no time flat .
4 #### I really liked this spatula , the Tomato color made it easy to find in my kitchen utensil drawer . It was a sturdy scraper for getting all the thick sticky cookie dough out of bowls , and I liked the feel of the handle in my hand . I said " was " , as after a year of frequent use the spatula head came off . I could n't use it after that , the spatula tip just would n't stay on , so it went to Kitchen Utensil heaven . * cries * Perhaps it 's because I washed it in the dishwasher ? It 's possible , but I really want a spatula that can be put in the dishwasher . It would seem I 'm not the only one this has happened to , so OXO Good Grips needs to use space glue to make sure those spatula heads do n't come off .
5 #### Pro 's : I keep this on my front deck to store shoes in . It looks much nicer than the exact same thing in the brown color . It has more than adequate storage . It seems sturdy . Con 's : Has a slightly warped look to it . I own two of these . This one , and the dark brown one .
4 #### Weber makes great grills and this one is no different .. My only complaint is .. its suppose to be portable , and it is but , do to the configuration of locking it closed , all has to be totally cool before locking up to move with it ..
4 #### Brushes came packed in a cardboard box rather than a plastic bag . I used one brush the day after I received them and it worked fine . When i was done with it I had no problem throwing it away rather than going through the exercise of cleaning it with mineral spirits which , in time , breaks down foam brushes anyway .
5 #### I was going to purchase this fan on Amazon , but saw it tonight in home depot for $ 16.79 . I do n't yet have an ac and the heat in our small Florida efficiency has been unbearable . I rigged this fan up in front of my bedroom window and .... Eureka! ... relief at last ! I have it set up facing my vornado fan ( Which arrived from Amazon just today ) and the nice cross -breeze is unbelievable . For a small , cheap fan , the output is pretty impressive . I have purchased this same fan a few times over the past several years(gave a few away and left two behind in a move)and had them for at least 3 - 4 years with no issues whatsoever . It 's noisy on the medium and high settings but still an okay trade - off as my comfort level has gone up a few notches . All of this for only $ 17.00 . I 'm very happy with this fan !
5 #### Lost my prior Stanley at a job site . I was using that for Year 's my dad bought me the FatMax . I was bummed out , so I got another , I"m very pleased to have SFM back
5 #### My purpose in ordering it was to pit Cherry Tomatoes but , as has been mentioned by others , one keeps discovering uses for it that you had n't thought off . The rim on both ends is sharp enough to easily cut through the flesh of both vegetables and fruit which is a plus . It has a firm grip , heavy enough to allow one to feel they 're in control but not so heavy as to make it cumbersome to use . I 'd order one even if on the moment I had no particular use for it . Eventually you will and you 'll be glad you had it on hand .
5 #### This worked fine - it is a gold pull chain with a white ball / handle on the end . Met my expectations , and also came with the small connector required to connect it to an existing ceiling fan or universal chain .
5 #### Was a gift and for me . She loved it . I have n't used mine yet , but it looks like it 's good quality .
5 #### These Estwings remind you of how tools used to be made : solid , good quality , made to last .
5 #### These are quite short but I prefer that since they do not feel as unwieldly as some I 've used . Also the spring action does n't feel like you 're trying to hang on to it . I do n't need a huge lobster claw protruding from my hand . The locking action is well set and it releases in a smooth motion with a tap on the counter . I especially appreciate the fact that the jaws line up with each other so I can grip food without struggling .
5 #### These are the first ( and , so far , only ) parts to go on our hummers ' most popular , old feeder . I hated to buy a whole new feeder just because the bees had shredded these little plastic cages over the years , so I was thrilled to see them sold separately on Amazon . I also find that little black spots , which I 'm assuming to be mold , develop on these which I ca n't completely clean off , so now that I know where to get them , I can treat the birds to new ones every Spring .
1 #### This style knife is useless buy the blades that do n't have jagged edges
2 #### The build quality of this unit is very good , however the design leaves a bit to be desired . There are a number of negatives and annoyances which leave me wishing I had bought one of the other brands . There 's no dust collection port . That seems silly , and I kick myself for not having noticed that before buying it . I thought something this expensive should have that basic feature . You ca n't open the saw cabinet once this is installed . Being that this is made by Delta , you 'd think they would have noticed that problem and prevented it . No provision for the switch cabling . They give you a place to mount the switch in a convenient location , but no good way to route the wires . I drilled the tube myself and ran them through . The add - on " kit " to use this with a Biesemeyer fence is just a flat piece of metal , and it 's too soft / thin so it flexes and fails to support everything properly . The price is ludicrous for what you get . You 're much better off buying a piece of angle iron and drilling it yourself . Overall , for the expensive price of this , I expected much more . The Biesemeyer guard is much better designed and has dust collection . It may not have the remote switch , but I 'd rather have DC and be able to open my saw cabinet . I 'd take any of the others instead of this one .
1 #### Mice apparently do not like the cold clammy metal on their itty bitty feet . Never would go inside . So it was a waste of money . I would not recommend this trap .
1 #### Lasted a little over a year and connectors came loose from hose rendering them useless .
5 #### We love it , hummingbirds come right to the window to drink .
5 #### I love this little machine . Powerful suction . Lightweight . So easy on the back ! But the floor attachment is a bust , as far as I 'm concerned . Anyone got any suggestions as to what would be the best floor attachment , or what works best for you ?
5 #### Awesome product . Time to buy the drill bits that fit this .
5 #### Bosch makes great products . I have the cordless tool set which is awesome ! This compliments my jigsaw . These blades last a long time and cut very well . They were great for cutting laminate counter tops . They did n't rip or cause any damage .
5 #### Makes it so easy to get zest required in recipes . Actually a child could use it .
2 #### Does n't melt ice in really cold weather , like -20 . :(
4 #### I 'm a big fan of OXO products , and they 've become one of my go to companies for small kitchen tools . Thsi whisk , like a traditional non coated balloon whisk I have from the company , is a great tool , witht he added benefit of silicone coating , which protects it from scratching non stick surfaces . After a few months of use , I 've noticed no issues with the coating .
3 #### Wish it was not lacquered and just nude wood . The handles are stuck . Should have gotten a custom made one for the same price .
1 #### Do NOT buy the " VersaPak Silver " . These are advertised as having no " memory effect " but that is blatantly false . These are nickel cadmium batteries , the old type of rechargeable . " No memory effect " is a term used specifically to differentiate newer batteries , such as nickel metal hydride [ NiMH ] and lithium ion from the older nickel cadmium ( NiCd ) types . In fact , these ARE the batteries with " memory effect " . Because of this effect , " VersaPak Silver " batteries will quickly lose their ability to hold a charge after your Dustbuster or other tool is plugged in continuously . Instead , save yourself the trouble and spend the extra few dollars to buy " VersaPak Gold " batteries which are NiMH and DON'T have the bad memory effect . You can leave a Dustbuster with the gold batteries plugged in continuously without having a real impact on battery life . Remember to recycle your " VersaPak Silver " batteries because they contain toxic cadmium .
5 #### Used as part of an earth box mix recipe . We have few earthworms in the sandy FL soil , so this was a great buy !
1 #### Horrible stench like decomposing fish , and within a week maggots were all over it . Would not purchase again .
5 #### High quality , easy to adjust spray pattern , fits on the orbit sprinkler spike . Max height on spray is around 3 feet if you need to spray under small trees . Max distance is variable from pressure , I 'm near a water tower , full pressure gets around 35 feet out , lower pressure sometimes has trouble getting the mechanism to work but once it does , the minimum distance is between 15 and 20 feet .
5 #### This Danner PM1000 is a great low profile filter for my 125 gallons pond . Attached it to 5 Watt Solar Powered Water Fountain Pump , this is what I was looking for especially price wise . Have to make modification on the hookup between the solar pump and the filter , but works great .
4 #### Very good for those that do n't or ca n't take out their AC 's for the winter months . I bought this for my 24,000 BTU AC that is a massive pain to take in and out . You definitely do n't want to just rely on the somewhat flimsy strap and clip that comes with it though . It would not stay on the AC during a very windy storm . But if you use duct tape or bungee cords around it , it will definitely stay on . It 's pretty thick too , and it 's doing a great job keeping air out of the house and also helps keep the unit reasonably dry . If you use this on the outside and then use the shrink wrap plastic kits from 3 M on the inside , you 'll be in great shape to keep the cold air out during the winter months .
4 #### This is a great addition to my kitchen . It works great and easy to operate also saves so much time cooking the same meal . I first purchased 16 - qt cooker / canner then purchased this one and a 6 - qt also . Now I use all 3 cookers for everything . I am very happy about " stainless steel " because I can use dishwasher without worrying about discoloration ( they only make 16 - qt cooker in aluminum so I have to hand wash it ) . This is a well - made , top of the line product for such a great price . Only issue that I have is occasionally I have to exchange the screws ( holding the handles on the lid ) since they rust after a while . Other than that , I am very satisfied with this purchase and strongly recommend to others .
4 #### Had a cheap salad dryer for years , but was always bothered by the chemicals in the plastic . This brand makes their products safely , so I decided to switch . It does the job but it does n't get the lettuce as dry as my old one , but I wo n't return it because I believe there 's real value in the chemical - free aspect of this product ( and a little water on the leaves never hurt anyone ) . Also , the big bowl in my old one had holes so the water dripped down into the sink when I spun it ; whereas this one ( and most newer ones ) have no holes in the big plastic bowl so you can spin on the countertop ( though it means that if you flush water over the lettuce in the green basket , and it 's inside the big bowl , the big bowl will fill up w/ water and you have to dump it before you spin ( otherwise the lettuce is spinning in the pool of water ) .
5 #### This is Redneck Entertainment at it best . A cold beer , B - B - Q on the patio with friends and just add some flying insects to complete the evening . This will knock yellow jackets out to the air and will give you new respect from anyone who does n't believe your warning , " it 's got a BIG PUNCH " , once they try it on themselves . Good cheap hometime fun ... !
5 #### it does not lie when it says " good grips " . Kind of wish it had a hole for hanging . Sturdy and high quality all around !
3 #### The Nitrogen test does n't work at all for me , and that 's what I really needed . It showed " Depleted " ( aka no nitrogen reaction ) . I thought that was odd since I heavily fertilized last fall and now my lawn was the greenest in the neighborhood . But I trusted it and fertilized with a high rate of 34 - 0 - 0 . Two weeks ( and 2.3 " rain ) later I tested again and it showed " Depleted " . ? ? Now I lost trust and added some of my 34 - 0 - 0 pellets to the soil solution and let them dissolve . I tested again and still no Nitrogen ! I attached those pictures . What gives ? Perhaps it 's because of the color of my soil . You will see in the pictures that even after I followed the directions and let my solution set 24 hours , yes 24 painful hours of muddy water in the kitchen , even then the water was very brown . Maybe the tester fails to produce a strong enough color change to read . Edit : I emailed LusterLeaf and they think it might take more time for Nitrites to convert to Nitrates . They also say I should wait longer than 24 hours and see if the water clears up .
4 #### nice solid maple board with all the normal pastry lines . great for slicing dinner one one side and rolling out dessert on the other .
5 #### Great for my Dremel . I am using this to help grind the rough edges off my stained glass window . works great !
5 #### If you core and slice a lot of apples this is for you . I have n't found an apple that was too big for this corer , and it works like magic . No problems ;
2 #### I am stripping paint off concrete floors with a&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Norton - Non - Woven - Depressed - Center - Rapid - Strip - Discs-4 - 1 - 2 - Diameter-5 - 8 - 11 - Arbor - Hub - Grit - Coarse - Pack - of-1 / dp / B00755XY2Y / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Norton Non - Woven Depressed Center Rapid Strip Discs , 4 - 1/2 " Diameter , 5/8"-11 Arbor Hub , Grit Coarse ( Pack of 1)</a > .

This grinder was highly rated so I bought it . Unfortunately it bogs down constantly when I use it and is essentially worthless for any heavy duty grinding tasks . It might be great if you need a light - duty variable speed grinder but otherwise it 's a waste of money ; might as well just buy a cordless . Bosch does n't seem to make any 5 " grinders over 10 amps . Also I found the switch to be inconveniently located and annoying to use .
5 #### Used this to replace the charcoal bowl in my new ' Char - Broil 14201876 Vertical 365 Charcoal Smoker ' . The handles are the perfect width to slide onto the original charcoal rack rails with zero modification . Now the coals receive an even amount of air and do n't snuff themselves ... plus I can give this basket a quick shake to drop any built up ash and let the coals keep burning steadily . I also tried the Weber brand version of this basket , but the slit - style holes in that model were not as good for airflow as this Mr. BarBQ basket . The weber works well for shrimp on top of the grill , however . I never actually used this basket on the grill , but it is sturdy , reasonably sized and made of decent stainless steel , so it should function at least as well over the fire as it does under the fire .
1 #### These prewound spools from Toro are bad . You are better off buying line and respooling it yourself . Actually , you are better off not buying a Toro trimmer . The line is wound poorly and does not unwind smoothly . The line gets caught up and you have to take apart your trimmer to get it released . Also , there are nicks in the line , so that the line breaks inside the spool . Because of both of these problems , the bump and feed on the trimmer rarely works . But , they whole bump and feed system on the Toro trimmers is one big design flaw .
5 #### As many folks out there , including Anthony Bourdain I too was scared of pressure cookers . After I purchased this my first one I made sure to study the entire manual , as if for a school test . The rocker type is really totally harmless ! Cooking times are slashed by at least two thirds , less gas and therefor less escaped heat and better inefficiency make this cooking method a winner . Cleanup is also very quick . The heavy base and material compound allows for some nice browning of meat , which is essential for good flavor . Anne Burrell always says:"Brown Food tastes Good " .
5 #### Graphic 45 is all we need to say ! Beautiful stickers that go with the Place in Time papers from Graphic 45 .
5 #### Great splitting axe , well balanced , nice grip , sharp . Everything I wanted .
5 #### excellent feel of the knife and serrated blade is sharp .
5 #### I 'm starting to love OXO Good Grip items .. I have now ordered other items by them because how much i liked it .. The price is alittle more but its a great quality that will last a very long time
5 #### Great book , very colorful , gives ideas for every occasion . Gives great instructions on how to make the different shaped cake pops .
5 #### I already have one of these but I love it so much that I got another one ! I bought one for my mother and my sister and everyone that has ever used it at my house LOVES IT ! It is SO SMOOTH . It 's perfect for peeling potatoes , carrots , apples ... pretty much anything . If you do n't have one of these , get one !
5 #### For the price , this mobile base works extremely well . I assembled it in about 20 minutes and installed it under a Wilton 4200A 6x48 " Belt Sander / 12 " Disc grinder . It rolls around with ease and has very good stability . The stability is n't quite as good as the machine sitting on the ground , but it 's darn close . I plan to buy more of these HTC 2000 bases for other equipment in my shop . The foot pedals operate easily as well . Overall it 's a very simple but effective design .
5 #### WAYYYYY better than most I 've tried . Made in Italy not china , taiwan , korea etc . Thousands of cuts and still razor sharp , leaving nice clean flush cut edges . Definitely worth the price
5 #### If you want to remove lots of nails from say a deck , this is your go to tool . Works really well , massive timesaver
5 #### I put this on my back patio 2 years ago and it is still going strong on the same battery . It looks and works great .
5 #### Much to my surprise it worked ! Very skeptical at first purchasing such a pricey gizmo . Wanted a humane way of getting rid of my unwanted house guests . Just 2 for now . Years ago they visited and I caught them with a cube trap that worked very well but did not have the heart to terminate them so I released them at a state park . I am sure they are doing well there . The Zapper did what it claimed ! Save me from terminateing them and no suffering for them .
5 #### In my review of the 2 " pulley , I stated that the key slot was undersized . In this pulley , the key slot was exactly 3/16 " as it is supposed to be . Unfortunately , the key I was using was oversized , so I had to file the key again . Cosmetically , this pulley is designed to have a counterweight for the extra metal required for the set screw , my old one had a larger / heavier ring around the shaft to act as the counterweight . This is just a design difference and does not affect the operation of the pulley . I am satisfied with this pulley .
5 #### I know others have written that the instructions are incorrect but this must have been fixed because they looked correct to me and resulted in a sharp chain . I 'm no expert , but this is a fairly easy to use tool that gets the job done and with a battery Dremel like mine it can be accomplished where ever you are . You just have to make sure it does n't do to good of a job and take off to much . I Highly Recommend this sharpener especially if you need to do quick in the field work .
3 #### does not fit saw but I used a clamp & make it work .. It 's not perfect but it keep saw dust to a limit amount , instead of no bag at all . Works for the small job i need .
4 #### Not the most powerful vac I 've used but fine it 's what you get with the price
4 #### Purchased to replace lights on an odd Hampton Bay ceiling fan . Took a chance going by the visual and power specs . They fit like a charm !
4 #### My grandfather used to say that if God had made 9 " Kleins first , it would 've only taken him four days to finish the world . Klein makes a tough , versatile set of lineman pliers .
2 #### After 2 years of regular use , the orange plastic in the hinge and gear crumbled and the tool fell apart .
5 #### great product , works , is accurate etc .... can be seen from a distance .
3 #### when not in use they are in the way and have to be removed
5 #### Great little lite has a strong clamp and the 2 settings of brightness is very good , I only need the low setting to read .
5 #### Use this next to the door on my side porch . Great place to set your groceries while unlocking the door . I use the other one in the yard under my awning to sit on and it holds my gardening hand tools .
5 #### These measuring spoons from OXO , just like their measuring cups , are sturdy , easy to clean and are secure on their clip which makes finding them in a dark cupboard or drawer easier .
5 #### Works well and the supplied adapters let you connect to any bigger shop vac .
5 #### Easy to connect the wire ( I used 12 gauge ) and popped right in my breaker panel . I crossed the wires to make sure it would trip ( which I do n't recommend you do ) and it tripped like it was supposed to . Could n't ask for more .
3 #### We still get SO many mosquitos in our patio area . I"m not sure what is going on that it ca n't keep this small area safe for those critters .
2 #### After jamming a scrap of wood between the blade and the table of my arbor saw and radial arm saw for years I ordered the Bench Dog to get to the free shipping cutoff . Using this to take off the radial arm saw blade for cleaning was EASY . I put it under the blade , lowered the radial arm saw blade into it without exerting much pressure , and took the arbor nut right off . This tool probably saved me 5 minutes . Considering I 've installed and reinstalled blades after sharpening ( the days when this was normal ) , and installed new blades to replace old ones ( today 's normal ) perhaps 100 times ( not counting Dado blades ) this tool could have saved me perhaps 8 or 9 hours of time over 30 years taking off blades and another 8 or 9 hours putting them back on . It 's worth the cost . UPDATE - It works great until the inside of the tool shreds off and the it 's throw away time . I would not buy another .
5 #### Such a quirky little plant , just had to have a set for my meditation altar . They 're pretty much a meditation in and of themselves lol . Love them !
5 #### I am very pleased with my battery I recently purchased . We had moved to another state and the original battery was broken . I could n't find a replacement anywhere and then thought of checking on Amazon . I found it , ordered it and it was delivered right away and I was able to trim my hedges . Great service and I would recommend trying out Amazon every time when you can locate it locally . I 'm a happy consumer !
3 #### got this for a fungus gnat problem it worked so / so i still have gnats flying around but at least not as many ...
5 #### Another great Organic product that sprouts beautifully and lasts a nice amount of time after harvesting . Thank you . I will purchase more from this company anytime I need them , as well as their other organic items .
5 #### Comes apart to use separately , folds together in compact fashion , Anything OXO is well thought out , quality and practical . Oh I forgot affordable FYI I do not have shares in the company but I would certainly invest in it - good reliable anything they make
3 #### After receiving my first level with a missing endcap , they quickly sent a replacement having the same problem . Otherwise the level is OK for my needs . Guess I 'll just substitute the cap with some electrical tape to cover the sharp edge .
5 #### I have been using this type of Peeler for over 10 years and I find it very useful . I keep ordering them because I give it as a gift to my children / grandchildren or relatives who does not have this kind of peeler .
4 #### Love these but they are not quite as large as they look . Plants rapidly outgrew them .
5 #### great product , hope it lasts as long as the last one ( maybe 10 years before the UV cracks started to make it impossible to use )
5 #### I water from a lake and had problems keeping the smaller ( 1/2 " ) version from clogging even though I have a filter on the intake . This one works great and has never clogged . You do need to ensure that your have plenty of pressure ( 60 + ) on your pump or you 'll have problems moving the sprinkler . I 'm only using one sprinkler so my options for set up were limited . I found a good stand to mount it on though .
5 #### The XtraFlex2 LED book light is light years ( no pun intended ) better than the old itty - bitty - type lights that used incandescent bulbs . The XtraFlex2 gets great battery life , unlike the the itty - bittys , which I found went through batteries like crazy . Of course , the LED " bulbs " do n't burn out like the itty - bitty blubs ( and the XtraFlex2 does n't heat up from its bulbs , either ) . The XtraFlex2 's integrated battery pack is also great ; no getting tangled up in a cord while you 're in bed . I stumbled on the XtraFlex2 at my local Borders . They had a bunch of them in a display when the final Harry Potter book was published ( presumably figuring that a lot of kids , little and big , were going to be doing a lot of reading in bed ... ) . The leftovers were sold at half price , a real bargain . I bought one , tried it out , loved it , and went back to buy several more for use as gifts ( and spares ) . Available in colors other than blue;&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mighty - Bright - XtraFlex2 - Light - Black / dp / B000TXZIDM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 Light - Black</a>,<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Xtra - Flex-2 - LED - Book - Light - Silver / dp / B000OOSDTW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Xtra Flex 2 LED Book Light , Silver</a>,<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mighty - Bright - XtraFlex2 - Book - Craft - Clip - On - Light - Green / dp / B0013AK9ES / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 Book / Craft / Clip - On Light , Green</a>,<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mighty - Bright - XtraFlex2 - Book - Craft - Clip - On - Light - Pink / dp / B0013AG9QK / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 Book / Craft / Clip - On Light , Pink</a > , and&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mighty - Bright - XtraFlex2 - Dual - Book - Craft - Clip - On - Light - Purple / dp / B0013AM3TC / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 Dual Book / Craft / Clip - On Light , Purple</a > .
4 #### I m a carpenter and has saved me so much time . The green dote is easy to see in the daylight . The do e falls are the soft case it comes with . With the laser you also get two mounting brackets , one L bracket with magnets to put on metal studs or steel columns . The other bracket is to lift it off the floor . The case only has room for the L bracket . Which does nt make since .
5 #### Exactly what I was looking for . Makes changing from drill bit to screwdriver bit a snap .
5 #### I was actually shocked at how little effort I had to use to go through copper wire as thick as my index finger . There was virtually no resistance to my squeeze .
5 #### The screw that holds the chuck on is generally left - hand thread ( so it 's righty - loosey ) . My DeWalt had a Torx T-20 head . Remove this screw through the center of the chuck . Then tighten the chuck jaws onto the short end of a 1/4 " ( or so ) Allen ( hex ) wrench . The chuck itself is threaded on to the drill with a normal right hand thread ( lefty - loosey ) . So hold the drill body , and using a rubber or wooden mallet , strike the long side of the hex key counter - clockwise to start to break the chuck free . Once started , it should easily unscrew .
5 #### Best value for the home shop . I ca n't believe this drill cost only a few more bucks than my cordless , and came with a free mortising attachment and fence . Set up was a breeze and took less than 40 minutes . The Delta has some features that make a difference - The extra 7/8 " of quill travel , quick release depth stop , and the quill lock . Fit and finish are top drawer . The Delta has the capacity of the top dollar machines without the price tag . Do n't settle for a bench top , get this Delta and you wo n't regret it .
5 #### Since you only know if a fire extinguisher works when there 's a fire . But a model made by the same company lasted 20 years when we tested it this year .
5 #### Love the traveling spinkler . The John Deere is even more special since I am a farm kid and it is color coded to my white and green house .
5 #### I have the Dremel model 395 ( Type 5 ) . I do n't use it a lot , but it comes in very handy when it 's needed . I just want to add my opinion that having both this item ( 4485 Quick Change ) and the 4486 Keyless Chuck is , in my experience , a great idea . Both can be had for around $ 15 . The four collets included with the Quick Change give the confidence of a snug and secure fit for a longer task , while the Keyless Chuck is very handy for a less demanding application . The Keyless Chuck is secure , but the Quick Change Kit offers an exact fit and the added confidence that goes along with that . I would suggest you , occasionally , pause to make sure both are tight when using either item . I ca n't think - for the combined price - of any reason not to have both in your Dremel case . My son and two friends have newer model Dremel tools . Both of these items fit these newer models ( 4000 , and one of the 300 series ) .
5 #### This little gadget is my hero . My apartment bldg does n't have a faucet in the backyard so I have to run my hose out my kitchen sink to fill the pool . I live on the top floor . Neither my boyfriend nor my brother could figure it out and thought that it just did n't " fit " my kitchen faucet to connect my hose . My brother was preparing to go to the hardware store to find something else . In their defense , it came with no instructions or picture . I looked at it for 45 seconds , turned the piece around and inserted the narrower piece into my kitchen faucet . One snap later , voila , it worked ! Girl power ! This adapter saved my bbq gathering and the kiddies got to play in the pool .
4 #### only had these 2 days and have n't used them a lot but they seem good . Solid , Simple , Sturdy . Unlike some whimpy brands I tried and abandoned . I clipped some heavy grass today and these went right thru it as long as I did n't try to take too big a bite . I held back one star as I ca n't speak to durability but I have very high hopes for them - not much could go wrong with such a simple tool . Just need to keep them clean , oiled and sharp .
5 #### I bought this to go with my Kreg jig . It worked great . The Kreg jig comes with the square head bit . I hate those , I quickly purchased this Phillips head bit . Works great .
5 #### Perfect my little humming bird feeders . I like to know that I am providing healthy and clean feeders for these beautiful creatures .
5 #### Great ! I bought it twice , one as a gift and one for myself . It 's always good to use .
5 #### money well spent better than chicken wire very eye appealing i m sure this will keep out all that want to get to the chickens
5 #### Great accessory package . Keeps it steady from rolling and different lenses .
5 #### Perfect degree of offset , well - made . Flexible enough but not floppy . Easy to clean . A real necessity for icing a cake .
5 #### I also have a Traeger PTG . Great pair of grills along with the portability . Best of all worlds . WooHoo ...... !
5 #### As the name suggests , this pizza wheel does have a good grip , nice and comfortable . It cuts pizza ( and everything else really ) very effectively . For anyone who does n't have a dishwasher , it is also very easy to hand wash . There is not much else to say : it performs a simple task and does so very , very well .
5 #### Real easy to work with and no stink . It mixes in quick and my plants are happy campers . Life is good .
4 #### I wanted a quiche pan with a removable bottom to make a few tarts and quiches . this works great . the bottom came loose when the quiche was done and make cutting and eating easy
5 #### My wife wanted one to strain quinoa and this one works great ! Well made and seems durable . Highly recommended for use with quinoa !
4 #### Clear instructions for attaching handles although it is pretty self - explanatory ; lighter wt . than my previous aluminum cooker but I consider that a plus - lid seals well , no complaints . A good price for an 8 - Qt . cooker .
4 #### For a $ 1 product , it does the job . I love a particular brand of loose leaf tea .... well , actually , I like the jasmine green tea that summit makes , so it 's a lot more specific than that . But anyway , I got this because it was cheap and I needed something to seep the tea in and I did n't have a lot of money to throw around ( and the tea 's kind of expensive ) . So I got this . And in the beginning , I think it worked absolutely perfectly . After a few months , some larger pieces started escaping , but I actually do n't mind that . The overwhelming majority of the tea stays put and it actually has been working better , ironically , than the $ 10 tea strainer thing that my sister got me for Christmas ... so yeah ...
5 #### This tool is a must have ... it works better that thought it would . I am sad the job is over , it was fun to use .
4 #### always like These chains . You have to understand that you need to remove < clean . and sharpen before the blade dulls bad or blackens in order to get the most of of them
5 #### Easy to handle . The grips are well designed and sized . The tongs close and lock to reduce their size in storage . The mechanism works well . Very pleased . Easy to clean . No need for coating .
5 #### Perfect little vacuum for a small apartment . Good suction power and the bags have plenty of space
5 #### Super spinner ! Easier to use that the pull - string kind , and should last longer , too .
5 #### It is clean looking and such a cleanup breeze . Love stainless anyway but this rest looks great and does just what it should do .
5 #### Installed it late July this year and it still looks as new as it did out of the package . By the way it has retained its original finish I seem confident it will continue to do so in the future , but time will tell .
4 #### Does n't collapse in the middle under the weight of my large cakes , which was my main concern about such a large rack with no center support .
5 #### I have a small 14 ' x 24 ' grassy area in my desert landscape in AZ . The dirt gets compacted and hard . This little tool is just the thing to keep my grassy area looking top notch . It is n't difficult to use . Just step on it and pull out the plugs . It did clog a couple of times but the clog was easily removed with a dowel rod . In about 2 wks I started noticing a big difference in the color and thickness of my grass . The aerator is a manual tool so it does involve some effort to use . It requires more energy than sitting on the sofa watching TV ! It took about an hr and a half to do my lawn . I love the little tool . It is heavy duty , just the right size and easy to hang out of the way in my garage . Thanks Hound Dog for a simple answer to my little problem.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Hound - Dog - Products - HDP3 - 8 - Turf - Hound - Aerator / dp / B00023S156 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Hound Dog Products HDP3 - 8 Turf Hound Aerator</a >
3 #### the cloth lasted only one summer , because its always in the sun . but we ended up using pond liner the next year its a bit more price , but it really holds up to the ware and tare of the sun and the water .
4 #### This may not be the best ice melter on the market , but it 's the best one I 've found that my dog can safely walk on . It melts well enough , and it gives me piece of mind that it will not burn my dog 's paws . I have purchased before and will continue to do so .
5 #### Yay Gardening season is here :) Has a nice safety cap Also , Great for relieving rectal itch ... WOOF :p
2 #### Pic is a complete fraud ! It 's raw unfinished pieces loosely tied together . Falls apart easily . Pic color is deceptive advertising
3 #### Not as good as I had hoped it would be . Using it to remove the cores on Granny Smith apples does n't work nearly as well as I thought it would . You still need to clean up the cores after cutting the apple up . I was hoping it would make cutting the apples easier / faster , but it does n't improve anything for me . I 'm better off cutting them up and using a knife to remove the core sections from each wedge .
4 #### And it wo n't damage your pans . This whisk is short ( about 6 " , not including the handle ) and fat ( 3 " at widest point ) , with only 4 loops , so do n't throw out your old stand by just yet - but 99 % of the time , this one will work perfectly . Dishwasher safe , or incredibly easy to clean by hand ( since the loops are mush - able ) .
4 #### This is a good product ! there is trick to putting the plastic cover on so that it does not vibrate . oh and yes you can put LED light bulbs in this unit they work just fine .
5 #### It 's works great for 2 people and much lighter than the bigger ones
1 #### ordered this gasket to replace my old floppy worn out one . This was ordered to replace M-0406,but wo n't fit my canner . If your canner is older ( mine was 1972 ) , you will need # 3440 . Frustrated because this item ca n't be returned and I have to order again !
5 #### Nice thing about this tool is it is self contained . Hammer and jaws are on one tool . No need to find a hammer to make it work . It is a little hard to get the hang of . After about 20 nails you will be an expert . It will dig out any size nail even if it is sunk below the wood . Does a little bit of damage to the wood . Down sid is that it is easy to damage plywood . One tip : If there is room , slide the hammer out as far as it will go before prying . It increases the mechanical advantage for prying by about 2 . For some reason it was not the most natural motion , for me at least . The one I have is many years old and actually has hardened removable jaws . The still look like new .
5 #### I love this little utensil . The handle is sturdy and the two sized scoops are very useful for different tasks . I use it to drain or scoop out any small items , such as capers or olives . I like the idea of using it for meatballs or even balling up the crumb for crumb cake . It 's a versatile tool not only to create melon balls .
4 #### Very nice , heavy duty trimmers . They 're metal construction . Feel really strong and solid . Ca n't beat the price
5 #### Wish I had bought this earlier as it 's an excellent quality blade . I could tell before installing it that it was worlds better than my previous one . Worth every penny .
5 #### fantastic . its so hard to assemble but so beautiful when you get done .
5 #### Had occasion to immediately put the corer to work , and it performed fine . Easy slices were cut and released , as well as the core . Washed up in the dishwasher top shelf . Good purchase . Only complaint is it is not drawer friendly , as the wings are realy out there . But then , that 's what makes it do it 's thing .
5 #### Spins easily , drains well and it doubles for holding the lettuce in over night after spinning . Sturdy made and is actually nice enough to pop on the table for dinner .
3 #### The product is exactly as described , but my dogs refuse to walk on it which is why I purchased it in the first place . But that has nothing to do with the quality of the product .
4 #### I like this ... Makes good french fries .. The interchangeable slicers .. I find it easy to clean .. No rust as of yet
4 #### I m a pc / electronic tech . and been using traditional soldering iron for a couple of years and been looking for a smaller iron and finally found this tool . Pros : -its small , light just like a pencil -easy to navigate since it just like a pencil Cons : -I noticed that the tip / point is not replaceable so far its good in making small electronic project , not recommended using it to unsolder component in a large circuit eg . LCDTV boards , pc boards .
5 #### I have now purchased 3 of these stands and have found the excellent for providing a base for power tools . I am using the for saws and a drill press . They come with a hole patterns for Delta tools but it is quite simple to drill additional holes as required . I added lockwashers to all the leg bolts during assembly which I believe is something Delta should consider supplying . All in all an excellent product .
5 #### Work great ! Use them often . Would buy again I think that says it all ? Purchased others and these are well made center easily .
5 #### Opens and closes the door like it should . Linking to the 10 year old opener was easy and according to the directions .
5 #### Works Great . Uses batteries have caught three mice in my garage in 3 days . I put the batteries in put bread at the back turn it on place where mice run . It blinks once then blinks rapidly when you have a mouse . So far I have only gotten mice . Either I do n't have any rats or its set off too fast with mice .
3 #### This is a well thought out design , not perfect but for the price it 's a bargain . The cap is attached to the handle so there is no problem with trying to find the missing whistle cap , it 's always right there . Refilling the kettle is not so easy , holding by the handle and tipping back so the lid is open is a bit of a balancing trick and the bigger lid is hard to get on and off - it , by necessity , fits tightly ( otherwise the whistle wo n't work ) . The handle , even though rubber coated can get too hot to hold without some hand protection . Not perfect , but decent and decently priced .
5 #### These cut through metal duct like butter ; probably because they are made in the good ole USA . Also you can get these for a bit cheaper at home depot
5 #### Let you guys know how good ( or bad ) they are when the first one burns , should take a while to blow ! .
5 #### Made in America . I do n't understand why more simple tools ca n't be made here and sold at reasonable prices like this . Johnson tools has a reputation for making quality tools , and this is on par with that . It is a handy tool that you will be glad to have .
5 #### This corer works pretty good , takes the core out very well . Sure saves pain in your hands and losing a lot of product by trying to remove core with a knife . Cuts into the core a lot better than I thought it would . Linda
4 #### I have used Stanley tools forever . Still very good , but feel like quality is down a little . Tape measure I had for only a few years bent and broke . Warranty replacement not worth the hassle .
4 #### We have had a very wet summer here in Georgia and the bugs have been horrible . This was a great price for what you get and does the job .
5 #### Excellent product . Size- good Construction- sturdy yet simple All dishwasher safe ? Awesome . Excellent Product !
4 #### Fine chain ... cutters on every other link . I was shocked to find that the Poulan 16 - Inch Chain # 952051211 I ordered from Amazon on the same day has cutters on every third link .
5 #### Works great , keeps the screw in line while it is starting . Screw head has to be small enough to fit inside sleve .
5 #### We used this to create an aviary for our chickens so they could be worry - free from hawks and other aerial predators . It is thin enough that it is essentially invisible unless you are looking for it or right next to it but it has been working like a charm . Love this stuff and would n't hesitate to recommend for this purpose !
5 #### This contain only one chain . However , Poulan 18 " 2 - pack Chainsaw Chain is avialable at Walmart.com for $ 24.47 . Walmart sells the single chain that you 're looking at for $ 16.97 . But Walmart charges an arm and a leg for home dilvery . Store pickup is free , but you pay sales tax at Walmart.com because they have stores in every state . I do n't like to go to Walmart in December . I go through lots of chain . I clear brush and cut firewood , which means , no matter how careful I am , the chain occasionally goes in the dirt . Chain has become almost a disposable item for me .
5 #### I purchased one of these and was so pleased , I bought three more . I replaced all my exterior doors with these and the matching Schlage B60N622 Deadbolt . The knob is solid , quiet , and turns very smoothly . Good purchase .
5 #### Once this handle arrived , in a matter of seconds I had it installed on my new rake / hoe , and was able to use it immediately with no back pain . It 's sturdy and comfortable to use . I highly recommend this product ! Shipping was fast . Would recommend to everyone !
4 #### Heavier container than I was expecting . But good suction , a color I thought I 'd mind but I do n't , easy to assemble , stores easily , and does the job for a small apartment .
5 #### Works as advertised , has enough suction and easy to change bags . The air from the back ( for blowing trash or .. ) is not as good as vacuums from days gone by , but ok .
5 #### This little flashlight is everything we have come to expect from Maglite . While the bulb is n't as bright as I had hoped the obvious fit and finish and overall quality of the unit was expected and received .
5 #### Over the years I 've used a number of similar insect killers , and I find that they work well . They do n't control everything , but they definitely have had an impact on the flying insect population . We have a large second - story deck ( 16 ' x 40 ' ) on the back of our condo and I wanted a solution that would help draw insects away from us . We do n't have a great deal of grounds around us , so I mounted this at one corner under the deck , and it works great . I 'm continually amazed at the quantity of insects it eliminates .
4 #### Item arrived as promised . I had to order this to fit the Freud Router based for using a template set I bought . The router base slot where this piece fits has at leaset 1 mm of slop which means you must have a centering bit and because it is held in with screws if you bump it to hard you can knock it out of aligment . Also the router nor the adapter come with the screws or washers , so you 'll have to go but them . Too much trouble . Ruin 1 bit and the money saved is gone . I like the Freud Router and it was priced right , but after a the template issue and now the router table , I would have purchased another brand router .
1 #### Well ... After 5 FAILED attempts to get an UNDAMAGED outfeed table delivered , i 'm going for number 6 . I should give up , up this item is handy and i cut a lot of plywood . ( i should just give up and build one myself . ) It seems that no one can get the largest table part delivered in one piece . All 5 have arrived damaged in one way or another . The last attempt , direct from Delta , was the worst . The part was shattered in several places , almost beyond recognition . Needless to say , I 'm VERY disappointed .
5 #### Exact replacement for the planer knives for my older 22 - 560 12 1/2 " Delta Planer . They seem cheap but they are the correct ones , do n't be fooled . I recommend keeping a set on hand for that weekend middle - of - project you hit something and mess up your blades . They can be resharpened .
5 #### These are cute and positive . We make little poems to each other .
5 #### This popper was first given to us as a gift and lasted 5 years . It probably would have lasted much longer but I dropped the bowl and the plastic broke . All the mechanics were still working great . We loved the popper so much we bought the exact same model again . We use it several times a week with great success .
5 #### Placed these traps all in the basement and I hear no more crickets ! This worked amazingly well for my problem ! ! !
1 #### not as pictured in the description photo . I 've used this model before and was interested in the one pictured , which had a different texture on the handle . Was sent the smooth style handle . Also , the package is taped sloppily around it 's center , holding the plastic covering and cardboard backing together . Looks like it was returned and re - packaged . It 's pretty dirty inside the plastic , too . I 've seen amazon sending out more returned items lately and it 's a bad practice and will not do anything for customer trust .
5 #### Excellent coverage , good range with decent water pressure and very well made .
5 #### Very heavy duty . I like the way it opens all the way up so you do n't have to fight to get the cables in or out . Pocket on the front looks cool but is useless . I would reccomend this product .
5 #### Just as advertized , perfect for long reach without tape metal bending over ........ I 'd write more but Amazon limits me .
4 #### Good quality reciprocating saw blades . The blades cut well and as expected when you use the right blade for the job . The blades would be even better if they lasted longer .
5 #### The colored measurement makes it very easy for me to read , the black finish is nice also ... this is a good product and I am very happy that I purchased it .
5 #### Bought this as a gift for my Mother who uses it on a regular basis . She says how easy is it is to use and it does a wonderful job . Clean up is fairly simple as a basic rinse and dry is about all it needs , sure some soap of course . How dirty is clean rinsed salad and greens ? I do n't think you can really go wrong with OXO products , yes I 'm glad I purchased this !
5 #### Ok , came in as described , on time in good shape
3 #### Just thought I would give some feedback on the lifespan of the duracord hammock . We live on the Gulf Coast where outdoor furniture is subjected to high heat and humidity , severe sunshine and some salt spray . I purchased this hammock in April 2010 and left it out year - round . Recently ( July 2012 ) two ropes fell apart , several others look frayed and it 's clear that it is not safe to use any more . While this sounds like a negative review , I was quite happy with the hammock for 2 years - it was comfortable , attractive , and put up with use by multiple kids . Just do n't expect it to last forever .
5 #### I realized I have n't replaced my soldering tip in about 30 years , and it 's nearly burnt through . Time for a new one . These are quality tips . My Weller Model : D-550 . 240/325 Watt gun users bent ends inside screw - in fittings , but other reviews say the straight ends on these tips are easy to bend at a right angle . I just have to remember to slip the fittings on first . :-)
5 #### Super easy to setup . Took less than a minute and obvious - no instructions required . I live in Seattle where it literally does rain 24/7 for months on end ... they are holding up nicely in the rain so far ( it 's been a few weeks ) They are easy to read and look good . We have lighting setup all over the yard and power bills were getting big . I just set these up and put it on the dusk / dawn setting ... all 3 that I have setup work flawlessly . Excellent purchase ! Ended up buying an additional one with no hesitation .
5 #### This is the perfect whisk for small jobs . In my opinion a must have in the kitchen . Scramble two eggs no problem .
5 #### LOVE it ! Boy does it ever work ! The bugs , especially mosquitoes , have just been awful this summer here in central Texas and this has rfeally helped .
5 #### Es una herramienta muy bien hecha y duradera no dudara en recomendar este producto . 100 % Recomendado . Es un producto de una calidad superior
5 #### The best money can buy as far as I know . I lost mine , ( see my holster review ) and accidently replaced them with a " look alike " pair at COSTCO . NOT the same . They are copying the packaging and there is a reason . They are the best . Make sure you get real Felco , not the Fakeo !
5 #### Had one of these that lasted over 20 years of intermittent use in my farm shop . When it finally gave up the ghost , I naturally ordered another . I hope this one lasts as long . Good machine .
5 #### My old soldering gun just worn out over the 40 + years of use . It was time to get a new one for projects . This unit gets hot fast for heavy usage .
5 #### I have these installed in my three bath rooms and wash room ( mud room ) . That 's four all toll . Now these fans can be turned on as needed an will eventually turn off by them selves . I recommend these .
3 #### Takes off material quickly handle falls off and hard to clean chips out of .
5 #### This pan is very useful for making quiche ( this is a good use for using up leftover vegetables for an elegant lunch . Just put the broccoli , zucchini , mushrooms , onions , spinach , whatever you have in the quiche batter with some eggs or egg subsititute , evap milk or cream and maybe some cheese . Pour into the crust and bake . Good with salad or soup . ) It 's also great for European style fruit tarts , which are less rich with one crust and filled to the brim with fresh or frozen berries , peaches , apples or even filled after baking with tropical fruits like bananas and kiwi . The false bottom allows you to unload the tart on an elegant serving plate . However , to avoid spills in the oven , simply fill the tart pan on a baking sheet and put the sheet with the tart pan on it into the oven . ( European ovens have a solid rack for cake and tart baking that is removable . Since American ovens have wire racks , substitute loading the tart on a baking sheet instead . )
5 #### Very attractive peeler feels good in the hand and also does a great job ... what more can you ask for .
5 #### I own a large selection of Milwaukee tools and a few Hilti tools . IMO , getting Milwaukee products are like getting Hilti products for a little less money . However , if you work in punishing , demanding conditions everyday , all day , then Hilti may be the way to go for the very long haul . For 90 % , Milwaukee is a good bet
5 #### Made in USA was my primary reason for buying this coupler . I have used them in the past years , but never really paid much attention to where it was made ( foolish ) . Excellent quality , leak free . The best !
5 #### I love it . Simple to use snd clean . Have to cut larger potatoes into smaller pieces , but no big deal .
5 #### Great all around tool that is useful for small and large jobs too .
5 #### Why do I love it so much ? I cook beets . Quite a bit . And this thing is not stained red . How is this possible ? ? It baffles me .
5 #### AAA seller . The hummingbirds love it . I 've tried three different feeders and this is the best . The birds like a nectar of 1 part sugar and 4 parts water the best of all -- better than the prepared mix .
5 #### Works flawlessly controlling our outdoor water fountain over 1 year now .
5 #### The bulbs are perfect ... just WATCH OUT because these 10W bulbs pop up on the page when you search 20W ! ! ! ( Amazon 's fault) ... so I inadvertently ordered them . I could send them back to China and they would issue a refund , but the postage cost would wipe out the difference .
5 #### I love the cake pan . I have made so many pound cakes in this bundt.pan and each time my cakes come out perfect , golden brown .
5 #### I bought this drill 3 years ago to help cut holes in the studs on my living room wall to run HDMI , stereo wire and cat6 . It cut through those boards like butter - even at a terrible angle it works like a charm . Everything about this tool is top of the line - great case , great documentation , great durability . I see the price has n't really gone down so I guess I should be happy about that ! Either way , this is a powerful drill that will really get where you need to go . One thing about the angle - a long bit in tandem with the chuck and the shoulder can make this a bitt difficult to fit in tight places . Works fine for standard spaced studs for example , but anything smaller than that and you 're going to need to choke up on the bit . This can make using larger bits a bit of a challenge . That being said , I could n't be happier with this drill .
5 #### I always have one of these on my hip . I love the size and quality . I have fancier tapes , but this is my favorite .
5 #### I purchased this twine because I regularly stuff chicken breasts with cheese ( asiago is great ) and spinach wrapped in ham . Sometimes the cheese would run out during cooking , so this twine holds everything together . It also dispenses easily from the center of the roll .
4 #### Pretty good , broke it after a year , but it was really cheap what am I to expect ?
3 #### The fan was delivered in a box that looks like it was pulled directly off some store shelf , slapped with a mailing label and tossed in the mail - literally - with no thought taken as to packaging so it did n't surprise me when the fan arrived with two large cracks in the face plate and the bottom pegs snapped off . Amazon was very smooth with the return so I risked having another shipped out . Second fan arrived in much better condition , same bare bones packaging though , except for a tiny crack in the face plate . Not a big deal for a cheap little fan , so I kept the second , just be aware you may face the same problem . I 've had the fan for about two weeks now and so far no complaints with it 's operation .
4 #### I 'd like to give this 5 stars , but I find that for most fasteners , a regular locking wrench works just fine - and , you can use that same wrench for a lot of other things . This is a specialty tool , and for that singular purpose , it does really well - does n't seem to damage the fastener as much . But , it seems that whenever I have to resort to a locking pliers , the fastener is beyond re - use , so damage or not , I just want to remove - it . For that , my other locking pliers work most of the time . It seems the only time I use this , is when I blindly grab and come up with this one .
5 #### I ordered this by mistake but am glad I did . I wanted a solar zapper , but I 'm sure it would not be as good as this one . It 's a great bug zapper , really gets the bugs .
4 #### I bought this model because I have a very small kitchen and simply no room for a larger grill . Also , I mainly cook for just myself and my husband , so the size was fine . This grill does what it says it does , and clean - up is easy if you actually follow the strategies recommended in the instructions ( I learned the hard way ) . Skinless , boneless chicken breasts come out wonderfully on this as long as you 're careful not to overcook . At any rate , it is certainly not the best grill ever , but it is perfectly fine for someone who : 1 ) has a smaller kitchen ; 2 ) cooks mainly just for 1 or 2 people ; 3 ) does n't need to use it every day .
4 #### This is an excellent masher . If you 're doing skin on potatoes it clogs up slightly - but still made short work of a few batches of mashed potatoes ( with and without skin ) & mashing up sweet potatoes for another dish . The one flaw of the design ? It 's short handle . However , it 's not a deal breaker . In fact - the plus - es of this more than made up for it 's sole shortcoming . My old masher ( vertical handle ) was about the same height and had the same issue . There 's only one masher I 've used that I liked as much as this one - but it was literally twice the price ( it 's a Cuisinart model ) . However , I would still choose this one over that other model because there was no hand fatigue with the Oxo . My family loves mashed potatoes and when I make them I make a lot . This was definitely put through some trials for Thanksgiving . I 'm looking forward to using it for Christmas , and for meals in between .
1 #### The blades are sharp and fine , however the holder is useless . It does not hold a veggie and one has to hold it with a bare hand if wants to finish slicing . Quite dangerous and not worth it . I would recommend Borner V - slicer - much better use for your money , this one will serve you for a long time , my Mom has been using it for almost 10 years and still happy . I had to buy Borner as well after I tried Progressive .
5 #### Not sure what else to say other than it works like it is supposed to . Twist the handle and apple in opposite directions and it slices right through . Push out the core with your finger and on to the next one .
5 #### I used it on several projects already , works great . Good price too !
4 #### Works very well and is light in weight . Especially good for women to use or for smaller areas of lawn . Great exercise at the same time . I have to lift it up some steps to put in my store room and have no problem at all with it .
4 #### Overall , I 'm happy with the purchase . Before , when I bought romaine hearts , I would wash them , cut them into bite - sized pieces , wash them in a colander , and then use several towels to dry them before storing in a Tupperware container . After a few days , the salad would get a bit soft and eventually spoil . With this salad spinner , it 's a lot quicker process to clean and dry the leaves AND the lettuce stays crisp and dry for up to a week . The only negative is that the mesh is sized so that shreds of romaine are caught and tightly trapped -- something that never happened with the colander 's round holes . So it 's a real hassle ( and takes a lot of water ) to rinse out afterwards before a new batch of lettuce is processed . Another thing , be sure the size will work for you first . I chose the bigger one for its capacity , but it really takes up a lot of room in the fridge and so much of the dishwasher that I end up having to wash it by hand .
5 #### My daughter gave me the scarecrow years ago and it sat in my garage until a few weeks ago . I am currently replacing her rear yard fence and her idiot neighbor has a dog that started coming into her yard and relieving himself on her grass . Needless to say this women is a real jerk who takes no responsibility for her kids or pets . I remembered having the scarecrow and immediately put it in her rear yard . It has worked flawlessly keeping the little monsters , both canine and human on their own property . Her other neighbors asked me about the motion activated sprinkler , they are also having problems with the kids and dog and are now getting their own .
5 #### I have several kinds of mugs this is by far the best . I love the handle , just squeeze toward cup with fingers and drink , no flipping up the lever . Safer when driving and keeps coffee hot for hours and actually to hot to drink for the first hour !
5 #### These work great for mini cakes or cheesecakes . They are easy to clean , sturdy , and do n't leak . After fairly heavy use for the last year , they have held up beautifully !
5 #### I use this blade for cutting composites or very dense hardwood . Blade has no measurable runout and does an excellent job . I personally like the Silver Ice coating better than the red permashield . Silver Ice seems to be more durable .
4 #### This hammer means I have to pound hundreds of nails a few times less and not slam my fingers as we do remodeling . It drives nails quickly and the roughed head keeps it more accurate than my regular old hammer . The longer handle helps grant more leverage .
5 #### Heavy duty and quality construction . A good hose with strong ends .
5 #### My neighbor and I have used this product for a long time . It effectively deters deer from feeding on greenery and flowers in the yard . The product is expensive and the cost of this gallon of Liquid Fence from Amazon is two - thirds or more less than what it would cost at a local big box retailer . It is smelly while wet but once it dries the smell goes away . Somewhat resistant to rain , but in heavy downpours it probably needs to be applied again . If you follow product directions it should work as well as anything I 've found .
5 #### Works great as deer block . We used to protect our flowers in the Black Forest .
5 #### Brand new and worked like a charm , ca n't complain , besides , it was more expensive here locally . Thanx Appreciate it . Raul
5 #### I never had much of a brand loyalty for routine yard maintenance stuff until I had a problem with an old fiskars pole saw . The hardware could n't hold the poles anymore . When I contacted fiskars about it ( limited lifetime warranty ) they sent me a part . When the post office did n't deliver it ( a common problem here ) they sent me a whole new $ 80 saw by fed ex . When I come across actual customer service , I buy as long as the service is good . Fiskars earned my business and I now look for their products where available . This is a nice pruning stick . Unlike loppers , you can stick this into a shrub or low tree and cut a branch off without needing the linear clearance to open and close the lopper . The mechanism works very well and allows me to trim up my hedges without sticking my arms into them ( we have wasps and black widows ) or going through trying to use a lopper and having it hit adjacent branches . Not the only tool you need , but its a great addition . Like most fiskars products , its very well made .
3 #### Work well but I miss the older version that I had but somehow ca n't be located ....
4 #### You have to know how to wire things because their is n't any instructions but this is a great buy considering it will cost you more on other sites . I will use this on my Triton router table after I hard wire this in . I tried to remove the switch from the back plate and I broke the switch it was n't Woodstock 's fault so I ordered just the switch and used their wires so it was n't a total lose . Check my other review on the replacement switch . The replacement switch works perfectly . I gave the other switch 5 stars if it came off the plate without breaking I would have given it 5 stars .
4 #### It 's ok . I expected a better carpet attachment but it does what I need it to do .
5 #### These foams take the worry out of damaging your siding with the extension latter . They are a tight fit and I used a rubber mallet to get them seated down fully .
5 #### I love this vacuum . It is light weight but very powerful . It works OK on carpet with a few passes . It works great for removing cobwebs from walls and ceiling . It works great on wood floors and tile floors . I have also used it on my carpeted stairs and is so much easier to handle than my heavy upright for stairs . It is not horribly noisy either . I recommend it highly .
5 #### Well constructed . You really ca n't go wrong . My only complaint is that I wish it also showed millimeters , but I knew that it did n't when I bought it . Still a great buy .
5 #### I 've wanted / needed , shopped , and bought several Hygro - Thermometers in the last 10 years or so for monitoring homes and commercial spaces to informally assess and help diagnose HVAC equipment operation . To date , this unit has given me the most confidence and satisfaction with accuracy and operation in its price point . This is my recommended pick .
4 #### Not strong enough for batters but good for not scratching stovetop cookwear
5 #### Yes this was just what I wanted it also fits my Ward rotary tool . Good job
5 #### The nice thing about the Bessey Tradesmen 's , is that they are heavier duty than the competition , in the medium duty class , and you do n't have to take out a second mortgage to afford a set of them . The locking mechanism works without any hassles , and the grip is strong . All in all a nice piece of equipment . A major competitor sells this model for less money , but it is also a lighter weight clamp . I like them all . Bessey makes great stuff , you ca n't go wrong with these . They are a great general purpose clamp . Highly recommended .
5 #### Great set of collets . Just what I needed ! ! Thanks again , Bill
1 #### Pealed off the OXO ( I 'm a pro kitchen utincel ) label and stared to put it into the dishwasher but noticed the stick on notice that said : do not put in dishwasher . Breathtaking . These clowns ca n't design a METAL pounding tool that is dishwasher safe . Sending it back to find a replacement device designed by people that use their products .
4 #### These covers fit my chairs ( regular and rocker ) with the cushions on . They are well made and heavy . There is a soft lining to protect your furniture and velcro straps to go around the legs so the wind wo n't pull them off . I am really glad I bought these covers .
1 #### The description says infinite angle adaptability . I bought 2 of these to clamp an octafon and they will not work because the angles are 45 degrees . This strap will not work with angles under 60 but will work for any angle from 60 up to 180 degrees . It will work perfectly for anything between but i gave 1 star because description very misleading . Additionally , there are no instructions on how to use . It seems intuitive but really is not and while trying to figure it out I feared I would damage it .
5 #### I had an old bundt pan which I got rid of because no matter what I did , the cake would always stick and rip the top off . Okay , to be fair I had been using that pan for 38 years and it was one of those old school dark non - stick finishes which was probably considered " first generation " non - stick surfaces . So , I was amazed with this new non - stick coating . The coating is light and shiny and slicker than the old non - stick coating ever was . I have been baking apricot pecan bourbon fruitcaks and the cakes just slipped out . I did n't even have to loosen around the edges , just put a plate on top and flip the pan over . I liked it so much I bought 3 more nordic ware bundt pans to streamline my Holiday baking . Now , you still have to grease and flour the pan and the easiest way to do that is PAM with flour . If you do n't like PAM then I would recommend using an oil mister and then using a sifter or mesh strainer to apply a dusting of flour . Clean up was a snap with just a sponge and warm soapy water .
5 #### I got this tea ball as a replacement and its great . Fast shipping with my prime account and a very sturdy tea ball . You ca n't go wrong with a tea ball really , however I will add that this came via Fedex so if you are worried about your tea ball getting crushed during delivery do n't fret . It cam packaged better than some of my more expensive items , the carrier and I had a harty laugh about that .
5 #### These go well with both my cordless and corded Reciprocating saws .
5 #### I think the product probably works ok , but i have a soft sided pool and I could n't keep it level . Not the products fault , I do n't think .
5 #### Great control box . Very easy to use , easy to program , wire , etc . Far more versatile than other boxes I 've used .
5 #### bought this to help get rid of the mosquitoes and moths that seem to want to take over our yard . It works pretty good . the only downfall is that octenol attractant is not cheap and does n't last very long . but I guess it 's worth it to not get carried away .
1 #### We have two of these " defending " our vegetable garden . This morning I look out the window and there is a big grey squirrel digging up a seedling six feet away and directly in front of one of the Defenders . And the Defender is doing nothing . I 've been trying to get these Defenders to work for months now . I did manage to improve their performance somewhat by adding a pressure regulator to the hose that supplies water to them . It seems that the battery powered solenoid valve is not strong enough to reliably open against standard water pressure . But the primary problem is that there is no Sensitivity setting that will detect a squirrel and NOT result in the Defender triggering constantly in response to plants swaying in a breeze . So : Useless for small pest control . However , depending on your sense of humor , you may find them well worth the purchase price as you watch the Defenders soak your spouse , friends , gardener , ......
4 #### Light weight yet sturdy . Nice how holder / drip - catcher hides the rubber . It works - that 's all that matters !
5 #### This is a nice plunger . The housing hides the plunger so it can be kept beside the toilet without being an eyesore .
5 #### Works great ! This is the second one I have purchased and I am very pleased !
5 #### In the morning , we use this to measure water for coffee , and then when I need to measure other liquids for any type of use , it is wonderful . My husband uses it more than I do ! !
5 #### It 's a generic hose nozzle . Gets the job done . The rubber coating is nice .
5 #### I would recommend this product over to others . No complaints .
5 #### I always wanted one of these . I remember my mom and grandma cooking beans this way .
5 #### I am very happy with this product . I bought it for one particular project that I was working on , and it did the job wonderfully . I may not use it again for a year , but it 's a tool that is well - made and is worth having for the times it is needed . Was very reasonably priced , as well .
5 #### Good looking vacuum , seems sturdy , easy to use and functional .
5 #### Works perfectly . It creates a beam of light that lights up the book just right and not the room . The light is white led , I do n't remember reading it in the description so I thought it would mention that . Not sure how how long a battery lasts , but if it 's terrible I 'll adjust my rating accordingly .
2 #### What a novel idea : clamps that exert no pressure ! I was very surprised to find that these clamps which look well - designed , simply do n't work . Squeeze the handles together as tightly as you can and the clamps still fail to hold whatever it is you you are trying to secure . Color me surprised when I released my grip - and the clamp released as well . Like I said , these look like a great idea , but they are n't . Jerry
5 #### By far my favorite way to make popcorn . Easy to use and easy to clean . Far superior to dry tasteless air popped popcorn .
5 #### Kid 's love it . Wish I had a bigger area for a larger one .
5 #### Love this little roller . It makes short work of peeling garlic and it does n't take up a lot of room in the drawer like some other garlic peelers .
4 #### These work great , but are not as thick or sturdy as I thought they 'd be . But , for that reason , they are easy to cut to shorter lengths , which is convenient .
5 #### This is my second controller . I like the old style
5 #### I use it on my front porch for my deliveries . works perfect . if it gets dirty , a little rince from the hose and all is good .
5 #### So far , have completed about 1 dozen doors and this bit has been great . Always trusted Freud and once again they have come through for me .
4 #### This product has HUGE potential . It is an excellent design . I use this as a no hassle alternative to a messy Foreman grill . I cook on it all of the time . The gas lasts FOREVER ! When I built mine , I threw out all of the nuts and bolts it came with and spent over $ 20 on Stainless Steel replacements . Being an outdoor grill , this should be something it comes with . After about a year , the cast iron heat plate was destroyed . Everything else on the grill was in perfect condition ( thanks to using one of those grey Weber grill covers ) . My friend and I just replaced the cast iron heat plate , tonight ; with an eighth inch stainless steel one cut out of some of his left over material . WOW ! ! ! ! What a difference that made ! Holy Moley . The flame distribution is even ( unlike before ) , the temperature climbs up much quicker , and the stainless heat plate glows red hot . I am a true fan of this grill and think it is an AWSOME value , but I think consumers would be willing to pay $ 10 more if Char - Broil would just supply stainless hardware and a REAL stainless heat plate that wo n't degenerate itself . When and if it croaks , I will buy another one . But I will continue to do what ever I can to fix any future quirks with the one I currently have .
5 #### I recommend that everyone have an extinguisher in their home . I have never had to use one but just knowing it 's there is comforting .
5 #### Best pizza wheel ever ! Really impressed with the size , feel , and quality of this pizza wheel cutter . Would definitely recommend . Feels like a pizza place would be using this because of its quality .
5 #### Excellent tool ; I have to keep buying them because workmen in the house , and neighbors , keep walking away with them
5 #### I prefer a thicker string , but the new electric trimmer I purchased uses this so I did n't have my hopes set very high as this is about as thin of string as they make . However , it seems to do very well so far , especially compared the junk the new trimmer came with that was constantly breaking off . This string advances well and does n't break off inside the spool requiring you to take it apart to refeed it . I 'm happy with it so far !
4 #### This was a great price for what you get , I found the filters to be sturdy and able to filter the air very well for my needs . I will continue to buy them also they were safe and undamaged when I received the filters .
5 #### A very sturdy bag for a smaller Shop - Vac . I use it for debris cleanup .
4 #### We like everything about this nozzle except the fact that it really does n't have a " mist " setting . On the plus side , because it has such good pressure , it does seem to have more power and control when hosing off the driveway , for instance . I look at this nozzle as more of a work horse , which is great ... but when I only want to water the flowers , I have to barely turn the water on , or it 's just too strong of a stream .
5 #### These were made well , but what really great about the whole thing is the pricing . I would n't hesitate to buy more of these . I ordered these for my Dad and he was very pleased .
5 #### Love the sound . High quality in the strong Hawaii winds . Looks absolutely gorgeous .
5 #### This is a fantastic garden tool . I 've been looking for a substantial fork for a long time and the longer handle that can be purchased separately makes it even better . A sturdy , must have for the gardener .
4 #### Have you ever tried to drive a screw with a slotted head with a power driver ? Almost impossible , right ! You need one of these . Fits # 8 and # 10 screws .
5 #### Very nice brush ! Good size , very very well made . Oxo has really good quality products . Thanks .
1 #### did not know it would take oxygen out of water
5 #### Was a little skeptical that this cover could make a difference . After reading reviews , took a chance and ordered the 24 ' x 12 ' solar cover . Our pool literally looks like Mickey Mouse 's head , two ears , spa ( nose / eyes)in the middle , etc . Cut one piece in a 90 inch round shape to fit into the spa . Cut another piece into half circles to place in other irregularly shaped areas . Left with a couple of 4 ' X 8 ' strips that almost covered one of the " ears " . So light weight and easy to put on and pull off . The first morning water temp . was 74 degrees , heated pool to 86 degrees , enjoyed our swim , and put all the pieces on for the night . Outside temp . went to 72 that night , checked water temp in morning , and pool temp was at 84 degrees ! Keep in mind that because of the weird shape , only a little over half of the pool was actually covered with the solar cover . Without turning on the pool heater again , repeated the process for three more days , and it is holding the temp at 84 degrees every time . We are amazed , and thankful that we can avoid using the pool heater . Worth every dollar spent , and will be a money and energy saver for us . Will probably purchase another to completely cover ' Mickey ' and really extend our swim season . A great product !
5 #### Arrvd on time & well pkd . This is a great product . Easy to measure & mix .
5 #### I hated when my chain would get dull and I 'd have to get sharpened and could n't use my chainsaw while waiting to get back from shop . this second chain allows me to easily swich chains and keep working while other chain is being sharpened .
5 #### I 'm a carpenter so I have a tape measure in my hand all day and this is easily my favorite . Most people use the 25 ' which I recommend but I aomething a little lighter and smaller so I go 16 ' .
5 #### I appreciate that this mesh is packaged in a roll . It was evenly cut and a breeze to install , I just unrolled and clipped it on the poles as I went around my fruit tree cage , which happens to be 7 ' tall . So it fit perfectly on the sides of the cage . I just rolled it up to the top and secured with small bungee cords . Now it 's ready when I need it . One less thing to worry about . I plan on leaving it on all year . If needed I can place fleece or plastic directly over it in cold weather when needed . The mesh is 1/2 " x 1/2 " and the birds can see enough shine on it to actually land on it instead of flying into it . But it does not obstruct my view of looking at my beautiful food plants . Note * I secured a heavy duty mesh netting on the top of my fruit cage to withstand smaller falling branches and hail . I recommend attaching this taught so the birds will not get tangled in it .
5 #### I bought it for making Seven - Minute Frosting . It 's just the right size . It 's good quality and heats evenly .
5 #### Smaller than I thought it would be . Even my husband likes the way it cuts and it is easy to use and clean ..
5 #### Had two 400watt bulb , first one blew within an hour , replaced with this one . Two days now no issue's ... Turns out this one is reliable and bright . I m Hooked , good quality here.(by the way the one that blew , i contacted seller and they took very good care of me . ReplaCed bulb for free.even though it took 2 months to start up bulbs ... very happy with both
5 #### Works like a charm . My only complaint is I bought the biggest one and it 's not even that big . Also , the little mosquito attractant they give you does n't work as advertised , but even receiving it with the unit was a surprise . Come summer this thing will be cooking some bugs for sure .
5 #### Bought this handle in 1972 , while a mechanic . It cost the then - huge sum of $ 25 but paid for itself right away . It 's an extremely strong , extremely flexible handle , and the ratcheting action is fine enough to allow it to work in tight places . It ai nt as pretty as a lot of flex - heads , but it is much stronger , given that the head is supported by two pins . I 've broken loose a lot of rusted connectors with it , and , 35 years later , it 's still going strong .
5 #### These work great . I have captured lots of wood rats .
4 #### This is a nice , well balanced can opener that works well . The knob is very large & I had to find a different location in my drawer for it to fit . But it works good .
5 #### We liked this vacuum so much that we ordered a second on for my Mother . It has plenty of power , it is light , easy to change bags , and is affordable ! What more could you ask for ?
5 #### 3 years and it works great for my big drill press . Do n't move it much nowadays but it was really handy helping me optimize my shop and it still sits under my rig .
5 #### I bought this unit in order to scare a Blue Heron away from my fish pond . I may never know if it gives him a scare , but I can attest it does detect the presence of a warm body ( it is a heat sensor ) and the jet of water produced by the sprinkler is sufficient to scare the devil out him . There are a couple of cons . The plastic washers furnished in the hose connections should be replaced with compressible rubber ones , and the hose connection needs to be modified to be a normal rotating female connection as is found on most , if not all , garden hoses . Other than that it is a good unit . Had I purchased it some time ago I 'd most likely have quite a few more fish than I do .
5 #### This is a gift ... and I could n't be happier to send it . Quality product !
5 #### It does exactly what it is supposed to do , and does it well .
3 #### This item is identical to the ones that come complete with sprinkler heads in the home improvement stores . Like them , it works fine but it can bend easily and after a couple of bends it will leak . It 's cheaper to replace the spike and reuse the sprinkler head than buying a new sprinkler head and spike assembly .
1 #### Lasted 6 months , then totally off ! Wo n't recommend !
5 #### Had it for over a year now , no complaints so far . Very sharp , easy to handle , extra long handle is great , splits great , carrying guard cover is nice but not necessary . A regular axe costs between 20 - 30 a replacement axe handle 15 , if you add it all up the return on this investment is quick .
5 #### The bits were received in excellent condition . They produced precise and clean results on a large project with no deterioration in quality . Freud is now my first choice for purchasing router bits in the future .
1 #### Soapy water works much better than these . Just fill the dish part of the flea trap with a cup of water and three table spoons of detergent . Fleas instantly die in soapy water .
5 #### I like the fact that this is not a bulky sifter and that it has lids on the top as well as the bottom . Hope that the shaking part of it will not break , stay tuned .
5 #### I have used a Chantal Classic teakettle for years and accidentally left it on the gas burner , water boiled away and totally ruined it , cracking the enamel and destroying the white enamel . I replaced it with another brand teakettle that came with good reviews which I used for about two months . After burning hand on handle that was not supposed to retain heat , splashing boiling water everytime I poured out of it , and having to hold the spout open the whole time while pouring water , I gave it away . Plus , if I was in the other room , I could not hear the whistle . Ordered new Chantal Classic Teakettle in red and I love , love , love it .
3 #### Parts is Parts , have to have right parts to do the job , not much choice . Took a littls longer to receive than I anticipated so had to wait to fix the leaky faucet .
4 #### We 've been using this quite a bit lately , and I have to say it is incredibly handy for all sorts of greens and herbs . Simple , well made , and easy to use . What more can you ask for ?
5 #### Performed as expected ! Highly rated by American Test Kitchens in their tests . I do expect to get a lot of use out of it for years to come .
5 #### Love them ! ! They are a nice size . Burrito size tortillas fit in them nicely . We were always buying the tortilla shell kits , you find in the grocery store . They are expensive and of course you have to throw them away . The shell pans will pay for themselves . I am very pleased .
5 #### After reading many reviews I decided to give this battery a try . It was by far the least expensive . Upon receipt I noticed some slight physical differences , but found that they did not hinder insertion of the battery into either the drill or the charger . I am also very pleased with the power of the battery . So far ( a few months)I have used it a number of times and not yet had to re - charge . I gave it a 24 hour initial charge in my DeWalt charger which worked flawlessly . My drill is the DW926 that originally used the DW9062 9.6v DeWalt battery . This is a perfect alternative , and much less expensive , for the regular replacement DeWalt battery . 11/26/12 Update - After 3 years of experience with this battery I must say it is better than the original DeWalt . It has taken and held charge for lengthy periods ( months at a time ) with as much power as can be expected with a 9.6 volt battery . This remains the perfect alternative to the OE DeWalt battery . Great value !
1 #### Not as easy as shown on TV . It took many times going through with the knife to get the pieces small enough to eat . It takes a shorter amount of time to do with a knife alone .
4 #### Great grill but shipments always appear to miss one part of the stand . My parents had bought this same unit several months ago and it too was missing part of the stand piece . I guess this must be a supply - chain defect where orders processed are always left without that one stand piece .
3 #### These are saw blades . They cut things . They are the same as all the other reciprocating saw blades out there . Buy on price . Do n't believe all the other nonsense you read that 's written by the DeWalt marketing folks , or the marketing folks who sell other blades or the other reviewers our here . They are just blades .
5 #### My husband likes his oranges peeled with a peeler . Yes , I know , that is strange , but he likes the white pulpy part and peeling the orange this way leaves most of the white . When I started peeling his oranges with a peeler , I had a couple of cheap ones that worked well enough for potatoes and carrots , but it was a battle using them on an orange . Since then I have been on a quest for a peeler that would handle the job . This one does with ease . It is sharp , cuts deep enough but not too deep , and the size and shape of the handle is comfortable in my hand . I just bought a second one because I am tired of digging my favorite out of the dishwasher to wash by hand so I can use it " now . "
5 #### Ever since visiting Bar Harbor I had cravings for the amazing popovers that has made the Jordan Pond House such a popular restaurant . I had tried to make popovers in a regular muffin pan , but they would never turn out quite right . I found this pan on Amazon and ordered it hoping my popovers would improve , and boy did they ever ! I have been making popovers for more than just Christmas and Thanksgiving holidays . The no - stick surface allows the popovers to slide out easily and they are light , fluffy , and HUGE ! Could n't be happier !
4 #### These clippers are fantastic for cutting . However , they are hard to grasp and squeeze for these 62 year old hands . I have to use both hands to squeeze them as the handles are skinny and the clippers are heavy . It is absolutely very sharp and cuts well . I wish the handles were angled differently or something so they were easier to hold on to and squeeze . I also bought the sharpener but have not used it yet . The clippers are heavy duty and as described .
5 #### Quality , Quality Quality . This nozzle is heavy and built to last . It works great for any application you would need . For me , just general watering and clean up .
5 #### I 've had one of these for three years without problems . Just bought a second .
5 #### Whisks without scratching non stick . So far the plastic has n't worn off the core . Had it for a couple months .
5 #### Try to buy a foreign made pair of slip joint plyers even close to the performance and quality of these . Just try .
5 #### perfect replacement for my damaged shop vac hose ! variable adapter options . would recommend !
2 #### Good idea , maybe I have not learned how to use it well but I find that this gets stained easily and is hard to get clean . It does keep the veggies and fish from slipping through the grill but I can get the same effect from pan cooking or using foil instead . I do n't think I would purchase this again . Overall I have loved all my weber products , this is my least favorite .
5 #### I tried to save money and not buy this part of the Foxfarm trio but I gave up . The plants just do better if I use this along with the rest of the trio . Thank you Foxfarm .
5 #### Purdy brushes are really the best brushes for homeowners as well as pros . I am happy with the results I got when using this angle brush to paint trim .
3 #### It works to help kids learn time but i thought it would be bigger and come with game ideas to make learning more fun
3 #### This is a really nice edge guide but be warned that the website is NOT correct . You can not use this with the DWP611 . If you have the plunge accessory then it will work . I sadly had to send mine back today , but it was built really well if you are using a different router other than the DWP611 .
4 #### The edge of these is nice and thin so that one can get under the food .
5 #### There are plenty of clips included , no need to buy extra . The cable seems to have gone up with no problems , but only winter will tell . I have mine on a switch , and also used the Farm Innovators Model TC-3 Cold Weather Thermo Cube . I did search for a controller which would also monitor water , but did n't find one at a low cost . It seems like this could be a fire hazard if you crossed the heat cables . The picture on the front of the box helped me as much as the directions .
4 #### This unit is for our back - up generator storage . We placed it on a patio block platform and added plywood inside for proper support . Just the right size and it has easy access from the top or the front .
5 #### Outstanding quality . Made in USA . The 15 inch length is just right for keeping this bar in the tool box . Very handy . Good width and thickness for strength when you need it .
5 #### I have used them and ordered more they are great sprout right away fresh and great tasting , will keep these around
5 #### Purchased product because I have a short bed , 6.5 ft , on my pickup and the canoe I purchased was 16 ft long and I did not want to have to put the canoe on top of the truck all the time . This product give me the option when I do not need to carry anything in the bed of the truck and makes it easy on loading the canoe .
5 #### The shaft is 1/16th of an inch longer than 4 inches . The handle is a little fatter than other brand screwdrivers , at about 1.25 " in diameter . I also got the Wiha 40010 magnetizer , and it works great with this screwdriver . I was n't expecting much , but it worked like a charm . BTW , after much googling for an answer , " Profilated " simply means " Precision Cut " ; more specifically the 4 points of the phillips tip . This bit PRECISELY fits into the head of # 2 screws , with zero wiggling . I have n't tried it on cheapo screws , but so far it is a very precise tip , with no slippage / stripping under torque .
4 #### I LOVED the Fiskars reel mower . The mower is an absolute delight to use . I do n't have a very big yard ( front is 50 ft X 30 ft . rear / side is 20 ft by 40 in various rectangles . ) So , for edging I thought I would stick with the noiseless manual solution and try this 36 - in shears . Silly me . While I can get an * ok * job , it is too slow for this purpose . It will do around a flower bed easily , but using it as an edger is not its purpose . They do cut well and they are lightweight . SO , if you are using a weedeater to edge your lawn , I do n't see the need for these shears .
3 #### I have bought a few of these , love them . However , my first one broke where the flat spatula meats the frame of the handle . I bought a new one , but had to return it three times because none of them were " flexible " at all . The contact point of the handle and spatula was done incorrectly and would not allow the spatula to bend , or it would spring back and fling food everywhere . Finally , the fourth one I received is like the first , very flexible and works amazing . I wish they had a better Quality Control on these items to save the time and effort to get a good one .
5 #### Great for getting water off everything from salad and veggies to grapes . Have used this item for many years with no problems . You do have to get it spinning very fast for it to work as it should , and I can see how a lack of upper body strength could make this a problem for some people . I also see reviews talking about closure tabs breaking , mine unit is older and has no tabs like that .
5 #### Item was as described . Shipping on time . Would buy again .
5 #### Very good whisk . Feels good in the hand and does not slip . Well designed .
5 #### I bought it because I know I 'll need it soon , looks perfect for my needs , I suppose you should get one too !
5 #### Needed these weird bulbs for a chandelier from IKEA . They work perfectly , and I have n't found any " duds " in the batch we ordered . Will buy again when we need more .
5 #### Channellock makes excellent hand tools . I 've been using their tongue and groove pliers for years , as well as their needle - nose pliers . I 've been abusing them for just about that long , and I 've never had one fail . I 've seen plenty of junk at the tool importers , and they 're cheaper , but who cares about saving a few bucks on a $ 8 pliers when the cheaper tool fails and you hurt yourself ?
4 #### 10 Cents worth of product for $ 1.50 + . Best thing to do is order a quantity to distribute the cost to a point where it is more practical . Works as expected . Expeditious delivery
1 #### Bought this on November 13 last year . Have used it 10 ( that 's ten ) times . I only hand wash it ; I do not use the dishwasher for cleaning it . I use a dishrag plus a fabric coated sponge for washing dishes . No scratchers have been used on it . It is currently showing rust spots around the top edge . Fortunately I did not pay a lot for it , but it still was too high a price to pay for a piece of cookware that basically only lasted a little over 2 months as I do n't wish to eat rust . It is also very lightweight compared to the old pressure cooker my mother had for over 40 years ; maybe that is why the metal is n't very high quality . Firm believer in the old adage that you get what you pay for ; my bad . Have ordered another brand that is pricier . I am not in the financial position to pay more for one specialty pan than I did for my entire set of stainless pots and pans , so we will see how this next one works out .
5 #### I was in trouble . My almost 300 lb weight lifting significant other refused to do any more home repairs for me until a found a stepstool that would hold his weight . The best the hardware store could do was a 250 lb step stool . So I said a prayer and looked on Amazon . Behold ! I found this step stool . Now my house wo n't fall apart ! This is a small step stool , about 2 ' high , and narrow . It 's very lightweight . When my almost 300 lb handyman hops on it , it does n't sag or bend or give . I 'm really impressed that such a lightweight , petite stool can take the abuse we heap upon it . Folded , it is small enough to sit in a corner of our coat closet . Be careful not to pinch your fingers on the side latches when folding and unfolding it . They are functional and obviously do the job , but could easily catch a finger . This is a great buy ! I 'll be looking for a matching ladder soon .
5 #### Do not buy an all cotton hammock , they do not last as long or look as good after time . I can leave the DuraCord or polyester out all year in South Florida weather and get 3 to 4 years use .
3 #### Mmmmmmm , takes up a lot of cabinet space for it 's function ...... however , the unit does exactly what the seller claims and is well made . Great for a large family !
4 #### Well made but assembly was more time consuming than anticipated . Works great on my old delta table saw .
4 #### These things are great . Very easy to use . Connecting and disconnecting is a breeze . From time to time some water will drip out , but that is nothing more than it just needing to be retightend .
2 #### the instructions say to put bait in it before turning it on to get the rats used to it . I did that ; they ate the bait . Now , when its " off " the rats eat the bait . When its " on ' , the rats wo n't go in it . all that I can figure is they get some kind of feeling or non - lethal warning before they go in . it has caught nothing . It has been in use for weeks . the rats just wait for me to turn it off to see if I can get them back in it ; then its free meal time .
5 #### Very handy little brushes . we feed hummingbirds , and it is important to keep the feeders clean . I was glad to find these at such a reasonable price .
5 #### Great nozzle ! Get two just in case you lose one or run over it with the mower !
4 #### It 's hard to get too excited about vacuum cleaner agitator belts ! They are as described and they do what they 're supposed to do
5 #### Works in our small pond to keep the algae away .
5 #### this rake was perfect for the job of removing the heavy thatch from our yard . the price was very good and the rake is a tool i would recommend to anyone for removing thatch .
4 #### lots of different measurement scales so you can convert without the math
5 #### This is n't my first Bialetti pot but it 's the biggest .. I love it !
3 #### well i 'm not impressed because all it is , is a mini food processor , nothing spectacular as they all work the same . I did like the fact that I could get it in a different color which was blue . I thought I would use it more but I have only used it a couple of times . I still like my bigger food processor and feel I may have wasted my money buying it . it probably would be great for an older person who does n't need the big food processor and only needs to chop up small stuff .
5 #### Sturdy and will last a while . Way better quality than the knock off vice grips .
2 #### Works great ! Glad I bought it . - Ann Atwood - Have changed my mind . Bought this in Oct. 2014 and worked great til the past few months . Began to hold a charge for a short period of time . Now it does n't hold a charge at all - what a disappointment . Would n't think I should have to replace batteries less than 2 years ! Ann Atwood
5 #### this is a great little steel . by that i mean next time i will get one that is a little longer . but it does a great job .
5 #### This product is easy to use . I put some in the bottom of the planting holes and then around the roots as transplanting was done . The plants involved were : lettuce , Brussels Sprouts , tomatoes , squash , and Swiss Chard . The plastic bag that contains this product is of heavy plastic and has not ripped .
4 #### I would give this a five star rating if there was n't a very questionable design choice . I use the burner for a heating source while brewing instead of my stove in order to heat the beer more efficiently . It does the job really well . It can heat up a 6 gallon pot very quickly . I have no reservations about recommending this as a heating source to heat a large amount of liquid quickly . The design is sturdy and is easy to hook up to a propane tank . But the paint was blasted off the first time I used it . I work in manufacturing and I am familiar with various coatings . To apply a high heat paint that could withstand the heat of the burner would n't be prohibitively expensive , especially for a burner that 's on the higher end of cost . The burner is sturdy , and effective , but the paint has burnt off which is a bit odd .
5 #### Do n't settle for a lesser corded drill . In fact , do n't get any other corded drill ( with rare exception for&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Milwaukee-1680 - 21 - 13 - amp-1 - 2 - inch - Super - Hawg - Joist - and - Stud - Drill / dp / B00006AGPX / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Milwaukee 1680 - 21 13 amp 1/2 - inch Super Hawg Joist and Stud Drill</a>&nbsp;if all you do is use the right angle function and use it for big hole saws ) . As a remodeler , I could never go back to the regular&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Milwaukee-0299 - 20 - Magnum-8 - Amp-1 - 2 - Inch - Drill / dp / B00007FPIN / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Milwaukee 0299 - 20 Magnum 8 Amp 1/2 - Inch Drill</a>&nbsp;for electrical and plumbing work . Once you get used to the awesome power , it 's impossible to go back . The best thing about a right angle drill is that when using an auger bit or similar , the drill does n't rip your wrist off when it catches . You can use your whole body to control the drill , which makes for much less tiring work ( e.g. , when mixing drywall mud ) . I appreciate using this drill over its bigger brothers because it is much , much lighter . The right angle attachment comes off as well so that you can use it as a regular d - handle drill . The right angle attachment is relatively easy to take off , and it can be switched around to adjust for speed ( low and high ) . The head swivels , and my version came with the quik - lok cord . I also appreciated that this drill is made ( mostly , at least ) in the USA . The five year warranty is nice , but like with most other Milwaukee tools , I do n't expect to use it . Get this drill .
5 #### Feels good in my hand it does a good job ....
2 #### I bought this at the same time I bought the Wire Tek " EasySet " Mole Trap here on Amazon , and after trying both products I have to say that the Victor " Out O'Sight " Mole Trap is not only 1 ) much more difficult to operate but also 2 ) less effective than the Wire - Tek one , not to mention 3 ) tears up your yard more . With this Victor brand one you actually have to dig a hole by hand vs. with the Wire - Tek one all you do is push it in to the ground and step on it to set it , easy as pie . That one has caught 2 moles for me so far , the Victor trap has caught 0 moles . If it was n't such a hassle to ship stuff back , I 'd return this one and buy another Wire Tek brand mole trap . Do n't waste your time on this product here !
5 #### I 've used these action packers for years at work . We would sling these to remote locations by helicopter packed with food and gear for up to a week . Not one of them ever broke , even with heavy crew sitting on them at night . I would n't trust them to be watertight on a boat . Maybe if you placed an even bead of silicone caulking it might do it , but for keeping things dry in the rain , no problem .
5 #### Still running . Been a few years now . I stuck an allergy furnace filter of the same size as the fan on it . Works great . Probably quieter solutions , but none that will have the same replaceable filter for as many years as this will . ;) Most people do n't even notice I have a filter on my box fan . :)
5 #### The handle is a nice size for someone who has trouble with there hands . Easy to use
4 #### I was afraid that at this price the tool would turn out to be flimsy . It is not . Although I could hardly call it " heavy - duty , " it is decently made and practical for light -too medium tasks .
2 #### Low quality , I would not recommend . You wo n't be impressed . I was n't very satisfied with the purchase . Sorry , but no thank you .
5 #### I like the design of the single foot pedal which makes this mabile base easier to use than the HTC 2000 model . The HTC design requires two foot pedals to operate while the Delta has only one . The foot pedal is also larger on the Delta while the HTC design has rather thin ones . The single wheel also seems to make the Delta model easier to pivot with . If you want a mobile base that 's ready to go out of the box , the HTC model will serve your needs well enough . If you can or do n't mind making the rails yourself , get the Delta model since its easier to raise and lower with its larger foot pedal , and the single wheel design also makes it easier to pivot with .
5 #### The installation was quick and easy . Toilet is flushing great once again . Is adjustable for any flushing needs . Looks like it will last .
5 #### Great pressure cooker , use it twice a week and not a single issue . Straight forward and easy to use .
4 #### It seemed to kill more moths than mosquitoes and despite having a monthly pest spray company , mosquitoes still were in my house .
5 #### Best speed square out there , worth it ten times over just for the info in the booklet that comes with it . You can do anything with this baby .
5 #### My previous whisk fell apart and am I very happy with this one . The whisk feels sturdy and well put together .
4 #### These are great trimmers . Bought a pair just like these 5 years ago , they are still going strong . Bought this pair to keep in the back yard .
5 #### I havn't shot at it yet but if it 's anything like the fifteen year old Stanley that it replaced , it 's bullet proof .
4 #### I purchased this specifically for my cardinals , and have found that the little guys , like the Titmouse , Vireo , and House Finch are enjoying it too . What I really love is that the bully birds,(for me Black Birds and Starlings ) , and the squirrels HATE it ! So even when I mix it with the Sunflower seeds , a squirrel fav , there are still plenty of these left behind for the song birds to eat . My only negative is how small the bags offered are . I guess because it is very expensive compared to the other types of bird seed .
5 #### Very easy to use . Worked well for our basement project .
5 #### Works just fine ! We 've caught 2 pesky opossum & 3 squirrels . Only once has something somehow stolen the bait without tripping the trap . We did however have one squirrel die when the door snapped shut . The poor thing evidently had his head in the way when the door snapped shut . Hopefully he did n't suffer which is the whole object to buying this kind of trap in the first place !
1 #### The metal ring below the connector bent , preventing connection to a second hose . The metal ring is too thin and flimsy , do not recommend .
5 #### best tape ever , been using these all my life , making a living . Since it reaches seven feet in two directions i do equal distance measuring to find centers . Mark seven feet or six feet six , then mark the same from opposite wall . You may have a foot overlap or a foot shy , then you are only dealing with half of the small remaining distance . I call it equi - distance measuring . It should be in every craft or construction text book like the 6 - 8 - 10 method for squaring buildings . Hope they always make this tape , they are not as easy to find these days .
5 #### I prefer the convenience of a gas grill and these chips add that " BBQ " flavor gas grills do not provide on their own . Excellent .
4 #### Love these apple chips ! Infuses better then the cheaper brand and last longer . It 's a little more pricier then I wanted but I will be buying them again because they 're better .
5 #### First , I love this because the handle fits my hand really well . I like a small offset knife for a lot of reasons , icing , of course ... but also for loosening up baked goods or getting under a baked lasagna ... being it 's small it 's easy to maneuver . I would definitely recommend this .
5 #### This is an excellent Pressure Cooker . It works perfect on my Induction Cooker . This is my second Presto Pressure cooker , the first one had wooden handles , and was made of aluminum ( still in service ) . Aluminum not being compatible with Induction Cooking I got the Stainless Steel . The encapsulated bottom creates that perfect heat distribution for searing and browning . What an absolutely beautiful combination . The new sealing ring is a wonder all by its self when compared to the ones of the 1940 's . Do I sound happy with this cooker , That 's because I am . The first thing I cooked was a pot of Pinto beans,(see photo ) the pressure cooker cooked them 14 times faster than a conventional pan . Clean up is a breeze , and to keep that just out of the box look I use Bar Keepers Friend . During assembling , use caution when attaching the handle to the lid as I twisted off one of the screws , which is not a problem or deterrent as Presto has great customer service , and sent a complete new replacement assembly . I shall be ordering a second one in the not too distant future . Thanks to Amazon.com for a fantastic buy . All Pros and No Cons . This review was written assuming the reader knows a little bit about Pressure Cooking . Pressure Cooking is Fast , Fun , and Flavorful . :)
5 #### Great bulbs for hand made lamp . Emit plenty of light
4 #### Yes they are bulky . I bought them because I wanted / needed the 3/4 cup and this set has it . My old set of oxo the measurements wore off , I 'm guessing that these will too . Well they are cheap and should last me a few years before having to buy a new set , maybe than I 'll buy SS ones with engraved numbers
4 #### Installing this upgrade was a snap . The instruction sheet was barely useful , but the installation is simple . Alignment is unaffected by the riser and the increased resaw capacity is great . The blade supplied did n't hold up , but with a good blade my Jet 14 " cuts beautifully with the riser in place .
5 #### I have used these shears a long time and find them perfect for my needs , plus my wife loves them .
2 #### Although the description says " For use with all DEWALT routers " it certainly does NOT fit my DWP611 compact router . The rod spacing is too far apart . I suppose that I could only use one of the two rods but that does not provide the stability to get high accuracy . Returned to Amazon .
5 #### This is the second angle clamp I bought . The first one ( I forget the brand -- it was a ratcheting clamp ) was so poor quality I sent it back . This is high quality . I bought extra angle corners ( Bessey VAC-6 Angle Plates ) so I can use the strap with work pieces with up to ten sides . I will definitely buy more Bessey products .
5 #### We buy this filter for our aging 16 - gallon shop vac , and I credit its long life with always having this filter in place when we dry vac . I remove it when we do any wet vacuuming . It works as protection for the motor , keeping dirt and debris out . The bag catches most of the dirt , but the filter is extra insurance . At $ 14.50 , it 's cheap insurance against burning up the motor on our shop vac .
5 #### Makes delicious tea ! Stays on the cup very well , good design .
4 #### Works great , all metal parts . The only downside is they do not lock in for transportation . I need to keep a bungee cord handy . A clip would be nice to have seeing this is for a portable table saw . I have the model attached to the cart with wheels . This puts the saw sideways when moving and storing upright which makes this even more of a problem .
4 #### Some of the hardware for putting the product together was missing . I called the number provided by the company and they immediately sent the hardware to me . The product is perfect for what I need - a quick , lightweight tool for picking items up from the floor ( hard surface or carpet ) .
5 #### They are good not expensive which help me to choose to buy them
5 #### These clamps work great , bought them to assemble some cutting boards . I love how I can buy cheap pipe and have a variety of clamp sizes . plan on buying more soon
4 #### GOOD BUY AT THE PRICE CATS AND DOGS DON'T SET IT OFF , ZENITH IS A GOOD COMPANY
5 #### Wife needed replacement so we listened to the sounds and picked this one . Very nice sound . They are smaller than they appear in the listing .
3 #### Does the trick for making a nice strong coffee . It replaced a model I had bought somewhere in Europe years ago but got lost during one of my moves , and you can feel that it 's not the same quality - the overall thickness of the metal is n't enough to make it feel very sturdy , and the sieve is moving around in the funnel . So far it 's been holding up well and doing its job though , no complaints there .
5 #### i would reccomend to every one , they are great , just what the doctor ordered to get the job done right .
5 #### Love the Fat Max , replacing all my others with the Fat Max .
1 #### I have purchased many of these old work boxes which all have the same flipper arm apparatus . As of late ( 12/15 - 1/16 ) all the boxes , whether the cheaper all plastic or the plastic / fiber combo models have defective flipper arms . The boxes themselves are fine . It is the plastic used in just the flipper arm which is defective . Even with minimum screw down tension ( driven by hand ) they break off . Many break overnight and the next day the box is drooping out of the wall . Carlon has missed the boat on quality control and rendered their product useless . We all know how much fun it is to go back and re trim an outlet or switch assembly . I was able to salvage some by driving drywall screws into a nearby stud but that is rarely the case as they are usually installed in a field area .
5 #### I do n't review many priducts but I had to come to the defense of my favorite garlic press ! Maybe I 'm just unaware of all the stellar garlic presses available nowadays , ( this is the only kind I 've ever owned ) but I find absolutely nothing to compain about here . We bought one of these witha agift certificate we received for our wedding - 16 years ago . No , we do n't have that same one - it broke , but I blame my misuse more than any flaw in quality or design . If you put more than a big clove or two in together it does strain and if the rubber handle cover has slipped down it can put too much pressure on the actual handle . That 's exactly how ours broke and I recognized my error ... we 've never had a problem with the replacement . Yes , part of the outside layer of the garlic is left in the device but I figure if it 's not tender enough to be pushed through I do n't want it in my dish anyway . I also REALLY like the ease of cleaning it . As soon as I 'm finished with it I use the cleaning part and run it under some hot water at the sink and it honestly looks like new even though we 've had it for over 10 years now . I give these often as wedding / shower / going to college gifts with a couple other gadgets I have found to be indespensible in my kitchen .
2 #### It 's too heavy , unbalanced , does n't keep a charge very long , the cord keeps breaking and it wo n't serves as an edger ..... it trims fair and is cordless .... so if that 's what you 're after BUY it .... if not , stay with what you have .
5 #### It 's no surprise to me that these are a best seller . I have owned my pair for a couple of years , and absolutely love them . They are my go - to pruner for any plants that are not woody , for dead heading , and for general cleanup like when I cut down the leaves from daffodils and tulips . These look small , but they cut well and are easy on the hands for longer sessions . The locking handles are comfortable and having them locked when not in use protects the blades against dulling . As lightweight as these are , they are solidly built and are robust . I 'd gladly buy another pair when the need arises .
4 #### I purchased this for my niece who is living on her own for the first time and is exploring her cooking talents . This wisk is a good fit because it is safe for all types of pans and machine washable . I recommend this wisk for making gravies and rues .
5 #### Another America 's Test Kitchen recommendation win . It 's easy , effective , deconstructs well for cleaning , and is dishwasher safe . What more do you want from a salad spinner ?
3 #### Very solid and cool design - in fact perfect for EDC key chain type of thing . But , the illumination and battery use has been a total disappointment . - Illumination is never enough so I was always disappointed and wondered why I bother . In fact , I just threw it out after a while . Even with a fresh battery really was n't adequate - 2 - 3 lumens I think ? Why bother . - Batteries : I rarely used it and checked the batteries often but they just died - this thing just simply ate batteries for no good reason - like I 've never seen before . I hope they 've improved the LED version . I 'm a fan of Maglite but this one was a disappointment .
1 #### These things are terrible . they are way more trouble to set up than they are worth . there are easier / simpler products out there that will be more efficient .
5 #### We LOVE it - makes the best hamburgers we have ever had - easy to clean - love it love it love it .
5 #### We lost the nozzle to our big sprayer , and we were looking at a replacement cost of over $ 40 . I clean - cut the end of the old wand , bought this inexpensive nozzle and glued it to the wand . I used super - glue to get the initial tack ( welder 's lingo ) , then I used gorilla - glue to fuse the old want to the new nozzle . It works very well . If you try this , make certain to disassemble the new nozzle before gluing and exercise restraint in applying the glue . Do n't drip glue into the new nozzle , freezing it or clogging it . The entire repair took 1/2 day , most of the time was spent sitting undisturbed and drying . Price new sprayers and you will see why I resorted to the repair technique .
1 #### I do n't think I will ever use this . It can not be used to water plants . I thought it would be adjustible , but the stream is too hard , but not even something that could be used to clean a sidewalk , driveway , etc . Very disappointed .
5 #### We had one of these when I was growing up , and I bought one to have at home . Still the best popcorn popper available on the market IMO . Leaves few unpopped kernels . I would recommend using it with coconut oil , although it will work with any cooking oil . I have tried air poppers , microwave poppers , stove poppers , this one is still the only one I would actually recommend to anyone to purchase .
3 #### sadly I measured wrong ... and it did not work for what I intended . But it is well constructed ... and I found another use for it . BE sure to follow the direction before you start to assemble it ... I got it together , did it wrong ... took a neighbor 2 days to get it apart and make it right for me
5 #### These are great and we use them all the time . They are super strong and can hold any bag and they store easily on your fridge . I love using them and we can always find them when we need to use one !
5 #### Works like a Presto , my wife 's favorite pressure cooker ! What more can you say ?
4 #### While it 's not the newer cree led version for the price it is hard to beat and definitely throws some light . If you need a heavy - duty yet affordable option that you do n't mind putting through the wringer then this is a solid option . It 's a Maglite and that says about all you need to know for both quality and performance .
5 #### Perfect water hauler for a family on the go . We use it all summer .
5 #### Very nice sturdy nonstick broiler pan and rack for use in a toaster oven .
5 #### Very nice reasonably price name brand pressure cooker . Given as gift .
5 #### so far it looks like its a great quality , have n't really used it , but it looks nice in the bathroom .
1 #### Too skinny and weak . Paint make bamboo far too slick . Ties do not work
5 #### As many hummingbird fans , I have tried two or three kinds of instant nectar ; I found that the Perky Pet is one of their favorites . It is very easy to mix and dissolves quicker than others . Amazon has a GREAT price on this size ; if you are in need of nectar for these precious jewels , get this !
1 #### The handle on the pot wo n't stay tightened . You have to get the lid positioned just soooo before it will go on . And , if you do n't have the gasket in with the two little notches in front of the handle , forget it .
4 #### Has n't kinked yet and threaded ends are well made . If you need a shorter length hose ; this is a good buy
5 #### Ca nt go wrong with Botanicare their line is the best !
5 #### If you are thinking of making a deck you can not do the job without this . It had made cups and both boards so much easier to place in . It makes the job of moving deck boards and allowing them to become Tighter and closer together than you could ever get them before . Tool made from hardened steel which feels good in the hand and know it is safe to use
5 #### Repair Clinic and E - Replacement Parts have parts . E Replacement Parts has exploded views of equipment . Stens has a FULL - LINE catalog for ALL kinds of equipment . It is a VERY good catalog ! Amazon has parts in bulk . Get the 12 " hemostat pliers or the 45 degree hemostat pliers to replace fuel lines and filters . Cut the lines at a slant to ease installation . Use needle nose pliers to loosen stuck fuel lines . Work them back and forth to loosen . Set the lo mixture for highest RPM 's at idle and hi mixture for highest RPM 's at full - throttle . Set the idle just until the chain just stops . Amazon has mixture tools individually and in sets . Repair Clinic has a oil pump gear remover tool to replace the oil pump gear . Get the piston stop tool from Amazon to replace the clutch . Amazon has a clutch tool . Amazon has a 2 cycle piston ring compressor set . Amazon has a tach which you touch the spark plug wire to set the idle . It has lo and hi RPM'S. A digital tach might also work .
5 #### Great chair covers . My wicker is well protected from the winter weather . Very thick material and well made .
5 #### These are the best rat traps out there . Hit hard and do n't take a ton of pressure to trip . Threw away the Tomcat traps because the bait kept getting eaten out of all of them . Replaced the Tom Cat ( crap ) traps with these Victor traps and nailed all of the little thieves !
5 #### Bulbs seem to be of good quality and were packed very well . Arrived on time . However , what I thought was a burned out bulb , may be something more serious as the fixture is still dark . Hope to have it working soon .
5 #### This company makes pumps under 2 categories . The PumpMaster uses a foam prefilter and the Danner uses a plastic prefilter cage . The Danner prefilter is a better model since it does n't clog as fast . Pump is quiet since it is submerged , just the sound of falling water . My koi pond finally has clear water since the pump is connected to a UV filter before discharging at the waterfall . Just an incredible improvement saving me hours of not having to clean the pond every 2 weeks .
5 #### Nuttin like it . Get one . Much easier to swing than my previous 6 lb maul . And much more effective in getting wood to split .
3 #### This clamp is OK for the price but I have much better clamps . It is useful for one - handed operations but does not always clamp as tightly as other types .
4 #### I had these for a couple of years and they stood up to abuse . They did n't peel but I never scrubbed them . It is great not to have to scrub and soak every time I warm up some pizza rolls or a leftover . Just wipe 'em off with a soft sponge and rinse . No oven cleaner and no dishwasher please ! I would n't say they are designed for heavy cake baking or roasts though .
1 #### Does the job . On off switch is a push through . My only real problem with it was that the harp does n't fit all that well into the holder ( it 's a bit wobbly ) and in general is pretty flimsy . If you 're replacing lamp components like I was and your harp setup is sturdy and does n't wobble and you can fit it , use that rather than the one that comes with the setup . Otherwise , it works and it 's relatively inexpensive ( at least compared to replacing the lamp , which was my other option ) Edit : I thought I 'd updated this review but apparently that update did n't take . Less than a year after buying this ( ca n't remember the exact time frame , but it could n't have been more than that because I moved ) , the kit , which I had installed as per directions , started smoking and my wife saw a flame before I unplugged it and took it out of the apartment . I 'm just glad we never used this at night or when we were n't home . Stay away . Far , far away .
2 #### This is for someone with very large hands . The blade sticks after each cut and is awkward to handle . I am disappointed in the function and would not recommend .
5 #### I did n't realize how dull my peeler was until I replaced it with the OXO Good Grips . Peeling potatoes has never been easier ! The peeler is easy to hold and easy to use .
5 #### Did n't have to modify anything . Bar did n't drag , it does take a little longer than an air popper . This is a little bigger than you may expect .
5 #### Purdy brushes are expensive but they 're worth it . Just make sure you clean them carefully and use a brush comb . They 'll hold up for years
5 #### LOVE this salad spinner . It sits out on the counter , as I use it so often . I got so tired of wasting money on the prepackaged salads , because it would go bad shortly after opening the package . So I buy bulk in all the salad greens , make enough salad to fill this container and then bag it myself . The salad lasts MUCH longer ! ! Absolutely no regrets in getting this easy salad spinner , large enough to fill a gallon size storage bag , easy to spin .... just push down several times , and it gets rid of the moisture . Another plus is that it 's easy to clean .
5 #### Do you ever buy something then wonder why on earth you had n't bought it years ago ? That is this pot . It is fabulous ! I made spaghetti sauce and for the first time there was nothing burned on the bottom . Easy clean up , too . Looking forward to making soup soon . Great pot .
4 #### I have two sets of these . Originally , I bought them to keep dog food in , but now I use them for chicken food . I have one set outside and have little problems with moisture . I love that they are stackable , although the front load design makes it more difficult to fill all the way . Overall , definitely the best thing I have found to suit my needs . Had my first set for over 5 years , and bough a second set recently .
5 #### I purchased this mower in July 2009 and have been using it ever since . I have nearly 1/2 acre of lumpy , swampy , " lawn " to mow in the deep South where the jungle ( cane , kudzu , ivy , etc . ) is constantly trying to take over . I affectionately call it my " mower - chopper - shredder " as it is the toughest little lawnmower I have ever had . I needed a mower light enough for a female senior citizen to handle . This is it ! My grown son moved away and the gas propelled mowers ( all 6 ) needed more muscle and know - how than I had . The self propelled ones were too heavy to turn or manage on a slope . I hope they found good homes after I put them on the curb . This B&D lawnmower crunches tree roots , pine cones , cane shoots , vines of every description , and does a beautiful job on the lawn where it exists . It is so light and maneuverable I can do the whole job myself . Handling the cord is just a matter of know - how . Even 100 + feet of extension cord adds little to the chore . I purchased a spare blade to put on , but have n't needed it yet . Beyond that there is NO MAINTENANCE . It is still working perfectly , just waiting for the 2012 season , which will be long and hot and challenging . This mower gets my highest recommendation . I intend to replace it , when the time comes , with another just like it !
5 #### I mounted this on a table saw table . I have a cheap portable saw that I suspended from a piece of plywood . I did not want a dedicated table as I just do n't have the space . The table setup I have comes apart and stores on shelves or out of the way . I installed this in the runout part instead of a wing as it works better for me . I am trying to get used to the raised portion in the center which seems odd but works ok .
5 #### Reduces cooking time and utility demands efficiently . Tenderizes meats , preserves the integrity of vegetables . The original " fast food " ...
3 #### get the idea - but did n't notice a difference with / without this product on our specific bug zapper .
5 #### Love it ! Bought a cheap $ 8 stovetop espresso maker elsewhere & regretted it ever since . THIS however is the Cadillac of espresso makers ! Solid construction , beautiful espresso , easy to clean up . What more could you want ?
1 #### This is a very poor made tea ball . There is only one clamp on one side of the ball . Your tea falls out of the left side of the ball as well as the back side as this ball does not clamp all the way closed . I purchased two of these and both had the same problem . Very poorly made and would not recommened .
5 #### Nice sturdy case locks securely . Like having the right piece for the job .
5 #### I am very happy with these shears , I use them to trim my miniature horses hooves . Most farriers tools are made for large hooves & are hard to manage for little hooves . These are great , they cut through both my horses hooves very well & one of my mini 's has very hard hooves ! I am so happy to have found these !
3 #### Love this model and I only have one recommendation for the makers of this product . Make the opening to the glass bottle bigger so it is easier to get a bottle brush inside to clean the glass container . OFten black muck builds on the side of glass . It is tough to clean out .
5 #### Same as thew reviews I wrote for Cherry and Maple chips .
5 #### This is the best mechanical can opener I have ever owned , and it was even better once I figured out it had an integral plier device that grabs the can lid edge to remove it . I highly recommend this product .
1 #### Did everything by instructions . Does n't grow at all . Not a sign , seems all seeds are dead . Because of insignificant price did not bother with return . Do n't buy , no quality .
4 #### Because this is my first cork screw that I have owned that has n't been part of a swiss army knife , I was n't prepared for this little wonder . The OXO makes opening a bottle of wine or oil effortless . The plastic handle feels good in my hand and a few twists the cork easily slides out of the bottle . Just as an additional praise for this corkscrew , I bring this with me when I go over to people 's houses just in case a need might be found . I try not to be " that guy " but when your corkscrew looks this good it is hard not to demonstrate .
4 #### I really like this nozzle . It 's very well made and durable . I 've had it for 2 years now and it 's still as good as new . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is that I wish it had a shut off valve . To shut it off , you turn the nozzle to the end until it 's in the off position . Instead , I 'd like to be able to shut the water off without changing the spray setting . But it 's very high quality and looks like it will last for many years , which is hard to find in some products .
5 #### The first one I owned my teenage son tried using it on a limb that was too big and applied too much pressure which caused it to break . As far as I am concerned it was not the companies fault that this unit was abused . I keep it now for spare parts . I am very impressed with the second one I bought . It has paid for it 's self many times over and has never given me any problems when it is used properly . I am disabled with arthritis . I do not like heights . This unit is very easy to use and as it stands now I should get many more years of use from mine .
2 #### The magnet it 's OK , the price is also OK , but the screws that come with this thing are made of extremely soft metal , and they get damaged when screwed into wood . It 's a tiny screw with a flat head - not easy to find a replacement that would fit . I did pre - drill holes for them , and even being very careful with a screwdriver , I wasted 3 screws before finally being able to install this thing . Kitchen cabinets are usually made of really hard wood / board , not a drywall !
5 #### It fit my mower and it was just what it needed .
4 #### pic shows them as green , but are natural . I do n't care
5 #### Works great . I love the way it spins so effortlessly .
1 #### This is my second Raintrain . My first broke in the same fashion and I fixed it with $ 5 in parts and an afternoon . I love the concept and the functionality BUT ! ! The connection to the water hose is weak , weak plastic . Because I had seen it break at the connection before I added a quick disconnect and every time I moved the Raintrain I disconnected the hose . Alas , this also did not work and once again after 1 season of use I have a broken connection . The unit needs to be heavy to drag the hose someone please tell the designer to put the weight in the weak points .
5 #### I bought it as a back up to the one I already had which is about 18 years old so these are great tools now I have one * 00 grit and one with 3000 grit very happy
5 #### I have a few 16 foot measuring tapes , but it ca nt tell you how many times I have needed a slightly longer measuring tape . The thing I love about this 25 measuring tape is that it stays straight and does nt even try to bend for the first 7 . There is nothing more annoying than trying to measure something and the tape measure keeps bending down on you . I also like that the case is metal , which is much more durable than most of the plastic cases that companies seem to be putting measuring tapes in .
5 #### Quick review : I really like this vacuum . I was surprised at the quality . . . and at how well it does what it 's supposed to .
4 #### The bulbs are shorter than other Halogen 120V , 50W G8 bulbs I have bought in the past , which in my case made it a bit harder to install in the fixtures , although I would not consider that a problem . Installed in outdoor landscape light fixtures about a year ago and after considerable use in all kinds of weather none has failed . Excellent service by the seller and by Amazon .
5 #### The OXO Good Grips silicone spatula is the best spatula ever . Great size , great shape , and the tomato color is really cool . Sooo tired of all the glow - in - the - dark colors these things are being made in these days .
5 #### Works well with limes , lemons , and oranges . I have used a couple times and it works great ! ! !
5 #### Bought them before , came back for more . They are just great and best price .
5 #### This opener was extremely easy to program in one try . Excellent price and quality . About one third of the price that my local store sells them for .
5 #### I 've only had to plunge once so far , but it did the job . It certainly looks nicer than just having a plunger sitting out in the open .
5 #### I have some 9 " knockoffs which are decent enough . They have the silicone grips . I needed a 12 " pair and decided to go with this brand . Better quality and I prefer the stainless steel grips .
5 #### DeWalt . is a great brand . These hold up with no issues and works as intended . Just wish I 'd stop losing them ! They are cheap , but the price adds up if you are prone to losing your gear .
5 #### We researched hammocks and landed on this one and we 're glad we did . Comfy , large and a beautiful hammock . Installed easily .
5 #### These are a great fit on the standard wall sockets and light switches . I purchased this one to replace a yellowing white one that had been fitted to my dark grey garage work unit . This is hardly noticeable in the brownish black shade . Good sturdy plastic .
3 #### Little twigs stop the roll . Good work out alternative has good amount of resistance . Not useful over sloped or ditched lawns . Works well over flat lawns . Not as consistent nor provides neat cut edges . Sometimes ca n't cut longer and leaned grass even after multiple attempts . I preferred an electrical flat bed cutters ( GreenWorks 25022 12 Amp Corded 20 - Inch Lawn Mower ) over this one for both environmental and practical reasons .
3 #### I guess I expected fast results since the mosquitos have been very bad where we live because we did n't have a cold winter . The mosquitos have run us out of the yard and flower beds this year .
5 #### For a couple dollars , it 's definitely worth purchasing this aluminum line level rather than the cheap plastic junk you often see . I expect this to last me decades , and hopefully a lifetime .
3 #### It kills some fleas , Not all of Them . Probably need more than recommend . I used this to kill as many as I could then continued with a growth inhibitor to prevent the rest from breeding .
3 #### The scissors that came with my original Henckels knife set was so much nicer than this " replacement " knife . It 's a little flimsy , and does n't have the feel nor cutting ease I had hoped for this up - scale brand .
5 #### Holds a great edge , easy to sharpen and is a man sized knife . Looks good also . Worth the money . The 3 different blades fill most needs .
5 #### I do n't have the string algae that I 've had in the past so I guess it 's working .
5 #### Ok , this chainsaw is a bit on the weak side being electric , but the Oregon chain greatly improved the cutting performance . If you still have the original chain , spring for a replacement chain , it will certainly cut better and be safer too , no fighting the tool . Granted , my saw is probably 10 years old , but the chain has seen very little action . I have found that better quality cutting blades can make up for underpowered equipment .
4 #### This hose is probably overkill for keeping my truck tires inflated but I am glad to have it . The rubber stays flexible year round which makes it easy to drag around the garage and then coil up for storage .
5 #### Looks good in our enclosed trailer ! Mounts easy and holds nicely in bracket ! hope to never use it ! ;)
5 #### This works great for picking up dog hair . Battery is long lasting and the beater bar is a bonus . I bought this originally to use in our off grid cabin but it is great for home too .
5 #### GARLIC MAD . GARLIC SMASH . I was cooking for my friends , and going through about 3 heads of garlic . Since I wanted speed , I did peel the garlic first . Then , I pushed it through the Oxo garlic press . PERFECTLY pressed garlic in seconds , with very little effort on my palms , AND it did n't fly all over the counter . I had a very bad taste in my mouth from the awful Oxo V stand grater , which was a piece of garbage , and broke very quickly . I did n't think I was ready to love again . I think I 'm ready now . I got a text from the husband just yesterday , " This one is so much easier to clean than your old one . " I was easily able to fit three small cloves of garlic , or one very large one in the chute . Also , I have found that if you take the stuff that was left behind in the feed chute , and fold it over , and re - press it , you get even more garlic out of it . For the heft of it on my hand , the power of the lever , and the size of the garlic feed chute , I would give this little press every star I can find .
5 #### Love this little object , even though the very small particles from my tea escape it . I still use it all the time
1 #### Fit fine installing was easy . Failed after 2 months . Not happy .
5 #### Great dust bag for any table saw . Keeps dust down in garage .
5 #### Makes great espresso . Easy to use and clean . Right size for one person . Highly recommend .
5 #### -I had this pan for a while and just used it the other day . I like it because it 's deep , which allows room for various fillings . I made a caramel pecan tart , which I have made many times , and the pan worked great , no sticking . It can be tricky to separate the pan from the tart so non stick is important to keep the crust intact . I also have the Nordic Ware big round spatula which I use to separate the crust from the bottom of the pan . I have many Nordic Ware products and recommend them highly .
1 #### There are better options than this . It barely caught anything and the stench is AWFUL . We actually scraped them pretty quick due to the whole HOUSE smell that it caused . Two of these made our 1500 Sq Ft house reek to the point of nausea . Maybe for outside , but not for indoor use in my opinion .
5 #### Ordered the LU87R010 based on Amazon reviews . 10 bucks more than the Diablo D1024X I have been getting @ Depot , and worth every penny of it . Love this blade , cuts 1 " X & 2 " X spf like butter . Good finish with proper fence alignment with no drift . Great general purpose rip blade .
5 #### Bought this on Amazon a coup , e of years ago . Nordic Ware is THE name in Bundt pans and this is the granddaddy of Them all . I rarely purchase non - stick bakeware - sharp tools ruin them- but knew that no knives would get near this baby , so I gave it a try . Wonderful ! The pan is perfectly heavy to evenly cook your cakes . The nonstick surface allows everything to release with no fuss . And since no one is allowed to use or wash this pan but me , I 'm able to protect the nonstick surface to ensure years of scratch - free use . ( Remember to use the right type of scrubbie for non - stick pans . ) I highly recommend Nordic Ware Original Platinum !
4 #### Never used this before .... trying for the 1st time in my koi pond ! ! I 'll be back at the end of spring to give a complete review ! !
4 #### This is a pretty complete door making set . The description on Amazon lists bits that are completely wrong as of 7/28/08 which will hopefully be corrected . This set includes a panel raising bit ( no back cutter ) a match pair of rail and stile bits ( coping and grooving)- all ogie profile . In addition to the basic door bits this set includes an outside edge bit which put a radius on the front side edge of the door and a beveled undercut on the inside of the door perimeter . The last of the five bits is edge glue bit for gluing up the raised panel - nice in itself . Nice complete set - good quality bits , nice box ( opens kind of funky ) . Ca n't recommed it for use with Freud 's 2.5 hp router . The panel raising bit in particular and the outside door radiusing and beveling bits take a lot of hp to swing , even taking partial depths of cuts ( which you 'd have to do even with a 3.5 hp unit)is too much for the 2.5 hp unit . Because the outside radius bit has no guide bearing and the transition between of the shape of the raduis and door lip it is hard to get a straight edge in to set the fence - the radius starts immediately with no flat to use the straight edge against . Not surprisingly this is a table only set - only Paul Bunyan would try bits in this set with a hand held router .
4 #### Great exhaust fan . A bit tricky install on my type of window , but I made it work . I may buy another one as this is an indoor pool area .
5 #### Great , I used the product around base of deck skirting . Varmints ca n't dig in .
5 #### Works great ! Been using it for weeks now . Gives a very fine cut and is easy to close . Highly recommend .
5 #### I bought this insert to use in my DeWalt 746 tablesaw and have found it to be a very high quality accessory . When my insert plate arrived I was pleased to note that it was dead flat ! Installation was very easy - using the four leveling screws I was able to bring this insert perfectly level with my saw table all the way around . Once adjusted , the side - to - side and front - to - back adjustment screws took all of the play out of this insert . I also appreciate the smooth surface which allows my stock to glide across it with little effort . The finger hole allows easy and quick removal for blade changes , etc . My only complaint is that I wish it were yellow . Mine is bright orange , but I can live with that ! Several people have complained about losing the ability to use their splitter with this insert . I noted in the instructions that if you are installing this on a DW746 saw , all you need to do is bandsaw a small kerf in the rear edge of the plate ( in line with the table saw blade kerf ) and you will have a slot to mount your splitter through . This should not be too difficult to accomplish for a woodworker ... All in all I was thrilled with the performance and level of quality found in this design and I would highly recommend it to anyone with the DeWalt 746 saw .
5 #### This natural brush cleans so much better than those plastic vegetable brushes . This brush cleans potatoes really well . So glad that I bought this vegetable brush and it was priced well .
5 #### Outstanding performance in a 450 sq ft apartment . I can come home to a 97 degree apartment at the end of the day , turn on the fan and knock the temperature down to the mid-70s ( evening outside temperature ) in less than an hour . For the price and ease of installation , it 's a perfect alternative to a fan that has to be built - in to the ceiling . In terms of noise , this fan is as loud ( no more , no less ) as other whole house fans when run on high speed . You 're going to get this loud hum with any unit that can move the air out of a whole house very quickly . On low , it 's a mere whisper yet creates a noticeable air flow .
5 #### Works great , should last a long long time . Oxo makes great stuff .
5 #### Works great ! Really sharp ! I have only used it 2x since I purchased it but it had exceeded my expectations so far !
5 #### I could n't find a vegetable brush anywhere in my zip code , so I ordered this one . It 's much better quality than any other one I 've ever had , and I love that I can toss it in the dishwasher ! I will definitely buy another if this one ever wears out or gets eaten by a dog .
5 #### This LARGE Kangaroo is as well made as the smaller one I have used for years . The hard bottom is practical for heavier loads ; the bottom of my previous 30 - gal . Kangaroo was the first part to give out . Because it 's so big , it does tend to get dragged around a bit . My previous 30 - gal was a Fiskars and made of a Tyvec - like material -- this one is made of material more like the smaller Kangaroos .
1 #### This is the first product I 've ever given one star . Within a year , the handle became loose , and after extended wrangling I was able to get Chantal to send me a new screw . However , the screw was not the problem with the handle . Within another year ( thank goodness for extended warranty through platinum card ) , the welding had come apart and the handle fell right off , spilling hot water all over the floor . Fortunately I did n't get scalded . I am still trying to get warranty service , replacement , refund , whatever from Chantal . They 've had me send photos but no word yet . Update July 2015 : They never sent me a refund or any acknowledgement that they received the photos . Got tired and gave up .
5 #### I purchase this metal detector because i just purchased a new home and i could not find the well . If you ever had a well you would understand the need to know where it is . Especially in the winter should you ever have a problem . So when i received it i tried to find the well using logic to where it came out of the basement . No luck so i jus went random from house out and when i hit some signals i marked them . I went back to the signals and fount the strongest on and started digging . apx 16 " down i dound the well cap . I also used it when the contractor that was replacing the sidewalks and steps to my house . The dimond cutter uses a lot of water and while cutting the steps off there was a ton of mud and water below the stems that were being cut off . The contractor lost a bolt out of his cutter and was stopped . He looked for it but could not find it . I went and got the metal detector and within a minute i located some metal and he reached down in the mud and pulled out theis 3 " long bolt . It paid for itsel just with those 2 times i needed it .
5 #### mounted on my wall to hang scarves ! I had one of these for many years and decided I needed another . works perfectly
5 #### This is great product that I have found that control algae in my back yard fish pond . I have a 500 gallons in ground fish pond and all I need is one of the Barley bag underneath the water falls . In one week it will sink down to the bottom and as it decay it will produce a chemical that kills the algae . My fish pond water is crystal clear without any algae , this make my filter system runs better .
2 #### I 'm sorry to say the top would never close . And i had several friends try as well . Checked the comment boards and people were helpful but still did n't work . Needless to say it went in the garage sale .
5 #### Holds the dog food for my Rotty which I can keep in the kitchen for easy access
5 #### My Granddaughter is so interested in space , this was perfect for her ! She uses it everyday when she eats . Beautiful , very informative !
4 #### Been useing these vacuum bags for many years they are good quality and the price here was very good wold recommend to others
4 #### Works , aromatic ! Heavy to hang , appears to work well after two days .
4 #### it is a whisk . Easy to hold and it works .
3 #### i bought this based on the many positive reviews . i 'm not sure it is working . . . the dials have not moved in the last week ... looks the same again ... the dials still have not moved . it has been six months . i think itz broken . thanks for shipping junk ! ! same in the winter as the summer . it looks good though ! !
4 #### old album is one of my favorites . Lost old CD and love that i do n't have to worry about that ever again since it is all on Amazon music now .
5 #### A really easy to use and high quality system . I 'm glad I bought this one instead of trying cheaper and less effective products .
5 #### I love this bowl ! It is the perfect size for mixing brownies , pancakes , etc . especially since it has a pour spout . The rubber bottom helps keep it in place , too . I would definitely purchase this again !
5 #### Bought this to automate my outdoor fountain . Works great . Tons of options in the settings . * * * NOTE : The instructions state : " Select ON , OFF , or AUTO ... " which makes it sound like there 's three options . There 's actually 4 apparent options displayed . You can select ON and OFF , but when you toggle to the other options you actually get either " ON AUTO " or " AUTO OFF " on the display . Which means to start the AUTO program with your plugged in devices either ON right now or OFF right now . Then the AUTO programming takes over . Initially it was a bit confusing and the instructions were n't clear in this one area .
5 #### So glad we purchased this , great for the many pests we 've had this summer , I just wish it was easier to clean .
5 #### The design of the head on these pliers makes them very useful when you have a hard time gripping with standard pliers .
5 #### The Freud Diablo Series of saw blades is my favorite for two main reasons .... value and clean cuts .
4 #### Works very well , and keeps salad crisp and fresh if left in the fridge with lid . Only left one star off because it is bulky and hard to store ( at least in my small kitchen ) and just do n't make the mistake of letting lettuce sit out in this overnight , its very hard to wash the green strainer the next day .
4 #### It 's just the right size for handling , not too big or awkward for smaller hands . It 's a good purchase , glad I bought it !
3 #### i LOVE all my oxo stuff and the company really stands behind their products , but my garlic press broke after a few years at the hinge of all places ... right through the thick metal part ... crate and barrel did say that that is how long they are suppose to last though , so ... you be the judge !
5 #### This works great at expanding your table . It took less then 10min to install . I wish this came with the tablesaw , but at least it 's priced affordable .
4 #### the amazon price was right on these filters , but I ordered the wrong size . I am trying out the 800 's now to see how they work . so far so good and my AC coil and air handler fan wheel are not getting dusty either . but , the lesser 3 M filter frames are not nearly as rigid as the ones with the back side reinforcement . either way , 3 M makes good stuff though - imo .
5 #### I bought this for my mother for Mother 's Day and she just loves it . While not a bird feeder or bird house , it 's just a very cute ornament to hang outside in her garden . Well made with lots of detailing , just as the picture shows . There are other wooden bird houses shown with the Noah 's ark that I am considering getting my mother for her birthday . I 'm very pleased with my purchase . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/When - I - Dream / dp/1608605809 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">When I Dream</a >
1 #### This is not a magnetic tack hammer . It is a split shank tack hammer on one side , zero magnet ability on the other . It is a nice weight in my hand so keeping as another hammer can always be used . Still seeking a magnetic one but have figured out other means to an end .
3 #### I bought a crosscut sled and this support does not support the weight of the sled . Really disappointed in that I will have to find a way to keep it up . It drops about 1/8 " and does not give me confidence in the sleds ability to give me accurate cuts .
5 #### Its good . I just got it and I am going to use it right now . You must have it at your home .
1 #### I did not receive the ones in the picture , I got some cheap knock off attachments . I bought these to clean my stairs from my shedding dog . He is white , my carpets are maroon , not a good combination . I was sent a wet - vac water nozzle , not a carpet /upholstery nozzle . It may seem petty to you , but a wet vac attachment will not pick up anything on stairs , it is designed at a different angle to be used on a wand extension with you standing up and sucking up water ! ! This was a total waste of my money
5 #### Ordered and received very very fast . Happy with the bulbs !
3 #### We have a few Woodstock Chimes around our property and they are all great . Best chimes on the market . I bought this one based on some of the other reviews , but it is tiny with a faint sound . The little fella ca n't be more than 10 inches high & very small diameter tubes that do not produce enough music for our ears .
4 #### These table extensions are nice to have when cutting a larger piece of wood and not having another set of hands to assist you . Setup is fairly simple . I did end up adjusting the mounting brackets by making the extension bind up a little to prevent the extensions from sliding out every time the saw is tipped over .
5 #### This unit is exacty what I needed . It 's simple to program and it works . And the price is right . I would definitely order it again .
5 #### These measuring spoons are very well made and appear as though they will last . I detest plastic measuring spoons and stainless always ensures that they will clean well with no residue or dullness . The handles feel good and seem to be holding up well in cleaning . Beyond that , what else can you say about measuring spoons ?
1 #### I followed the instructions , used good soil , bought a healthy Roma tomato plant . It bloomed waaaay after all my more traditionally planted tomatoes ... And the fruits themselves would turn black and rot on the bottom before they would ripen . Everyone I talked to after buying one said they have never had any luck with them , and tomatoes are pretty darn hard to mess up .
5 #### I so missed the broken skimmer I had for years that came with my wok , and finally ordered this one . It is typical of OXO utensils .... sturdy and well - made . So happy to have this upgrade and know it will give me years of good use .
5 #### Cuts clean enough for seemless glue joints . Plus you can have it resharpened . Worth the schekels . I was using Freud not anymore .
5 #### It works perfect , just be careful that it stays well greased inside .
4 #### It 's a Fiske good quality and less expensive here than in one of the big box stores
3 #### This Dewalt set was bought as a gift for my son and so far he is happy with the quality of this set .
5 #### These clips are good replacement clips for Closetmaid shelves . The package says they are for mason , but they worked well in enough in our drywall . Instructions are printed on the plastic bag , so it was an easy and quick installation .
5 #### Great salad spinner . This product is very sturdy and easy to use . Allows for large quantities of salad .
2 #### Hummingbirds do n't like it . Went back to boiling sugar and adding this for color then they liked it .
5 #### As we have a patio and plantings that create an uneven shape in our backyard , I was looking for a sprinkler that would save me from moving it several times a day or having to use multiple sprinklers . This sprinkler handily did the trick . The adjustments are easy to make and the base is very stable . It 's even easy to make adjustments while in operation without getting wet . A nice fact is that the speed and distance correlate - when set to longer distances , the head rotates more slowly , allowing the lower volume of closer in drops to collect , promoting even watering .
4 #### These are neat . They make good coffee and look nice sitting on your stove top when not in use . They also make good coffee , it 's not really espresso , it 's sort of halfway between espresso and coffee . But for the price and if you 're a coffee nerd its another neat way to make coffee .
4 #### This works , I may have expected too much , but it stops quite a lot of the saw dust and is worth using .
5 #### As Usual , nice quality couplings from Milton . Would definitely recommend this product to anybody needing a high quality " M " Style coupler .
5 #### Excellent pry bar . Unlike other flat pry bars this is designed so that you can hammer on the curved end , which is very helpful .
5 #### Works great and a nice addition to my tool collection . well made and very easy to use . I had to make a bunch of custom louvered doors for storage access behind the kneewalls of the upstairs of my cape cod and this was perfect for sturdy assembly and turned out a top quality product l
5 #### Solid , simple , conventional . I do n't have much more to say but am required to say more in a review , so here you go .
5 #### OUTSTANDING . I NEED TO SPRAY THE TREES IN MY YARD , AND THIS WORKS GREAT . I PUT THE " BUG KILLER " IN THE CONTAINER , ATTACH THE HOSE , TURN IT ON AND " FIRE AWAY " . IT HAS A DIRECT STREAM OF APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET . ITS JUST WHAT I NEED .
5 #### Keep one of these at the top of the basement steps . You have tools handy for little jobs around the house , do n't need a tool drawer and do n't have to go into basement or garage when you just need a screwdriver . Plenty strong . If you 're going to load it up , screw it into studs . make your own mounting holes if needed . And add a washer .
5 #### This 4 " wrench has a home in my " EDC " emergency bag . Along with a small tape measure , this size wrench is often overlooked as a " must have " item . Until you have one on hand , you do n't realize who often you will use .
5 #### I LOVE this pan ! ! I wish Nordic Ware made the small size ones with the high sides like this one ... maybe they do & I have to find them . The high sides gives me more versatility for making different foods , from quiche to tarts and whatever else I dream up .
5 #### My girlfriend loves it . It 's built to last and works well
5 #### Used a s a replacement drinking water hose for my RV . This hose is high quality and I could not find a better price anywhere . If you need a good drinking water hose look no further .
3 #### did the job , but not what I expected . The weave was very open . Not like the old fashion burlap bags that we used to get grain in . Disappointing .
4 #### This is a great flashlight and a fair price . I 've had a lot of flashlights lately fail at the " push button " switch in the butt end of the flashlight and finally just gave up on them and went back to the Gold Standard of Flashlights . Maglites have never disappointed me yet . Fine construction . Superlative workmanship . They work when needed .
5 #### I lost the one I had for years and purchased this one , there are subtle differences than my original but the cutting mechanism is the same . I found my other one within a week after this one arrived . Do n't buy the cheaper ones , this is the only one you need .
5 #### Great blades . I use them in Rockwell BladeRunner and they cut VERY smoothly . Blades are strong and the small sharp teeth are perfect for fine work . Very good price point for this 5 - pack .
4 #### ... The design of the " head " means that it 's limited in its functionality as a hand - held vacuum . The roller head does n't come off -- Eureka should have designed it so that it could be interchanged with other heads or just removable so that the hand - held vacuum can reach smaller spaces . Otherwise , I 'm happy so far * knock on wood * .
5 #### I thought all peelers were the same until I used this at a friend 's house . I purchased the same exact one as soon as I got home . It peels potatoes so smoothly with ease , I could peel potatoes all day with this peeler .
4 #### This thing seems to work OK . I use them inside a micro shop vac ( the 1.5 gallon one ) and they make sure that when I suck up sawdust it stays in the shop vac rather than being blown straight out of the back of it . I tried using bags but it 's surprising just how little sawdust it takes to fill the bags inside these tiny shop vacs . Using the filter seems to work but it does seem to cost some suction , suction I can ill afford to lose . I think maybe my hopes of using a small shop vac to gather up sawdust was overly optimistic . My 8 gallon unit works just fine but the little tiny one seems underpowered and putting a filter in the suction process does n't help the power any .
3 #### I purchased it in order to bring my order up to the free - shipping level . It is a nice item considering the low price .
5 #### yet another kitchen item we now ca n't imagine living without . this model is easy to use and clean . the pan is as heavy as our 18/10 Cuisinart pots , while the top is made of lighter stuff . it 's nice that the gasket and valves are replaceable ( though it looks like they 'll last a long time ) ; i 'd definitely recommend this model over the ones with a long handle : as easy ( or easier ) to lift and carry between stove and sink and much easier to store ; the manual pressure release valve can be safely operated with a bare finger as the steam vents around the conical baffle ... and it 's easy to control , so i do n't see any the advantage to the slightly more expensive " top " dial model .
5 #### Had a 30 y / o Sears Craftsman 1//2 " drill which finally bit the dust during a project drilling 52 x 1.25 " holes through 4x4s . Read the reviews and bought this Dewalt . When I opened the box I thought " whoa ! They sent me a 3/8 " drill by mistake . " Well , it was actually the 1/2 " drill but in what I 'm used to as a 3/8 " ' form factor . ' I inserted the same 1.25 " fostner bit and was amazed at how much torque this drill had . The Craftsman was struggling to drill a hole in 2 mins whereas this guy was blowing through a hole in 30 seconds or less . I 'm very happy with this purchase !
5 #### JUST WHAT I NEED FOR KITCHEN CEILING FAN AT A VERY REASONABLE PRICE .
5 #### Got this for our oven in our camper . They fit perfect !
5 #### It 's good quality . Mine keep " walking off " . So I 'm sure I will be buying again .
5 #### Have been using it for a few months now and it 's perfectly sized for use with paperback and hardback edition books , just have to clamp onto multiple pages if using with a paperback . The two lighting settings do make a difference .
5 #### I call these my humpback whale grips . They are my " go to " grips in many situations . I am a welder / fabricator and have almost all of vice grips styles . I use these for all sorts of things . Very well made and useful tool .
5 #### They work exactly as advertised . They keep the algae down in my water bucket for my sheep and horse . I use them in my duck pond as well .
5 #### Very pleased . Makes for quick hash browns with minimum cleanup . It is easy to store and fits on most bowls without slipping around with the indentations along the bottom edge .
5 #### Good breaker . Bought this one for spare but had used one I bought previously to replace a weak one that kept tripping with my power compressor in the garage . Fits perfectly in my Siemens 200A box
2 #### Too difficult to use and you better have very small potatoes to start with ! ! It takes a lot of strength to cut fresh potatoes !
3 #### Good product and quality but would have gotten it on my next trip to town if I knew it would take so long to get .
5 #### Great metal detector for the price . Found what I was looking for in no time at all and it 's easy to use considering I had never used one before .
4 #### Purchased this Hammock and it works perfectly . I would highly recommend this product and seller . No issues , very high quality product , as expected . Would rate a five , but reserve those for ungodly excellence , which is basically unattainable so you should understand .
2 #### Chipped the first day using after splitting a log and hitting a small rock on the ground . Use for strictly wood !
5 #### Was just what I was looking for ! The price was good . I use these for spreading butter , mayo , peanut butter etc .
5 #### who knew a pizza cutter would be so good and so much fun to use . Friday night is pizza night . We use the ken forkish pizza book to make the dough and this to cut the pizza .
5 #### I am addicted to cast iron skillets and now I am addicted to cask iron grillings ... once you 've used this grill , you 'll forget all those fancy - smancy ones ...
5 #### great popcorn maker . Never need / want to go get movie theater popcorn again . :) I prefer to melt the butter and pour it on myself , after the popping is done , and avoid the suggested idea to put the butter on the top of the lid for melting and distribution . Works just as it says and if given attention , no burning and no seeds every time . well recommended
5 #### If you bake cookies , this is just the best spatula ever
5 #### Great tool for clearing brush , limbing and clearing small saplings . I have disabilities that make it hard for me to use my hands and arms but these make cutting a breeze !
5 #### Its handle is made with rubber for easy grip , and it features two blades for easy peeling of apples , oranges . lemons , and potatoes .
5 #### A must - have for any graphic designer who uses PMS to communicate with vendors / manufacturers or clients ..... I had an old book given free to me from 2008 that did n't match my screen .... finally , when upgrading to this new book and the Creative Cloud , I was immediately about to see almost the same color on my screen as in the book ....
5 #### What can you say , works great in my Siemens P2030L1150CU , no issues for me .
3 #### It 's a nicely made multimeter ( much better than digital ) . However , I most frequently measure voltage in batteries , and the 10V range is just too wide for that . I 'd rather have 3V or 5V instead of 10V.
5 #### Great . Easy to use . Good clamping power . Highly recommend it .
5 #### This is a very well made square layout tool . Strong and not flimsy , has all the measurements and conversions numbers etched into the metal with yellow highlight to see better . I like this because it is small and easy to work with in one hand and fit into small spaces . For what I paid on Amazon for this I highly recommend it , great deal .
5 #### I replaced an old tarnished brass fixture that had been there for 8yrs .. The new light with a semi gloss black finish looks great and weathers wonderfully .. D Strickland
5 #### This is an excellent mini router table . I use it to make doll house edging it works . Very nice table Thanks .
5 #### Love these measuring cups because ... -They have and angled opening to allow for easy dunking into a narrower container -There is a halfway mark on each measuring cup so half recipes are easy ! -The numbers do n't fade off !
2 #### After receiving this product , which had chipped paint , I noticed something worse than the lack the proper mounting hole pattern ( look carefully at the picture , it shows an OEM blade , not THIS blade , which only has a square hole ) . So what 's worse than a blade that is n't even what 's pictured ? One that is completely dull . For the $ 16 shipped cost , I would still have had to go get it sharpened for another $ 15 . Instead I spent $ 19 at Sears ( yes , I had to go into the store ) and get a real OEM blade . Which , BTW , is sharp AND has the proper mounting pattern . Seriously , if you 're trying to save a buck , just take your blade off after your next mowing and go get it sharpened .
5 #### Purchased as a spare chain for my 18 " Poulan Wild Thing chain saw . The color match system was very helpful .
3 #### they smoke better than some other brands and the taste is ok . You can get them cheaper at the store , but for the convenience of having it shipped to you , may be worth it .
4 #### These pruners were bough to trim small bushes and plants in my yard . They are n't the sharpest because any bushes that have a small anount of diameter to them makes it difficult to cut through . I would just use these for really small diameter objects . It has a locking mechanism to it to keep them in the closed position when not in use . It has a comfortable grib that makes it easy to hold and prune . The curved tip is great for hooking around small branches that you do n't want to cut . I recommend these for some starter pruners .
4 #### NICE VAC JUST THE RIGHT SIZE FOR A SMALLER HOME . OPTED FOR THE WIND UP POWER CORD OVER THE AUTO POWER CORD WIND UP , BECAUSE OF THE UNIT POWER AND WEIGHT . WORKS WELL ON ALL FLOOR SURFACES .
5 #### This skimmer is large enough to use in my deep fryer and fits well in most of my pots and pans . I like this much better than the concentric circle design of other skimmers which do n't work well with many foods . This skimmer has wholes to let liquid go through without losing the food you are straining .
4 #### Very impressed . At first like EVERYONE states , it may look " cheap " but it 's quite a sturdy lil tool . I suctioned it to my countertop near the sink . Have to give it a lil elbow grease with some tough potatoes but then they shoot right out into my bowl I have in the sink . Deep fried fries as soon as I recieved it !
3 #### I 've been using conventional American - made nozzles for many decades and although my wife likes the comfort of the large - rubber - wrapped grip on this , I will say it does n't last as long as nozzles that are still hanging around our house after decades of use . That being said , she 's the boss and the Bon - Aire Original lasted 3 years . Buying the next one tonight while I complain about the too - high - price for something this cheap .
4 #### A perfect fit and replacement for my wet - n - dry cartridge filter . I use a cloth bag over this filter instead of the foam sleeve . The bag being much easier to clean and lasts longer .
5 #### I saw mostly hard woods on my table saw . Occasionally I resaw 2X4 's and I would overheat my motor with the old blade . This one is night and day contrast . There is a marked difference in noise reduction and ease of ripping . I would often incur burn marks and an occasional problem with my stock riding up if I was n't careful with the old blade . This saw blade made a vast differance . Reclaim the joy of woodworking and ripping on your table saw and buy this blade .
5 #### I ordered 2 of these for my parents to keep in their gazebo . They use them to put the rocker cushions in when not in use , and they usually use the boxes as side tables , although they can be extra seating when needed . Only drawback is the color -- they wanted white or a color like blue or red , but all that was available in this size is the putty . Still does the job though and did not cost an arm and a leg . These are not the petite looking deck boxes you see -- they are too large for my front porch , but plenty large enough for cushion storage if you have the space .
3 #### Rarely use loose tea so have not used this a lot .
5 #### This is a study utility bowl . Makes a great double boiler of a sauce pan . Amco makes a quality product .
4 #### It is important to note that the size range for the stile of the cabinet is 1.5 to 2 inches ... the stiles ( vertical frame piece ) on my cabinets were slightly under 1.5 , so I had to use shims with these clamps , which is a bit of a pain . Nonetheless , they do a great job of drawing the cabinet frames completely tight , while allowing you to make slight adjustments towards and away from the wall , so that the alignment is perfect ... and then allow you to drill and insert trim - head screws to keep that perfect alignment . I guess my only complaint / suggestion would be for Pony to either make another model for smaller frames , or extend the size range down just a bit .
4 #### " SQUEEZY " and " PULLY " that is the deck building duo names for my wife and I. We reconditioned our large deck with all new 16 ft boards . This tool was awesome . We have super straight boards now and it looks fabulous ... darling . I have no suggested design changes nor do I have anything really negative to say about it . It works exactly as I had hoped . So when she and I worked together using this tool , we primarily used it for squeezy work pushing the loose board closer to the previously secured board . I would recommend this to anyone who needs to install deck boards . It is not as easy to use by 1 person as I read in an earlier review .
4 #### They were easy to install . But I 've installed cabinets before . They came without any instructions . It did n't bother me but its got to be a little difficult for a first - timer . They are very solid . I had heavy iron doors and these are working quite well .
5 #### I have owned this sander for about a year and have been very pleased with it . It is a very comfortable tool to use , and with the hook and loop system makes it very easy to change the sand paper .
5 #### This was an exact fit for my shop vac I have no complaints whatsoever when the filter has worked correctly I would purchase this product again and will when I need it it certainly beats going to one of the box stores and walking up and down the lands trying to figure out where to find it have a great day thanks for reading my review
2 #### Do n't buy a Feeder without Bee / Wasp Guards ! You will just be inviting pests and they drive the HBirds away ! THis one does not have the Guards !
5 #### These blades were sharp and were a perfect fit for my Ridgid Jointer . They fit perfect in each mounting slot and did not need any special adjustments . Of course on subsequent sharpenings , I will need to adjust . It was nice to install new blades and easily get them lined up . Now to take my current blades and get them sharpened .
5 #### This stuff is like gold . I definitely recommend it for all growers .
4 #### Received this item as described . Shipping was moderate speed . It 's flimsy but does work ok . Ca n't really complain for the price .
3 #### takes alot to get them to work but I have irrigation nightmares daily so after 3 yrs , hey they work home owners will have better time do nt be discouraged by the pressure issues and the fact you may need to have a mounting t posts and get clamps to clamp the poly tube leading to it etc . Its not easy for homeowners unless you are super handy but you can do it email me if you need to I 'll walk you thru it
4 #### Long string so it can hang low if necessary . Actually , seems really good . Seeds hold well inside the sock and does not get soaked with rain . Finches like it a lot and can hold on to it - they even hang upside down . Price has gone up a lot , I got it for 9.50 .
5 #### Being a writer , of novels and poetry , I love creating new things and this lets me play around with some ideas while I am cooking or waiting for something to finish in the kitchen ! These are great , although I do with it came with some more personal pronouns ; there was only one ' his ' and ' her ' and a LOT of ' me ' and ' I ' LOL . But it 's fun to make stuff up , and the kids have a great time with them , too !
5 #### Bought one of these last summer and love it . Used it so much that I have since retired it and purchased the Jumbo Joe grill . This is the perfect sized grill for 2 people and smaller amounts of food . Well worth the money , does n't use much charcoal and you can some nice grilling . I wanted to try some more advanced grilling so I moved up to the Jumbo so I could have hot & cool zones and more space for larger items . Get one !
5 #### i have a bunch of these - mostly plastic , but recently I picked up the stainless steel version and it 's awesome . Solid , should last for a LONG time . It 's great for use with a cast iron pan - you can really scrape up any bits that might be sticking on , which is a challenge with the plastic ones . It 's * much * thinner than the plastic version as well . If you 're using a nonstick pan you 'll obviously want the plastic one so it does n't scratch it up , but if you are going to use this in a metal pan , go with the metal turner . If you have nonstick AND metal pans , I recommend getting one of each .
5 #### Quick for canning water bath only but ca n't use for pressure cooking . The pressure cooker had a slip that says not to use these burners .
2 #### The original , could possibly be the best true pocket sized knife ever made for daily farm utility . A knife with multiple blades is an asset when far from a home or shop . Scraping bolt threads , cutting belts and hoses , striping wire , cutting rope and twine , opening feed sacks , scraping battey terminals , on and on . The originals were beyond rugged , and often were still going strong with the handles worn slick , and blade tips broken off and re - ground . For the guy that needed a rugged , inexpensive , trust worthy knife , they were unbeatable . My Grandad , a farmer , has a junk drawer with 3 of the older Old Timer 34s . Completely worn out . They served him so well , he ca n't bear to throw them out . Those three represent well over two decades of life on the farm . The new 34 's ? He showed me 2 . Both had horrible side - side wobble with each blade , and the main clip blades would no longer snap shut . They also would just fall open if held upside down . Total garbage . Did he give them a hard life ? You better beleive it . Just like the older ones . How long did the new ones last ? 6 months . Are the new ones sufficient for the average guy to carry , and whittle or cut an apple with ? I have no doubt . They 'd last forever in that capacity . Are they true tools like they once were ? Not a chance .
5 #### So far so good , I 'll let you know more in the spring . Cord is a tad short .
2 #### I purchased this based on the reviews . Amazon reviews are usually spot on ! ! The truth is I do n't get how this receives any 5 star reviews . This thing pops the kernels but the popcorn it makes , tastes terrible ! It makes mushy , chewy , microwave tasting popcorn . I do n't care that it pops all the kernels because the results were so bad that the entire contents of the cheap plastic bowl went in the trash ! ! I have returned this and went back to the Presto hot air popper . I get great poppcorn everytime .
5 #### I hope I never have to use it . I almost started a fire playing with electronics . So now I have a work bench , and this thing is right on it .
5 #### This helps me to peel potatoes so much faster . Love this device .
4 #### Way better than the other guys ! I 've used a couple different other brands and they tend to blow apart after a while . This one is hanging in there , primarily due to it 's one piece design .
3 #### It 's beautifully built , it works exactly as advertised , for SOME foods it 's unbeatable . But do n't throw away your other kitchenware . You have to bring the steam up , cook the food , then let it cool down till the steam vent drops ( in most cases ) . So I finally had to compare TOTAL cooking times against stovetop and microwave for one cup of rice . It ai n't that great , folks . When you count time to come to a boil , time to cook , and the cooldown time for the pressure cooker , -Pot on the stove , 25 minutes . -Pyrex covered bowl in the microwave , 22 minutes . -Pressure cooker , 24 minutes . Now , with the pot you have to watch it till it comes to a boil and check at around 15 - 16 minutes to see if it 's done . With the pressure cooker , you have to monitor it for the steam coming up , set the heat to the proper temperature to make the pressure gauge rock , turn it off at the specified time , and then watch for the valve to drop , in this case about ten minutes . With the microwave , you watch till it boils , set the time and cut the power back to 10 % , and then walk away . The pressure cooker DOES do whole grains and beans in half the TOTAL time , but that cooldown really cuts down its advantage .
2 #### Can not discern any extra effectiveness in attracting mosquitoes . Save your money .
5 #### I will keep it short simple my company runs 45 - 50 of these saws every day i would nt buy anything other than this saw its light powerful and never dies if you keep a sharp blade and lots of oil in it
4 #### This little vacuum is great ! It 's lightweight , the hose is flexible , the motor is powerful , what more could you want ... except a better floor tool for the carpets . But that can be had for a small price here on Amazon . Go Vacuum has a 1 & 1/4 inches DELUXE FLOOR BRUSH that fits this Mighty Mite perfectly . I ordered it with the vacuum , after reading the reviews here I knew I 'd need it . They 're both great ! I vacuumed as soon as I unpacked and assembled the Mighty Mite , and I was done in no time . There was no moving furniture , this goes under and behind everything so easily . My only complaint , and the reason I held back a star , is the smell . Fortunately it dissipates quickly once you 're done vacuuming . And I 'm hoping that as the machine ages the smell will disappear .
5 #### Purchased this item about six weeks ago after reading mostly good reviews on it . I had to bring the bowl part of our birdbath closer to the house so the heater would be near an electrical outlet . I set the bowl on top of a planter and that worked out well . Some of the water does evaporate each day , but not a lot . I keep it filled and it is handy when there is snow on the ground as I just shovel some snow into the birdbath and the heater melts it . That way I do n't have to go into the house to get water in the watering can and take it back to the feeder . The birds do n't seem to use the birdbath much when there is snow on the ground . I think I read somewhere that they eat snow , for their water . I did not see any birds using the birdbath for a couple weeks . I guess it takes them time to discover it . After that I started seeing birds using it . Much to my surprise , one of the first birds to use it was a robin . There was snow on the ground that day and it was twenty degrees out . Because of that , I say the heater brought on Spring here . If you happen to buy one of these heaters , keep the receipt as the heater has a three year warranty , which I felt was very good .
4 #### This design is your basic weed pulling device , so you ca n't go wrong . Like the arrowhead and hand ax , it features time tested design and materials of construction . The Ames Eagle from Amazon will lighten your summer work .
5 #### Filtrete is a great product from 3 M and I only use them in my house . When I change my filter as needed , you can see all the dirts it traps and it traps a lot of dirt . The shipping is great and I got it quickly .
3 #### Is not an LED bulb . I was kinda disappointed when I received this .
2 #### Ugh . As soon as it arrived , I had to first peel about 10 inches of sticky strong putty glue from the removable bottom piece in order to get that darned cardboard off . ( Seriously , the ribbons and ribbons of glue were about the size of a small plate , when one dot to secure it would do . Geez , you 'd think this was Ft . Knox gold . ) I 'm not a weakling but spent several minutes carefully tugging hard around the edges of the removable bottom to get off that cardboard and glue . In the process the very , very thin removable bottom section bent like a feather in a breeze . It now does n't fit tight in the bottom of tart pan and nothing could return it to its original shape . This is the first piece of Nordic Ware I 've ever bought that was not the highest quality and made me regret the purchase . It also leaks like a sieve .
4 #### DO NOT USE RED DYED NECTAR ! Mix Pure Cane Sugar and Water at 4 to 1 ratio , or 1 Cup water and 1/4 cup sugar ! Or 4 Cups Water and 1 Cup Sugar ! Mix it and keep in the fridge up to two weeks .
5 #### Great price . Local brick & mortar had these for $ 5 each .
5 #### They are awesome on my 716XPS , they hold the crown at the exact angle so you do n't get any miss cuts . I 'm not sure how what the max size crown is that they 'll fit but they work good .
4 #### Product as described . Good feel and will not scratch my pans .
3 #### It works fine . Slices cleanly , and I like the generously - sized handles . But the plastic cracked after about 3 months . Still usable , but obviously not as nice .
1 #### If you are looking for an old fashioned hand crack ice cream maker that uses salt and ice - this is the only choice I have been able to find . Unfortunately , I was only able to make ice cream about 5 times before I noticed the gears were stripping . I then took a closer look at the hand crank system - and it is made very cheaply . Additionally , even though I have been diligent about rinsing out the bucket when I am done , it is still rusting on the inside . This is presumedly from the salt water needed to freeze the ice cream . Still , since I very much like hand cranking , I am now looking for a replacement piece for the hand crank system and hoping it will last more than a season . The good news is that you can still buy an old fashioned ice cream maker . The bad news is that no one has come out with one that is made to last . My suggestion is to look at garage sales for one built years ago - when they were built to last generations . If you do n't find one , then this will do . Update 2010 : I never found a way to replace the handle so we now have a very expensive wooden bucket . Since more recent reviews say that the gears are still stripping , I would stay away from this product .
5 #### Great product . Have a Gerber 2 inch toilet .. not 3 inch opening
5 #### I bought this for the baker in my house . Very happy that every time baking in this pan the cake easily comes out of the pan . the pan is nice and thick , the construction is very solid . looks like it will last a lifetime .
2 #### The product that i received has plastic ends which means i must be careful when grilling . Seem cheep but then again they were . I just would n't buy them again .
4 #### This is simple and straight forward . The roller works very well ... I will tell you not to let the glue dry on the roller , while it may not stick to the roller it is not easy to get off once it does dry . When you are done take a couple of minutes and rinse off the roller in the sink . The rest of the attachments are a cool idea but the hassle of changing them out makes them less friendly to use than the standard nozzle on a regular carpenter 's glue bottle . I love the roller and use it all the time and that makes this item worth having but I would n't get excited about the other attachments if I were you .
5 #### I can put it in the dishwasher and it is very sharp . It does a great job on peeling potatoes .
5 #### Liquid Fence is really good stuff . My experience is that it works . We have a serious deer problem in my part of Charlotte NC for the past 8 years because of unchecked development . Before I started using this stuff a year ago I 'd see herds of 4 - 8 deer in my back yard eating just about anything even though I also tried other products . It was impossible to grow hostras , ihydranga , mpatients , cucumbers , tomatoes , etc etc because the deer would nibble them down to nothing . I started buying Liquid Fence from a big box store but found that it 's less expensive on Amazon . Every couple weeks I spray the plants they like ( backpack sprayer ) and also spray the bushes where the deer come into my yard and around the garden . I also spray after a heavy rain . My yard stinks pretty good for a couple hours after I hose everything down but it goes away quickly . So far this year we have n't had any deer damage . Oh , and our neighbor 's cat does n't seem to notice it . It 's a never - ending battle with these deer but using this stuff , I 'm winning !
4 #### Since this was the first soil test kit I bought , I was a little confused at first . The kit is simple to use , pretty accurate and allows you to read NPK ratings and PH levels in soil with a little water and some supplied capsules . Pretty handy once you figure out how to read the instructions :)
5 #### If you 're are cooking mainly burgers , steaks , and chicken you will not need this . However , for low and slow briskets and pork butts it is a must . Just put the meat on one side and leave the access hatch open on the other side . You will be able to quickly add fuel without losing a lot of heat . You can bbq a mean brisket in a weber if that is what you have to work with . This grate makes life so much easier for those long cook times .
5 #### The anti - rolling bumper is a flashlight saver . It also turns your Mag Lite into a light impact tool for hammering in tent steaks in soft soil . The red lens is great for preserving night vision and the lanyard is handy to prevent the loss of the flashlight .
5 #### It 's holding up nicely to our regular use repairing and rebuilding electronic equipment . Good grip and nice feel . Good alround tool .
5 #### This hammer is just the right size . Feels really nice in the hand and not too heavy at all . I am thinking of buy the next size up for bigger jobs .
4 #### These are as good as I have been able to buy . I use these on some outside lights , they have been a nuisance due to how long they last , I think its the fixture and the bulbs . These last as long or longer than the same bulb that costs much more at a big box store . I am looking at LED but I tried one a couple of years ago and that did not work 2 weeks , these bulbs are lasting over 6 months on a electric eye system .
5 #### I love this soaked . It keeps my garden and trees from being dug up . The best part about it is that it is adjustable . I would definitely buy this again .
5 #### A must have to drive eye lag screws . These screws work well . Bon 15 - 385 3 - Inch Zinc Plated Eyelag Screws , 100 - Pack
2 #### Old , brown and stale seeds . Bag appeared to have been sitting a shelf for quite some time , as well . Will not buy Kaytee again . Going back to the fresher Wagner 's safflower seed , which also has the zip top closure .
5 #### These router bits are great . They did the job and where better than I expected . Milled up some tongue and groove and these blades did the job .
5 #### Got this to go with the Freud LU91M012 saw blade that has a 1 " center ( bought them both at the same time ) since my saw a Dewalt 7790 which has a 5/8 " arbor , it is hard finding a good 12 " blade with a 5/8 " with out having to pay a premium price . Personally I think the price was a little high for this bushing , but since both the bushing and blade are from Freud I was hoping that the fit would be good , well , it fit the saw blade perfect , bit of a tap , fit nice and snug just as if the blade had a 5/8 center . I was worried that such a tight fit might have distorted the center , but it did n't and fit the 5/8 arbor of my saw nicely .
5 #### These are exactly what you 'd expect from maglite- great quality and price . I ordered these because we have rougly 20 C batteries that we either bought by mistake or that came in multisized battery packages . I bought 2 to get free shipping . I have a bunch of two D cell maglites and really like them . These are surprisingly lighter , but not quite as bright . Still , they provide more light than my AA and AAA maglites . I 'll have to see how the battery life compares . If you need one of these to carry around for work . You might really like the size and weight .
5 #### such an awesome peeler ! everything comes out soft and smooth , wastes little product as well . Have n't knicked myself yet and I am as clumsy as it gets
5 #### Much better than the plastic ones we had . Solid , and have had no issues
5 #### I have used these gloves for years and have been completely satisfied with them . They fit perfectly and are the most comfortable work gloves I 've ever had . These gloves have intelligent design with breathable material , reinforced stress points and a terry brow wipe . The wrist has elastic with a velcro closure for perfect fit . They are strong and durable while allowing a level of flexibility other work gloves do not offer . I will never buy a different brand again . I am so impressed by these gloves that I recently gave my sister a pair since she uses work gloves for the many community beautification projects she volunteers for . She loves these gloves also , and told me they are the best , most comfortable work gloves she 's ever had . So there you go , two high recommendations for these gloves in one review . As an added bonus , these gloves are environmentally friendly . As the packaging states : " Two 8 ounce plastic water bottles have been removed from the landfill to make this pair of gloves . "
5 #### Works really well , and does n't dry your face out . Lasts a long time too . You can leave it on your face for a minute or so and it 'll clean a little deeper , like a mask . Really like it .
5 #### If you like to putz in the garden / yard but then hate to pick up all of the trimmings , this is the item for you . It stands tall while you stuff it with cuttings and is easy to haul to your " dump site . " Forget plastic yard bags that tear and fall over ; this bag is so convenient I gave it to close friends for Christmas presents . I bet it is one gift that will not be re - gifted ! The 10 gallon size is great for ladies and small gardens . For bigger jobs or professionals I recommend the larger size .
5 #### Works like expected . Actually bought this hose for washing the car and not for a boat or camper but works great just the same .
5 #### its a foam filter .... works great , more than what I needed so I am happy to have backup .
1 #### Cheap quality . Is n't even those that is pictured . Hose that was received was folded in half and very very cheap materials . Would not recommend
4 #### We bought these to match the door hardware we were putting in throughout the house . We were changing every knob and hinge and these knobs were for some interior French doors . They match the other knobs very well and look nice . Unlike the other knobs ( privacy , closet , etc . , ) these knobs screw into the door itself . They were more difficult to install than the rest , as the screw holes from the old knobs did n't line up exactly with these . I do n't blame Schlage for this - probably whoever drilled for the old knobs was off in his / her measurements - but it took some elbow grease to get these attached . They come one to a box , unlike other door " sets . " So if you need a knob on both sides of a door , order two . Not cheap in price , but they look nice .
5 #### Built like a brick . Thick aluminum will provide even heat for baking . Will update if anything changes . Well Made . Nordic usually has great products !
5 #### I had to order another as my brother helped himself to this wonderful product ! :) Since I make my own tea blends , the screen allows the herbs to steep perfectly for as long as I want and holds heat well !
5 #### I use this to organize my electrical supply 's and all the screws and fasteners I need to get the job done . Makes it easy to find what you need and travels great ! I toss these in and out of my truck for years and they hold up great .
5 #### I did my research before digging holes to secure our new arbor into 2 - foot deep holes . The old clam - shell digger ? Please ... WAY too much work for a hole that is either not very deep OR too wide . ( I wanted a hole just big enough to seat the 4 x 4s that extended into the legs of the Arbor . ) An mechanized auger ? Well , great , if you have one , but expensive and a lot of trouble to rent . I found out my ground is rockier than I expect , which made my work harder than it would have been without the rocks , but still this made steady progress and every stroke that did n't hit a large rock took up 4 - 6 inches of dirt and I had 2 feet deep holes in an hour of work , even digging around a wheel - barrow full of potato - sized rocks .
5 #### I really like most of Fiskar 's products and this is no exception . The small size makes them easy to carry around ( I 've even carried them in a back pocket ) and they can do most everything that my much larger Fiskar loppers can . Just like the larger loppers , the " PowerGear " mechanism means that you have to swing the handle a greater distance to open the jaw , which can sometimes be a problem in tight quarters . Also , the cast blade can snap if it sees too much of a side load , but Fiskar sent me a replacement blade under warranty .
5 #### These are a nice set of pans for the RV oven . They fit and have proven easy to clean .
5 #### It 's a peeler ! It 's good quality and easy to handle
5 #### I have been looking for measuring cups that would fit into the mouth of my flour canisters and allow me to level the measurement without flinging flour everywhere . These are a nice graduated oval shape , perfect for my use , sturdy handles ( a definite plus ) as well as the cup size designation appears to be one that will not wear off . They even have a 2/3 and a 3/4 cup ( never heard of that before ) .
5 #### I am in love with this thing . It 's huge , and I unfortunately use a ceramic cook top , but because the bottom of this thing is so heavy and even , and especially because it has the lid that fits it perfectly ; I can get the stock to cook .... it 's beautiful . :) It 's also my first so I probably ca n't really say much , but I have cooked lots of stuff in here already ; chicken stock , chicken soups , etc . No matter what stove you have , this is a great buy .
5 #### We are using this saw with a Freud , 40 tooth Diablo 10 1/4 " blade to cut our timber frame house . We are cutting about 3 3/4 " deep in all of the big timbers with a smooth as glass finish .
5 #### We had tried 3 other traps with no results . This one finally caught out tiny friend and I was able to let him go free in a nearby field . I was happy knowing that the mouse did n't have to die just because he dared to come into my home . He was happy to be living and not with a broken neck . Its a win/ win !
1 #### One year review . This Eureka Mighty Mite was a big disapointment to me . The size and functionality really looked like it would fit the bill but it has failed an most counts . It is louder than most vacs , it puts out heat like a heater ! . The hose is obnoxious because of the amount of care it takes to fool with it . Worst hose I 've ever used because it pinches closed easily . The attachments are singular visions . Someone has thought up attachments that could be revolutionary but are just harder to use . And the wand . When I use it I get scratched walls . I tried replacing the attachments which was $ 25 . There 's just too much to overcome . On Monday it 's going to salvage and I 'm getting something better . Sorry !
3 #### I would like this a whole lot more if there were a way to secure it , it keeps blowing off . You get what you pay for . It works well enough .
4 #### Ideal for those of us who do n't want to scratch up our non - stick pots and pans , but not as strong as a metal whisk for those with other cookware or more labor intensive applications requiring greater durability . As a bonus though the handle is standard Oxo and quite comfortable .
5 #### Bought this for the extra battery and the extra discount on the site at time of purchase . This Vac is useful for super fast cleanups if one is pressed for time . It does a wonderful pick up of crumbs in the kitchen and particles on the bathroom floor . No need to waste time to plug the cord into a socket , which makes this a inexpensive and very convenient vac . Battery lasts several days , as I have not recharged mine in 3 weeks , even after using it for atleast 7 - 8 minutes every day .
5 #### At first I found this to be another useless kitchen gadget because it did n't fit any of my mixing bowls . There was too great a gap between the fork and bowl . ( A regular table fork worked better . ) Then I tried using the bowl from my Kitchen Aid Mixer . The curve of the Granny Fork matches curve of the Kitchen Aid bowl and it 's now a 5 star utensil . The grip and leverage is far better than a kitchen fork . The wide shaft is far more comfortable and usable than mashing forks with a thin wire shaft .
4 #### It works as described . I wish it was big enough to accept the protector case on the calculator also . Because with out the case buttons can be pressed if something pushes on the leather holster . Good quality .
5 #### Precision , high quality , very sharp , I 'm extremely happy with these and highly recommend them .
5 #### A must have accessory . The other reviewers have good tips on correcting the drop when extended .
5 #### it did repair the hose , no leaks , Gilmour does it right
5 #### I just bought this apple corer in a local supermarket . I was using a six blade apple slicer / corer but I had to give it up because the darn thing would slice my fingers up when I pushed out the apple core from the center of the gadget . Now I have this and I love it . With an easy grip handle it makes coring an apple a piece of cake . One push and it 's all done . It 's not a hard push either . It is very sharp , but unlike the apple corer / slicer , it does n't cut my fingers to pieces . When the apple is cored cutting it into many cubes or slices is a breeze . It is a very quick job to cut an apple that has been cored .. I think I will give this corer to my friends and let them save their fingers as well . Great product and very functional , it comes out of the dishwasher as sharp as it went in . I would rate this corer 5 stars for functionality and usefulness .
5 #### I have used this saw for a couple of weeks now and very pleased with it . Suffered with a Sears ( admittedy $ 89.00)for several years and when it died I bought this one . Unless you have huge trees to work on or do n't have access to electricity I see no reason to own a gas chainsaw . I could never keep the things running . The Makita should get me through many years of firewood .
5 #### This wrench will absolutely take control of a bunch of anything and make it a solid piece . I use it for welding mostly and it literally locks stuff together so tightly one piece of metal will dent another . I also have used it to carry loads of pipe and square tubing- 2 of these at either end and the bundle is like one piece ! If you have a stuck oil filter it will give up to this - period . I 've used it with bundles of tubing on the chop saw too . A no BS tool that you should have- you might not use it everyday but those couple times you do use it you 'll thank god you bought it .
5 #### You ca n't find these in the stores anymore , they work perfectly ! Great for people with arthritis !
4 #### I use it to monitor the soil of my blueberry plants . The set worked well although the capsules are hard to open .
5 #### I could n't believe how much better this works for me than the normal round whisk . I feel like I 'm able to whip things up so much faster than before .
5 #### I use these regularly to repair my hose . Works great !
5 #### I was skeptical that this scarecrow would deter the deer in my yard . I 'm very glad that it exceeds expectations ! I placed it facing the parts of the yard where the deer trails end . Heard it go off during the night a few times during the first week , followed by the sound of snorting and stamping deer . For the first time in years my yard is not a deer buffet -- as a matter of fact NOTHING in my yard has been browsed this year . So glad to finally see some perennials that I have n't seen in five years . I have tried all kinds of things in the past to deter them and nothing works . If you have deer problems I highly recommend giving this a try . If only there was something for winter ( besides deer netting ) .
4 #### A lot of thought was obviously put into this product . It is well designed and manufactured from high quality materials . I expect it will last me many years . Unlike some other reviewers I had no problem with speed . I sifted 3 cups of flour in under a minute . I did notice that the mesh screen at the bottom of the sifter can be removed for cleaning . I also noticed that it can become dislodged and not flush with the agitator at the bottom of the sifter . This may be why some folks are experiencing slow sifting . They may simply need to realign the mesh screen properly . The plastic lids that come with this sifter are a brilliant addition . Put the bottom lid on when scooping the flour into the sifter then put the top lid on while shaking to keep the flour from shaking out the top . Then use both lids when storing the unit . The metal is a very sturdy but I was disappointed by the plastic handle . I would have preferred the rubberized grip OXO uses for most of their other products.(-1 star )
5 #### After researching , I decided on this light . I am very pleased with the flexibility of the functions - dim light , bright light , light that fills the whole page . My husband loved it so much , we got one for him too !
5 #### trying to keep my bosses huge dog away from my cats and this thing really squirts hard and fast and works well . also seems to be made well and should work for scaring away most cridders . good product
5 #### It slices like a hot knife through butter . This apple corer is easy to use and in true OXO fashion , it feels comfortable in your hands . It slices large or small apples very easily and without the need for excessive force pushing down on it . Definite must for your kitchen !
5 #### This is the second one I have purchased . It is so nice to be able to watch the hummingbirds come to the feeder that is right up to the window . Wonderful product .
5 #### You ca nt read it but these are 3 M filters , no worries as to the product materials .
5 #### Excellent quality , function and value . Shuts off water completely making it simple to change attachments without shutting off the water .
5 #### Just added this clamp to my new Dewalt DW718 sliding miter saw . This saw did come with one clamp but I decided that I better have another one for the other side of my material I would be cutting for safety measures . It would have been nice if Dewalt would have included this clamp instead of the one that came with the DW718 but I am sure to keep costs down we are lucky to even get one material hold down clamp . This DW7082 clamp is way better than the one that comes with the saw and is more heavy duty with a quick take - up button that saves a lot of time screwing the threaded rod to tighten the clamp . It would be nice to have both clamps like this one but I ca n't justify buying another DW7082 clamp seeing as now I have one for each side of the blade . This DW7082 material hold down clamp will now become my primary clamp though and the one that came with the saw will only be used when I think two clamps are really necessary .
5 #### I love my large spoon rest . Cleans up nicely too .
5 #### My old can opener was on it 's last legs for quite a long time . I 'm not sure it ever really worked great . So this one just seemed to work so miraculously , but truly this might just be how can openers are supposed to operate . Looks nice , works great .
2 #### It does the job of peeling garlic , though not always on the first try . It gets dirty fast because garlic peels sort of stick to the inside . It 's very easy to clean , but then you lose the time savings which it was supposed to deliver . If you want to peel more than a couple of cloves , it 's a big nuisance . And it 's simply unnecessary . To peel garlic , put it down on the cutting board ( or counter ) and whack it with the flat side of any tool ( I use whatever chef 's knife or cleaver is sitting around , or even the bottom of a can ) . The peel will come right off .
5 #### Great stuff I use it all the time and always will ! ! !
5 #### Radial apple slicers are finnicky and prone to breaking at the seams between the core and the wedges . This corer makes it trivial to just wash the apple , stab it through the middle , and the apple 's ready to eat ! The size is best for small to medium sized apples - you 'll want to get something larger if you regularly eat the giant oversized apples supermarkets sometimes carry ( I dislike those because I find them to be extremely bland ) .
5 #### Must have for pool with kids . Sunscreen . Plants and hot sun . Salt water pool
5 #### Sounds like a shop vac but perfect and powerful suction . Nice size and attachments allow for carpet to hard floor cleanup . Just what I was looking for !
5 #### Great idea and a well made product that does what it promises .
5 #### My daughter moved into a new house with White Hinges and Knobs . They did n't look good with the rest of the kitchen decor . I got these hoping they would fit , and they were perfect !
5 #### Worked as advertised . Only took our dogs a couple of trips through the sprinkler to understand which part of the yard to avoid . Do n't know how long the battery will last but that 's not a big problem . Now if I can just get the scarecrow to recognize me and NOT trigger when I accidentally walk in front of it . :-)
4 #### I had a lamp that I brought from Germany when we moved back to the States that used these bulbs . Since I had n't lived Stateside for a while , I was n't sure if I could get them anywhere . Amazon had the best price so I ordered . These bulbs look exactly like they do in the photo and came very quickly and well - packed . I got 10 of them and none are broken . They were perfect and a very quick replacement . Bright and clear . Ca n't speak about how long they last yet but if there 's an issue then I 'll re - post . Generally a good buy for what they are .
4 #### Good fitting refills for the handy little roller . I use for room touch up . I also use for rolling glue when I laminate veneer wood . Perfect for that use .
2 #### My son works at a ice cream shop , and when I recieved this ice cream scoop , he was glad that I got one that resembled the one that he uses at work . Until he actually used it . It looks metal , but feels like it 's plastic . When I used it for the first time , I was scooping out very hard ice cream , and it felt like it was going to break . I had to turn it in circles to get anything . I think I will be going back to my old heavy metal one . At least I know it wo n't break in my hand .
4 #### Works well ! I find that my salad is not completely dry , but most of the water is gone .
5 #### I use this on steel fabrication jobs . You can get a little rough with this well made Klein tool . When needing to convience some pieces to fit up snuggly , you can get the hammer out and get the job done with this tool . I would recommend this tool to a good friend .
5 #### Though it 's just an ordinary measure - but what I love about it is the lid . That 's hard to find . It fits tightly . I can save items in the fridge or transport them in the beaker .
5 #### Great Product . Only con is the wife stole it for her garden hose so now I have to buy another
5 #### I use mine constantly and it keeps a great edge on my knives . Staying at my brother 's , I could n't cut anything with his dull knives . While it took another sharpener and a lot of time , I finally got one of his knives to cut .
5 #### My first order of 2 hoses both of them leaked from the end . I filled out the return on Saturday mid morning . Monday my new hoses arrived and neither of them leaked ! I only wish they had a shorter one . 1 of these was used to replace a lead hose on a hose reel and the other to replace a busted hose to our timer in the garden . Both are working out well .
1 #### Now at the bottom of my pond after so much green slimy algae grew on them .
5 #### Quality you would expect . In different lighting , it seems a lot easier to see than my gray one .
1 #### FIRST , remember that this is the CHEAPEST large router out here , THEN ask yourself " why ? " You get what you pay for . I had this " working like a dream " for about a year when setting up for cabinet door work it " grunted " and died . Heck , I thought I had popped a breaker , or a " re - set , " or a part that could be replaced . WRONG , if THIS router " grunts " it fries the speed control module . They charge about $ 80 for the module ! But heck , since I ALREADY have " modified " this router to use in my table , I " try " to buy the module ..... GOOD LUCK ! After 2 months of dealing with a " hitachi distributor , " I finally told them to stick the order and bought a Milwaukee . I " learned " a lesson , IF I find anything about half the price of all competitors , I probably should BUY TWO so that I can " fix " it when it breaks . I will NEVER buy from Hitachi again , their parts " support " is useless .
5 #### This item catches a lot of little bugs . I bought it for my father 's home since he has an indoor / outdoor cat and I was worried about fleas making their home in the house . Very few fleas were caught , but it did catch a few different bugs including what appears to be fruit flies ! Since I rather have the bugs crawl on this instead of him , and the price was great , I feel it was worth the purchase .
3 #### Concept , design , and function are great . But being cheap plastic , it will last one year at best . Therefore , not worth the money
5 #### My life depends on this stuff ! My home is built into a steep side - hill , and there are many places where I can not setup a ladder . The Qualcraft Pump - Jack System is inexpensive , easy to use , safe and reliable . I 'm very happy to have equipment I can trust .
5 #### Great tool . I was a little worried it might not get though the material , but it was excellent , fast over and over . Well worth every cent .
2 #### I LIKE BLACK AND DECKER PRODUCTS . HOWEVER , I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT . LASTED ONLY A FEW MONTHS . CHARGE LASTS A SHORT TIME IF IT CHARGES AT ALL .
2 #### Good suction but cheap looking and a bit awkward to store and use
5 #### Love OXO stuff . This is no exception , I use it all the time and now I no longer have to cut apples .
4 #### Ok for the $ $ ... suits my needs as a fire pit insert instead of a BBQ . If grilling was a focus I 'd kick in for the next step up which has better venting .
4 #### This is a nice flexible and light - weight hose . It does kink when it is uncoiled after storage , as do all hoses I have owned , but the kinks do n't remain once the hose is straightened out based on the flexible construction . The end connections are of good quality and should be durable . Good hose , overall .
5 #### Yep , it 's a utility knife . It 's just like my fathers trusty utility knife . Solid metal . Painted bright green to find it . Quality built , latches and hides the blade easily without slippage .
4 #### not a comfortable seat but it serves its purpose for storage plus occasional company seating
5 #### Good ole Victor . Solved our mouse problem in one night and reusable in case we ever need them again .
5 #### Nice quality tool , it served the purpose I needed it for
5 #### It looked flimsy when I first opened the package , but it 's really hard to tear .
5 #### These bypass loppers are really great for cutting up good size branches ! Sharp as promised by Fiskars ! Even my husband likes them and he has always purchased the rachet type ! These are my favorite since I do all my own trimming and have to size branches up for city pickup ! This was a good purchase and I 'm glad I have them .
5 #### Once again Stanley does it right , The weight , balance , markings and durability of this tool are outstanding . I highly recommend Stanley made tools to others , can not go wrong .
4 #### This is my first mower I ever owned . I live in the Philippines , and I have Korean lawn grass ( Zoysia ) , it works very well . The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars is only because it wo n't cut 3 1/2 inches from the edge of my tiles , but I can and will use my Gardena shears that I also brought from Amazon . Putting it together only took around 15 - 20 mins . After I used it today ( 9/15 . ) I did hosed it down then spray it with WD-40 . I did leave the clippings on the grass which is a very good Fertilizer as far as I 'm concern . This manual machine is very light , but , if Fiskars had a 16 inch mower , and lightweight I would have brought it . This machine gave me a good workout .
5 #### I love it . Great material . Be sure to use with a liner .
4 #### I like these . I wanted to love them , but the easy scoop shape is actually harder for me to use than the regular shape . They do n't fit as well in my canisters , and it 's hard to dump off the extra without spilling it on the counter because the opening is so big . I tend to eyeball the fullness of the cup instead of scraping the top , and it 's sort of hard to judge the fullness on these . It was easy to take them off the loop , which I have discarded because it annoys me to have my measuring cups stuck together . They are nice quality , stack well , and look really good . They look larger than they are , but I checked a couple of them , and they 're accurate . If I had it to do over again , I 'd probably stick with this brand , but buy the older style and just mark the sizes on them with a Sharpie ( since people complained that the sizes wore off ) .
5 #### Saw something like this on one of my favorite cooking channels and I just had to get it . 1 . Sturdy . Not flimsy at all 2 . Nice handle for grabbing , it fits comfortably in the hand 3 . Pretty damn sharp . 4 . Cored my apple really nicely Can not wait to use this in future projects , i.e. coring cupcakes so I can put in fillings .
3 #### It 's okay as it has a function . It was way too small for my needs
5 #### I love this tea strainer ! It does n't leak , it 's great for brewing loose leaf ( or bagged tea ) on the go . It 's rather small ( holds about one mug of tea ) . I guess the only thing that needs addressing is once you remove the tea+strainer , there 's nowhere to put them that they wo n't leak everywhere . And dealing with the 3 lids ( strainer , sipper , and solid cap ) can get a bit cumbersome . But still , it does what I need .
5 #### My wife wanted a good , stiff , vegetable brush . She laughed , and laughed , when she got this in the mail for a Christmas present . She says she could have gotten it at the local grocery store . But she loves it . One of the best stocking stuffers ever . ( My wife is very , very difficult to please when it comes to kitchen gadgets --- actually she 's hard to please in all respects , but that 's a different story -- so , I was relieved to hear her say she loved this brush . )
1 #### I was eager to use the new pan for a Thanksgiving dessert . On the recommendation from Cook 's Illustrated , I ordered one from Amazon . It arrived with a couple small dents around the bottom edge , which I was concerned would affect the pan 's ability to seal . Amazon quickly sent me a replacement , which arrived with an even larger dent than on the first one I returned . I am getting a refund this time , and will buy this from a local retailer , where I can inspect it before I leave the store . To Amazon 's credit , I 've learned how easy it is to get replacements and refunds .
5 #### Used this to remake an old axe head I reforged from a rusty scrap found under my deck . Cuts like a dream now !
5 #### Watched a few videos and went to work . I found that if I did n't get results in 48 hours , I would move the trap . It took a few tries to learn the easiest method of setting the trap but once I got the hang of it , it 's a breeze . I did sand the paint off the tip of the trigger in order to make it slightly less sensitive . the word is out in my local mole community that there is a new sheriff in town .
5 #### Did the trick . I was moving an older fan of another brand and needed a shorter down rod . Big Box stores and hardware stores did not stock the narrower diameter . Took a chance and this worked perfectly .
4 #### So far so good . I find this to be a very good can opener .
5 #### Once we finally got this table assembled , it 's great . Really love the Kreg products . My only complaint is the assembly instructions . They could have been better and plan on spending about 90 minutes to put this table together , goes faster with two people . Overall , very happy with the table .
5 #### So i bought these based on value and reviews . i set about 30 of them all over basement anywhere i figured spiders and mice may be . I have two cats so to be honest i did n't think i had mice . It was spiders and bugs i wanted to get rid of but just to be safe put in places where mice may be . I set them up about a week and half ago . and today i was just looking here and there where i thought mice may be and they are clean . i found a few w/ spider in them and a fly . and than up top along the wooden beams i see something furry sticking out and i got flash light and bam sure enough not one but two mice . seems like i have more of mice problem than spider problem . so now i reset like 6 more traps along the beams to see if there are more . these are easy to assemble and do have a distinct peanut butter smell .
5 #### This pool is better then sliced bread . We are having a blast with it . We have the 16 ' . I can swim 3 laps each way - do a somersault and swim 3 laps the other way . I am exercising- and swimming several times a day with this pool . After reading the reviews - when we purchased it ( for $ [ ... ] . ) from Toys R Us - I paid an extra $ [ ... ] . for replacement . So , if it does n't store well - next year I can have it replaced for nothing . We set it up on our concrete patio . All we have in it is a floating chlorine holder with chlorine tablets in it . The water is clear . We did put carpet underneath it - which I like . Got the carpet for free from a carpet vendor 's extra 's from cuttings . All I can say is ... I wish I 'd bought one sooner ! I have n't turned the air conditioner on once since I 've been using it ( I work from home)and we 've been having a heat wave with days being at 100 degrees or more . Hubby and I set it up in a couple of hours ( including laying the carpet ) . So . We LOVE it ! :-)
5 #### I did n't order enough of the product but it has worked well
2 #### I bought this pan in January and have used it maybe 20 times . This morning , the bottoms of my popovers had bits of nonstick coating in them . I do n't own a dishwasher , so the pan suffered no abuse that way . Once , the popovers stuck in it ( so much for nonstick ) , and that required soaking and then some scrubbing with a gentle scouring pad , the kind that 's supposed to be okay for nonstick . I 'm not tough on pans , because I want them to last . This is why I avoid nonstick ones , because eventually most of them fail , and there 's nothing you can do once the coating starts peeling . In this case , I had no choice , because all the popover pans I 've found are nonstick . This one worked well until this morning , but now I guess I 'll go back to my non - nonstick muffin tin for the time being .
5 #### I bought these for another project that needed but one key , but the extra came in handy , for I had a another lamp with a 3 - way socket with a round plastic knob that was hard to turn . Instead of replacing the switch , I simply replaced the knob with the key and now I am able to turn it easily , given the greater leverage of the key .
5 #### This hose has weathered well in hot / humid and cold arrid conditions . It has NO difficulty unravaling in the colder weather and seems to have no memmory once unraveled . I would buy this product again .
5 #### Bought these to keep in my cars . They are small and fit well in the car trunk . Hope I never have to use them . Yet they will help put out small electrical or grass fires . I keep one next to me when jump starting a car , just in case ...
1 #### The unit arrived in good condition . First batch of popcorn with a known good bag of white popcorn yielded poor results . Many of the kernals did not pop . Second attempt with another brand of yellow popcorn gave similar results . A third batch and the stirring arms stopped and will not turn . I would not recommend this product .
5 #### Used to edge band Oak plywood using a standard Iron . Then trimmed with a flush trim bit with a router . Works as advertised .
5 #### This is a professional grade bundt pan . We had been looking for a true 12 cup pan and this one meets the test . Heavy duty , and non - stick . Only have had it two weeks , but already have made several cakes and all have come out perfectly . Even baking , released from pan properly - love it .
1 #### This item is a joke . It does not work very well . Use a knife blade flat on a garlic clove and hit the blade with you hand . This technique works better than anything . Watch any chef peel garlic and that is what they do . You will never see a chef use this useless device . Save your money
4 #### I have always smashed cloves of garlic with the flat blade of my chef 's knife against a cutting board , then peeled them . One day , I visited a friend who has one of these E - Z Roll Garlic Peelers , and , after using it , I was impressed that my hands did not smell of garlic , as much . I love the smell of fresh garlic , but there are times when I do n't want my hands to retain this aroma . This gadget works to keep the garlic smell off your hands that you would get from peeling garlic , so I use it when I am going to cook with whole cloves of garlic . However , if I am chopping , mincing , slicing , or slivering garlic with a knife , then I still get some garlic smell on my hands . The Cuisinart Mini - Prep Food Processor is great for chopping , mincing , and pureeing garlic , but it wo n't slice or sliver it . I have found one other one gadget that does really work to take onion and garlic smell off my hands -- it is a small block of stainless steel that one rubs on damp hands . ( Also , I keep jars of both roasted and regular garlic , minced and chopped , in my refrigerator . )
1 #### Do n't believe this product was made to last more than one season ! I 've had several of these and they do n't seem to last for more than one summer . The root feeder , or metal portion that gets inserted into the ground naturally rusts quickly , and begins to soften . So taking it out and moving it say around to the other side of the tree , and it will bend very easily . At the end is 5 holes , 4 outward , ( such as north , south , east , & west ) , and one straight downward . Once you get past the soft top layer of soil , chances are as you go deeper you will hit clay , or harder soil . Not is it only hard to push into the soil , but most of the time the holes will clog with clay or mud . So what I 've had to do was turn the water on full , then push it down a few inches at a time until you get it all the way in . Then pull it back out and most of the time clean out the holes with a twig or something , then reinsert it , ( trying to find the original hole , which is all mud now ) . Pulling it out , is no easy task either ! Best have a strong back ... The one I have now was purchased last summer , and it 's not looking like I 'm going to be able to use it this summer . Water is leaking through several holes in the cheap plastic handle . I would not recommend it !
5 #### This was hard to find . I have n't installed this yet since the drywall is n't on the wall yet . Should look nice when finished .
5 #### Love Woodstock Wind Chimes ! They are tuned perfectly and sound amazing ! Ca n't beat the prices on Amazon .
5 #### Hose works great and seems like it will hold up for a long time !
5 #### They are sticky and they work great ! Do be sure to replace them regularly so that there is enough free space for everyone to fit on it .
5 #### Great product , works great , as expected for Porter Cable products that pre - date the latest round of portable tools .
5 #### These are great . Hold a lot , light weight , easy to carry .
4 #### For safety , you should really use two of these per ladder . But I had a small job to do , and wondered when I 'd ever need a pair of these again . Now I 'm not telling you to do what I did , but I mounted on;y one to my ladder , and it worked great for my purposes . The slope I needed to walk / sit on would 've been far too steep without this handy little tool . It made the seemingly impossible a piece of cake .
3 #### The top opening is too small to allow for easy filling of anything in quantity . Miracle Grow and similar fertilizer products have to be dissolved in water before adding and then carefully poured into the small top opening . The sprayer will spray down or up . On a positive note it does get some distance and power when spraying .
5 #### This is the best potato smasher this side of the Mississippi ! ! !
5 #### I use this for vacuuming my small office . It has excellent suction . The sound is a bit less than I expected , and very reasonable . The head is perfect for the hardwood floor with small brushes that actually help scuff up the dirt , and the width is just right . The tubes that attached to the head are nice and long so no bending over . The hose is plenty long as is the cord . It is nice and small and compact so you could easily pick it up and carry it for stairs or really high spots or store it in a small space . It does n't have a retractable cord but for the price , that 's a small exception .
5 #### The cutest little box of words . It has enough words to make little comments and some complete phrases . I wish the word " stay " was part of it .
5 #### Bought for roof job for my dad - he said they did the trick - decent value for the money - remember you will probably need 2 ! ! Kind of odd they do n't sell in pairs .... or at least when I purchased them ...
5 #### These shears allow me to prune my Plum trees with ease . It really makes clean cuts that are essential in pruning .
5 #### Good glue . Sets fast . I use it for gluing spacers in picture frames . The Titebond III took too long to dry , this stuff holds well and strong and usually does n't need any clamping so I can spacer the frames faster and do n't have to worry about a clamp marring the finish .
1 #### I WAS HAVING FUN WITH , MY DAD I WORKED TOGATHER ON HOMES 25 YEARS . SO I GOT THIS IT WAS GOOD FOR 6 TUBS , I MADE SURE IT WAS CLEN , AIR PSI , WAS RIGHT . THEN IT STOP , , IGOT SAMS TUB OUT OF AIR GUN PUT IT IN A HAND GUN , TUB CAULK WAS WORKING GOOD . ALL TUBS OF CAULK I GOT AT LOWES AND LOOKED AT THE DATES ON EACH ONE . THIS BAD THING NOT BECOUSE IT STOP ON ME I READ ALL ABOUT IT WHAT WAS SAID HOW THAY USED IT . I HAVE $ 40.000.00 TOOLS , BUT THIS ONE GOT ME TDHILL .
2 #### I wish there were some type of " scent " applied so that this would work as a true BAIT for trapping this terrible little critters .
4 #### Be sure your panel ACCEPTS Tandem Breakers . Mine did not yet this product would work fine for my application . Look at the diagram on your panel and it indicates which slots will accept this twin type of breaker . Sad but happy with product . For the ones on here that it did not fit , it was most likely that your panel will not accept Tandem Breakers . The blade MUST have a slot cut out of it by the Manufacturer at FIRST ! Not after installation to be within its code and specs .
5 #### The clock works perfectly and I was surprised to find the temp and humidity sensors are very accurate ( compared against a known good source instrument ) . I am in northern Arizona . The WWVB signal here is quite good , hence no problems at all with the clock setting itself . Note : the clock is NOT waterproof . Keep it sheltered if used outside . Only works down to -10F ... so not suitable for all the U.S. in winter .
4 #### I use this to pound the heck out of chicken breasts and thighs before marinating them . Works well but I wish the heads were a little bigger .
5 #### I needed replacement knobs for plastic ones that had cracked and came across these on Amazon . We have been very happy with the upgrade because it instantly made operating lights easier & stopped the fumbling around . I suggest these to anyone tired of the same ...
5 #### This is a great tool . It peels efficiently ; makes the job a lot easier . The grip is firm as the swivel does its job . It is always good to have an extra one around when people want to help and they all want the same peeler .
5 #### Toro has made the job of gathering and bagging leaves a cinch with this unit . It 's light weight , easy to use , and with the low price and rebate we got , we really did n't expect a machine of this high of a calibre . We got to use this for 1 day before it started raining . In that 1 day we got 50 % of our yard done . If we had only had 1 more day , we would n't have to rake up the rest of the leaves in the spring when things finally dry out . It does everything it says it will do and that high power blower will even push wet leaves into a pile . Believe me , we 'll be using the heck out of it this next Fall before the rains hit !
5 #### Super sharp . Easy to clean . Comfy handle . Would buy again .
5 #### Great price , arrived on time and item was as expected .
5 #### I was skeptical at first . The price was very low , especially for ten . Ten came , and they work as well as any I 've gotten .
5 #### This ladder hook works great with my light aluminum ladder . I can easily take it up on a roof by myself and the wheel helps to maneuver it into position . I hook it on the top of gables and hang lights where I would n't dare go otherwise . It really helps on the steep pitches .
4 #### So far they 've worked like a charm . Plants are healthier and and taller than ever .
4 #### I bought this for my Craftsman contractor 's saw to replace the piece - o - junk fence that came with it . I was not disappointed . This is a solid fence . It went on my Craftsman saw without any problems and without any type of retrofitting . The fence is easy to adjust with the microadjustment dial . The only issue I had with this fence it that it has to be locked down with both levers very tightly , otherwise it will move when you 're cutting . There is no real click or feedback when it is locked down . I 've gotten used to double / triple checking to make sure that it is secure . I 've noticed that since I bought my table saw 4 years ago , they have improved the contractor saws quite a bit , especially when it comes to dust collection and fences ...
1 #### It was way to hard to use , bought it a few months back and watched videos of how to use it and after all that , used it once .
5 #### The set is very complete and is very reasonably priced at Amazon compared to buying individual hole saws .
5 #### This set of measuring cups is a cut above most collections , because it includes 1/3 and 2/3 measures , too . The amounts are clearly marked in a contrasting color on the handle . The cups are attached to an oval ring by open hooks that are easy to detach and reattach after use . These are just a top - notch product .
5 #### I love my kreg jig . So I burn through a lot of kreg screws and need to buy in bulk . Amazon has the best prices around for bulk purchases of kreg screws .
4 #### This is a great product ! ! It has so many uses the great part is that it works and is eco friendly . My order was delivered on time in perfect condition . Will reorder more when this bag runs out .
5 #### This gadget is phenomenal ! So easy to use , love too that it 's blue :) anyone who has a farm , or simply wants to build a fence , this has worked better then the post hole digger that opens and closes with2 curved pieces , it pulls dirt out as you spin it down into earth ... and it 's easy on your back
4 #### I would give this five stars if I did n't have to clean it . It takes longer to clean than to make popcorn . But it does make really good popcorn . I got the theater type oil and topping and the gourmet corn to go with it and it made a great combination . I doubt I would go back to microwave popcorn unless cleaning the Stir Crazy really gets old . Popper came from Amazon and corn and oils came from another source .... and they both arrived the same day . I was eating popcorn before the UPS guy got out of the driveway .
5 #### Had a project where I needed to cut some metal on an amp plate to replace it with a different size one . These work and I had extras if I broke on . Dewalt products are usually good for me .
2 #### Mine caught fire while I was using it . Fortunately I was in the same room when it happened . No it did NOT set something nearby on fire . The actual unit caught on fire . I had a tank in the right side and the left side was without a tank . The fire started on the left side . I own both this unit , and a single cylinder 9000 BTU unit , and they are both fantastic as far as heating performance . Sadly I will never trust them as a safe indoor source of heat except in the most dire emergency situation when my life comes down to either deffinately freezing to death or possibly death by fire or explosion .. I strongly hope Mr Heater fixes this known issue before someone gets hurt or killed . 2 stars instead of 1 because I will hang on to tham for use outside because they work so well when they not in flames .
5 #### Simply can not beat DeWalt quality . They last atleast twice as long as any other brand I have tried .
4 #### Was a little thin . I was expecting it to be a little more solid . It is just a thin woven plastic like tarp . I think it works ok though .
5 #### I love this trowel . Have 3 of them , just in case they do n't get put up and I have to find another one . Very comfortable in my hand . I use it ALL THE TIME ! Hubby loves too - he 's the reason we have 3 of them , LOL ! Highly recommend !
5 #### This tractor is fun for my 4 - year - old and saves me a lot of time . You must own a rigid , good hose , though . It does exactly what it is billed as doing -- follows the hose in either high or low . Only minor complaint is that it already shows some rust on the body .
4 #### Comfortable to hold while using . Does get the job done well . Would recommend . Good value for the price .
5 #### One of the best surge protectors i ever bought . I labeled , it comes with labels , and monster is a brand you could trust .
5 #### I found these for the first time a couple years ago . They are really a blast . The main blooms can be nearly a foot in diameter while secendary blooms about 6 - 7 in . They are so delightful . They really do look more like a yellow pom pom then a sunflower . The heads to get pretty heavy and can weigh on the plant . But you will be delited with the unique beauty . I certainly was . Your friends will be impressed with your gardening abilities .
5 #### I never had a salad spinner before and really like this one . Also like that the top push handle locks down for storing .
4 #### I bought about 5 different boxes of these . Mixing them up with the other words I have create very interesting sentences . I suppose it could be educational , I did n't buy it for that reason . My refrigerator now looks like a book . Fun stuff .
2 #### I can run my table saw all day and not fill up this bag one - eighth of the way . So why does it hang all the way to the ground where it gets stepped on , tangled in cords , and possibly even wet if there was rain the night before ? It should have been half the size and cheaper . The spring clamp used to hold it on to the saw work okay but the way it 's designed makes it so that you actually have to work to put the thing on the saw well enough that it does n't fall off . It should have been simpler to get that right - maybe a flaw of the saw as much as the bag clamp . Lastly , if you use the zipper to empty this bag then be prepared to get covered in dust . I think the size of the bag has something to do with this since the bag on my miter saw , which is much smaller , does n't have this problem .
4 #### I 've had my Breadman Ultimate for at least 4 years . I think it might be dying now -- I was making a loaf of Italian bread on the " Dough Only " setting -- the digital timer never changed and it just kept on kneading ad infinitum . I unplugged it and saved the dough , but now I have to think about replacing it . I 've read endless reviews for Breadman , Zojirushi , Panasonic , etc . , but I think I 'll get another Breadman . This is an imperfect world . I 've only been disappointed with the results about four times -- bread rose too high , bread collapsed once -- both problems undoubtedly caused by early inexperience . The Breadman overall does a very satisfactory job with all types of breads . I often start a loaf in the machine and finish it in the oven because I like crusty crusts . But I 'm also very pleased with the breads I 've baked in the Breadman . Tom Lacalamita 's , " The Ultimate Bread Machine Cookbook , " is a great resource , by the way . For the price , I doubt the Breadman can be beat . The downsides for me are it 's inability to knead heavier , wholegrain doughs , and the chute for adding extras ( nuts , etc ) is hard to clean . In response to other reviews , my machine has never " danced across the counter . " If you really spend the time and read the instructions carefully you should produce lovely loaves . Experiement , experiment . Bread making is an art developed over time -- even in a machine .
5 #### Compare to low price this is a great and quality item , I will order more In the future ! !
5 #### Does a good job removing paint and rust from metal .
5 #### Best potato / yam peeler I have ever used . The grocery store brand peeler is terrible . I can peel potatoes , etc . now with ease .
5 #### Had looked for this locally , price at grocery and hardware store was ridiculously high for amount of twine . This ball has enough twine to last nearly a lifetime for a great price . I use it regularly for trussing chicken and sizing roasts to put on spit roaster . Twine holds up well , does not burn off . I used an empty plastic container from a bird supply store in which a large block of suet came in to house the twine and keep it clean . Punched a hole in the top and thread twine out through hole then cut off what I need . Keeps raw chicken gunk away from the ball .
5 #### did n't work for what I ordered it for . But will find a use for it ....
3 #### I really like the material and feel in my hand and the overall aesthetic , but the nozzle does not have a setting where it is a powerful narrow long stream .
2 #### tis can not be in the sun , so what good is it , I have the sun all day on all sides of my place
5 #### Have tried several other types over the years but the birds and I think this one is the best . Easy to fill and keep clean . Have three in use from April to Aug.
5 #### Bought this after seeing my landscaper use it to deep water new transplants . Makes sense and a new hedgerow seems to have taken nicely before the cold set in .
5 #### We had a slow - filling toilet in the master bath . The Korky fixed the problem . If my isolation valve had n't leaked , installation would have been a snap , but I had to keep bailing out my collection pot , which added to the time and complications of installing the Korky . That , and the builder 's insistence in putting the toilet in a tiny room .
5 #### I cook daily in a pressure cooker so this product is very important to me . I have a Hawkins 2 liter cooker , prestige 3.5 liter and a presto 6 quart pressure cooker but they are all aluminum . I 've had the presto 6 qt aluminum for at least over 6 years . It works very well . The best thing about it as compared to Hawkins and Prestige is that it does n't let pressure off in loud installments ( which scares the kids ) , its more like a consistent whistle . The main reason to buy the 4 qt steel cooker was to have a size between the ones I already owned , suitable for a family of four , and also the reason that stainless steel does n't react with the food , which is important to me because I often marinate the meat before cooking certain dishes . The new presto has a flatter bottom which sits better on my cook top unlike the old one which rocks a little bit , the heating is even and its easier to clean as well . What I did n't like is that the steaming plate that comes with the cooker is made of aluminum . But its not a deal breaker for me . I think that Presto is a very dependable brand and I 'll happily recommend it to anyone .
5 #### What else would you expect but quality ? This is my first time making a set of doors . They came out perfect . The setup is easy if you follow the instruction video or the paper they give you . I found it a must , to make a router table sled for doing the rails . I bought the phenolic sheet and a grizzly clamp off of Amazon . They got delivered fast and made it a lot easier . It prevents the back of the wood from blowing out . Make sure to check the speeds on your router . The back cutter feature makes the set even nicer .
2 #### While I have no real complaints about the quality of the product , I do dare anyone to show me how they get 100 feet of hose reeled into this ! I have 75 ft medium duty 3/4 inch garden hose and no matter how carefully I 've tried to reel it in , the most I can get on the reel is about 60 ft . I guess if I went out and bought the flimsiest 1/2 inch hose I could find I might be able to get it reeled in , but I have my doubts .
1 #### Not Happy at all ! I purchased a Hoont and despite problems , the company responds to my challenges and offers suggestions . I purchased this from Tyler Puckett store . It caught one mouse and then no more , despite cleaning the plates and putting in more bait again and again . The mice walk in and eat whatever I put in there and leave . Their paw prints are all over . It has brand new batteries . I asked to return it , thinking it was the Standard 30 dayy Amazon return policy . No . So warning . Puckett only allows two weeks . Not really a decent amount of time to try out a device like this . I do have Victor ones that work well , however , only hold one mouse so I thought with great reviews I would try this one for a change . An expensive mistake . Make sure you READ the amount of time allowed to return it . I still could not find it on the site , however it is only 14 days with this company .
3 #### Switch seemed a little off of square , but worked after some adjustments to the underlying switch boxes .
5 #### I am a fan of Oxo products , but not just for comfort . There is often a functional improvement involved in Oxo products that makes them worthwhile . This spoon is a great example . When I need to stir something for a while , using a regular spoon or spatula causes my oversized hands to cramp because the shaft / handle is just too small . The large handle is just right for me . Your mileage may vary ...
5 #### I did n't get mine on Amazon but in a local store , the first night I caught 21 mice , most were babies and a couple adults , 2nd night I caught 7 and 3rd night I caught 10 . I caught them in my chicken coop . Throw in do , e random food that 'll last till morning , not much and you will be surprised . Always change the location so they do n't catch on and you get to keep catching what you want . I like that I can see in the box soon know what I 'm dealing w in , umbers and that I do n't need to use any poison bc the .ice go to the chickens for free feed .
5 #### Hopefully you do n't need anyone to tell you that ( a ) Channellock makes great products , or ( b ) their classic " tongue and groove plier " is an industry standard . Do yourself a favor and get a range of sizes . Keep one in the trunk of your car .
5 #### I have been using Weller for over 40 years . This one is the same good quality as the products have always been . I got this for my grandson . This will start him in the correct direction . Delivery was fast and no surprises .
3 #### I 've ordered this in the past and it 's been great , but this batch came moths - which I ignored at first but now they 've become a nuisance . I know it came with them as my seed is sealed in a container and none of my other seed or peanuts have moths . The Dr. Killigan 's Moth Traps are doing the job but I was a bit disappointed with this batch .
5 #### You slam this thing down into an apple and PRESTO - gross seeds and tough core are gone - zo . I like to dehydrate apples , and this has simplified that process by a million minutes . The little teeth at the end help it break the waxy apple skin , and a quick turn pulls the core out .
5 #### wish I had more like it , so i 'll just say it 's great and if I need a another one I know where to get it .
5 #### Works just fine for my Black and Decker 10 " chop saw .
5 #### I received my Channellocks before the promised delivery date . I have a number of smaller Channellocks and use them quite frequently . Their quality is excellent . I have researched other brands that cost the same or more and they do n't meet the same quality and functionality as Channellock . I bought the 16 " capacity for use on swimming pool plumbing and fittings ; needed large jaw capacity . I paid $ 20 less through Amazon than I could have gotten them or their equivalent elsewhere .
5 #### Awesome light . We have been using it for 6 months . We have dropped it a few times and no issues , very bright .
5 #### Great for scrubbing carrots , potato 's ( save nutrients by not peeling ) and cleaning any raw fruit of vegetables from the grocer or the garden . Run it through the dishwasher to keep it clean and sanitary .
5 #### I 've had this filter for about 5 years and it has been very effective . The carbon block catches most contaminates .
3 #### Hard to read . Maybe I just need glasses . It 's a good cheap measure .
4 #### This is a nice set of measuring cups , with comfortable handles and convenient , in - between sizes . The one caveat is that the most - used ones , you will eventually have the number wear off . Well worth the money , and perhaps nail polish could replace the markings that wear off ?
5 #### You simply ca n't find a more comfortable weather - resistant hammock . I highly recommend it !
5 #### Bought this to use in a large cupboard to hold playground balls . Really like the hard bottom as it seems to make it sturdier when carrying from one place to another . Can see having several of these for storage in the garage and shed .
5 #### I really like this design . I got it so that my 4 year old could help and I wanted something that he could n't go crazy on and pull apart . Since you just push down like a top there is n't that much to break . I also like that it 's clear .
5 #### This set is quite adorable and it has high quality stylish fashions and accessories that reflect current trends , as is what is to be expected with the Style dolls at this point . The only downside would be their bodies . Yes , they hand great arm articulation , but their have hips that are jutting to the side as well as legs in fixed poses , very similar to the Barbie Collector Model Muse bodies . All in all , if you can get this set for $ 20 , as it is now , I highly recommend getting getting it as it would please both kids and collectors !
5 #### Works great for my 2.5 gallon Shop - Vac . I use this when I need to pick up fine particles like drywall dust . If yo do not use one of these to vac up drywall dust , or anything as fine as that , you will clog your filter up and dust will blow out of the exhaust . Use these for fine pick up . I recommend it .
4 #### Very happy with this product . i took a chance with what I thought might be mosquito larvae in my indoor and outdoor potted plants . I sprinkled this and mixed into the soil and the water trays under the pots and not long after , my mysterious mosquitoes were gone and have been gone since receiving this around 11/16/17 . It is now 3/4/18 . I also sprinkled into my rain barrels and seems to be addressing there as well . I do wish that they dissolved and broke down more as my pot dishes have what looks like brown cat litter granules in them as opposed to silty residue .
3 #### Vacuuming just got a little easier with this light - weight , cordless job . It does n't have the cleaning power of a full - sized , corded vacuum but it does suck up a lot of dog hair and general debris / dust . If you are noise sensitive , you might find this vacuum a little easier on your ears too . But most of all , it 's much easier on the back , and the handle is long enough for a taller person . It also has a nice reach under lower - profile furniture . One year later , I 'm down - grading this to 3 stars because the batteries neither take a good charge or keep a good charge . This was the second one I bought and it 's inferior to the first one , perhaps luck of the draw . Anyway , I 'm buying a Shark Navigator next and will see if that works any better .
4 #### Nice product , If I needed another I d buy this pot again
5 #### I purchased this corkscrew based on the reviews , and because it was made by OXO . I just wanted a functional corkscrew , without all of the frills . This is another great utensil from OXO . The OXO non slip grip makes the corkscrew efficient . It is handy to have an all in one opener with the blade as a foil cutter . The price is right .
5 #### We baked our first cake in this pan and followed the directions using a spray oil / flour release coating on the pan . The cake came out of the pan easily and was perfecty baked . It looks like it will last a lifetime .
5 #### What a great heater . We 've used this on some remote camping expeditions , where the temps were in the low teens , in a canvass - style tent and it keeps the tent nice and toasty . We only ran it on the low setting ( one side lit ) and it put off enough heat to heat the 10x14 size tent . You can screw in two cans ( one on each side ) or use and adapter hose to connect to a larger bottle . The product is well designed , sturdy and easy to use with an electronic ignition . It also has a place for batteries if you want to have a fan blow the heat out . I ve never used that feature as the heat from it is broadcast very well . The price s good for this product and there are plenty of videos on YouTube on how it operates , etc . We carry it everytime we go camping in the winter or in upper elevations where the temps will be cold enough to require some heat in the tent .
5 #### Need one of these and a shorter one in every kitchen . I use this length for turning lamb chops or cooking meat to avoid oil splatter on me .
3 #### This item is okay , the first one I got , one of the valves would not turn to open and the rubber twist fell off . The second one I got as a replacement works good , but again , the rubber twisters have all fallen off because its hard to turn the valves and now I use pliers so it does n't hurt my fingers . But for my job , it works .
5 #### An excellent saw blade to replace an identical blade I 've used more than 10 years .
4 #### Everything you would except from a whisk . Good price . Comfortable handle . Pros 1 . Comfortable handle 2 . Durable Cons None
5 #### I used these to secure down 3/4 " thick Bruce Oak hardwood floors , they penetrate the flooring and the 3/4 " subfloor with approx . 1/4 " protruding below the subfloor . They hold very tight which is perfect . No complaints with these nails .
5 #### Not long after I bought these I made the mistake of trying to prune old wood that was really too great a diameter for a small pruner and I broke the cutting blade . Feeling embarrassed , I wrote to Fiskars and asked them if I could buy the part I 'd broken . Instead of replying they sent me a new pruner within days . I want anyone shopping for garden tools to know that this is a great company that stands behind its products even when their customers fail to use them properly . How often does that happen these days ? ( I now always make the trek to the shed for the larger loppers when I need to cut old , thick branches . )
5 #### Product used outside of porch exit / entrance doors . Solidly built and they look good , classy almost . Pricing was very good , but shipping costs brought closer to average cost . Plus these were the only wall lights I could find that almost matched the curved glass of my front door and driveway pole lamp fixtures . I 'm very satisfied .
4 #### Hidden away in a drawer . Bought a 3 - piece 8 " 10 " 12 " Stainless steel set for the same price .
5 #### A must to go with the Fly Web light . There are 10 boards per package , and at the current ( 5/15 ) price of just under $ 10 , that 's less than a dollar a piece . I 've yet to see a bug free itself from one of these sticky boards .... once they hit it , they 're not leaving . Unless you 've got an excessively bad insect problem , this refill pack should be enough for at least 2 seasons , possibly 3 .
5 #### Have bought several of these . Use some for books and two for map lights in the car hooked to the visor . great amount of light for most usage
5 #### Easy to use and cut . I built a chicken coop with this and have plenty leftover just in time for diy Halloween decorations and projects ! The holes are bigger than I expected though .
5 #### Buy eight of these . The best all - around utility knife in our house . Be warned , this has no safety besides a tension - lock on the closed knife . That said , this knife is a perfect jack of all trades .
4 #### It is set up and ready to use . The bugs are not out in force yet as it still is cool at nightl
3 #### Fits my Black & Decker machine fine , but must be made of a soft metal . It does n't hold its sharpness very long . I easily go through two blades a season .
3 #### It did n't work for me but maybe I have very smart rats that smelled a trap . The rats eventually found somewhere else to nest .
5 #### This is a great little set of clips that also function as refrigerator magnets , helping you organize bills , phone numbers -- whatever things you need to have out in plain sight for ready reference and easy access . They are also washable , so greasy kitchen finger prints are not a problem .
5 #### A real good knuckle saver , and if you have a good drill , then this adaptor will save you time and aggravation .
4 #### I needed a replacement for the short hose that runs from the faucet to my hose reel . This filled the bill , and it 's about three times as long as the old connector hose , which allows me to store the reel out of the way . However , the hose does NOT match the one pictured in Amazon 's ad . It 's not only a different color ( which the ad does indicate ) , it 's reinforced vinyl , not rubber as the one in the ad appears to be . The metal connectors are cheap stamped metal with no black knob for tightening , and the single washer that came with the hose was plastic , which I replaced with a good rubber washer . However , having reading the other reviews before I ordered , I did n't expect much , and this does the job at a low price . No leaks so far , even under full pressure with the nozzle turned off .
5 #### I purchased these MAGLITE K3AMW6 National Breast Cancer Solitaire Flashlight , Pink to assist with the breast cancer drive for a cure , and provide extra lighting in every room of the house and our vehicles .
5 #### I was hesitant to use this on the grill . The flames did not break through the rope . Turned out great and kept everything in place . The delivery driver even brought my trash can up to my house from the end of my driveway . Five stars !
4 #### Much smaller that I expected but they are good quality
5 #### Worked perfectly in my Toro cordless trimmer . I just matched my model number with the description here on Amazon , poppled it in easily , and was able to use my trimmer within minutes .
5 #### These are so very convenient and my houseplants are thriving !
4 #### Thin so works better with not - so - heavy plants or use 2 - 3 stakes at a time for more support .
5 #### This is one well made tool not to heavy and not to light nice balance and sturdy handle
5 #### We have several of these up in our barn , and it makes a huge difference in the fly population around our animals . We 've placed them high enough where the smell does n't bother us , and they catch flies by the thousands .
5 #### Nice stretchy hose , purchased to replace one that had leaks because it was left out in the freezing weather with water in it . I 'll be sure to drain this one .
5 #### Connects 4 " dust hoses and fits well enough that I usually do n't use a clamp unless the hose is getting pulled on
5 #### As expected this shears cuts clean . I do n't have to exert excessive force to cut branches .
5 #### I really like this item . I am reading a lot of complains on here , but it 's made of metal , feels solid , and does n't leak at all . I needed a nozzle with threads on the outlet to connect a foam sprayer to wash my car , and this one works great . The spray is adjustable and you can lock it on if needed . It 's basic but it works .
5 #### Works as advertised turning our Christmas lights on and off and has lasted one New England Christmas season so far
5 #### I love using this to core apples for my kids ' lunches . They are too young to eat around the apple without eating the seeds , but they do n't like the apple all cut up because it gets too much brown on it . The middle still browns up , but not too much to gross them out .
5 #### I love this pan ! ! nothing sticks ! pops out perfectly ! ! ! great purchase ! !
5 #### These are my goto measuring tape . I have used the Stanley tapes forever as I never have problems with them , unless my kids get ahold of them and let the lip slam on the tapes base which causes the lip to break eventual .
5 #### This is the second Lifetime table that we have owned over the years . We purchased this one because I know that it is " bullet proof " !
5 #### This holds the perfect amount for one semi - strong cup of tea . The tea diffuses easily and I have n't had any trouble with the locking mechanism .
5 #### We 've owned a Stir Crazy for years and always appreciated the great job it does popping corn - hardly any un - popped kernels , and no burned corn . We bought this one as a gift for my daughter and her family . They love it and use it multiple times a week .
5 #### My kids , ages 5 & 7 love this placemat . They got it for Christmas a year ago , and since then their interest in space and our solar system has increased .
5 #### Perfect fit for my old scout ax . Had to sand it down just a bit and then it fit like a glove . The ax head will never come off or get loose after driving the wedge in .
4 #### I bought this through my hubbys account . I love this it is a great addition to my other wind chimes on my balcony . Do n't catch the wind and chime as much as the others but is very whimsical .
5 #### I have 4 dogs and this little vacuum has worked miracles for me . So light weight and easy to use . Changing the bags is a breeze ! Great purchase for the money .
4 #### Well this is the very first time I 've every used or purchased a pressure cooker before . I had a hard time trying to get the top to line up right . I thought I was going to have to send it back , however , my daughter the other cook in the family was very successful in attaining this task . It works very well , I thought it was a bit cheap but it does just as great a job , I suppose as all the other pressure cookers . No problems with the release valve , it work well . So do n't spend any more money than you have to , this one is great . So why did I give it a 4 and not a 5 , good question . Would I purchase it again for a gift yes , do I recommend it , absolutely yes .
5 #### This replaces an old 5 ' ladder . You ca n't beat a Werner ladder and this is no exception .... great ladder ! ! This makes life easier when you just do n't need a 6 foot or 8 foot ... and five is easy to carry around ... only about 13 pounds . This should be a lifetime ladder for me .
5 #### These fly catchers are unbelievably efficient , and they do not have the noxious odor of most fly traps . You never have to touch the flies and no yechy sticky paper . These products work best outdoors , placed slightly adjacent to the location you want to rid of flies . simple installation and easy - to - follow instructions .
5 #### After a lifetime of using those cheap peelers you buy at the grocery store , I treated myself to this . I started falling in love with OXO products a while ago , and this product is as superb as all the others . My first peel project : a big eggplant ( which I love ) . It took the skin off quickly and easily , in nice wide pieces . Just a light touch is all that 's required . Treat yourself !
4 #### The vacuum is light weight , and picks up dirt and hair quite well . It runs for a bout ten minutes on a fully charged battery . I am not too crazy about the charger annd charging base . The charging base is made to be mounted on the wall with screws . I 'm not going to put holes in my walls for a vacuum cleaner that will last a couple of years . The charging base could be used for counter top battery charging , but it 's designed for wall hanging , and it slides on the counter , and the shape is not made for flat surfaces .
5 #### Very handy tool with good leverage improvement . Surprisingly effective for size . Durable after years of use .
5 #### exact product at an affordable price w a smooth transaction
5 #### This sharpener is very simple to use and works great . It provides a surprisingly sharp blade on all my knives ( good knives and cheap knives ) . It was a good buy .
5 #### Made in the U.S.A. the most important thing to remember . Bought one for my son and grandson . It is a great hammer , good balance to weight . Estwing makes good tools and they will last when the china ones have bit the dust . Still using the my grandfather 's and it is over 50 years old , will pass it on to my grandson .
5 #### I bought the Weber 2290 Rotisserie to use with my 22.5 " Charbroil Grill . I bought the Charbroil instead of the Weber because of the shelves on each side of the grill and I liked it very much . Since the Weber 2290 Rotisserie does not fit my Charbroil 22.5 " Kettle Grill I now own a Weber One Touch Gold(along with my Weber 18 " Silver ) so that I can cook my Thanksgiving turkey on the 22.5 " and the Acrorn Squash on the 18 " . At first glace it appears to be a well designed item , but I wo n't know first hand until Thanksgiving . I 've had Turkey cooked on the Weber One Touch before(so I know they are delicious ) but never using a rotisserie until this year .
5 #### The Corona RS 7120 cuts very quickly and with minimal effort . ( It cuts on the pullback ) I have given several to friends , one with very little strength in her hands , and she can still cut thick branches EASILY . I have used many pruning saws , and the the size and shape of this one if perfect . I recommend this saw highly . You can use it in place of a chainsaw for small projects . When the blade finally gets dull ( my first one took several months of hard use ) , you can order new blades for about $ 10.00 each . It 's easy to replace the blades and they do n't loosen up at all . Warning- if you get one you will want to give all your friends one also .
1 #### I will only feed hummingbirds clear nectar . I ordered these pouches of clear nectar mix because they are easy and very quick to mix up to fill my feeders . Unfortunately , I received a jug of liquid red - colored nectar instead of what I ordered , hence my one - star rating for this transaction . I contacted the seller about the problem , was told they did n't have any of the item I ordered in stock and issued me a prompt refund . Since I feel strongly about how unhealthy it is to feed hummers nectar with red dye , I poured out the jug I received .
5 #### I make fries all the time and this cut down my time . I did need a little muscle to get the potatoes through , but it was worth it . The vegies cut easy and it is just a great product .
5 #### Great control to grip all manner of food sizes and densities from boiled collards to frozen grapes . Totally dishwasher tolerant , even the soft parts . Easy and gentle on my chronic hand injury . An excellent value for the money .
5 #### Very happy with product . Makes peeling potatoes and fruit easy .
5 #### For the little patch of grass I have this has been great ! it is small enough to store with my porch brooms and it is easy to push . It cuts very well .
5 #### It was time for my 15 - year old salad spinner to go . This OXO one was rated best by America 's Test Kitchen . I 've purchased many products they recommended and have not been disappointed . It has a break to stop the spinning , and the pump goes down for storage . It removes water from salad very well and stays put while spinning because it grips the countertop . So glad I ordered it !
5 #### Awesome . A must - have for making salads . Gets all the dirt and bugs off the lettuce and this dries it out in just a few spins . High quality and quick .
5 #### I 've bought several packs of these for my reloading table and have been pleased with them . One came with the Lee Load - Master kit I bought which is what got me interested in them in the first place . They are stackable and stay put pretty well . No regrets ; will buy more .
5 #### Glad I purchased this optional extra . Makes cross cutting of long planks easier . Only complaint is that it is sometimes difficult to pull the support out . It has a tendency to stick .
4 #### I like it , it does the job . I got it cause we live in the sticks and when the electricity goes out , we 're screwed until it comes back on . So it works . It sucks that you have to buy the power cord separate . I call b.s . on that . Update : Have had this a few yrs now and use it as stated , on camping trips , hunting , and in the man cave when on mid shift . it takes 2 1 lb propane bottles and that will last about 2 , 3 days tops , dependent how high you want it . If you keep it on low , the 2 bottles will last several days . How long each day ? maybe 4 - 6 hrs a day ( hunting blind ) so maybe a week . There is a battery compartment in order to power the blower fan , I have n't changed those batteries yet . This thing really does put out some heat and can warm a 1 - 2 bd area easily .
5 #### Came on time , plugged it in and it worked . 6 months later still working fine . Had all the features I need AND came with a remote ! ! !
1 #### Absolutely terrible . Suction is fine but this is the most awkward vacuum to use . No wheels so it does not glide well over floor on high setting and scratches wood on low . Total garbage . Used it once and the attachment fell off several times , hitting my foot and causing injury to my toe . Terrible product .
5 #### Perfect on the patio . Easy to read and aligns exactly with official outside air temp .
5 #### I love my little mower ! It has very sharp blades , and it is perfect for my townhouse lawn . I keep it stored in an inside closet when not in use . It is pretty easy and very quick to assemble . I like the fact that it 's made in the USA . Note , some debris such as thicker ivy and branches may stop the blade spinning . Just use your foot ( if wearing closed shoes ) to reverse the blade a bit . This can be a little frustrating , but I 'm pretty sure it 's par for the course with a mechanical mower .
3 #### I notice some reviewers thought it was smelly and some did not . I live in a hot climate and mine was super smelly ... like a dead rodent . If the breeze blows towards my patio I can not stand the odor . It trapped a lot of flies but I did n't notice a decrease . I think based on the strong smell it may have attracted more to my area than would not have otherwise hung around . Maybe I needed to hang more . I 'm not getting another one .
5 #### as advertised ..... Oregon Chainsaw always delivers a good product . I 've bought lots of their chainsaw chains over the years and have n't ever been disappointed with the quality ...... good product ..........
4 #### I actually used this for lasagna and it cut through it easily and was easy to serve . I also used it for cake but we have n't tried it with pie yet .
5 #### This bowl does n't slide and the measurement marks are clear . It is so easy to handle , and to keep clean .
5 #### i use to peel my veggies with a knife , but this thing is so simple and easy to use .... what was I thinking ALL my life ! it 's great quality and i love the feel of the handle .... and the blade is very sharp that i never had any issues peeling !
5 #### This product is just what I expected . It cuts drywall really well which is really the only purpose I bought it for . It is just flexible enough that you can do curves while cutting .
5 #### This is hands down the very best vegetable brush I 've ever , EVER , had . Even my husband is impressed by it . Glad I bought two so if this one ever wears out ( which will take a good long time because it is built so well ) I 'll have another on hand and not have to do without it .
5 #### Good soaker with adjustable flow volume . Excellent for watering shrubs , trees , vegetables , etc . right at the base . .
5 #### The OXO salad spinner works very well . The design of the salad spinner was well thought out and it reflects on how it actually works . Very happy with this spinner .
4 #### right size , right price , handy for short spans to avoid stacks of extra coils , could probably use a couple more
5 #### I had my doubts but it works exactly as advertised .. Use a few pieces of dry dog food as bait . Just summarily executed rat # 3 with no battery change needed yet . Highly recommenced .
4 #### The breaker works fine , perfect fit and a great price . It is hard to find these at home stores . -Extra text to meet minimum requirements-
5 #### The birds and squirrels LOVE this ! We see new species every day that we never saw before .
5 #### this new addition to my kitchen is now making life so smooth ;) ! it has actually encouraged me to add carrots to more of my cooking since it takes a mere few seconds to clean em up real good ... definitely well designed : handle grip , swivel blade , light weight : easy to use . love it :)
5 #### I was tired of using headlamps to read at night . I ordered this book light , not expecting much because I have not had much luck with them in the past . This light surprised me by far exceeding my expectations . It is very bright and a lot smaller than I was expecting .
5 #### ( And I usually roast my own beans ! ) I bought this to make Cuban coffee . The 6 - cup size is just right for two double - espresso sized cups , like Illy or Lotus . I also ordered some Caf Bustelo espresso coffee , and was worried the grind was too fine ; not at all , rarely residual grind . Fill the basket ( off pot ) , and lightly pat to level - do n't tamp - this is not espresso . I save the Cuban coffee preparation ( with the whipped sugar ) for afternoon pick - me - ups ; now I also use the moka pot for morning brew as well . I have n't yet had to try my own beans ; this combination works perfectly . I also ordered a replacement filter basket and gaskets , because the Bialetti is an iconic standard , and replacement parts are available .
4 #### Buy these for six bucks directly from Werner at parts(.)werner(.)com(/)/Home(/)Part(/)36 - 2
5 #### Great vacuum . Have purchased two . They do a good job for their size .
5 #### This is THE BEST pizza cutter I have ever used ( and we eat homemade pizza at least twice a week ) . It is much easier to use than just about every other pizza cutter out there due to the large wheel and plastic bushing in the hub . The cutter rolls very , very smoothly , and cuts through toppings , like pepperoni , without sliding them around into gooey mounds of cheese . The blade on mine is all stainless steel , thus no rust , and I 've had mine for 2 years now . For best results , you should hold this cutter very upright and apply enough down force . I cut my pizzas into 8 slices in a couple of seconds , and never have to retrace my cuts , unless I got lazy and did n't push down hard enough .
1 #### It 's a pretty thermometer but you can not see the numbers because it is so dark colored .
5 #### Just arrived . Tried it on some knotty chunks of pine and birch ( semi - green / wet ) . Split clean and easy . Exceeds expectation ! Not sure how it will perform on knurly pieces of perform with oak , cherry , maple , but even if I have to use a maul on those , this is a real addition to the firewood arsenal--5 + cord / year .
5 #### Simply marvelous . My sister in law has one . So , we decided we should get one for painting and chores inside . No more lugging that 6 ft step ladder from the garage and no more crazy balancing act from a step stool .
4 #### A little messy and hard to clean but makes wonderful popcorn . It works with my organic popcorn with a thicker hull and my every other kind of popcorn I have thrown at it . I love oil popped corn and this is great with my favorite coconut oil .
5 #### Great quality for a very good price . These work well so far ( only tested on wood ) . Better than some cheaper brands I 've used .
5 #### Flies were in 30 minutes after putting it up and they keep coming . WOW this really works . I am in AZ and does not seem a problem the flies until you try to eat outside in the spring . But this will work for you ! ! ! !
1 #### I carefully tested two identical hoses , and they both failed miserably . In the range of 15 - 20 PSI the flow rate is absurdly low , and parts of the hose that are in the sun warm up enough that the hose softens , expands , and lets lots of water out at that place . At higher pressure ( 40 PSI ) more water comes out of the soft spot(s ) and most of the rest of the hose still barely lets any water out .
5 #### It works great . I should have bought it years ago .
5 #### I installed this 15 minute timer on my bathroom fan and it works perfectly . Now after a steamy shower I can turn the fan on and walk away .
4 #### We were pleased with the purchase , however the description says it has a bypass on it which it does not have a bypass . Other then that they are what we use for the filter system .
5 #### Cheap and easy . Good for Chai teas . Not good for bulky tea .
1 #### The seeds germinated OK , but there appeared to be a mold growth and a very strong , foul , sulfurous smell . Had to throw the batch out . Never had a similar problem with alfalfa sprouts .
4 #### Overall , this seems to do a decent job . I 've had it less than 2 weeks , but have been using it daily . This picks up dog hair ( I have 4 Cardigan Welsh Corgis that bring in a lot of dirt and shed a lot ) . I have a 1900 square foot house with wood , travertine , and ceramic tiles . My opinion based on cleaning doormat rugs is that this product would not be a good on carpet . I use it daily on the carpet setting ... seems to pick up better . I try to vacuum quickly before the battery charge runs out . The batteries do n't always get my whole house ( even with using both batteries ) . I 'm not sure if they are charging all the way . It does pick up the majority of the dog hair . It can go under my couches , but it is inconvenient because it is kind of wide . The canister does have to be emptied a few times during each cleaning and I usually have to use my hands to pull the dog hair out of the canister ( it gets stuck in the flap ) . The canister is on the small side , but it does the job . Also , it is somewhat inconvenient to put back on . 3 weeks later : The batteries are not charging so I 'm going to send it back ... but will try ordering another one in case this one was just defective .
4 #### A must have if you do small carpentry jobs around the house . Good product for the price . Clear markings and easy to use .
5 #### This router plate is awesome , far more than I expected . The router base plate has all the insert rings attached , they are stable and easy to configure , there are adjustment screws to level the plate and unique locking tabs in the corners . It looks serious and I love owning it . I have installed it , used it and am proud of it . I got 2 of them . I am learning the Bob Rosendahl method ( PBS tv ) This plate is not screwed to the table top , it lifts out for bit changes and height adjustments . I ca n't compare it with other plates , I have always made my own from Lexan , I ran out of Lexan , did not buy any more , it is too expensive . If a woodworker at any level needs a decent router plate , try the Roussea .
5 #### I could n't find a replacement filter at the local hardware stores . This was a good ' find ' for me . The filter is good quality ; will purchase again when needed .
5 #### You can not compare this to a corded electric leaf blower , it is n't even marketed for that . It is a great replacement for a broom however and for that it works great . We have a 50 foot porch which is always in need of a sweep after even a light wind . Needles , leaves , pieces of cones always seem to make their way , it is a constant battle . Using a broom takes too much time to do everyday as is taking the time to get out the cord and electric blower which is overkill . This little blower works perfectly . So easy to use I just grab it and flip the switch . I can have the porch clean in about a minute . Works well for the patio and garage too . As a bonus I was recently surprised to find it worked well blowing the needles off our roof , another issue we have to deal with every summer . I have a couple of batteries . I always leave one in the charger , the batteries last a bit longer when I do . If you have a lot of sweeping to do this is a great tool !
3 #### I ordered this with the feeder but it did not work in my backyard . I 'm in Long Island , NY . Did all instructions and saw some birds around but never on my feeder .
2 #### Ca n't fit a small potato in this thing . Got ta cut them all in half .
4 #### same as my old one ; reliable and works like a charm
4 #### This timer is well made , but the timer can ' t be manually turned off once wound .
5 #### I have n't used these blades yet , but they seem to be sturdier than other blades I have purchased , so I am assuming that they will hold their edge longer and stand up well to extended use . This was a better price than I could find at our local home center .
5 #### Love these . I had been using my fathers for years to cut almost anything and to pull out nails .
5 #### This is a quality deep pie dish . It is thick and does not appear to be fragile at all . Makes a great deep dish pot pie . Good price .
5 #### I have several hummer feeders and about half of them are this one , which I consider one of the best . My only admonition is to clean it regularly and systematically , lest it become fouled with algae and other crud . Of course , this is something we hummer aficionados should do any way , right ?
5 #### Just what I needed ! Makes washing / drying large amounts of fresh herbs so much easier !
5 #### Use this to transport my 55 lb . 11 ' kayak with my mid size mini van . I have enough room to transport two kayaks . ( Trailers for Kayaks a little pricey,)Bought this on Amazon , after reading it 's reviews ... With Extender can transport Kayak either on top of vehicle or inside it , prefer inside vehicle because of Kayak 's weight .
5 #### Seller performed excellent .... the product was great and a good deal ! ... we are very happy .
5 #### I was looking for a way to move my Sears table saw around my garage . This fit the bill . Very easy to use and once lowered is a secure stand that will not move . Great product .
5 #### Prompt shipping . Exactly as pictured and described . No hiccups - smooth transaction . Thank you .
5 #### Gave to my Dad as a gift , he loves them !
5 #### Very nice product . Works quite well and it 's good value for the money .
3 #### probably needs to be set down ( the gate door)to avoid sticking and clogging when you try to close the gate / bought a metal one to try as the plastic won , t take much and a couple came apart what to expect for 6 or 7 bucks / easy enough to make your own really
5 #### Excellent product , very responsible in their sales , are 100 % as required , recommended , to deal with you was a real pleasure , thanks for your kind treatment
4 #### Adjust it first . This little plane is for small work and only shaving of little bits material at a time . Take your time and adjust it on a scrap piece of wood so it will shave material nicely . It is very small and has one screw to lock the blade in place . Set it to where the blade is barely(LIKE A HAIR WIDE ) protruding from the base and you should be happy . This may take awhile to get just right . resting it flat on a counter top then pushing the cutting edge flat against the surface while I tightened the screw worked well for me to get a base line . If it digs , it 's too far out . Try again . Remember this is for small projects or refining fit and finish . You ca n't get enough purchase on the tool to put alot of force behind it to remove lots of material on a long push or pull stroke . I do n't like that the base is painted because as the paint wears off it forms a dip it the base . Easily fixed by sanding the paint off . If you have the patience for it , it 's great . Just put in the extra effort to make it work best for you . It cost as much as a six pack . I keep mine on me pretty much always when in work mode . Very light . Grind was off on the blade but I planned on squaring it anyway .
5 #### Works great ! I use it for making refried beans . Comfortable to hold and very sturdy .
3 #### This is a decent hose reel for the price . My husband says an improvement could be made at the hose connection to the reel . It 's made of plastic and it needs to be metal . At this price point though , I guess you would get a metal connection on reels costing much more . Other than that , it serves our purposes .
2 #### A bit ticked off because : When I placed my order it stated that there was a limit of I believe 3 or 4 per " customer " not full confident that this would work I ordered one ( yes it is great easy to install etc ) although when I came back to day to order 2 more I was not allowed to because it stated I had ordered the maximum possible . I fell a bit screwed because it did not originally state you can order only once ! If that were the case I would have ordered the 3 and returned all if it did not work . I will not order from this seller again !
5 #### I will be buying more when I start to run out .
5 #### If you have a fly trap like a resolve , then use this stuff to inhance or sustain your fly trap . It works .
5 #### I 've wanted a large stainless steel bowl like I see on cooking shows that is somewhat deep but also wide enough to use as a serving bowl for salads or snacks like popcorn . This one is perfect ! It 's sturdy enough that it does n't dent easily but it 's not too heavy either . It 's great for bread dough rising also . I also have the 4 qt and plan to get the 8qt .
5 #### I received a lamp body with some cheap plastic parts that needed replacing . This kit had everything I i needed except the lamp shade , and the quality was good .
5 #### This is a sturdy cover and if you also have the side shelves on your camp chef 2 burner stove , this cover fits just fine .
5 #### This set of three , multi - colored bottle brushes is perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports and other small holes and places . For example , I have reserved one to clean out the small spouts in my fountain which tend to clog with algae as the summer wears on . Each brush is about 3.5 inches long , with a tapered head that begins at 1/8 inch and widens at the base to 1/4 inch . The brushes can crush down to a much more narrow diameter than that , of course -- the width of the wires that hold the brushes , less than 1/16 of an inch . The plastic handles are rigid , although they can accidentally be snapped in two with pressure . The wired support of the brushes themselves is only slightly flexible ; you wo n't be able to work these brushes around corners and inside the base of a feeder bottle . These are basically short , rigid , reusable pipe cleaners . They are perfect for cleaning hummingbird feeder ports or any other job requiring those qualities . -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
5 #### One of the best hummer feeders at a great price . It is so easy to order these things on line and get wuick delivery .
5 #### I 've decided for core tools , the ones you use constantly , such as basic screwdrivers , good quality will not only give you the best , most enjoyable experience now , but also save over time since they 're more durable . For these core tools , I 'll stick with Klein and other top manufacturers . This screwdriver is rock solid and seems it will serve not only as a screwdriver but also in those alternate applications to which we always put flathead screwdrivers ( mini pry bar , opening paint cans , etc . ) This screwdriver seems to be 2 " longer than the " standard ' length of a screwdriver , is just a bit longer than most basic screwdrivers I own .
2 #### I got this last year , it worked great . Hummers love perches . This year it has leaked and I ca n't find out where or why . Needless to say I have had to remove it . I did salvage the perch and attach it to another feeder like this that I have had for years . It is not the easiest to clean , but can be done .
5 #### Went to Lowe 's to purchase 5 bulbs for our landscape lighting . No problem finding the bulbs in stock ..... but the price about knocked me off my feet ..... $ 6.00 PER BULB ! ! Figured it was just a mistake . Took one up to the service counter for them to check the price . They said that was the correct price , but it was a " little " higher because it was a " speciality " bulb . Went home ( without any bulbs ) looked on the internet ..... found them for 44 cents ! Ordered 20 bulbs . Arrived about 4 or 5 days later . Took one out of the box ..... but it under the magnafier alongside the original .... exact match in every way . Replaced the ones burned out ..... they worked fine , and no problems since . The only difference I could find ? Lowe 's sells theirs in a fancy package , and if my calculator is correct ... at about a 1400 % mark - up . These bulbs came with each one in a separate little box wrapped in bubble plastic . Yep , I 'm happy !
4 #### I love composting ; it makes me feel like I 'm doing my part to keep valuable plant nutrients in the ecosystem , and waste out of the landfills . And it 's super easy to do when you break it down into the basics : heap up food and yard waste , and let it rot . Then you wait , sometimes for a year , for your compost . This product speeds up the process a little bit . It has a mild manure smell that did not bother me when I was storing it in the garage before use , but the smell did bother my nose - sensitive mother , who wanted to know what ' that stink ' was . So for storing inside , be aware others might find the scent offensive . I 'd suggest just using it right away . :) The pellets are really just a kickstarter product , with enzymes and flora to make the compost process hotter more quickly . If you 've never composted before , this is a great way to get some quicker compost bang for your buck . It 's also fun to use , making the process more like cooking . If you really want to learn how to compost well , read Let It Rot , or find a website on composting . Even with a starter batch like this , composting still takes time and patience . NOTE : Some of my pellets arrived sifted out from the box . It was a bit messy .
1 #### I beg to differ , the blade bends at the base and after several bending it back to the original setting it ends up in two pieces . That is the truth of the matter . The original peelers were all metal and I can not fathom why the makers stopped making them . They never bent and nor have I ever seen any snap in half . I am not complaining for they work in other uses just not for peeling potatoes . great on carrots , cucumbers and other smooth surfaces like apples and such .
2 #### Made in Mexico and the blade does not hold an edge .
5 #### I do n't give too many 5 star ratings - but these boards are great . I catch mice , bugs , spiders - anything that moves in my garage or basement is fair game . My next door neighbor did n't think he had a bug problem , put a couple in his garage and they are both billed with bugs and he caught a mouse . I put these down preemptively to catch bugs and mice that want to make a home in my home .
5 #### This Oxo 58081 Steel Can Opener is terrific . For just a few dollars more than your standard " drug store " plastic and metal hand can opener , you get one made of quality stainless steel with the most comfortable grip and turning knob ever . It works like a charm and is really easy to hold ; it is especially helpful for those of us with slightly arthritic hands . Another real plus is that it washes beautifully ( by hand ) and wo n't rust . I highly recommend this brand and model of hand can opener . This item was received in timely fashion and in perfect condition .
1 #### Purchased a year ago and already need to replace it . I wish I had listened to other reviewers on the battery life . If you 're reading 5 star reviews , it may be because the reviewer has n't owned this vacuum for very long .... At first it I thought it worked great , and would have gladly given it 5 stars . It was nice having 2 batteries for longer jobs . Over time the batteries held less and less charge . It would be so that after only 5 minutes I 'd have to replace the battery with the other one in the charger . I every time I vacuumed I 'd run the battery out and it would charge for at least 12 hours before using again . Today was it 's last vacuum . The battery in the vacuum died quickly so I went to replace it with the one in the charger and that too died within 30 seconds .... Switching back to a corded vacuum with an extension cord .
5 #### I picked two of these to use on outdoor lights , on my front porch . And they work well . I was a little concerned that the dawn / dusk sensor would not be super accurate . This was the primary function I purchased them for . But it works well , so A+ And come Christmas , they will get used for those lights as well .
5 #### After my fiasco with Ebay HK LED 9W " dimmable " GU10s which buzzed and flickered like in a disco , i went for the only narrow beam 20W available here , for a very decent price . They dim wonderfully , and i have 18 bulbs on a Lutron 600 W IR dimmer , and plan on adding 6 more soon . The convex UV protective lens looks good too . Very pleased , i know the brand from my office , where my desk lamp burns about a bulb / year , but when i got 10 for half the price of one at Home Depot I am a happy customer .
4 #### Well made . The one thing that stood out when I first looked at this was that it was noticeably larger than all other cutters I 've owned ... I do n't know if that 's a plus or a minus ... either way , this is a good , solid pizza cutter . It has weight to it and the disc does n't wobble like many other cutters ... so we 're happy !
5 #### I found this on amazon at a great price so I ordered it a few hours later it went on sale . Amazon refunded me the difference immediately . Great customer service . This saw is amazing so quite vibration free it was up and running in minutes .
5 #### I bought this for my husband because he love popcorn on race day . Easy to clean up and avoids a lot of grease !
5 #### not as advertised . sitting in my carport to be sent back
1 #### THIS IS NOT a Marshalltown trowel ! The name brand is Goldblatt and it is welded NOT forged .
1 #### good while they lasted . I have had 2 OXO flexible spatulas come apart where the flipper is welded to the handle . I have several OXO utensils and 2 have broken in the last few days . the head snapped of my OXO bottle brush last night at the flex point above the steel handle where it is plastic . I was just shaking the water out of it after using before placing in dish drainer to dry . Head came flying off . The head of my OXO pizza cutter snapped off the black plasitc handle 4 days ago . The OXO utensils are nicely designed and great while they last but that is not long . I also have 2 wooden silicone spatulas , the wood handles are fine but silicone head is nicked and disintigrating . I hand wash all of my utensils and do not abuse them . I have many utensils some cheap and some expensive that have lasted for years . This lack of durability is unacceptable . Its time to look for a new utensil maker .
5 #### Takes about 3 hours to assemble . Lots of screws and nuts . However Martins love it . Ordered a second house since I had so many martis the first year .
5 #### X Mas decorations came on as soon as the sun started to create dusk . Turned off as the dawn approached . Very well constructed , and so far : Worked like a charm . Ca n't go wrong . Better than the timer , if in the evnt of a power failure .
5 #### love it . love the size of the handle . easy to grip
4 #### I 've owned his tool for at least 15 years . I do woodworking as a hobby so I use this tool about once or twice a year . When I do use it , I will sharpen my planer , jointer , chisels , and cooking knives all in one swoop . This is a great tool . When I first got this I knew little about sharpening and boy did I have alot to learn . Assuming whoever reads this knows about sharpening , you first sharpen the back(a little ) , then set the main bevel , and then create a micro - bevel . I bought the rough and the 4000 grit wheel , but I never use them . If something needs a lot of metal removal , I use a bench grinder with Norton wheels . I m my opinion , the whetstones work better after about an hour using them . I think this is the water absorbing in the grinding stone . Its all about the slurry that s created . I learned to soak it an hour before using it . Wear work clothes when using this . There 's a lot of splatter as the slurry contacts the knives . It does nt come out of your clothes . When done clean the metal particles off the wheel .
5 #### I 've never used something like this ; easy to understand , and operate .
5 #### Wish I had purchased the OXO Good Grips Corer much earlier in my life . Took seconds to core the apples to make the dumplings , and cleaning the utensil was very easy . Thank you OXO !
1 #### Purchased 4 of these feeders and one of them leaked profusly right away . Sent it back and Amazon replaced it with another one that also leaked . Since then , the other three started leaking also . Do n't know if I can still return the entire batch since it has been a couple of months , but I am going to try . I had these same feeders in the past and they lasted several years . Somebody " improved " them . Update : I contacted the manufacturer direct since the Amazon return policy is only good for 30 days and they replaced all four feeders with no hassel whatsoever . Havn't received them yet , so I do n't know how these will perform .
5 #### Many potato mashers have a long , pointed grip that makes it impossible to mash large amounts of material . It is simply to hard to grasp and press down for long periods of time . This handle is flat and easy to hold . Pressure can be exerted with minimal effort to get the job done .
5 #### I chipped the ceramic stem while putting it in . The magnet pull is so strong it is very hard to keep it from slamming in . However --- it came very quickly and saved my fish ! I have ordered a second one so that I am ready next time . Not a bad price considering .....
5 #### If you are looking for worm castings this is a great big bad of them . I use them all of my yard and garden .
5 #### I use my shop vac to vacuum up leaves on my patio or spills of dry goods in the kitchen , using the bags makes the job easier . They work as I expected .
5 #### Very good square , Good easy to see markings . Still does n't come with any info inside package so you need to know how to use one .
5 #### I used it to build a chicken run . Very well made . No problems with predators getting through yet .
3 #### I purchased this item to be able to carry my 16 ' kayak on top of my 2 Dr Jeep wrangler . I have not actually loaded the kayak yet so this review is based on installing the extend a truck and reviewing the fit . It fits just fine . One thing I was worried about was whether it would clear the spare tire on the back . It does . The package came well packed and in good shape . I have one issue which is why it loses two stars . It says in the instructions that to use it for your roof you must use some type of rope to tie the extend a truck down to the back bumper . Fair enough . So let me get that rope they included . Oh that 's right they do n't include rope . I have a problem with products that require parts they do n't include . Including the rope would have gotten 5 stars .
4 #### I 've been using this item for a long time but needed another . bought it on amazo just to find out it was half the price in the retail store . the product works good ! !
5 #### Love this thing . Makes about an 8 oz cup of coffee . Easy to clean . Just make sure you keep the heat very low as to not scorch the coffee inside or damage the rubber gasket . Takes about 15 min to make
5 #### we have about 10 windchimes placed around our s florida home . this one i put at the front enterance way . it is very attrative and well made like all woodstock chimes . does n't take alot of wind to create a nice gong .
5 #### durable . Sturdy . I 'd buy this again easy . Highly recommend . The height is great for potting plants etc . Do n't pass this up if you want a product that stands up to weather .
3 #### I bought this fence to breathe new life into my old Craftsman table saw . The fence is a breeze to set up , and works wonderfly . The on caveat ( and this is a big one ) is the the U26 does n't support using wing extensions , making the 26 inch to the right it advertises useless with some table saws . I returned it and purchased the Mule Accusquare M1025 .
4 #### I work as a commercial electrician . Whenever I need a new set of pliers , I 've always been wary of paying top dollar for a set of Kleins or Milwaukee , given the odds that they could get stolen , lost or destroyed on any given day . So I decided to give these Channellock Pliers a shot , and for the money , I 'd say they are every bit as quality as a set of Kleins . The hinge is nice and loose , moves just the way you want it too , they do n't gum up like the cheaper brands , and they are the perfect weight . Definitely my new favorite brand for the money .
5 #### These breakers worked with the .. P1224L1225CU 125 amp panel I also purchased from amazon ...
5 #### This tool is perfect for any type of work with the dremel . Very good .
5 #### This is a very well made pressure cooker ! The lid seats easily but tightly . The stainless steel cleans easily and heats evenly .
4 #### Easy up is beautiful the bag however broke the first time used . zipper broke first time .
5 #### Great item , stands up to use and cleaning , holds the right amount of tea .
5 #### Finally ... ice cube trays with covers that really work ! These are great ... there 's nothing like fresh , clean , great tasting ice ! I ... like many other reviewers do not use the pop top to fill these , I find it 's easier to fill these the old fashioned way . They do work very well and a little water on the bottom pops them right out ! A great product !
2 #### I have used this plate for 2 years now and it stinks . The crown in the plate is ok ... I do n't mind that , but the snap in rings are a bear . You have to use a hammer and hit it hard to snap them in and out . Last night I was hammering them out and the whole plate shattered . Now looking at Rousseau 's higher quality router lift I find that it has the exact same plastic top and the exact same snap in rings . Being a weird sized plate means I 'm now going to have to re - build the top of my router table to accept a better quality router plate . Spend the extra cash and get an aluminum plate with quality snap in rings . Also Rousseau 's customer service is a nightmare . This has a lifetime warrantee so I called to get get a free replacement after I broke it . 3 months and numerous phone calls later I FINALLY got a new one from them ... with the same stupid problem .
5 #### I like the design , and the birds seem to like it too . The perches are removable , but the hummers nearly always use them , and I figure it sames them energy not having to hover . I ca n't say how long it will last , but it seems to be well - made and it is quite attractive .
4 #### I am a avid gardener and from time to time I find the need to spray pests on my lawn or shrubs . The trouble is , there are rarely measurements on the bottle so that one can dispense the correct amount of product per gallon . This beaker solves that problem . You can easily and concisely measure the product that you need with no hassle .
5 #### I ordered this as a wedding gift for my sister and then had it framed . It sure was tempting to keep for myself . When she opened it , there was not a person around who did not have something great to say . I am planning on purchasing another one for myself , maybe a bigger size . Great quality and also delivered on time .
5 #### Bought this to replace " lost " one , which was definitely missed . Definitely glad I purchased a replacement . Comfortable to hold ( I have arthritis ) & easy to use .
5 #### Bought this specifically for tailgaiting and it was perfect . We made sliders then made hot dogs and it cooked very well . Nothing but the best from weber !
3 #### I had an old stir crazy that was fully seasoned but silly me , I threw it out as I had a missing power cord . I purchased this product and I am very disappointed . First off , the nonstick finish seems to be much different than the older models . It does n't seem that this new finish can be seasoned . Second , popcorn kernels keep getting stuck under the metal arm causing a screeching sound . This is something that never happened on my older model . I 'm not very impressed with the latest model . Wish I kept my old one .
5 #### I use this all the time to cook some steaks outside in our patio . It is perfect for couples and small families . It 's built in the USA and the quality is great .
4 #### I 've used it for a couple of weeks and it keeps the deer away . It is easily activated by my cats and goes off quite a bit . I turn it off in the day time , but can hear it clicking whenever I walk though the yard . So far the batteries have not run down . It is probably worth having to replace batteries often . The only thing to keep in mind is that it only takes one night of not being turned on to lose all your Hollyhocks !
1 #### Was looking forward to having a grow light in my classroom so my students can see how we can grow plants indoors . Ordered this lighting system early so I could make sure it worked and I would be familiar with how it worked . Was delivered today and just got it put together . The light does not work . In my opnion , the frame is cheaply made and the light fixture seems to be twitchy . Returning it . Hopefully , someone who is thinking of ordering this unit will not do so from the Amazon Warehouse , where I am sure this lighting unit will end up , with someone at Amazon trying to resell it . So disappointed .
5 #### Sometimes , keeping it simple is best , especially when its just something as basic as a water nozzle . I 've gone through countless ' fancy ' gadget nozzles with this spray setting , etc . , and all leak of failed at some point . This works like the old school product that it is .
5 #### I love this cake pan ! The cakes turn out perfect every time ! No sticking and falling apart , like they did with other pans . I would recommend this to anyone ! !
5 #### I have tried both dry and soaking in water . Jury is still out on that one . What I can tell you is flavor is noticible . Chips are much easier to work with in reference to Weber 's E670 smoker box . Chucks would be more appropriate for charcoal or homemade tin foil smoker bricks . Tried Charbroils version from HD . Will continue to be buying Weber 's version . Purchase again ? YES
1 #### Very unreliable timers . 3 of the 6 I purchased have failed in the last 2 weeks .
3 #### This beaker is a wonderful tool for accurately measuring small quantities of liquid . The problem is that it scratches easily , so if you try to put more than one thing into it and then mix it will leave scratches that over time make the markings hard to read . Too bad they do n't offer a version made of Pyrex .
5 #### These fit and are easily placed in trap . just peel and stick .
1 #### This is not big enough for an adult to walk on , period . It may be nice for a walkway leading to a small child 's outdoor playhouse , but it is to narrow for an adult .
5 #### Great item to have in a time of need . Good size for home kitchen areas .
5 #### Wonderful for LARGE popovers . Works much better than cupcake tins . Be sure to spray / grease and then heat 5 minutes before filling for baking to get a special crisp to the crust . These are large enough to share .
5 #### Unless you have the perfectly designed work bench , you need this stand for the scroll saw . Right height , right size and sturdy / solid . My wife uses the scroll saw more than I do , but I do n't think there could be anything about this stand not to like .
4 #### It 's a good square . The paint on it is a little thick , so that puts it a little out of flat on one of my sides , but that could just be mine . A light sanding on a flat diamond block and it 's good to go .
5 #### Works great ! I find myself still towel drying on leaf lettuce . But its fun to spin anyway . Almost theraputic .
4 #### Best 35 ' tape for the money , has survived multiple 25 ' falls and months of abuse .
5 #### I got this as a Christmas gift from my husband . I 've only used it once . It works great .
5 #### Ca n't go wrong with this Razor , primarily used for opening boxes and other packages
5 #### These spoons are great ! As an avid baker and a huge fan of OXO I came across these online after purchasing the OXO Good Grips Mixing Bowls and had to get these to go with them ! These are made of great quality as are all OXO brand items ; the stainless steal provides durability as well as a modern flair in comparison to other measuring spoons that are more often than not made of plastics that yellow and stain . I highly recommend this product !
4 #### Love this for a tray full of grilled veggies and onion slices ....
5 #### Someone " borrowed " my original , so this was a needed purchase . A good del , on a light that works . I 'm happy .
5 #### Drill Doctor Diamond Wheel This wheel is the same quality as the original part , which , in my case , lasted through hundreds of sharpenings . An alternative to installing a new wheel is to reverse the existing one . I.e. , remove the current wheel , turn it end - over - end , and reinstall . The drill bits I sharpened did not wear out the middle of the wheel , so reversing it provided new wheel life . Once it 's been reversed , and it 's worn again , a new wheel is required . If you 're having trouble getting the old diamond wheel off the spindle , here 's a tip told to me by Drill Doctor . Put the Drill Doctor in the freezer for 30 minutes and then , try again while the unit is still cold . This may sound silly , but it worked for me . The cold shrinks the metal parts just enough for the old wheel to slide right off .
5 #### OK ... let 's be real . Amazon says the retail on this is over $ 90 , but that ca n't be true ! I 've seen this at Home Depot for a little over $ 40 . That being said , this is a nice little trimmer for the price . I have a small yard but with all the rain recently , the grass had gotten over a foot high in the back , and along the fence it was pretty thick . This thing knocked it out in no time . I like that it auto feeds the line . If you purchase the slightly more expensive pre - wound spools , you wo n't have the problem with line tangling . Only thing that could make this better is if you could adjust the height . I 'm nearly 6 - feet tall , so I have to bend slightly which causes a backache . But for the price , it ca n't be beat .
5 #### I have been using the Victor Out O'Sight Mole Traps for the past 5 years and have found no better trap for getting moles .
5 #### Watched the squirrels try every which way and they could n't get to the birdseed ! ! ! Gave up pretty quickly and went elsewhere . Made really well and easy to maintain . I have mine on a pole .
5 #### Good weight and balance . Scooping is easy and easy to clean . Feels well built . As expected from OXO Good Grips . Love they 're stuff .
5 #### Simply put .... The Weller quality we 've come to expect . Unit works as intended and like their other products , should last a lifetime with limited home use .
5 #### Excellent Transaction and great low price for this de - icing cord for my rain gutters .
4 #### You just ca n't go wrong with Milwaukee products . The beam is surprisingly strong and seems to be of very high quality . Hope to use it for years to come .
5 #### This is by far the best " hatchet " that I 've ever had the pleasure to use . It ( and it 's big brother the X36 ) have made wood cutting & splitting almost a joy ... The balance on this splitting ax it great , enough weight in the head to get through the log , while the handle is short enough to make it ideal for taking an already split piece of wood down to kindling . Highly recommended and I would definitely buy this again .
5 #### Comfortable and easy to use . Did buy the cushion and love it . Would buy again .
5 #### Very handy little shave . Definitely will get used a lot .
5 #### I 've always had good luck with Freud blades and bits , so I was n't surprised when these knives arrived razor - sharp and ready to go . The stock Powermatic knives are 6 " x 3/4 " x 1/8 " , but the extra 1/16 " length of these posed no problems -- plenty of clearance to safely mount . Maybe one day I 'll splurge $ 300 + for a helical carbide - tipped cutterhead . But until then , I 'll just periodically hone these Freud knives to keep getting glass - smooth cuts in both hardwood and softwood !
5 #### My husband has had this on his list ever since he got the trimmer . It came in and he immediately put it to use . It works GREAT ! ! He used it to clean out all the leaves and trimmings in our little area of bushes in front of our house , and it was so much easier than attempting to pick them up with our hands , like we used to have to do . It 's got a lot of power . He loves it .
2 #### the tortillias do n't stay on the item when in the over . they heat up and expand then fall off . not great at all
4 #### After using the beefy max steel and even beefier fat max tapes this seems a little flimsy . Even so , the cheapest stanley is better than any of the other tape measures out there . They stand out longer , they retract more smoothly . Sometimes you need that extra bit of length . I do n't carry this around all the time but it 's there when I need it .
3 #### It is okay , but the clam shell does n't snap closed as well as it should . I 'd like it better if it were made of something besides plastic , maybe ceramic or something less tacky . I do not think it looks good enough to be left out , but it is too big to fit under the sink or in my cabinet .
1 #### Stop working a month ago - owned less than an year . Would not recommend .
5 #### These are great quality cooling racks that will last forever ! They are not cheaply made and will not bend out of shape when you set loaves of bread or a pie on them .
5 #### This is a nice pan for making the grandkids pancakes . They love the faces imbedded in each one . They use syrup to decorate the faces . One grand baby said " her pancakes were wearing makeup " as she decorated the eyes and mouths , it was quite comical . The only difficulty is when its time to turn them , but we took care of that . Have an electric griddle or another pan pre - heated along side the cooktop , when the batch of smileys are ready , flip them over onto the waiting pre - heated surface to continue cooking . Also the directions say to use a cooking spray , so do not leave that step out or they will be difficult to remove when taking them out . We make the batter just a tiny bit thinner and put it in a squeeze bottle , that makes it much easier to fill the molds . I also will carefully highlight the features first , let them cook until darker , then fill the face to give more expression to the smileys . You can also do the opposite for different effects . The kids love them and gobble them up !
5 #### I have never built anything , so I need something simple . It took me about 3 hours to finish the product , but like I said .... I did n't know what I was doing . I have completed my first one , I did put cinder block under the bottom pieces to help support the weight as many said . It is 10 foot long to fit my deck area and 4 foot tall . I did use another set to put a brace on top , simply because I was not sure if the sides would bow out , and I connected with a 2 x 4 . This will also serve to hold the tarp even . I have purchased 3 more sets and am very happy with the product .
4 #### Nice Sturdy Ladder . I can reach almost everything around the Home with it .
3 #### Easy install but less than 3 weeks it has already torn .
5 #### I have several machines on Delta mobile bases . After discovering how well they are made and how well they work when I got my first one with my Unisaw , I do n't even think twice now when I buy a new machine , I always get the Delta base to go with it . I just got a DJ20 . This is one big , heavy jointer . It 's about 475 lbs , about the same as a Unisaw , but this jointer is very long and possibly awkward to move . But my DJ20 is really easy to move and manouver around my small shop using this base . One Hint : when you set up your jointer , place the cabinet in the mobile base first , before you but the jointer assembly on th cabinet .
5 #### This is my second one I have purchased in the past 4 months and I probably should have bought a third , just to ensure I had an extra in the event they stop making them . It has a compartment to keep nozzles in and it comfortably will hang a 120 ' garden hose .
5 #### Very sharp . They work great for all around trimming . Do n't get carried away and try and cut big ass stems . Just for pruning and trimming leaves and very small stems .
3 #### I used it to kill mosquitoes and flies , did n't work for either , even using the included attractant . It did kill a ton of moths , which I really do n't care about .
5 #### I use this with my Bosch 18v impactor and 3/8 Tekton impact sockets . Even though this adapter is not made for impacting it seems to be holding up very well if used under 150 ft . lbs . of torque .
5 #### Sure does work . Be ready to change them out often unless there are somewhere you can not smell the stench .
5 #### I have had several of these in my life time . I am older and it seem to get heavier even though it really as not . returned it .
1 #### if you ever have to call Weber customer service you are in trouble . They employ the nicest sounding , most polite people on the face of the earth but they are clueless . They are worse than the the strictest script reading overseas CSR 's because they are convinced that you are stupid and the key to your intellectual salvation lies on the scripted response sheet they have in front of them . If you have mechanical or engineering experience that indicates what they are telling you might be wrong , well you are just a silly man ! !
4 #### My old RainBird 4 station controller of 30 years was acting crazy so I changed it out to this model . It was an easy install , has many different watering options for each zone and is a user friendly design . I noticed the backup battery was hidden so I called Rainbird support . My old timer had a 9 volt battery that could be changed . The battery in this SST 1200o can not be changed , so when it goes bad the unit will have to be reprogrammed after every power outage ... not good . Support said it 's a rechargeable lithium battery . The outdated manual that comes with it is for an 8 zone model , and is the same on their website . The connectors for the station wire are push in connection type , so rigid wire is needed . The unit measures 9 x 9.5 x 4.5 inches .
3 #### We got this small baking sheet to use in our toaster oven . It works pretty well , but the non - stick coating did n't last more than a year , it does n't wash very well , and it 's a little small for a toaster oven . It could easily be another inch or possibly 2 in each direction and still fit in any toaster oven I 've ever seen . Do n't expect this to be an amazing pan , but it works well enough to get the job done .
5 #### This is the exact flavor bar that came with my original , older version of the Weber Go - Anywhere grill . The original bar is starting to deteriorate and will need replacing in a year or three , thus , I bought this one while it was still available . Do n't want to give - up this fine , old grill yet ; shame on Weber for replacing it with a cheaply made , chintzy version of the original , tried and true model .
5 #### This is longer than the 180 grit wheel that came with my Drill Doctor XP , but fits ok . Fast cutting for the larger drills but leaves a little rougher surface .
4 #### Very nice product . I like the fact that the two graters separate at the handle if you want to use them individually .
4 #### So far so good , the tongs have been strong and have proven to be good with the handle as far as using with the grip area . I would recommend them at this point
5 #### So far this is a powerful and sturdy little friend . I put my own brush attachement on it for other jobs . Works great and it 's not too heavy . Easy to use . I prefer buying a couple of these lighter smaller units and keeping them in different parts of the house rather than those big , expensive , heavy ones . If they last a couple of years , I do n't get all nuts about it and have to run back and forth to service it , I just buy another one . It will take 10 years to end up costing as much as my former $ $ vacuum , which I had to lug to the bedroom from the garage . Now I store them in closets .
5 #### Love OXO . Durable , looks good , works great and cleans up great in the dishwasher .
4 #### I needed a roller shield so I could paint my ceiling without splatter . This worked great but remember to remove the caps from roller ends before you throw out roller .
5 #### What you see is what you get . Channellock quality and they are a good medium - ish size . They can handle about everything in your house other than some bigger pipes and some shower temp selectors . If you need something bigger you will know it otherwise this is perfect .
5 #### This bar of steel is a real tool . It is heavy , but it has to be . I removed 850 sq.ft . of decking with it . It was not easy , but would have been impossible without the wrecker bar . It is a tool in equal stature to visegrips and duct tape .
3 #### Sadly , I found the same insert at Sears for half the price and better made . The leveling screws on this insert are phillips , but the Sears product uses allen screws which are better . Otherwise , both inserts are identical .
3 #### If you are looking for a blower that cleans more than your back steps of a small portion of your driveway , this blower is fine . However if you need a bit more than say two to three solid minutes of blowing time , you best stay with a cord blower because this one wo n't do the job . I have a seven year old model with built in battery that runs much longer than this new 2010 unit .
4 #### Works great easy to assemble and does the job like any expensive flood light .
5 #### Well made . Nice to see that we can still get good tools made in the USA .
5 #### Was a gift for my mother , she always got loose tea and she loved this .
5 #### 9 months outdoors with no cover and on ever night with no problems so far .
5 #### I 'm not sure how I ever lived without this . Should have purchased one a long time ago . Makes scrambling eggs and boiling homemade pudding so much easier . I like the handle on this one as well , I shopped around a bit and kept coming back to the Oxo . Glad I went with this one , it 's really sturdy and comfortable in the hand and I think it will last forever .
5 #### The old glass Perky Pet nectar feeder that still have is from the late 1980 's or early 1990 's . Hope this new " Perky Pet Glass Nectar Feeder " will last as long as that old feeder is lasting ! With the construction being very similar i think it might . Differences being : new style has perches & new style has a threaded top & plastic cap where the old style did not have perches & it has a rubber cap & a grove in the top of bottle for a wire to hold the cap onto the bottle . The bee guards on the new feeder really do keep the bees out . If Looking for a glass nectar feeder that the hummers would like;this one by Perky Pet would be an excellent choice !
5 #### Best fly traps on the marketThis is the only brand that I will order and works !
5 #### Same tape measure I have been using for 15 years . Great quality . Great price .
5 #### I got this for my daughter for christmas . as we had one and the popcorn it makes is great just like at the movies .
5 #### This model puts my old spinner to shame . It works really well and is easy to operate .
5 #### Zero issues . Plugged it in and it went right to work . It works so well have had to clean off the thick coat of dead insects at least 4 to 5 times in the 14 or so days we have been using it .
5 #### My now 10 year old has had one of these eye masks for years now . For Christmas , I am getting her a new one and my son his own . I was going to get the adult size , but her old one still works fine . We have washed it a lot and dried it many times with no adverse reaction . Anyhoo , I love these and will gladly have an extra for her !
4 #### Love this pressure cooker ... I already use it and is just wonderful to be able to cook from scratch healthy food and sooo FAST ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I ordered these bags to use while vacuuming my vehicles . They were easy to insert and the Shop - Vac worked perfectly . Very happy with the product .
5 #### great to have some of my tools , spare thanks for sell separately and I buy two more to have more spare
5 #### water gets from one end to the other . I bought 2 of these . they DO couple together if need be . they do n't leak . it is black . the fittings are brass ( colored ) . did I mention they do n't leak ? about all you can ask from a hose
5 #### Holy crap ! Why did n't I buy one of these years ago . Nice axe !
4 #### I am only giving this 4 stars for one reason . The mesh is so fine it is hard to get dried stuff out of it even though I hand wash and check and dig out a pin to poke stuff out which is tedious to the max . Other than that It 's wonderful for a lot straining . You need the finer mesh for lots of things , but I do n't like it for sifting ; a little thicker mesh is faster . It 's very well made , good quality . My daughter was using it to strain coffee she was making and really liked it , should get her one .
5 #### I have a couple of the regular sized spatulas and three of the small ones . I use the smaller ones so often I have worn a couple out . They may eventually crack but this depends a great deal on how you use them . I am certain I had hit the bread machine paddle a few times while scraping dough from the sides of the pan with the kneading in motion . Scraping food off the blades of a food processor will chip and chew the silicone up . The one thing that takes these out of commission is forgetting the white piece is soaking in a dish in the sink when it is emptied down the drain . I lost one in the garbage disposal as a result . I like to keep at least three around so I always have them . The smaller size is good for making sandwiches , spreading jelly , mixing anything in a smaller bowl , they are resistant to heat so you can stir food , especially sauces and gravies , in non - stick cookware , I scramble eggs using them , etc . I often use 2 - 3 at a time . They are very useful tools and they feel very good in your hand . This is one of the most often used tools in the kitchen .
5 #### Sharp , handy , effective , even for jobs usu . done with bigger saw . Fine teeth side wonderful for small cuts , small pieces . A big awkward to store , but I find myself reaching for it often .
5 #### great peeper , works very smoothly and effectively , has a nice grip to it and peels potatoes and cucumbers in a breeze . love the design and ease of it .
5 #### Well - built . Heavy & thick construction , yet light weight . Top of the line .
3 #### Does the job , but can be a pain in neck to release quickly . It 's a bit heavy , the long lever handle could be aluminum .
5 #### I am really happy with mixing bowl . I can use it for almost everything and thank you for your business .
4 #### I 've had mine attached to a jet cabinet saw for about a year now . I experienced poor packaging too . Though not severe enough to send it back , one of the corners came buggered up . Mine is particle board .... or a very low quality MDF . The sides are skinned with a melamine rather than a laminate . Ok , that 's the bad . This table works , and works well . I wrestled with building my own but in hind site it would be tough to make one as sturdy , light , and with folding capabilities . My shop is in my garage and it 's sometimes shared with the car , so having a folding table is nice . The design is very flexible so it should attach to almost any cabinet saw ( requires some drilling in your cabinet ) . It uses lots of angle iron and fastners but the instructions are enough to get you through it . Once installed it makes sheet cutting a breeze . I ca n't believe I used roller supports for so long . It 's expensive for what it is .... basically painted angle iron , fastners , and a cheezy table board . But it works great . I would buy it again .
5 #### I 've been making popovers in muffin tins my whole life . I just made my first batch in this , and WHAT a difference . Popovers are divine and super easy to make . I use Vincent Price 's recipe which is easily accessible in your favorite search tool . Love this pan ! The popovers turned out great . Golden brown and fluffy . Yum .
5 #### What can I say ? Black matte finished metal , looks good , machined good , fits the pots as advertised . All it requires is screws .....
5 #### I 've been using these for years , and when I found them on Amazon as an add on at a good price , I got two of them Thanks guys .
3 #### I wish they make a heady duty reuse - able filter . I use the shop vac a lot in wet conditions and the paper filter does not last long at all
5 #### My husband and I bought this earlier this year and had it sitting around in the kitchen while I worked up the nerve to use it . I had heard all of the horror stories about pressure cookers and I was wary . Hubby got a little sick of this so he broke it in . What a pleasure . This cooker is easy to use and safe . It also delivers delicious food in a fraction of the time . We both love bean dishes and have used this pot for that since it cooks dried bean in minutes instead of hours with the flavor cooked all the way through . We have just purchased the 2.5 braiser and more than likely will purchase more Kuhn Rukon pots . They are solid , well made and we were able to find loads of helpful information and tips on their web site . A great product . Could not be happier .
5 #### Nice little vegetable scrubber . Fits in the palm of your hand . Bristles are sturdy and do the job . Very happy with my purchase .
5 #### This is exactly as described and not a cheap overseas knock - off - my dad loves the large numbers and ability to extend way out .
5 #### Perfect size for tiling jobs and very easy to clean . This will get a lot of use over the years .
2 #### Beware the size stated is wrong , the round base part is 2.25 inches and the mixer blades over 3 inches . The welds look bad and I doubt they will last long .
4 #### I have torn tendons in my left elbow that can not be repaired . This tool makes it easy for me to cut unwanted branches in our garden without pain . I did n't think I was going to be able t do that any more .
5 #### Great for the price . Will cut potatoes in a jiffy , but sweet potatoes are too hard for it .
5 #### love it I use it for my lemon zest when I make lemonaid , it adds flavor
5 #### A bit expensive but then again it is a RUBBERMAID .
4 #### best attachment you could get for a Dremel . The hand piece is much easier to use for any work . You get better control . Hang the tool from a stand and use this for any grinding work . The ability to do fine detail is much improved with a flex shaft .
5 #### What can I say but " If you buy a brand name like Dremel your purchasing quality " . This attachment did not disappoint . The extension gets you into confined spaces with ease . I use it to wire wheel tight places around my marine engines . Much easier to handle than holding the motor unit itself . Fits together fast and easy and stays attached no matter how much it is twisted . I tried an off brand and it did n't hold up to the task . Should have bought this the first time . Live and learn .
5 #### Great DeWalt product , makes it easy to swap bits out .
5 #### Wow ! ! What a Vege brush ! This little brush has a comfortable feel . The bristles conform to the shape of the potato , carrots , mushrooms or whatever vege you are cleaning no matter the shape or size . It really goes to work without damaging the skin . It cleans well and is also very easy to clean . I 'm impressed with this nifty little brush . Worth more than the money spent for it !
5 #### Nice sturdy filter with a heavy rubber base , fits my Rigid Vac perfectly
5 #### Love my salad spinner . What did I ever do without one ! ?
5 #### It works . It kills insects . It does n't kill all the mosquitoes . They are small enough that they can fly through it . However , I placed this away from my patio . Therefore , the insects are attracted to it instead of me and my guests . My girl friend was willing to sit outside since she was n't being eaten alive:- )
5 #### I always love those , they are fun to have at your window and easy cleaning , sometimes when it rain the humming bird stay there out of the rain :)
5 #### I am very satisfied with the cover . Winter may be a little tougher on it as it is a little thin . Store under a roof or in a garage in the winter .
4 #### Worked pretty well . The FOOT of this tool needs to be larger for stability . I had to screw a board onto it to keep it stable . It does NOT take an engineer to realize that this thing is unstable with such a small foundation . It got the job done .
4 #### Extra sets of measuring spoons and cups are always welcome as the markings on old ones eventually fade , chip or the spoons / cups are misplaced altogether . These OXO ones have raised markings printed in red on the handle and seem to be wear resistant . They survived the top rack dishwasher and even once being accidentally put in the cutlery basket . Only time will tell if they are truly durable due to the placement of the markings ( where your thumb would usually be on the handle ) . In this reissued " new " version of these cups , the markings do n't rub off immediately , however it is still recommended to buy these from a place with a good return policy in case you accidentally get one of the older defective ones . The measurements seem accurate enough and were compared by weight equivalent on 2 scales , a digital Salter glass model , and an old brass balance - weight model .
4 #### We certainly like this Oriole feeder and it 's larger capacity plastic bottle . The reason l only gave it four stars is it does leak some when the winds blowing it .
5 #### I bought this to use with my R4512 table saw , i used the POWERTEC 70128 4 - Inch Flexible Dust Collection Hose to connect to the table saw dust port on the bottom , then used this reducer to attach at the end to then connect my rigid vacuum . Everything fits snug , so snug that i do n't need to put any clamps on it to hold it on , friction fit ! Reducer is solid and just as pictured on the listing , what more could i ask for .
5 #### Love it . Two years later and it still works like a dream .
5 #### This is really a handy little vacuum . I 'm considering getting a second one for my travel trailer .
5 #### I like it ! A good , cheap , inexpensive feeder . We bought two so we could watch the hummingbirds flying between them .
5 #### These are ok and it is great to have Amazon to get these .
5 #### I installed one of these to control the ON / OFF cycle for a bird bath . Most timers are Dusk to Dawn which was opposite of what I needed . It was also important that the timer would be water resistant for outdoor use . This timer offers ( 20 ) ON / OFF cycles that can be programmed for your choice of any of the 7 day period . I would recommend this to anyone who needs a versable timer which can be used for many applications .
5 #### This set of blades is by Dewalt so not much else needs to be said except that you 're not really paying for the name in this instance . I got this to make cuts on both exhaust pipe and the muffler inlet / outlet pipes and the blades worked great and made fast easy cuts . I foresee many more cuts with them as well . I highly recommend this product .
5 #### Excellent supplier . Just as promised and timely . Thank you , kindly .
1 #### its barely 3 months now and its broke . It does n't shut completely in one direction . Better go for nozzles made by Gilmour . They might last a lifetime . Not this one ...
5 #### Replaced a battery that went bad after years of use . Works as supposed to .
5 #### After an unsuccessful attempt to find a decent vintage low angle block plane , I finally decided to try this one . I 'm glad I did . The fit / finish is flawless and the performance is great .
5 #### Elegant . Numerals are large enough to see from a distance . Shows up real well on our deck . It has been up for several months and so far so good .
4 #### 4 stars because I had to assemble one end of the hose before I could use it
5 #### Glad I found this . The 8 lb container has a shaker top , so you do n't have to touch the product . Per other reviewers , it goes on as a blue color and slowly melts and keeps the walk ways clear . We also purchased the 35 lb pail . Our house consists of 2 dogs and 2 indoor cats so the fact that this is pet safe was a plus . We also feed birds ( and squirrels - can not be avoided ) so I am glad this is safe for them too . The price is a bit steep , but it 's worth it .
5 #### A good spoke shave . Useable as I received it , but I 've spent a little time to fine tune it . English made iron .
3 #### Did not work with the dehumidifier we bought . Amazon should not recommend this for the Keystone KSTAD50B Energy Star Dehumidifier , 50 - Pint . Had to use Duct tape to make it attach and work . Its just a short Garden hose .
5 #### Really like how these link together thightly as they keep my cords from coming unplugged . Great quality replacement receptacle for everyday , heavy duty use . Also I like the lower price on here rather than local hardware store
4 #### Stuff often falls out of the sides , especially when the food shrinks a little . I used some cedar and wire to make little walls to prevent this .
4 #### Used this in a renovation to add a fixture in a bathroom . The fixture had to have a corded light switch , so this was the best option we found on Amazon or elsewhere . It looks appropriate in a bathroom and we have n't had any issues with it .
5 #### I have had many over the years but I keep buying stanleys products because I know I can rely on stanley
5 #### I have n't found an OXO kitchen tool that I have yet to like or think is better than any other brand I 've used . I give this 5 stars for a reason .
5 #### Fein makes a great machine and blades . But if I have a large project I buy the much cheaper blades and find that more cost effective . But when buying one to have in the tool box I buy Fein .
4 #### It 's sharp and works well . The rubber is nice . I just wish there was a bigger hand guard in front of the blade . Especially on the bottom .
5 #### Arrived quickly and comes with mounting bracket , mounted it under my sink inside the cabinet . And it comes fully charged ready to go .
5 #### unbeatable price on 2 tapes . beats the cost of one at local stores . best tape on the market
5 #### 5 stars . Why ? Well , because it 's easy to use , it 's easy to clean , it 's stainless steel , it 's easy to assemble , it 's easy to maintain , and you can find the replacement parts . The " back to basics " is simply a way to remind people that Americans made good use of pressure cookers in the past as a way to make healthy meals fast . If you want to save some energy , this pot works very well on induction cooktops ! When the power goes out and you have access to another suitable source of heat for cooking and clean water , you can prepare a safe meal ( possibly using even less energy ... ) for you and your loved ones every day until the power is restored . I would recommend this item to anyone constantly wishing for a way to spend less time cooking full meals when time is always tight . I would also recommend this item to those folks that wish to be self - sufficient when the time calls for it .
5 #### Priced well . Good quality zinc plating . I think this wire should hold up well .
5 #### This is the best salad spinner I 've used . It really does get rid of excess water and it 's easy to clean . Wish I 'd found it sooner !
5 #### Here how my story goes ... We have renters next door to us with an absentee owner and they have 2 pets ... one being a cat : -( ... Our backyard was just landscaped which cost us a lot of money . Everyday I would go out in the back and see the dirt in disarray ... I would smell this horrible odor and I could not figure out for the life of me what it was . Then I saw it . Their cat making a mess out of my yard . I went and bought all kinds of items to keep this cat away ... nothing worked .... I was at my wits end ... Then I came across " the scarecrow " . I was desperate at this point because every other product failed . Well , let me tell you , I have not seen that little brat in my yard since I put this out there . It is absolutely amazing . I just have to be careful not to walk in front of it as I got soaked on a few occasions already . Thank you Contech for helping me regain my sanity :-)
4 #### Does exactly what it should , sturdy , easy to use . Very sturdily build and feels like it will last forever . Update : While it has n't been forever , but it has been 8 or 9 months and it works like it did on day one .
5 #### My husband really likes is Weber grill . It is a good size for 2 or 4 people and is easy to use .
4 #### I purchased this product mostly to make Piergi for my Polish husband , but they have come in handy for everything from Calzones , Pocket Pies , Ravioli , Wonton , Pot Stickers , etc ! They are well made , but the hinges do seem to be a bit delicate . So , take care in how you open and close them ! Otherwise , you may end up breaking them . However , for the price , you really ca n't beat this set !
5 #### Nice filter and good price on Amazon . The filter itself looks very thick and seems to be working very nice
5 #### After reading all the reviews about difficult assembly , wobbly , etc . I was pleasantly surprised ! I banged the pieces together on a wooden bread board ( NO tools required)snapped the two clips on the light fixture and had it working inside 30 minutes without a hitch . It came partly assembled which took a lot of the guess work out of the somewhat opaque instructions . But the frame is basically 7 pieces that jam together , a little like tent poles . The light fixture adjusts up and down , no problem . And I 'm thinking of buying a double or triple bulb fixture to hang from it to see it I can grow tomatoes next winter . I was promised two day shipping but it arrived the morning after I ordered it , the NEXT day ! Thank - you Amazon . March 28 , 2012 After a couple weeks my tomatoes needed more than one bulb . Unable to find an affordable 4 bulb fixture I settled for a 6 bulb T8 with reflector from Home Depot for about $ 90 . The big difference other than more light is the bulbs run much cooler than the T5 , which burnt the leaves that sometimes touched the bulbs . It 's a little bit heavy for the Hydrofarm frame and hangar . I had to add the electrical cord and switch myself ( about $ 20 ) . But the bulbs are affordable and my tomatoes are about to outgrow it . I 'm looking for two - foot extenders , but may just harden them off and put them in the ground .
4 #### Works good for now , longer one is a bit sticky
5 #### Great glove for the price!!!These gloves are very comfortable and hold up well . I go through glove like crazy as a carpenter and get tired of forking out 30 bills a piece so I tried these and I 'm happy
5 #### Does the job . It is universal and bright . like the two level lights . It is compact , bright , and very useful . Ca n't beat the price either .
5 #### Finally , a non - metallic whisk that does its job . Mixes things beautifully , whips quickly , cleans easily . I would recommend it to any good cook . Oxo wins again .
5 #### The vegetable/ French Fry Cutter . is great . I get fast , easy to use French Fry Cutter . It is sturdy , easy to clean up . I can make up French Fries quickly as well very clean looking frys . I bought this when I bought my Deep Fryer . And as always Amazon . Com came through for me . Great Price , quick delivery . And was well packaged for shipping .
5 #### I was surprised at how heavy duty this chair is . It 's a nice size for two people and very comfortable . Also a very great looking swing . Very pleased .
4 #### It is adgjustable and all , but I could never really find a setting that gave me the soaking at the speed I wanted . It made some noise and it was n't the gentle bubbling sort of thing as I expected . I do n't think they 're really anything special , but plastic is forever , so unless I forget to bring them in and they freeze , I should gets years of service from then .
5 #### Sharpest and easiest to use shear I 've tried in six decades of gardening .
4 #### WORK LIKE THEY ARE SUPPOSED BUT I DONT RECOMMEND RINSING THEM OUT TO MUCH SEEMS LIKE THEY ARE MORE FLIMSY THAN THE A CARTRIDGES THAT WONT FIT ON THE 2500 GAL PUMP
5 #### Best camping axe ever . No bells , no whistles , just an axe ( and hammer ) . My best friend has had one for years and I finally bought one too . Straps to both my small hiking bag and large camping backpack .
4 #### This is a beautiful kettle , well made , and has a lovely two - tone whistle . I drink tea on a daily basis and after 3 years of use it looks good as new . After a few months our whistle stopped functioning but customer service was great and sent out a new whistle w no fuss and in a timely manner . The only design issue I have is that it 's annoying to locate and put on the padded handle so I do n't get burnt . To manage , I just use our regular oven mitts . Overall , I love this kettle .
5 #### I wanted a traditional whittling / pocket knife . I carry a spyderco , but it is too mig for little carving projects and while it is a good stainless steel , it is nothing compared to this steel . I 'll be honest , the edge sucks from the factory , but if you are any kind of knife owner you maintain your own edge . These guys get sharp , almost hair popping sharp , and keep it very well . The fit of the scales is n't perfect but the knife is well made .
5 #### I 've been an inspector on federally funded road and bridge projects for almost 15 years and can attest to this tool 's durability and accuracy . Do n't cheap out and get the Sears version . This tool uses a different technology and it 's accuracy is amazing . Also , the Sears version can not be calibrated . I often check my MD Smart Levels against the contractors and always find that they are dead on . These things take a beating and if the level itself gets damaged you can easily replace the aluminum box level with a identical replacement making the tool virtually new again . The only comparable product is the Stabila , which costs twice as much . Do n't listen to the reviewer who suggests that the $ 69 model is the same . The Sears model is n't accurate enough for ADA compliance verification .
5 #### Arrived as described . Well packed and promptly shipped . Thank you !
5 #### I have had a lot of spatulas and OXO continues to balance ergonomics with usability . This is perfect for standard cupcakes and even using for small areas on large cakes . It is lightweight yet extremely sturdy . I will buy at least three more . Nothing to complain or gripe about here . Love it .
5 #### Works for me - made my Henckels chef knife obviously sharper after five passes ( using YouTube instructions )
4 #### This review is from : Shany Cosmetics Feather Hair Extension Kit , 8 Ounce ( 100 Piece Feather Hair , Hook , Beads , Feather Grizzly Solid Mix All - In - One ) ( Misc . ) The salad spinner works great , is attractive and has great action . The lettuce is dry after spinning it . What more could you want ? I have had about three or four previous salad spinners that cost 1/3 as much and they worked well also and were much lighter and easier to store . It 's for this reason I give it only four stars because I think the cheaper ones do just as good a job and are easier to handle . Nevertheless , it is a fine spinner .
3 #### I like to have converters in my tool box and this is one I did not have . Not often do I need to use 1/4 to 3/8 but if so , I now have it available .
5 #### Old faithful ! I lost my other Stanley so this is a replacement .
4 #### About what you 'd expect - a basic vacuum with a powerful motor . A bit awkward to use in small places due to the long hose , and wrapping the cord around the underside is inconvenient , but overall it works well . I 'd recommend ordering the Hepa filter attachment .
5 #### but it is a good one . Actually it 's the clamshell stand that is great . I have one in all three of my bathrooms and feel it is discreet looking enough to be left standing in the corner without being tacky . Worth the money in my opinion .
5 #### This was only slightly more expensive than colanders I could find locally but the quality is much higher . I know this will hold up for a long time and I 've really enjoyed having it in my kitchen .
5 #### Bought this as a gift as they love it . Very good quality
4 #### Nice dispenser for each blade . I would prefer individually carded blades since you do n't have this bare blade being pushed out from the dispenser each time . Blades do appear to stay sharp as any good , reputable brand .
5 #### This is the best sifter I have ever owned . I purchased it 4 years ago and it still works great . You shake it back and forth , not up and down . Great purchase .
5 #### I read lots of reviews and chose this Flowtron model because of the price and it claimed to do what I wanted it to do : shred leaves to build up my garden soil . I had to ask my husband for help with the assembly , since I am not savvy in putting machines together , however , he had no problem . It does a great job . I took the advice of others online and placed it on a large tarp so that any shredded material is easy to move to the garden beds .
5 #### This hose is durable and great quality if you try and buy this at a hardware store you will easily pay double . This hose is very well made I have been using mine for about 2 years now and I have not had nay problems with it . I would buy again with out hesitation .
5 #### I 've been using these for over 25 yrs and will always buy this brand . :-) We use them more for scraping things - burred edge is awesome .
5 #### These are exactly what one needs to clean out the Hummingbird Feeders . ( Also handy for any other tiny things that need a proper brush to clean them with ) .
5 #### Needed them for my vacuum . They work great ! Sometimes they 're hard to find in the stores locally .
5 #### The best magnet torpedo money can buy . Very strong magnets for use in any rugged weather
5 #### Even if you just need to dry your socks this works fantasitcally ! It washes , dries and stores well . Get it !
5 #### Quick couplers greatly enhance the utility of a compressor . Milton seems to be the premier manufacturer . I have two of these and one older one . All work perfectly , paired with Milton male plugs . Note : Teflon wrapping of the threaded fitting is absolutely necessary .
5 #### Like all OXO products , the good grips swivel peeler does not disappoint . It may not be the cheapest option , but the extra attention to design that this company puts into its products makes it well worth the extra couple of dollars . I 'm not a design expert or engineer , so can not comment to exactly WHY the product works so well , but that is part of the genius is that all I know is that it DOES work well . For use on everything from carrots to ginger to potatoes and more , this is equally functional for removing an unwanted peel to utilizing the peels created for dishes and garnish . It is also surprisingly easy to clean , and remains sharp after months of use without cutting up my sponges . Also fairs well in the dishwasher . Overall , highly recommended .
5 #### Perfect for our hardwood floors . Very light weight and quite powerful .
5 #### This is the third one of these we have bought and enjoyed using . It is so great . It stands in for its " Big Brother " admirably when a smaller job is all that needs to be done . It is easy to clean and to run the parts through the dishwasher . Never chop an onion again !
4 #### The only improvement would a glass top to see if you had a guest in your mouse motel .
5 #### I had some older countersinks that had to be chucked up every time and the set screws left something to be desired . I just load these in one impact driver and shoot the deck screws in with another and ca n't believe how quickly the projects go . The bits seem to be holding up very well . I just bought a set for a friend who is a journeyman carpenter and he really liked them .
4 #### This product was so easy to get up and running . It is only an inflatable ring on top so the kids ca n't lean on it or water will leak out . It is big enough for whole family and a lot of fun . The only other flaw is the filter is not very strong so you need to be diligent about cleaning pool at least once a day and chlorinate at night . Not strong enough to hook pool vacuum to so getting bottom clean is hard .
5 #### Size matters . This is the largest feeder I have yet to find . I mix up one cup of sugar in 30 oz of boiled water in a mayonnaise jar ( 6 at a time , actually ) and fill my six feeders every day . They only need to be cleaned thoroughly about every 10 fillings . For that I use a bottle brush I got from a laboratory supply company . Same for base . If you let the feeders go empty for more than a few hours they will get yucky , sticky , and need more frequent cleanings . And , if you do n't head off the ants at the pass you will have even a bigger mess . These problems plague all feeders I have ever owned . The 30 oz Perky Pet is the only one I use now . I am told that I have about 120 - 150 birds feeding on my six feeders . I would say that those people who do n't have enough time to properly care for their feeders should n't tempt the birds . Who are they doing this for , anyway ... the birds or themselves ? Hope they do n't have babies and then leave their diapers unchanged for two or three days . shame shame , no no
5 #### I purchased this feeder for a Valentine 's Day gift ... and have been enjoying our hummers all summer . ( We had at least 4 ) The only thing that is needed is a small brush to clean the bottle from mold that builds up on the inside glass . I have been using a toothbrush with fairly good results . As the birds fly south for the winter , I will give it a good bleach bath and pack it away for winter . I would definately recommend this product . I also ordered the ant moat ... that was excellent keeping the ants away too .
2 #### Yes , it is a can opener . Yes , it opens cans .... But the item description says that it is dishwasher safe . The first thing I noticed when I recieved it was that it says " Hand wash only " . I might return it , but I need a can opener .
4 #### This a great Insect Killer I am still evaluating it . I only have it up a short time . I will give it another judgement .
5 #### The Black & Decker LE750 Edge Hog 2 - 1/4 HP Electric Landscape Edger is so easy to use and does a great job of edging my lawn . I purchased this edger because I became so tired of trying to edge my lawn with a string trimmer . The string trimmer did a choppy job , but the B&D edger makes a nice and neat edge on my lawn . Before this purchase I dreaded the job . The fact that this edger can also make trenches is a big plus . I am a female senior citizen and care for my lawn myself . Anything that makes that job easier ( like this edger ) deserves five stars . I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs an edger that is easy to use and does a good job .
5 #### I purchased these outlets for use in a large house remodel that I 'm currently working on . They are a great value and are as simple / easy to install as any similar product . I will definitely buy these again if I need additional outlets !
5 #### What can I say -- it 's a potato peeler . This is a simple product that does exactly what it 's supposed to , and is much easier to use than my older metal version . Very happy with this purchase .
5 #### This whisk works great and is a try space saver . I love that I can get the same results from a round whisk but I am able to more easily store this flat version . It is very easy to get the whisk clean .
4 #### Good so far though not really noticing a difference in crispiness between using this or a regular toaster pan .
5 #### I use this for my whole house fan . Simple to use - just turn the knob/
1 #### These pumps last about a year . The manufacturer no longer covers any warranty on their pumps . Warranty issues must be handled through the seller of the pump and they are free to shorten the warranty period to as little as 90 - days . Even while under warranty , considering the costs of shipping each way , and potential " handling charges " , one is better off buying a new pump and preferrably from a company that still provides their own warranty .
4 #### These loppers work real well and perform as described . I was a little disappointed that they do n't appear as tough as some others I have seen . The cutters and gears are stamped out of one piece and the handles do n't appear to be attached that well . All that said they have n't broken yet and they are easy to use . The gear design makes it so you have to have pretty long arms to get the blades to open the full width . If you can get them on the branch though it 's coming down no question about it .
5 #### Low cost and very reliable irrigation valve . I 've used these for years .
1 #### Did nothing to repel mice . The old fashion snap trap worked way better . Wood trap was located right next to shake away .
5 #### it 's regular stock for me , I'll continue to use'em so long as their service continues as reliable as they have been .
5 #### This hose appears to be very good quality , and quite wide , which keeps it in its place . I really like that you can use it as a soaker hose or sprinkler hose , just depending on whether you place it with the holes up or down . I grossly underestimated how much hose I 'd need , but that 's my own fault . I ended up ordering a couple more , one for the area I 'd underestimated and another for a separate area . Note that you CANNOT connect two of these hoses to each other . Unlike some other soaker hoses I 've bought , these do not have a removable cap at one end . If you 're going to need more than 50 feet of hose , you might want to look at other , longer hoses . This is a very good hose , especially when you consider its rather low price ; when I bought it , its price was about $ 13 for the 50 - foot hose . So far , I 'm very pleased !
5 #### I bought this to get free shipping on my Fitbit 2 Band order , but I really like this . It 's much easier to control than a handled brush .
5 #### I love this product . I recently took off the base of my ridgid ts3650 table saw bc the metal base was so flimsy . Made my own base out of ply and installed this mobile base on the bottom and bolted down the saw . Man can this mobile base move the heavy saw around with ease . I thought about purchasing the more expensive product but glad I went with this product bc I saved a lot of money and it works so incredibly well . Money well spent .
3 #### Kind of cheesy for a vac bag . Wo n't last long .
5 #### quick shipment and well packed . used two of the blades and they held up good . easy to change in my sawzall . ty
5 #### This is the best fly trap ever . It does the job and is so easy to throw away . Just toss it in the trash no touch no mess .
5 #### This stuff is a must for killing flies . After making a fly trap with GM and something stinky hundreds and hundreds of flies will die . Keep it out of reach of animals and children .
5 #### Heater does everything you expect of it . I heated my shop with 2 of these last winter . I installed a mini split heat pump , so , I do n't expect to use it next winter .
2 #### The one wheel wants to collapse . I have lowered my RIKON bandsaw to sit flush on the concrete floor . I have cushioned rubber floor mats in my shop to eliminate my fatigue . The wheels on this device are NOT large enough to role on this . Furthermore the bandsaw was NOT stable on the wheel / cushion setup . I had to eliminate the cushion under the Bandsaw and lower it down to sit on the concrete floor . If I ever have to move it I will have to take up the cushions first . I 'm not at all sure the one wheel will NOT collape . This Base was supposed to support a heavier object than this , but I think it was a real mistake for me . I should have spent more $ bought a heavier duty base . Of course I did n't have the saw & had to take their word for it at the time . This Base is absolutely no match for my RIKON 14 " Bandsaw . My Bosch contractor Table saw , Homemade Router table cabinet , & Dewalt Base stand for my Makita planer , all seem to be fine on the wheels under them . Note that the floor mats work really well for ME !
5 #### Had to purchase these due to new fire codes in our office . Installed them quickly and with ease .
5 #### Love this but do be careful not to put loose liquid . The batter should be stiff such as bread but can be a bit looser . Do n't butter the bread , it will run out bottom while cooking . oops Learned the hard way .
3 #### I love these Bessey clamps and would have rated them 5 - stars ... They are a joy to work with . That is , until I bought a set of the new Jet clamps . I have two main gripes with the Bessey clamps that are much improved in the Jet : 1 ) the handles can be slippery ( they 're round ) , and I 've put blisters on my hands cranking them down 2 ) the cam mechanism can be hard to disengage , especially if a little bit of glue has dripped on the slide
4 #### I do n't make a living with a hammer - just a truck driver that needs to bump tires , break seals , and hit a stuck trailer lock or glad hand . This is a good hammer for all that , but any hammer would have served my purpose . I chose this hammer because it is made by Apex tool company , a company I thought made their tools in the US . In the product description it said this hammer 's country of origin was the US . NOT SO ! Had made in China labels on it . Good hammer - bad information . It 's one thing for a tool maker to go overseas to take advantage of slave labor , but it 's another thing to trick me into supporting it .
3 #### I have it plugged in but not getting fleas like I thought . Maybe I do n't have any but with 3 dogs I sure would think so .
4 #### I think I have done this before . It is good knife and does the job and is priced right and service was good . I think I got sooner than what was told .
1 #### I had two Stanley powerlock tape measures for 15 + years . They were great and durable . When they finally gave it up in the last couple of years I replaced both my 16 ' and 25 ' with " similar " versions . One failed in < 1 year ( 4 months ) and the other lasted a bit over 1 1/2 years . I do n't use them often - say 10 - 15 times a year . One broke by the spring unwinding internally . The second broke by the metal tape breaking . Of course the warranty did not cover them , so I just throw them out . I mean come on Stanley ! These are pieces of $ @@%$% . You just lost a lifetime customer . I will not even consider other products by Stanley , when they show up . I would say save your money and find another brand . The quality of these tapes is much too poor .
5 #### Better then my 20 year old favorites . Precise and easy on the hands .
4 #### bought 'cuz needed 'em . have used 'em and like 'em . i 'd buy more . not much else you need to know .
1 #### This seemed to be a very handy items for leaves and misc lawn debris . However , after only two uses the bottom started to tear out ( see photos ) . Fortunately Amazon will take it back . I think this item would work OK if kept entirely on a lawn or other soft surface . If you intend to use it on your patio or walkways I would think twice , because of the very thin fragile bottom .
4 #### I give this vacuum 4 out of 5 mainly because of the noise . I have to use earplugs . Another thing I am missing is cable rewind . It is good value for money however : the vacuum is light and maneuverable , the sucking power is high . The best thing about this vacuum is the power paw . It really works well on hairy furniture . I have 2 cats . Every time I use " power paw " on my sofa ( it has cotton cover ) it looks pretty clean .
5 #### What can I say , it 's a machete . Seen well built and handles well . Use it on brush behind house .
3 #### Its a cheap fan , you get what you pay for . I needed this to replace the guts in an existing installed one .
5 #### This item works perfectly . I will reorder the same when needed .
5 #### I 'm sure it will work for any grating job but I got it so I could grate potatoes directly into a bowl of water when I make hash browns . It is very well made and the cutting edges are really sharp making grating super easy .
3 #### I bought this can opener a little more than a year ago . And it was great , so smooth in opening cans . But then all of a sudden with no warning , it wo n't turn any more . I 'm reduced to just pressing down and then going around and around the can . It 's so no worth the extra money .
5 #### The past reviewer more than likely has the fine polishing , drill bits and other specialty bits dremel offers or may be useing non dremel bits . I 've found unless you have the wrench or a strong grip the adjustable collet ( chuck ) loosens under vibrations and is sometimes to large to work in tight or close spaces ...
4 #### This double boiler is just what I need to melt chocolate and other gentle cooking . My concern over whether it would work on my induction cooktop turned out to be unnecessary since it works great .
5 #### I had one of these that hmm somehow walked off lol . I could n't find any local so I ordered from Amazon . Excellent just what I wanted , I have a 24 oz framing hammer but I was wanting something lighter .
5 #### Nice high quality bypass snips , comes in useful for harvest time . Gives clean cuts and no real need to sharpen as long as you do n't abuse the blade .
5 #### Nice quality replacement chain and fit perfectly . Seems to hold its sharpness better than the chain that came with the saw . I find it less trouble to just replace the chain rather than try to sharpen them .
4 #### Google EH40 install and you will find very helpful pages which show you how to install this unit . I resorted to the Internet for instructions and it worked perfect .
5 #### Work like a charm , nothing sticks and built solid . Not too much else to put down on here except buy it if you are looking for a popover pan .
3 #### I 've purchased two pair of these shears and both of them tend to crumple apart after about two months . I was attracted to the long blades and the fact you can turn the blades to use two different ways .
5 #### Works very well . A premium grade spatula . I expected something a little larger , but this serves it 's purpose well . I have purchased other OXO products and they are all of excellent quality .
5 #### CobraCo 10 - Inch White Adjustable Flower Pot makes my deck look great
5 #### The chain was the perfect size and replaced my dull chain in seconds . It cuts much faster than the original one did and did n't cost much more than having the old one sharpened .
3 #### Sings a little when your hitting nails my old one does nt do that ..
5 #### We cook in this pressure cooker almost every week ! The recipe book that comes with it is a big help ! Makes great pulled pork . whole chicken roasters , and all kinds of soups .
5 #### Awesome sifter ! My previous one had the sifter mechanism on the handle causing pain and cramping during sifting flour ... this one you just shake from side to side and it dispels a lot more flour ! I have already made some difficult recipes requiring finely sifted flour and this has worked perfectly !
5 #### I like this large version even better than the small one I had used previously . It is better as a saw guide and for doing layout work . There are a series of notches that allow you to firmly seat a pencil as you drag the square along a board , using it as a marking guage . This is great for laying out rip cuts - pencil does n't blow away like a chalk line when your saw blade is spinning . There are scales on both sides of the square for rafter angles . This tool works great on larger 2x lumber , without being as bulky as a 16 " x 24 " framing square . Buy it , you 'll like it !
3 #### I would not buy these again after trying them with chalk paint . They are a stinky brush once they have been washed . I ca n't get past the smell . I will stick with my synthetic brushes from now on .
5 #### I have a Bosch portable 10 " saw , probably 3 - 4 hp . I have been doing woodworking , as a hobby , for over 50 years . This is the best rip blade I have ever used . I can easily clean up the cut surfaces with a few swipes of a well - sharpened hand plane . The blade literally " sings ' its way through hardwoods , making it one of the safest ones out there . And it is reasonably priced . I will maintain its sharpness with handheld diamond hone sticks . I expect it to last me many years . All - in - all , that makes it a great value .
5 #### Finally , a sprayer that is built to last . As stated from other reviewers , this unit is not light but if you are used to a lot of physical work then it wo n't be a problem . Water weighs roughly 6 lbs per gallon so if you put in 3 gal of whatever you want to spray then you are roughly going to be carrying around 30 lbs at first . I like everything about it , the pumping action is very productive ..... what I mean is that when you pump it up you can tell all the air is going into the tank and not bleeding out around poorly made seals . There is no pressure valve so you can pump it up as much as you want . It did n't come with a carry strap but since I have never used a carry strap it was n't an issue but I figured it was worth noting in case this is important to you . I wanted an adjustable nozzle so I also bought https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H5SOM4/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_36 as an add - on .
5 #### These work great on bugs , mice and shrews , the things I have caught with them .... if you accidentally step on one though , you are in trouble .. it is not coming off ... You are supposed to fold them up but I leave them flat to catch more stuff ... with animals and small children I suppose that would be a problem
5 #### I bought this square to replace an old steel one which kept getting rusted in spots . The markings are easy to read and I do n't have to be keeping the rust buffed off . I would remind others that aluminum is relatively soft ; it can be more easily cut or gouged by a steel tool .
5 #### I bought this to paint my Mom 's house and just to have around , its lightweight and easy to setup with just myself , being aluminum I can leave it outside with little protection , I 've used the fiberglass ladders already and they are so heavy to handle and setup , the 28foot ladder is a nice size . The ladder was delivered before the delivery date by a courteous trucking company who called ahead of time for delivery arrangements , it arrived in good condition , I would recommend this vendor to anyone .
5 #### I brought this collector sight unseen based on the reviews and am pleased with the purchase . Setup is a snap , performance is flawless , and the workmanship first rate . Even the manual is what I expect from a power tool ... detailed and well versed in the available accessories . Buy a hose kit or two since none is supplied . You 'll be pleased with the purchase .
3 #### Bevel scale was damaged some how in transit . Rest of the saw had no visible damage and seems to be functioning with out any audible noise . Ca n't do a full check out as I ca n't mount the table . Box showed no exterior damage . Contacted DeWalt customer service to make warranty claim for just the damaged items . They were quick to agree to send the damaged parts . Will update review after I have a fully operational tool .
4 #### I got this after getting rid of my high performance black and decker electric model . I loved it , but with a bigger yard now , I needed gas . I considered independent gas blowers , but to get something decent I 'd have to spend $ 100 or more I decided . I also wanted a vacuum for leaves which was hard to find with an independent blower . Following that , if I 'm not going to find a decent gas blower with a vacuum that 's affordable , I might as well consider something like this . I like the idea of only having to take care of one motor . Now on to the actual review . This thing works surprisingly well . I had n't expected it to be a $ 500 Echo , so I was pleasantly surprised at it 's performance . The only reason I did n't give it five stars is for the sensitive tips that other reviewers had mentioned . If it had came with a metal bumper of sorts , it would be an easy five stars . BUY THIS ATTACHMENT !
5 #### Very neat , easy install , hangs on the wall out of the way . Quiet and easy to operate .
5 #### Excellent whisk for deep bowls and mixing heavy and light products . I use this whisk to mix mayonnaise based sauces which are heavy and thick . This whisk accomplishes the task without wearing out my arms and wrists . These are professional grade and worth the investment in your cooking . For those who bake or cook occasionally I would highly recommend this whisk because it might be the only one you 'll ever need to buy . A great go to whisk without dragging out a mixer , it really gets the job done .
5 #### Study , and big enough to fit my high - back chair . Love it .
5 #### Great dado set - very high quality , flat - bottom dados . It does not fit the Jet Xacta Saw Deluxe tablesaw , however . While the tablesaw 's dust shroud does have a semi - circular cutout , it is not big enough to accommodate the dado set 's dial . If possible , you should check for fit on any saw with such a shroud before buying .
5 #### This is a great little vacuum . I have one at home and also sent one to my daughter .
5 #### I have always used with Presto pressure cookers and as always a great product .
5 #### I wo n't buy microwaveable popcorn anymore , I feel much better about making it this way ! Bought as a surprise extra Christmas gift for my husband , now we can enjoy movie theater style popcorn from home ! It 's quick and easy , with easy cleanup .
5 #### Used this incorporated into the soil mixture I filled into big hole around half recommended rate when planting tomatoes and then the balance side dressing weeks later . Is of high quality with lots in there to help the frog keep your plants happy . :)
5 #### If you have a small lawn , it is fantastic . I thought it would be great for my 7,000sqft lawn , just for the workout , but after two months of mowing on the next to lowest setting on my new lawn of bermuda grass , it has made the grass so healthy and thick , i can barely push through it . Soni moved it to its highest setting to thin it out , because grass grows up or out wider , now its just wrapping rhizomes arond the wheels and dragging over patches of uncut grass . I love this mower but , geez .
5 #### Product is easier to use than the donuts and probably much easier to spread .
5 #### Used this on St. Patrick 's Day for my Corn beef because they do n't come with seasoning packs anymore . Put my own spices in this neat little ball hooked perfectly to side of large pot and presto my corn beef was infused with flavor . I recommend .
5 #### Makes the soil so much richer and better for my vegetable garden . Highly recommend , especially if you are doing an organic garden .
4 #### I bought this to shorten the plastic tubes that come with some storage shelves so it would fit in a low overhead area . It worked good for that and I 'm sure I 'll be using for those other one off projects in the future .
5 #### Love popcorn you can make a little for one person or enough for four people generally pops all the kernals . But you have to watch it does not shut off itself .
1 #### Well , I admit , I really should have read the reviews on this one before purchasing . It did not fit my pool . I have a 12 ' frame pool , but when I called Intex the lady there assured me that it would indeed fit . Wrongo ! Oh well . The company was awesome with returning it . Thanks :)
5 #### A great way to wash / dry your lettuce , beans , cilantro , etc . You can use it on the counter top since it does n't drain out the bottom ( this is really handy when the sink is in use for other things ) . You put some water in , slosh the stuff around , dump the water out , repeat , then spin everything dry . Comes completely apart for easy cleaning .
5 #### I have some large fly traps around the yard but they are too gross and smelly to have by the house . This one is great up on my porch .
4 #### Nice nozzle and works well . My water pressure may not be high enough to get what this is capable of but it does the job .
4 #### Looks great in purple , but the inside has started to change it 's color .. as if it is rusting ... I am not quite sure if that 's ok
5 #### When I asked my husband what to say in a review about this hammock he had one word ... AWESOME ! My children and I purchased the hammock and a Castaway pillow that attaches to the hammock for Father 's Day this year . My husband says it is the best Father 's Day present EVER ! ! ! We have n't had it long enough to testify to its long term durability but it dries out quickly and is super comfortable . He says it is very comfortable by itself but is even better with the pillow .
4 #### Typical DeWalt quality . Good and honest tools . Nothing exotic or special , simply works and very well at that . No issue . An excellent to add quick change capability to any older model drills .
5 #### the best heater i owned . I use it in my office space and works great
4 #### I do n't use this often , but when I do it 's indispensable . I have a very good set of thick aluminum teflon lined pans . They cost me a small fortune , so , knowing how temperamental Teflon coatings can be , I will not use ( or allow the use ) of metal tools in my pans . This is why I love this whisk . Whenever I 'm making a sauce , this is the tool I grab . The handle is large and comfortable , the sticky rubber surface of the handle provides a confident grip , and the nylon " tines " are sturdy yet flexible enough to provide just the degree of blending I need when making Alfredo ( or any other ) sauce . And despite the fact that it 's a " balloon " whisk it 's still small enough to make and effective tool . Maybe OXO will make a slightly smaller version of this ? Hope so . Lovely !
5 #### Great grill . I bought this as an Hibachi grill for those intimate outdoor times , when just the two of us are .... It cooks steak perfectly , and is just the right size for two . I think it 's too heavy as a " camp grill " , but perfect for the patio .
5 #### This was a perfect accessory for my 14 " Jet bandsaw . It was a bit of a puzzle to work out how to make it fit just right , but it all worked out with patience . Strongly suggest that you get one of these and attach it to the saw base before assembling the rest of the saw .
3 #### The 16 ' version is not as nice as the 12 ' version . I was hoping for the same sturdy construction with a tad more length to be more multipurpose , but this one is actually lighter duty than the 12 ' version
2 #### Pros- modular and strong . Cons- levers are hard to use as other users have stated . You physically need to lift your tool to get them to engage and disengage . The wheel bearings are falling out all over the place . I have had at least 10 of the bearings show up around my shop . Tool is useless without them and gets harder and harder to move each time . When one gets lodged under a 300 lb table saw moving across your shop floor ... saw stops and could tip , expensive epoxy floor chipped , and wheel gets damage . User miffed big time . While the listing claims 500 lb capacity , that just is n't true . Sitting still maybe but then , you might ask yourself , " Am I shopping for a mobile base right now ? Do I want to leave my mobile base and coupled tool in one spot so the base wo n't explode ball bearings all over " ? I doubt it . Sorry I spent so much and all the hassle - go delta brand ? Good Luck
4 #### very well made product with good waterproofing protection . ease of use is excellent .
5 #### Shipped fast and as always titebond makes a quality product . Decent price too .
4 #### This was a 3rd party purchase , all I know is that it 's exactly what my aunt wanted and she is may want another .
5 #### I suspect that if you are reading this review , it 's because you are trying to justify spending 100 + USD on a square . Believe me , I did the same thing . But , after going ahead and biting the bullet , I 'm very pleased with the purchase . It may sound weird to say , but the tool is just lovely . The surfaces are machined perfectly and it 's dead - on square . Final bonus ? Made in the USA . You can buy a crappy square made in China and be frustrated with the results , or buy an American made product and have it for the rest of your life ( and then pass it on to your son or daughter ) .
2 #### Product description said 14 - OunceTitanium Framing Hammer driving force equals a 24 -ounce steel . If true , then Sir Isaac Newtons 2nd law ( Physics ) is a big lie .
5 #### Simply could n't be happier with this sprinkler . I 've been using it every day for about a week now and it has truly made my life so much easier . I was previously using the notoriously unreliable circular sprinklers that did a shoddy job at best covering small areas of my lawn . It 's amazing how quickly those fall apart ... This sprinkler covers a HUGE area , but more importantly it does so with a gentle and even cover , rather than flooding certain areas with water -- not what you need for new grass seed . Adjusting this sprinkler is a breeze , especially while it 's running -- very thankful for that ! At $ 30 you ca n't beat it , and yes it 's made of plastic parts , so I do n't expect this to last for all eternity -- water + anything = destroyed in time . With that said , I 'm taking proactive measures to take care of this product by cleaning it and letting it dry fully after each use . Highly recommended !
3 #### There are many things that are good about this filter , it is simple , easy to hook up and sits low in the pond . However , there are issues . It is unbelievably heavy to lift out of the pond when filled with water and debris . If you try to lift ( assuming you have got real strength ) it starts dumping the collected debris all over into the pond . Same if you do n't lift it but leave on the pond bottom and try to change it there , dumps debris everywhere . Another problem is that the nibs on the hose hookup are not strong enough to keep the hose on , even with a heavy duty screw clamp . You have to be really careful because if you knock it , the thing comes undone , leaving and open pipe to suck up and kill fish , plus of course you have the filter dumping its muck everywhere because there is no longer any suction on it . One solution I am using for the stuff coming out into the pond during changing of the filter is to try to put it in a clean trash bag while it is underwater , tightly shut the trash bag and lift it out . It is a mess no matter what you do really .
5 #### Great quality ! Sturdy bowl , basket and spinning button . Totally worth the price since we 've been through 3 other spinners that just did n't last .
5 #### Luckily enough , I have not yet had the opportunity to truly test this item , but by all appearances , it appears to be a working fire extinguisher .
2 #### I Never got dry lettuce or greens and used it maybe once a month . , until the pump broke . Bought another on the list . It did not last long either , then bought another which still works but does not dry either . I am looking at the manual spinners and using my terry cloth homemade case which I used for years . It dries and shaking it is not that hard . some times old fashioned is better . I 've been cooking 76 years so I ought to know . Anne
1 #### My UV clarifier is probably 10 or 11 months old and it 's already dead . The bulb burned out about 6 weeks ago , well short of its 1 year expected life , and was replaced . Last weekend I noticed the light was dead . I replaced the $ 80 bulb , plugged it back in , and nothing . The UV clarifier is dead . Typical . Ca n't anyone many anything that actually works anymore ? It 's also annoying that the input and output tubes have such a tiny diameter . I think they went out of their way to find a size that was difficult to convert to more standard sized tubes . EDIT : I was very mad when I wrote the above . The next day I contacted Pondmaster to complain , but they quickly began to resolve my problem . They sent out a new ballast which arrived in a few days and a complimentary bulb . The new ballast works fine . They made this process extremely easy for me and they did n't need to . This was an example of how a company can turn a bad situation into a favorable one because after this experience I would n't think twice about purchasing another Pondmaster product . I have the product a 1 because it broke when it should n't have , but after seeing their customer service in action I 'd like to change it to a 4 but I ca n't . I wo n't change it to a 5 because I still find the UV 's tiny in / out pipes annoying ;)
5 #### I have a ' vertical ' square Brinkman Smoker and I have n't been able to get the temperature up to 250 degrees . One of my web searches suggested cutting holes in the charcoal pan for more air OR getting a vegetable grill pan . I thought this Wok Pan might work . I received it today and it is AWESOME . It is quite heavy and well made ! The ' handles ' on this Wok - Topper slide in where the other charcoal pan goes for a perfect fit! .. and it will hold plenty of charcoal . It is going to give the charcoal much more ventilation which will increase the temperature of my smoker . If I was n't using this Wok - Pan for my smoker , I would still be thrilled with the QUALITY of this pan for grilling vegetables , etc . Outstanding price on this quality , heavy , well made pan .
2 #### It works well but after using the flex shaft attachment I am so confused . What is going on here and why is this thing secreting green goo ..... ? It was attached appropriately and was working fine , but when i went to remove it , it became a mess . I will be returning this .
3 #### I think this would would better with steel tubing . I 'm using white oak with it and there 's just not enough rigidity . I have three of these and at some point the wood is going to have to be replaced with square steel tubing . It works better with my 16 " bandsaw than with my 8 " jointer . The jointer is within weight specs , just barely . I used very precisely fitted white oak . You can see it flex when the pedal is depressed , and the jointer is just barely lifted off the floor . Just barely . You should base your judgment , I believe , on how often you will use it and how far you have to move your machine over how smooth a surface .
1 #### Tried to use to help clear up our cloudy pool . All the pool levels were perfect before adding it . We were told to use it to help clean up all the dead algae . Used the entire bottle over 3 days and some stuff settled to the bottom of the pool and then it became cloudy again . Added floc instead and vacuumed up the rest ....
1 #### I was supposed to receive a 6 - pack of Filtrete Allegren Defense Filters 12 - inch by 12 - inch but only received a single ( as in 1 ) 12X12 filter . Someone needs to send me the remaining 5 filters . Unacceptable .
4 #### It took me 45 minutes to unpack , sort the parts and put the grill together . At first the number of small parts seems a little daunting , but I read all of the instructions before I started , followed the directions and it was very easy . The only tricky part is installing the little screw in the bottom that holds the burner in place . The heat deflector in the bottom is tricky to hold in place while you do this and if you have another set of hands available this would be the only place where they would help . I cheated a little , I have a nice little 1/4 in drive socket set that worked a lot better than the odd little wrench that is supplied . I use a 20 lb propane tank with a 5 ft hose designed for the purpose and it works beautifully . After heating the unit for about 10 minutes to burn off any oils from the manufacturing process I cooked 2 big thick steaks and it cooked them perfectly . If you are even just a little bit handy with tools this is a snap . Sorry Mr. engineer , but I 'm no genius , I 'm just careful and I follow directions well . I recommend this product .
5 #### This is a great tool to have if you frequently whisk wet and dry ingredients together . With a normal balloon - type whisk , thick batters can get stuck in the middle , but that ca n't happen with this . I use it a lot for pancake and waffle batters .
5 #### This is a small apartment - sized vacuum with incredible power . You will go crazy trying to figure where to store the wands and hose and miscellanea -- I ended up using a plastic bucket I had lying around , the heck with esthetics -- but once you plug it in and use it , you will be delighted . I have a much more expensive vacuum in my main house and it does n't pick up as well . Best sucker for the money .
5 #### Have been using for several months when smaller cutters ca n't do the job . Have been happy with these .
5 #### This pan is sturdy and has a very nice non - stick finish . I own other products from this company and they have always met my expectations with regard to quality and performance .
5 #### Works as advertised . Photoelectric cell is well made and the unit seems like it will hold up well through the weather .
5 #### This is a great little heater . I bought this heater to use inside of my vw campervan and It puts out a lot of heat . I have never used it on high . It heats up the space very well using the low setting . It 's approved for indoor use , but I still keep my skylight vented .
5 #### I really could not believe the size that the plants grew to after adding this to the soil . I moved a block from the ocean . Very sandy soil . Added the castings when I planted new plants in the spring . My Lanta plants are well over FIVE FEET tall . I have grown Lantana off an on for decades and have never seen anything like this . The rest of the assorted flowers have thrived . Well worth the money
4 #### Thanks for the name brand fertilizer spikes . Easy to use and makes for beautiful plants .
5 #### The refinement of this wrench is perfect in every way , adjustments are very easy and do n't falter in any adjustment . It keeps the adjustment when set . Will tell my friends of my find on Amazon.com THANKS
5 #### So I 'm NOT going to let the mosquitoes ruin my outdoor experience and this is a BIG step towards no bug bites . With so much going on in the world with disease carried by mosquitoes I 'm taking the precautions I need to stay safe and still be active . The ThermaCELL is well made , durable and works great - it 's not my " ONLY " line of defense , but it helps a lot and I use it on every trip - no problems ! A great product
3 #### Used mine for the first time today . Very happy w/ the solid feel , and the rubber feet are impressive . Kind of like construction or hiking boot soles . However those finger pinching metal hinges that are sure to get bent . Definitely not upset w/ my purchase , but would spend more money for solid , smooth operational hinges that lock .
4 #### This tool does exactly what you expect , without any drama . It 's not spectacular , except in the sense there are no bad surprises with it . I 'll definitely order more when someone steals the one I have .
5 #### Great all purpose mixing bowl . I bought this about 4 years ago and use it all the time . It 's my go - to bowl for making cookies , pancakes , etc . There is plenty of room for the mix , does n't slide around , and is easy to clean . I just ordered the matching 5 quart and batter bowl .
2 #### This vacuum was bought to replace another Mighty Mite . It does n't . The wand scratches our wood floor and can therefore only be used on tiled areas in our house . If it were n't such a pain to return something , I would have returned this . The suction is fine . For that it gets the two stars . If I had the option to get a replacement wand without the trouble of returning the bad one , I certainly would give it at least 4 , and probably 5 stars . It 's worth the money if you are n't using it on highly polished wood .
5 #### excellent grip as is all OXO gear . the loop at the end makes all the difference if your straining to a bowl . The mesh is also durable and holding up well .
5 #### Milwaukee and DeWalt seem to make the highest quality recip . blades -- at least in my experiences . These were on sale as a 5 - pack so I purchased them , not thinking that the 6 " length really only exposes around 4 " after it 's installed into the saw mount . The shorter length limits your cuts so my suggestion is to consider the 9 " blade -- even longer -- for general purposes . Otherwise , typical DeWalt quality .
5 #### No problems what so ever with this item . Very sturdy construction . Would purchase again if I needed additional triple adapters .
5 #### Freud is well known for their quality blades and router bits , this one is no exception . The bits are incredibly sharp , as you might imagine . Seriously though - they are sharp . I sliced myself pretty good removing it from the package by letting my attention wane . Once in the router however , this thing performed beautifully . It chewed through 3/4 " birch ply and MDF without hesitation . Cuts were clean , with no tear - out . Color me impressed . This particular bit , 23/32 is perfect for cutting dados when using 3/4 " nominal thickness plywood . Just about any plywood labeled 3/4 " will actually be 23/32 " thick , so make sure you pick up this bit rather than the standard 3/4 " bit , otherwise you 'll have some play in your work .
5 #### I actually have an original C8FB . The C8FB2 is even better : self - retracting guard is the best . As you lower the saw , the guard pulls itself up via a linkage . My older model allows the guard to touch the wood and is pushed up by being in contact . Not bad on 90 degree cuts but if the saw is laid sidewise , the guard binds against the blade . They fixed this problem elegantly on the B model . The saw is now twelve years old or more and is as accurate as when I bought it . What else can I say ? It crosscuts 2x12s . Crown mouldings . Aluminum . Anything . I 'm trying to get the 998864 blade that is actually designed to cut aluminum . That would be even better . The saw transports well : not too big and heavy . Cord is too short , but they all are . I replaced it with a 14 - ga 25 ' cord . Much better . Now if they offered that centrifugal - on laser cutting guide in the blade bushing it would be perfect . My radial saw was retired by this beaut .
5 #### These will do the trick ! Bought a couple 100 's and an 80 footer . make sure to have the plug in end close to a receptacle .
4 #### I was looking for a simple double boiler for occasional items , this fits well and works well enough for how often I use it . Not quite as heavy as expected , but since it 's not one of my primary pieces , not too worried about it .
5 #### One of my favorite brands of stock pots . I had a 12 quart , which I used all the time for canning my spaghetti sauce . I gave this one to my daughter only because the 16 quart was too big for the burners on my gas stove . I love it and would n't use anything else to simmer the sauce that I 'm going to can . Good quality and never burned the bottom even when I had the heat pretty high . Easy clean up .
5 #### I 'm very pleased with this pie pan . I 've used it so far in a regular oven for making quiche for 2 people . It works beautifully . The pan is not super - heavy , but it 's heavy enough to allow the quiche to bake evenly , and the decorated lip on the top is very handy when forming the top of the crust . It washes up well in the dishwasher , and it has n't scratched from the utensils I used to cut the pie slices . It is perhaps a little trickier to get the first piece out , as one reviewer mentioned , but I find if I use a smaller - than - normal spatula , it works fine . I plan to buy another one -- I love it !
5 #### Eliminated a wasp problem I was having in my barn . The first day I had 50 - 100 wasps on the floor dead or dying . In the next few days it cleaned up the remaining 25 or so . I 'm completely happy and no longer are concerned with getting stung while working in there . This is the only fogger I saw that lists wasps as a " controlled pest " . It worked for me ! I needed to use a fogger , because I never could find the nest to treat it directly . I suspect it was hidden behind some of the structure at the top of my barn . Update Oct 20 : I used this product back in late March . My barn was wasp free until today ( Oct 20 ) when I noticed groups of wasps loitering near the windows and rafters . I 'm about to pull the trigger and order more of this product . They claim it keeps killing for 2 months , my experience says its really more like 6 or 7 months . It worked for me better than they claim , which is a rarity these days - most products ( and politicians ) deliver way less than advertised .
5 #### After reading many reviews the overall ratings for this vacuum were quite high . For a small sweeper it has good power and the price was reasonable . I am well satisfied with the performance .
5 #### This tool is a high quality grass cutters , I used it in a field to clear grass around my electric fence and it did n't perform quite as well with thick straw type grass . Trimming the grass around my yard it works great . Its very sharp . so its does n't handle lots of grass at one time , however it does cut a good amount of regular grass which each cut . I do n't find the shears hard squeeze I have work it for a few hours and did not get tire . It does n't have any of the adjustment as the write - up said , it just a great pair of shears .
4 #### I have about five of the flexogen hoses in different lenghts for each side of the house so I do n't have to drag them too far . I have had to use the warranty and it is painless . You send in the ends . They send you new hose . Happy watering . As they get older they do tend to kink , but that is usually after two seasons .
5 #### Think this is a better deal than the pre curled types . Can reach a longer distance and the color stands out . No problems found other than I did not wrap the connector with Teflon before trying . Exactly as advertised . Part of the recommended package by Amazon .
5 #### We have an older Shop Vac 2010A. Over time , we have lost most of the accessories for this vacuum cleaner . This kit was the perfect add - on for this Shop Vac .
5 #### I have a small kitchen and was restocking my knives and associated tools . The price was reasonable , it is well made and does what it is suppose to do .
4 #### I was so excited to find this ! My grandmother had one when I was growing up , and I have been looking for it forever ! I use it to store carrots in water in my fridge . It keeps them fresh and crunchy longer , and the water makes them especially cold . ( I swear it 's true . )
5 #### Ca n't go wrong here , great product and arrived timely !
4 #### Ca n't get too excited about a hose , they all make you nuts till they get broke in a bit and get some sun to wear them down . We are in Colorado , so when the hose is cold it is till a monster to get rolled out . Plus the water temperature going through still is burrrrrrr . Gon na give it some sun time and we will get along better . I have purchases the Xhose & the Xhose expensive black version in hopes to have a good hose for the deck . DON"T get them ! They all explode and can hurt you like me ! Stay with this type . Safe & will last for years ! !
1 #### I bought this machine based on the reviews of others . The first time I used it , smoke came billowing out within minutes of the bake cycle beginning . I thought maybe something had spilled out and was burning on the inside . I removed the bread pan and everything was clean . I started the bake cycle back up and again smoke . It smelled electrical , so I immediately unplugged it . I am so grateful that I was home and had n't set it to bake while I was out . I called the manufacturer and they were very helpful and apologetic and sent a return label for it . I returned it to them about 3 weeks ago , and have heard nothing yet .
5 #### Fabulous gift to self for Big - O birthday . Just what I always wanted outside my kitchen window .
5 #### Excellent addition to my Shop - Vac . Fitment was perfect as well as quality
5 #### Work really well to clip liriope .. Glad I got them .
4 #### Excellent product , but it does drip after I am done watering a particular spot . I may need to re - read the reviews to prevent it , but I thought I did ( by turning the gold piece the other way ) . If I can get it to not after - drip , I 'll update my review . Great reach . You really ca n't go wrong here .
5 #### I love these ! I keep them on my fridge when they are n't in use , and then they are always by my side when I need them .
5 #### I have never wanted one of these , and saw no use for one , then America 's Test Kitchen said nice things about them , so a picked this up . I 'm sold . It 's very good for icing , and other smoothing ( I make a cauliflower bread starter , recipe attached ) . Like other Oxo products , it 's a little more expensive , but it 's very well made .
5 #### I bought this for my elderly father 's house . It was infested so bad you could n't sit on the sofa for 5 minutes without getting eaten alive . I had tried every type of spray , powder , and bug bomb on the market and nothing worked . I was ready to call an exterminator when I saw this and decided to give it a try . Within a week the majority of the fleas were gone , and within two weeks they were totally gone . I put it behind the TV stand and keep it plugged in year round now . Also if you do n't want to buy replacement pads , you can get 8x10 lamination sheets at Walmart , cut them into four equal sections , and you have four pads for about a buck .
5 #### Adheres well to sink . My only concern is that unless you put flatware handle side up , the pieces tend to lean to the flat side and hit the side of the sink . I 'm not sure how sanitary that is .
2 #### If you 're looking for a garlic press that produces minced garlic , keep looking . This is a garlic squasher , a garlic masher , a garlic crusher , but NOT a garlic press . No actual minced garlic emerges from the little holes . I was so disappointed ! My husband finally repaired our old , no - name , made - in - Taiwan garlic press , and we 're back in business . Caveat emptor !
4 #### I did a lot of research and many people complained about " the tolerances " or the machines being " off " by a micro millimeter . Here is my experience : I 'm a dowel guy , but i recently purchased this tool to speed things up that do n't need the strength of a dowel . I 'm quite happy with it . There are some big advantages in assembly of cabinetry to have a plate jointer ! When you place a biscuit , you have a little play to work with so even if the machine were ' off ' by a millimiter , it 's really no issue at all .
5 #### This whisk is great for those coated pans that you want to protect and keep in good shape . It works as advertized and is a value for the money .
5 #### I have three sets of measuring spoons and I only use this set . I like how the measurements are clearly labeled in large font , also each spoon has text in a different color , which I find helpful . The spoons are almost too easily removed from the ring . I keep these hanging , sometimes a spoon will fall off when I 'm replacing another .
5 #### I bought this to keep the deer away from my hostas and it has worked like a dream ! We live a wooded area where deer will actually walk up to my front porch to eat my plants ! It has worked so good , that I even sprayed my neighbors hostas and they are amazed at how beautiful their plants look this year . It does smell something awful when it is wet , but does n't smell at all after it is dry .
5 #### Brought this to use with circulation fan for dust collector in my wood shop . I can set in and walk away .. and dust is removed and shut off . About half the price of the local big box stores
2 #### Did n't work . Tried various things . Bait gone several times , until I think the rats figured it was a trap , then they left it alone .
3 #### I 'm not thrilled with the rocker seat . It 's too easy to tip over in . Do n't think I would buy it again .
5 #### this was a gift from one of my grandchildren i was skeptical , but it works like a charm
3 #### I debated whether to give this item 4 stars . The attachments and hose attach easily . The hepa filter also attaches easily . The sucking power is just right . Not too strong but strong enough for kitty litter and whatever appears on my tile floor . I tried the brush attachment on the couch and rug around the cat box , it is just adequate . I would like a more power . I would not get a vacuum with a smaller than 12 amp motor . The hose is the problem . It kinks easily and stops the flow of air . I ended up wrapping it around my body to stop this from happening . If not for a very flimsy hose , I would have rated this higher .
5 #### When this knife arrived in the mail today , I was a little confused . I thought this came with a blade ....... THEN i realized that I had to open the handle and install the one blade that is included . You can probably store two to three blades in the handle -- handy for when one breaks in the middle of a job . The price on this little thing is awesome . I primarily will use this knife to open Amazon boxes -- as I am an Amazon junkie ... lol Quality : The blade is a bit thin , but will serve the purpose for which I plan to use it for Price : Awesome ! ! ! $ 3 for a great handle --- i wonder if you can install a heavy duty blade in this bad boy ... hummmm Recommendation ; I highly recommend this blade for light duty jobs --- the handle will last years to come --and the blades are replacable
5 #### I bought two and this is my second pair . Nicely made and very functional . Keeps the corners square every time .
4 #### This works good as a coffee filter and that is what I have been using it for . But your coffee has to coarse ground so that it wo n't have many grounds in your coffee . I do n't know how the quality of the metal used in this . It is made in China and who knows .
4 #### I bought this because I , too , wanted a longer icing knife . I works well , with the exception that it is flexible . So , the frosting can not be cold or stiff , which sometimes makes the cake more difficult to ice . It does work fantastically with softer frostings and whipped cream .
4 #### This is true Fiskars quality and stores flat in a second . It carries so many different things , is light , strong , and easy to carry I just think it is great for what it is designed for .
5 #### potentially , this is a good review . since nothing has caught fire , i am literally giving kidde the benefit of the doubt .
5 #### Bought this as a Christmas present for someone who used my Sharptooth saw on a hunting trip & had to have one . Amazing cutting ability . This size packs well and is a staple on on our Alaskan hunting & camping trips . It can even double as a bone cutting saw on big game or tree limb trimming around the home . One of my favorite tools !
5 #### Easy to use and have a powerful cut . They seem very well made .
4 #### Too flexible for my taste but seems pretty decent quality .
5 #### For its size , weight , and price , this is a mighty fine cleaning device . I live with 2 indoor cats , so it not only has to deal with lots of fur , but those pesky little grains of sand that seem to travel far from the litter pan ... and it does a good job with both . Also excellent for my Persian carpets , as it 's not recommended to use a vacuum with a beater bar on them . The plus factors are : It hangs in my broom closet taking up very little space , it 's incredibly light , the cord is long enough to reach many areas , it works equally well on carpeting or the kitchen / bathroom flooring , the nozzle is thin and mobile enough to clean corners and tight spaces , and most of all ( and this is a big item for me and my four - pawed friends ) , the sound is tolerable for our sensitive ears . Yes , you have to invert the filter and clean it , but it 's a sturdy one ( and washes well if you want to ) , and if done carefully with a paper towel is an easy enough procedure ... it also amazes me how much finds its way into the filter , proof that this handy Quick - Broom is doing its job . Update 3/3/05 : Still going strong ! But those with a fleet of pets should keep in mind that this is not a full - powered vacuum . It will not handle , or was it meant to handle , major jobs . If one keeps this in mind , it 's a remarkable little machine .
5 #### This is really big and really effective . Put the lettuce leaves in the basket , rinse under the tap , shake , put the basket in the spinner . Spin . Encourages one to eat more healthy salads and fewer ice cream sundaes .
5 #### I have purchased several Amco products and they all are far better than the more well advertised jumk you can get from big box stores . I have yet to be disappointed .
5 #### Awesome ! Makes even better popovers than my " solid " popover pans . The open wire frame really helps .
5 #### Great heavy duty mini - measuring tape . This thing has some weight to it and is very easy to read . If you 're not worried about your manhood . Get this tape measure !
5 #### I use this almost daily to keep my kitchen knives and pocket knives sharp . As long as your blade is not damaged or overly dull to begin with , this perfectly sized sharpener does the job terrifically ( I can sharpen even my larger chef 's knives to the point of being able to shave with ) .
5 #### I read a ton of reviews and for our almost all wood - floor apartment in Chicago , this thing is AMAZING . Extremely powerful , yet light to carry . It can get a bit warm if you are n't changing the bags on a regular basis . Bags are cheap and easy to order on Amazon . Best money I spent on a vacuum . I woudln't pay any more for the unit than I did , but for it 's exact price , it 's a gem .
4 #### This is a great blade , super quiet and super quick ( be careful ! ) My Forrest WWII leaves a cleaner edge but this is a great blade . When I 'm doing a lot of ripping this is what 's in the saw .
5 #### It was very easy to ues it , nice , and very comfortable . We recommended everyone to have it . I like it to much .
5 #### Prefer this over the snap on equivalent easy transition between channels and strong metal construction . Would buy this again in a heart beat
5 #### I did n't want to be married to Kreg and have to buy screwsfrom them . I tried several other types of screws though and none seem to do the job the Kreg screws do . Be sure you use the coarse thread for soft woods like pine and spruce and the fine threads for hardwoods . It DOES make a difference .
5 #### I have been buying this glue in this exact quantity for years now and I am here to say that it is an absolutely great performer . Though I have used polyurethane glues and epoxy ( I have yet to try the new Titebond III ) , this Titebond II is the glue I turn to 99 % of the time . It has never let me down in any application - I build mainly indoor furniture and jigs . Once cured , the strength of this glue is consistently stronger than the wood around it . I have had good luck with letting it dry and scraping the squeeze - out away with a sharp chisel and/or a flexible putty knife . After sanding I have had no problems with splotchiness in finishes . I made the mistake of buying too much of this glue at once a few years ago and learned the lesson that it will go bad over time . Now I always buy this glue in these bottles and never have problems . Highly recommended !
4 #### My 9 year old daughter is the one that uses it , but I have seen how it works . It is very bright , but not so bright that it disturbs others when she uses it , and it clips perfectly to her books as well as her tablet . Even her thicker books such as Harry Potter it works for , and she loves the girlish designs on it . Very happy with it , especially given the price . EDIT : 1 month later and this is broken . I 'm not sure what happened , but the top part with the light in it got separated from the middle , and the inside wires snapped . My daughter was very careful with it and is now very disappointed . I have taken a star away , since this product is clearly not very durable and I expected it to last longer than a month
4 #### It works very well for cleaning , drying and storing lettuce from the garden .
5 #### This thing is great ! Works very well and is a quality product . Was easy to assemble and serves it 's purpose well . We sprouted a ton of stuff with it this winter and got a head start on our garden !
4 #### Good quality , OXO is a good brand that I frequently buy however be sure to pay attention to the dimensions . I thought I was getting a bigger wisk length wise than I actually received . It was my fault for not looking closer to the size . I kept it anyway , I will use it . It is just not the full length I wish I had purchased .
5 #### My chain has a pitch of 3/16 . So I use 1 shim and the orange color sharpening stone provided with the kit . It 's cheaper and faster than taking the chain to a store for sharpening . Take a few minutes to read the instructions and you can do it . If you 're smart , you could figure it out without reading . I 'm not smart . So it took me a few minutes extra . If you sharpen a lot of chains or frequently and need extra sharpening stone , then you can buy a pack of 2 for less than 6 bucks .
2 #### This served me well for two years . It transmitted the info through bricks , glass and metal over a distance of 50 feet for about two years until the batteries needed replacement in the exterior unit . After that problems mounted , performance became spotty and I finally threw it away after three and a half years . Never did like having to unscrew four tiny screws just to change the batteries in the outside unit . This by itself is poor design . Not worth price and frustration for just two years of good service .
1 #### It does NOT spray water far enough or wide enough , very disappointed . Also it 's too pricey .
1 #### Reading through the positive reviews on this product gave me the reassurance in buying it and that it was n't going to look used . I received the Moka Express on time and fairly quickly . Opened it to find what looked like a used product with unnatural looking blemishes and scratches , also the logo is faded both front and bottom . On top of that they over greased it leaving little globs of grease on the edges of where you screw the bottom on , was a little disgusting knowing I may be ingesting that lol . Also the wrapping was just loosely thrown in not even holding the product properly . Not expecting perfection , just excepting it to look presentable and at least new .
5 #### I used this automatic switch for outdoor holiday lights . It has a day / night sensor and can be programmed to come on at dusk and turn off at any number of hours later - or stay on all night - or stay on all of the time . A tip : Make sure the sensor is pointed so that headlights and other lights do n't shine on it . It will mess up the timer function if lights shine on it while it 's on . I do n't mean christmas lights - just bright lights like car headlights and flash lights . It worked all season without any issues controlling 200 LED christmas lights . I used it outdoor on my outdoor roofed front porch .
5 #### used it when I was redoing my Kitchen and other project around the house . It work really great will buy it again when needed
5 #### It collects the dust , but not all of it . I empty the bag after use each time . Hate to think of the mess I would make if I did n't have the bag attached .
5 #### Having made several of these myself for about a 1/4 of the price , I was extremely skeptical at paying the price and getting something better . However , the adjustments to bring this consistently level with the table top are almost worth the extra . Having a small piece of wood jam against the lip where this meets the table because it is not perfectly aligned is at best frustrating and potentially dangerous . This aligns quickly and easily and lasts . It could be cheaper !
5 #### A necessary part of your building kit . If you do n't have one of these , get this . You 'll wonder how you lived without it . Stanley again makes a good product for the DIY at a great price .
2 #### the pressing handles are not long enough I had to stand up and press with my body weight .... a long pressing handle would help a lot .... I returned because of this I have hand and wrist problems .
2 #### This is a handsome well - made lightweight nozzle , but it is LOW FLOW ... only about 50 % of the flow of the " HOSECOIL FIREHOSE NOZZLE " I previously ordered , which I got TWO for the price of this Bon - Aire . I 'm sending mine back ...
2 #### march 23rd this scroll saw will be 1 year old , machine is making knocking sound . have to bring it in to service center . this machine for the price should last years under mild use . this machine lasted under a year with only about 2 months of total use . Not happy .
3 #### For occasional use during 6 months 3 tips already broken , one still OK . ( 2 tips been belong to Gun , another 2 I bought via Amazon ) .
1 #### I bought this a year ago and initially gave it a high rating , but the plastic at the bottom interior of the bowl is now peeling in a few places . I do n't know about you , but I do n't want plastic in my food , so this is now going in the garbage . What a waste !
4 #### They fit the ladder perfectly and were easy to install . They also work perfectly . Pushing a 12 ft ladder up the roof is made very easy with the castors . Then you flip the ladder over and the hooks grip the opposite side of the roof peak . These should be sold in pairs , because they really need to used in pairs ( per instructions ) , and maybe they could be built slightly lighter ? They significantly add to the weight of the ladder . The cross pieces on the ends might be improved by making them a triangular shape where two bolts could be used to keep them from rotating unintentionally ( and they could be aluminum ) . On one use , one of the cross pieces , in spite of being bolted very tightly to the hook , got rotated to where it was parallel with the hook instead of being at 90 as shown in the picture . Since the bolt was tight , I had to take the ladder back down to fix the problem . Maybe keeping the bolts slighty loose would prevent that from happening ? Professional roof ladders used by firemen do n't have those cross pieces , so maybe removing them is a viable solution . However , I think the cross pieces are easier on the roof than the hook points without them .
5 #### These chips give your recipes a wood smoked taste a bit different from hickory or mesquite . I think it 's particularly good with fish , pork and poultry .
5 #### I have one of these that my father had for a while . They hold up well and work as advertised . A little pricey initially but really pays for itself by not having to buy replacements . I have one on the curved pipe base , one on a spike , and one on a base another now defunct plastic head came on .
5 #### Started getting my veggies from the farmer 's market . This device not only leaves the leafy greens clean , it 's fun !
5 #### Fits very large bag of dog food perfectly ! Keeps food fresh and dogs / cats from chewing through side of bag ! Highly recommend .
5 #### When they arrived , I could not wait to use them . Wonderfully easy to use and seem to be pretty tough . Would recommend them . Good if you have some trouble using your hands like I do .
5 #### Liking everything about this product . Power , extra battery and ease of use . Glad I do n't have to lug out my big vac as often . , This works so great on my tiled floors and area rugs . Highly recommend !
5 #### I am using this in conjunction with other products , but so far no algae bloom and nice clear water !
5 #### When it came time to buy , it was a choice between this one or an electric one . I chose this one simply because in thinking this would be easier to keep clean than a electric can opener . Plus really , , , , how often do ya open cans ? ? ? For me , not much . So buying a manual can opener made more since . Anyways , , , , , , effortless to use and being solidly built makes it a good buy .... :)
5 #### This product is fantastic . I just would not place in your yard , would hang this away from whatever area you are using as this attracts everything and their mother to it :-) I had a lot of flies around my yard due to my neighbors " very clean back yard " NOT .. I hung 2 of these on the fence close to their side and I have to say within 2 days both of these were filled to the top with these flying critters . My yard is now fly free and I can have my burgers without 20 flies on me trying to take a bite . I seriously recommend this .
5 #### It 's a light switch plate ... local Lowes was out so bought with timer switch so free shipping .
5 #### This filter is just as good as the one that came with the wet dry vacuum . It 's all any one needs for a replacement filter .
5 #### Really like this timer ! Easy to set up , use and change times if needed .
5 #### Inexpensive and just what I need for quick cuts . Ideal for my projects . 5 - Star
5 #### totally works but works best with smaller size apples . Costco size apple cores are a little too big so you get a little bit of the core still in the apple .
5 #### Easy to follow instructions including a very helpful Rodents 101 pamphlet showing just how to best bait and use the unit . I used about 3 kernels of dry dog food as bait rather than peanut butter which would be very messy . Caught 2 rats in 4 days but then the unit stayed in the zap mode so I followed the directions for cleaning and it worked fine again . Must keep dry with some type of enclosure if used outdoors , just as it says . My neighbor bought the Victor model from Ace for $ 15 more and has n't caught a single one , plus the Victor uses C type batteries versus the AA for the Rat Zapper . She says she will return the Victor to Ace and order the Rat Zapper from Amazon .
5 #### High quality product . I 'm a chronic DIY guy . This is a great set with a quality case . Love it .
3 #### This item is smaller than l thought it would be but the dimensions on the listing are accurate so that 's my fault . It does n't hold much more than the three items shown in the pic . I 'm using it for my sponge .
5 #### I 've had this hammer for about a month . How 's it going you ask ? Truth is , I was so taken with it as an ' object d'art ' , that I have had it on display ever since . This is a beautifully crafted item , period ! An absolute pleasure to look at and to hold ... in sickness and in ... have I gone too far ? Since I bought it to replace an Estwing hammer that 's been by my side for around 15 years , I can testify to what marvelous hammers they are . I have tried other tradies tools and while a few other top brands come close , this one is well and truly the pack leader . Treat yourself , buy two . That way , ( like me ) you 'll have one beautifully balanced tool to satisfy the carpenter in you , and another to engage your aesthetic side .
5 #### I purchased this exclusively for autobody repair . It 's a tip I learned from an old body man many years ago . These curved blades are ideal for shaping Bondo when it is set up but NOT YET HARDENED . I do not use a handle , just the blade , exactly as it appears in the photo . Hold it at each end with your fingertips and drag the blade along the work in a generally downward motion . Works best when you tilt one edge of the blade up off the work . Excess Bondo sloughs off like cheese coming through a grater . Fastest way I know for getting down to the approximate contour . I think pro body shops may have pneumatic air files now that do the same thing .
5 #### I have four small ponds in two different locations and are using this filter in all of them . It is effect , relatively low maintenance and effective .
5 #### Wow small innovation , small device maximum usage , great youtube videos are there to understand its multi purpose . The construction is very good and so is the material quality .
5 #### The GenTran inlet junction box is a compact PVC but large enough to make connections . I have no issues with water intrusion and it was easy to install on the exterior of my house .
5 #### I have been using Algaefix for several years and have found it to be the absolute best for cleaning up filter clogging floating algae . My pond holds about 1,500 gal and 20 + fish . At the start of warmer weather , I treat the pond with Algaefix about three times and have crystal clear water all summer , only needing a touch up treatment on occasion . I recommend that treatment be stopped around September to allow regrowth for fish grazing over the winter months . Using one of those hose fertilizer sprayers makes application very easy . You might also consider getting some barley straw in the water to stop green water as it aids the Algaefix . I do n't know how they do it , but Amazon sells this product at about half the price of pond outlet shops and ships it fast . I highly recommend this product for algae control in outdoor fish ponds . Just be certain to follow the directions and keep aeriation going .
5 #### I store my washer in my wood working shop , these help to keep the sawdust from covering it .
5 #### I think it is actually a vegetable brush for Mushrooms and soft vegetables but I use it as a nail brush . Works great as a nail brush too . Very well made .
5 #### Fiskars makes strong , light weight trowels for the garden and all of the styles are terrific ! Do n't dig , scoop , or tunnel without one of them !
5 #### To all out there who buys a tape measure My expertise is I ve been in the trades self employed for 35 years . What to look for in a tape is how many rivets holds on the end that hooks onto an object . Some come with 2 but 3 is riviets is what you want This tape like all I buy has 3 rivets meaning a good tape wo n't get sloppy at the end in measuring not to mention Stanely is the best all around tool to buy . Great tape for the price and QUICK delivery LOVE it all Thanks to the supplier and Amazon
1 #### This was delivered April 26 and as of yesterday May 11 , it no longer works properly . At first I loved it . It did a nice job of watering my vegatable garden but now I can not get it to oscillate any more . It just sprays in one directions only . Now I have to find another one to replace . This one . Waste of money for only 16 days of use .
4 #### No , this fan wo n't cool your entire house during the summer months . It 's a very basic , low - end fan - but it does provide substantial relief from the heat . I keep it on overnight in the bedroom which allows me to reduce reliance on the air conditioner . If it 's pointed directly on you , you feel a huge difference . It wo n't drop temperatures too much on a room overall , but even if you are n't standing next to it , the air circulation is worth the price . I was able to get it for under $ 20 at a local store . I would definitely recommend this ultra - basic Lasko fan for anyone who wants to save money on the electric bill .
2 #### I 'm a person who reads reviews before I buy . I especially read the negative ones to see what they have to say . This was rated very highly and honestly I ca n't even remember what all the negatives said . Maybe we had a defective cooker but here is my opinion . First of all , this is not our first cooker . We needed this one for a vacation home and have some idea of how they should work . The cord was already assembled so we did n't have to worry about that . All we had to do was attach it to the cord and the other end to the propane tank . Very easy . Our problem with it was that it would not stay lit on low or medium heat . We had to fry our turkey on high heat . It was a dry and hot morning with hardly any breeze . We did get our turkey done after an hour but felt that we did n't want to go through this every time we used the cooker . We really did n't know if we had a defective cooker or what but we returned it . Amazon understood our concerns and sent UPS out the next day to pick it up . You got ta love Amazon for their return policies .
5 #### This thing is a workhorse . It gets a lot of areas on wood floors done that the drum sander ca n't reach . Areas that are not exactly where you would want to use an edger . Not too heavy which is a big help and the bag does a great job . Just enough power for what it 's made for .
4 #### I used the piss out of this tape until I dropped it into a creek and the innards stopped working as a result of rust I 'm sure . I have since bought a new one just like it . The long stand out really a shows its worth when I 'm working alone and do n't have anyone to hold the other end . The only complaint is that the tip / hook is kind of sloppy so whenever I 'm doing anything that needs really precise measurements I grab a different smaller tape . Experience level in relation to this tool : medium
5 #### priced great . These do n't leak at all . I have 6 of these and they will last a couple years , even using them daily .
5 #### Bought this from Amazon back in 2011 and I 'm halfway through 2015 at this writing still using it and still loving it . Perfect size to slice through the oak logs I use for my fireplace . Recommend ! I have left it under the house and outside ( I know , shame on me ) but it is still holding up well , take care of it , it will last an extremely long time I think .
5 #### This book light works very well for a variety of uses . Great quality , many uses , and worth the price .
4 #### First one was defective but of course Amazon replaced it asap , free , as always ... they are great . New one works fine , really is very big for a liquid tube thermometer .
5 #### Hard to imagine an electric chain so with so much power . Takes care of any task around the house . I am not going to be cutting down mature trees but it sure fills the bill for everything else
5 #### YOU WANT QUALITY AND WANT THE JOB DONE RIGHT GET THIS , IT WORKS GREAT .
5 #### Great peeler . Easy to use and hold . Worked great on my carrots . I would recommend to others .
5 #### This tool really speeds up ripping drywall . The only advice I offer is ( 1 ) ensure that you keep the yellow guide firmly against the drywall edge while cutting , and ( 2 ) take the time to learn how to " read " the slots between the inch markers on the rule section . They are at 1/16 " increments , and if you are unfamiliar with how they are set up , you can easily select the wrong slot and be off by 1/16 " . This tool is a little over 24 " long , so you 'll need to continue to use your 48 " T - Square for most " crosscuts " .
5 #### Fills up with flies quickly , keeps them under control around the chicken coup .
5 #### They work good with my old hands . Cutting small things this works very well .
4 #### My husband repaired an old axe and he ended up staining this and putting a little inlay on the bottom . It came out very well ! He 's happy !
4 #### I bought this for the lights I have on my gazebo and a tree in the backyard . It works perfectly . It was a little hard to understand how to set it up but not too bad . I will most likely buy another one to use for the Christmas lights outside . I love how you can program it any way you want .
5 #### Easy to cut , although it 's quite " transparent " and light , so you 'll need a hand to get this wrapped around your trees or shrubs . Seems to be quite durable . Keeps the deer away from the plants I wrapped they had already started chewing on this winter . Saved several of my plants from certain death already .
4 #### Easy to use . Very comfortable grip eels good and will save time when I 'm having to peel and core apples
4 #### I bought these for our Hoover vacuum cleaner and they work really well . We vacuum once a week and have had really good success with them . They seem to hold the dust and debris in them nicely and are fairly easy to swap out when full . No complaints , they work as described . The packaging was very good and the shipping only took a few days .
5 #### Works great but NEVER get downwind of it , , , , , wheeeeeew it will tip ur gag meeter to the red zone .
5 #### Sturdy and the cake came out with well defined design .
5 #### These shells are wonderful . We use them at least once - sometimes twice - a week , and they still look brand new . They do n't require any sort of oiling before use , so they require almost no cleaning . I just give them a quick swipe with a paper towel . They really are non - stick . I store them together with a coffee filter in between them . We highly recommend this product .
5 #### The only brand and model of corn popper you should ever consider .
5 #### I have had a small fake Christmas tree for years . It 's lighted at the base by a MR11 halogen bulb . The directions state , " Do not leave on more than six hours , bulb may overheat . " I just installed one of these and not only is it brighter , I can tell there 's almost zero heat .
5 #### This mandoline is great ! I 've wanted a mandoline for sometime but they always seemed much too costly . ( Most I priced at $ 100 + ) So when I happened upon this mandoline I jumped at the opportunity . I must admit , the previous reviewers suggestion of fresh made potato chips was rather enticing ... and are they ever yummy . My husband is so impressed with me and my cooking ability , thanks to this little mandoline ! Get it , it 's fun to use , does n't take up much space , it 's safe , it 's a great bargain and it 'll make you look good !
5 #### works so good that I ordered one for my daughter .
5 #### I put this base together twice and it works great . Now if only I could have measured the tool right the first time ... Seriously it went together easy , rolls well and fits my Ryobi BT3000 just fine . I love it . I was going to buy the Shop Fox but their heavy duty model was more $ $ $ and it was at least 1/2 " too short in one dimension !
5 #### Packed loose in a large box . A few tines were out of alignment when it arrived . I pushed them a bit , and everything lined up just fine . Seems just as sturdy as any full sized rake from the hardware store .
5 #### OXO products are often worth the extra cost , and this is one of them ! I tried cheaper , no - name strainers , even ones that claimed to be stainless steel , and regretted it . I have this OXO strainer and a larger one of the same kind , and they have n't rusted after many uses . The grip handle makes it easy to hold onto when dumping something heavy into the strainer . I know , it 's just a strainer , but it 's one that should last you a long time !
1 #### I bought this item and used it for about 2 months , then It exploded while I was spinning a salad and was impossible to repair . I went on to buy a Tupperware salad spinner ( green ) and have been using it for four years with no problems at all .
5 #### A nice pan that works beautifully for thin Swedish pancakes . When I made them on my griddle the thin batter would run and make a mess . This pan , along with the Tovole Pancake Pen really is a game changer ! Love them both for making the delicious Swedish pancakes easya d mess free .
1 #### Strong words for a pressure cooker , I know , but this thing has been such a disappointment . I bought it to replace my old 6 - Quart Presto pressure cooker that worked well and faithfully for many years . I 'm not sure if they have started making these things in China after I purchased my last pressure cooker or what . This new one is much lighter weight and the metal feels thin and cheap . The handle screw continually comes loose which makes the handle itself loose and wobbly . The pressure hole does n't seem to line up properly so that I have to use a knife to wiggle the pressure button free to pop up so it can start to cook after the pressure builds . If you are looking for a solid , reliable pressure cooker - - keep looking ! This is not the one !
5 #### As always , Delta makes a quality blade that fits precisely in the planer
4 #### Worked for me . Once I found the new path it was taking ( 2 try 's ) , got it by the second day of the second placement . Update 080717 : Worked well till something was spilled on it and it started to make a buzzing noise . Will order another .
5 #### The flat whisk is a great device . Its easier to use , store and clean than a traditional whisk . The light handle means you can rest it in a bowl with less chance the bowl will tip .
5 #### I am NOT a handyman , but felt this was something I could tackle . Very easy to install , and the device feels like it is well made and good quality ( had to return one I got at local hardware store that was very poor quality ) . We have been using in our bathroom to control ceiling heat lamps with no problems at all .
5 #### I have used this product before and it is great for use against flies , ticks etc . This year I will use it around my dogs as well . It 's sagfe and easy to use .
5 #### My first scroll saw was a cheap delta . It did the job . The 788 is my second . If I had ever used one of the high dollar saws , maybe I would n't be so impressed . I do n't understand the user that had a problem with the light and the hold down . My light mounts on the left and is rock steady ; my blade hold downs are knobs . I " think " I installed the light using an allen wrench but that 's the only place . My saw does n't pass the nickel test but that 's only because I have the saw tilted forward on the stand . I too was afraid that the 788 would not live up to its hype ; so far ( 3 months ) I have not been disappointed I have cut copper laminated to piece of 1/4 paneling with no problems or vibration . I think the other reviewer may have had one of the first 788 lemons that I have heard about .
5 #### I 've owned one of these for almost 8 years now . It is the best flashlight I ever purchased . I bought it when I was in college and worked as a Student Auxiliary for the college Police Department . My flashlight has suffered a great deal more then most flashlights can handle . It 's been dropped , run over , used as a hammer , used to pound in tent stakes , constantly taken on road trips , I ca n't even remember all of the things I 've done to it . All I can tell you is it still works . The best thing about the 6C is that it is lighter and thinner than the 6D but still is big enough and bright enough to get the job done . I even bought one for my best friend to keep in his truck . To keep it working well you should occasionally apply a small mount of Vaseline to the threads to keep the threads and O - rings lubricated . If you do that it should last you a long time .
5 #### I do n't know if my old can opener was a complete POS , but this opener is so much nicer . Easy to turn handle and great price . I would recommend this product .
4 #### Got this for my son for Christmas since I have one and he keeps trying to burn his house down making popcorn on the stove . Quick , easy cleanup with just a wipe of the lower portion and a swish of soapy water for upper lid . Loses a star due to the butter melter thing on top . Butter just kinda hung up in there and made a mess . Natures way of telling me I do n't need butter , I guess .
5 #### Just like all Freud router bits that I have purchased , excellent quality . That 's why I buy only Freud , Whiteside , and sometimes Amana .
5 #### My small house plants winter under this . They love it . Arrived quickly and in perfect condition . Could n't be happier .
5 #### Great Knife , small enough to carry daily . Very sturdy design .
4 #### Amazingly effective getting mice . I hate having to kill them , but they were tearing up my attic and eat my clothes . I also have a hard time setting spring traps and retrieving the poor dead corpses is even worse . You just tip this into the trash - you do n't even really need to look at it . Did n't catch a darn rat though , but then neither did spring traps as that rat was smart !
3 #### I really like the sizes , easy to use and easy to clean . I like making snacks , and dinner depending on the mood .
5 #### I believe this is the third Mighty Mite I have purchased , and I absolutely love them . The suction is extremely strong , and the canister is lightweight . I now have one for my upstairs and one for the downstairs . One of my favorite products !
5 #### Love this feeder ! Worked great for me ! Will order again just to have a second in hand !
5 #### They feel strange at first , as there is an odd grip pivot / ratchet action , but you quickly get used to it . They seem tough - have held up well for 3 months . They are sharp and the quality of the materials it top notch . I was worred about the plastic gear but they seem extremely beefy . As a mechanical engineer I am knocked out by the novel nature of the action . Some one had a real brainstorm on the mechanism . Hats off to mechanical engineer that came up with this system . Bottom line is ' strong value for the money ' .
5 #### Do n't go with a cheaper version . This is an excellent and very flexible hose.l
4 #### the right tool for the right job love using the tool
5 #### Did some kitchen chairs reupholstering . Worked easily . I have tendonitis but was able to use this without pain . Would buy again
2 #### Do n't buy it . The center is raised . Waste of money .
2 #### I 've sprouted a long time . I am a sprouting madman . I usually buy from wheatgrasskits.com or sprout people , and have always had great luck . These ones from Todd 's are not as good as the broccoli seeds I 've bought in the past . The germination is not as good as I have had in the past , but after working out the kinks with my new trays , I think my previous review was a little harsh .
3 #### I installed this for a neighbor . The kit itself is supposed to be complete . But what I received was missing one of two screws to hold the faceplate and seal in place . The second issue I had with it is that the instructions to attach it to siding are poor - it was loose when installed as directed . Finally , I think it should be anchored from the top and bottom for a siding installation - instead of having screw holes for one side only . I also think the instructions should indicate that it should be caulked after installation to completely keep water out . Overall , the product is satisfactory , but I had to modify it to install securely with no leaks on vinyl siding .
5 #### Sturdy , works well , good whistle volume ( and you can leave it " up " to turn off the whistle if you like ) . I 'd definitely buy this one again .
5 #### The clamps make adjusting for install an easy job , I have other brands but needed to do a big job with a large number of cabinets . I purchased these and they work so good for predrill and even screwing face frames while the clamp is on , a feature not on the others . Bottom line doing cabinet installs get them , the most difficult part sticking on the no mar pads .
5 #### This strainer has a very fine mesh , as was noted by another reviewer , so I decided to try it . I was SO pleased to fine a utensil with a fine enough mesh to be able to wash and rinse quinoa , since it 's a very tiny granular grain that slips through most other strainer screens . Previous to buying the Oxo strainer , I had resorted to lining my other mesh strainer with coffee filters , which worked , but was a real pain to get the grain off the filter . The mesh on this one also seems to be stiffer than some other models of strainers . I have had to discard several other strainers of a similar type , that have had the screen crumple and pull away from the framework , over the years . I am very happy with this item .
5 #### I have small potted plants and this trowel works great for me . Durable and easy to handle , it 's a great addition to anyone 's gardening toolkit .
4 #### Gets misshapen easily , but it 's also easy to bend back . Works fine . Ca n't beat the price .
5 #### Completely love this 17 " splitting axe . I wanted something for me to break down logs or plants of wood into manageable kindling - and this does the job perfectly . Good weight head and a light handle which feels secure in your hand as has a bit at the end to ensure wo n't fly out of your grasp . A couple of other makes have similar axes and may be a same parent company - but I trust Fiskars to have quality blades on all their tools and so would recommend this as a reliable tool .
4 #### I was so happy to find an affordable insect killer living in a place that is infested with mosquitos every summer . I hung the Flowtron next to my chicken coop and near the above - ground pool where I am certain there was plenty . I loved turning it on every evening to hear those mosquitos get zapped away . I can say that I saw an obvious reduction of pests in my backyard , but they were n't completely gone . I used an old dry toothbrush to clean the metal grate when it would get blocked up with carcasses . But many did end up on the ground and I think my chickens enjoyed the treat when I let them roam . I wish there was a way for the cicadas to not meet their death in there as it sounds very scary when they are frying in there . I did not give it 5 stars because the product arrived broken . Some of the plastic on the bottom was broken off and was unable to fix , but it did not effect the functionality of the zapper , so I did not return it .
5 #### Exact replacement for my trimmer . Very happy with it and the price was very good .
5 #### Bought this so I could have a longer leader hose on my hose reel . I did have to use it with a male - to - female coupler because it has one female end and one male end , and hose reel leader hoses for some reason have two female ends . Worked fine after solving that little glitch .
5 #### I have 3 each scarecrows and it does work . I used to have cats come into my yard and do there business and not any more . I have even sprayed people with the scarecrow when the walk within range of the motion detector .
5 #### I like the base . I have a hitachi m12v mounted to it . No flex whatsoever in the plate . It is very rigid and does not bow . The included hardware is good , but I did not care much for the nylon raisers . I bought # 10 24 - thread , machine screws to replace these . Just a preference , not mandatory . Comes with a start pin for table routing smaller piece with no fence . The snap in rings are strong and rigid . They snap in real tight . I found that if you use your router bit wrench you can pop them out real easy without maring them by just sliding the blunt rounded tip of the end of the wrench in and using the opposite side of the ring to snap it out . Works really smooth . You can not fab one for cheaper using the same materials ... its a no brainer to get it- Jason
4 #### I generally buy metal fittings and couplers when I can but this was for a yard hose which I use and move around less frequently . I had some concerns the plastic would strip when screwing it tight to compress the hose , but I was pleasantly surprised . Been using these now for a few months and I really ca n't complain . Metal is best but these cost less than half the price and have held up very well so far .
4 #### I have many , many saws and several mitre boxes . Although this my least expensive one I find I use this nifty little combination quite frequently . No , I would n't use it for cabinet work , but when I need to do a quick job I find the cam operated clamps and the lip that holds it against the edge of a workbench a real boon . I used it this afternoon while building a chicken coop . I 'd buy it for the cams alone and am thinking it might be worth drilling holes in the base of a better quality wood constructed box to use these useful little chaps . On the downside it is flimsy and there is too much slop for a high degree of accuracy , but for the money it really has its uses . Weigh up what for you want to use it ; read some of the other reviews and you may decide it 's for you !
5 #### Caught a lot of flys . I have it kinda close to the back door so you can smell it sometimes . But does n't bother me . Its been hanging awhile and I still see new flies inside . I have noticed there are way less flies in the house .
3 #### I have pinched my fingers in them several times but they work well for removing spent blossoms from our many pots and baskets of geraniums so I will keep using them .
5 #### Came as promised . We 're not in mosquito season yet , so we 'll see how effective it is . Crossing my fingers !
4 #### This is a replacement for an old one that finally wore out . The only draw back is he fact that you have to balance the head just right to keep the unit from tipping over . Other then that , this is a fine product to get light where you need it hands free .
5 #### This fire extinguisher arrived overnight ! Very pleasantly surprised because I was advised it would be a few extra days in shipping . I do n't know how to review something that I have n't used - and hope to never need to use . I will say that this extinguisher appears to be very good quality . The canister is sturdy , strong and well documents the procedure incase I need to use it . I keep it under my kitchen sink for easy access . This extinguisher is very affordable and something my family feels is extremely important to keep in our home .
5 #### Purchased as a gift . Item arrived on time and has so far been a hit with my brother .
3 #### This works really well , but is very flimsy and the dog destroyed it in hours . Hard to position , but would be a great product for a semi permanent location that needs extreme flexibility .
3 #### These were purchased to hopefully help our plants . So far so good , as long as I remember to use them .
5 #### Adds versatility to a Dremel tool when used with the workstation .
5 #### Powerful ! ! ! top quality . I use it with a foot switch and router style speed controller . get the speed right where you want it for the cutter , brush , stone , etc you are using . buy it ! TROG OUT !
3 #### The tool does a great job of cutting , but is a bit heavy to handle .
2 #### not the 20 " box fan I envisioned . Flimsy , ca n't stand up while on full without plastic legs that will eventually break . would advise to buy from walmart so you can see what you are getting I would never but this again .
5 #### Proxxon do n't have threaded collars . But the diameter allowed me to trim the 565D internal threads so that it fit snugly on the Proxxon and is functional . Great tool for small router type work . The cutting bits are alone worth the price .
5 #### This is a real nice durable zestier - grater . It has a good sized thick handle that feels good in the hand . A real nice feature it has is the rubber sleeves that wrap around the corners , it wo n't slip or slide around on what ever you are using it on . I 'm real glad I bought it .
4 #### I bought a pack of these a cpl of months back . They packaging was nice . So far so good . Will update when one fails .
1 #### It has already quit working , will not light up , I would not recommend this product to anyone .
5 #### I chose this product because the reviews on it . It is much better than delta bearings and guide block s that came with the saw . It was easy to install . Ripping and resawing is much better ..
5 #### This is great and looks good on my patio . I use it all the time . I have it hanging so I can see it from indoors or outdoors . The wind blew it down a few times and it 's still in great shape .
5 #### Very strong suction . Used on hardwood floors and area rugs . We do n't have any issue with winding the cord around the bottom . In fact , the automatic rewind on my old Mighty Mite which we used for about 15 years caused us concern when young children were around .
4 #### This compressor feels very sturdy . It came with one of its ' feet bent and I felt the packaging could be better . It has worked well so far . The compressor is heavy because it is mostly metal . It works well , comes with compressor oil but you 'll need to buy some quick couplings and teflon tape . I 've had this for a few years now and it has served me well . I 've used a framing nailer to built 2 sheds with it , I powered a finish nailer to install trim in my house and I used it to remodel my kitchen . Worked great so far . The only downside is the weight ( which is really not bad when compared to other compressors ) and some parts such as the regulator is cheaply made .
5 #### This is the soldering gun I 've always wanted . Very sturdy construction . Heats up quickly and does the job . Easy to tin the tip , comes with solder , flux , different tips and good instructions on how to use . The price was very very reasonable , better than any retail store and I had free shipping as well . I 'm thoroughly satisfied and pleased with the product the company that sold it to me and the total experience .
5 #### I am almost 70 year old and this is the best peeling I 've had !
4 #### I purchased one of these nailers last summer for a framing job . It operated flawlessly for the whole summer , and continues to do so this year . It is very light , and as a result of good design , can be used in relatively tight quarters . I like mine , and would recommend it to any experienced carpenter . Handy Dan
5 #### I was amazed how lightweight and strong this little shovel is . I needed something to use for transplanting in the house and outside and I love this tool for that . The dirt slides right off . I 'm going to order another one to put in my camping stuff for digging in the hard ground for tent stakes . Definitely worth purchasing for those small digging jobs .
2 #### Freud is known for great quality in their router bits and certainly give Whiteside and other manufacturers a real run for their money . I ended up ordering two of this set before I finally gave up and bought a matched pair from another manufacturer . The first set was returned for a chipped rail cutter caused by the bit being loose inside the manufacturer 's packaging . Amazon quickly replaced the set so I was really ready to go . I set up and cut test cuts in order to measure the current tenon / groove width . Using thin plywood for doors , I then calculated how much I needed to reduce the tenon and groove and proceeded to remove the shims as instructed . However , the bearing on the stile bit appeared to be nearly a press fit and I was unable to remove it and adjust the bit . So much for the close tolerance engineering . I also noted that there is a lot of height above the rail cutter .... it shows in the picture but when it is in your router table , you really notice it . I had to back the fence away , because of the fence - to - bit interference . Not a problem if you are just switching bits but if you are removing the top to do an extended tendon ... and instruction say to not move your fence , you may have a problem .
5 #### Its about time someone designed a book light that you can recharge . Not only is it very functional , its adorable . This 9 inch light clips onto your book , kindle , or sheet music , and gives you hours of surprisingly bright light . When it starts to die on you , pull the stem out of the clip , and plug it into your USB charge port on your computer . Wait a little , then its recharged . ( I do n't let mine discharge all the way . That way I can depend on it , if I 'm away from the computer when it runs out of power . ) The problem with these clip on book lights that I always had , is that I fall asleep when I read . The light would stay on for a few hours , wasting the batteries . Then , I could n't find the right round batteries for the light , or never put them in , etc . So this light will pay for itself , in batteries saved alone . Plus , you get a blue monkey , so there 's that too . I gave my honest opinion in this review in exchange for a promotional light .
3 #### This is the least expensive 8 " carbide stacked dado that I could find . I bought mine at a big - box store about a year ago . It replaced a 6 " steel stacked set that I bought a few years back . It was a big step up and , for a while I was satisfied with it despite the not - quite - flat bottom it left . Last week I needed to rabbet some pine molding . I did n't have a close look at the dado while I installed it on the arbor . Upon starting the cut , the workpiece vibrated violently as it passed into the dado . I stopped and examined the dado and discovered that the outboard blades were missing a total of six teeth . I 'm not sure when I lost the them , but the net result is that I 'm now looking for a new dado set as I do n't feel like investing $ 40 or $ 50 to have the teeth replaced . I 've gone back to doing rabbets with a tall fence and my Forrest Woodworker II blade which I just got back from being sharpened by Forrest . I think I 'm just going to have to bite the bullet and purchase a Forrest set as my experience with the WWII blade has been extremely satisfying .
5 #### Updating my review , adding that last star . After the first dose , my pond cleared considerably . After the second dose of this , along with the enzymes I use , it is totally clear of algae and I can see to the bottom . And the temps are steadily rising . Prime algae growing season . Once it no longer looked like pea soup , I was able to see my mosquito fish had quite a few babies and they were everywhere ! Not only did this not harm my turtles or giant goldifsh , the mosquio fish are fine , including tiny little babies that I am sure are extra sensitive . I am no longer going to use the pond blocks , they worked great for me last year , but this year it 's a no go . May have a different type of algae this year ? Who knows . This year has been very trying with my pond . What worked last year is not working this year and so far I am having a very hard time keeping my pond clear . I used this algeacide last week , and so far my pond has cleared up and looks pretty good . Watching it and will dose again when I can and will update if I notice any changes . So far I like it , and it did not harm any of my fish or the turtles .
5 #### I love these pressure cookers . Still using one given to me over 30 years ago . I purchased these as Christmas gifts for my married kids and they love them too .
5 #### Love this vegetable brush . I use it all the time now to scrub my veggies and potatoes .
5 #### Great hose . Like the white color for garage mounted hose stand .
5 #### Great for wood carving . It turns the angle grinder it a great creative woodworking tool .
5 #### Came timely and as described . Air handler seems to like them . So that 's a positive .
5 #### Great handle ( Plastic ) which is much better than appears on picture . I wish the " V " was a little sharper . this is a great buy thanks I used Weed Be Gone herbicide for a couple of years . this works much better .. The weed be gone does n't work as good as they say or we have tougher weeds than elsewhere(doubtful ) I have weeded lawn for about 3 times and took 30 minute each . Almost no dandelions left !
5 #### I bought this one as a wedding shower gift but I have the same model that I have used for years . It holds up nicely and you can put it in the dishwasher . It can be used for more than just lettuce too .
5 #### really like these I have used them alot they work great
5 #### I was reluctant to purchase these charcoal holders at first , mainly due to the cost and fear they would be cheaply constructed . Up to now I have been using inexpensive wire holders that are functional but not great . I was very pleasantly surprised when I purchased these Weber basket charcoal holders . They are solidly built , large in size ( designed for 22 - 1/2 " grills ) , and well worth the cost . Charcoal seems to heat up more rapidly in them , ash drops easily from the bottom , and you can empty the baskets easily after the coals have cooled . There is plenty of space between the baskets to put a foil pan with water to keep foods moist during indirect cooking . If you like to barbecue foods by the indirect method , these basket charcoal holders are perfect . I would buy them again in a second ( although they will probably last for a very long time ) .
5 #### My favorite lamp was out and my favorite room was dark . Like so many others here I went online to look for a replacement torchiere and discovered they do n't make them any longer . Finding this new switch and reading the reviews was really the best thing I 've come across on Amazon in a long time . It arrived quickly and I disassembled the lamp and spliced in the new wires and tested it . Bingo ! Reassembled the lamp and we 're ready to go . The replacement assembly was slightly different that the new one but I just matched wire to wire ( printed wire to printed / ridged wire to ridged ) and all was well . As other have mentioned this does n't come with wire nuts . I only had two that were small enough and you 'll need four . I soldered and taped the other connection rather than going out to the store . Thank you Amazon community and Angelo Brothers for giving me my 30 year old lamp new life .
3 #### Ordered two for my travel trailer for proper protection , only to be notified that they are under a manufacturer recall . Now I will not use my trailer until I receive replacements from the manufacturer !
3 #### Personally , I like it except , it would be nice if the handle had a grip . My big hands find it a little small . Now , my wife , does n't like it at all . She would like to see the handle being a little shorter . She thinks it awkward being so long . Guess I will have to saw the handle shorter and put a rubber handle around it .
5 #### This is one of the best pry bars for trim I have ever used . They sell a 2 pack ( two sizes ) as well that I usually purchase . I have more of these stolen by employees than I care to mention . Stainless steel thin and durable , an absolute must have for a trim carpenter or any trade for that matter .
5 #### this cover is very nice for the money . What else is there to say except mine did not look like the picture . It was not translucent like the one in the photo . Mine was solid black with elastic on the bottom to hold it tight around grill . Nice .
4 #### Huge time saver . Not as precise as a Jang but for 15 % of the cost of a Jang it serves my needs just fine . Beets and radishes will need thinning .
3 #### I was super excited about these , until I realized the magnets were not strong enough to be used on my magnetic whiteboard . Sad .
5 #### Part of an extension cord from my 220 generator to my welder .
5 #### Have a shop vac to use to vacuum the furniture and hard to reach places . These extensions make places that could n't be reached easily a piece of cake to clean .
1 #### Like trying to make jewelry with an axe . Slow to heat up , as in very ... like no settings , just a trigger . The unit cools when the trigger is released . Probably would be ok to put a big glob on trailer wires for example ... nothing requiring any finesse . Maddening . Have had this for years and just dropped it into the Good Will bin ... Buying a Weller WES51 .
4 #### I prefer stainless steel for most of my kitchen utensils and this fit the bill . I own a bunch of OXO products as they tend to be pretty good so this was just one more to the set . Pros : -Sturdy and good weight -Stainless steel ( no rust ) -Easy to clean ( dishwasher safe ) -Does not bend easily Cons : -None I would recommend this to anyone needing solid , long lasting whisk for their kitchen .
1 #### The cover has a mesh strip in the front and back . I 'm not sure what they are for but if your grill sits out in the open , the mesh allows water , dust and whatever to get inside the cover . One of the reasons I bought the Genesis Gold B was because of the enclosed area under the grill . The first rain came right thru the mesh and everything inside the enclosed area was soaked . The same thing with dust . I 'm trying duct tape over the mesh areas . If this will not work , it will be new cover time ! Very dissapointed with the cover but the grill is great !
4 #### It gets near daily use for tea and I also use it occasionally for herbs in soups and stews . I like the stainless steel . It cleans up nicely in the dishwasher . The mesh will hold on to small bits if you 're not careful , but that 's just because it 's a fine mesh . The mesh part looks a bit battered these days , but again , that 's just a quality of the mesh . If you like fine teas , it 's just the thing . Initially , I found the chain a little loose , but I just squeezed it together better with my fingers and have n't had a problem since . It goes through the dishwasher well , but I often wash by hand since I 'm just going to use it again immediately anyway . The stainless steel looks better when it goes through the dishwasher , though .
4 #### Suction cups do n't work so well but it serves it 's purpose . I would probably go with a different design but in not unhappy with it . I think my sink is n't shaped well for this design .
5 #### This has been one of the best tolls I have purchased for my shop .
1 #### Book arrived in perfect condition . However , it 's not much of a book .
5 #### this is the way to make scroll work easier by putting the work right at your fingertips without taking up precious bench space .
5 #### Same as other Vise - Grips , but with the extended jaws that are used for welding clamps . Nice quality tool for this type work .
4 #### These are fun to have on the fridge . I have about five boxes on my fridge - a variety of words . I have a teenager and there are teenagers at my house all the time . It 's fun to see what they 've written - they are very imaginative .
4 #### This is a pretty good square , but there was some untrimmed flashing that I had to file off for it to function properly .
3 #### First rule of internet purchasing : know your qualities and QUANTITIES ! I have used this product for two years with great success . However , when I re - ordered , I noticed that the price was lower ...... MUCH lower than expected . Smaller bottle ; I got shtuckled .
5 #### I love this peeler . It is the best peeler . I will be buying two more because it works so well .
5 #### A great plane , once honed , removes material cleanly . A nice and useful addition to your tool cabinet . I would highly recommend .
5 #### It seems to be very good quality and I like the fact that the blade is replaceable . Good Christmas gift !
5 #### I own four of these and would be lost without them . They are excellent for moving my drill press , band saw , planer , and jointer .
5 #### I use these primarily for flipping fries and searing the edges of steaks . While both those tasks can be done with other tools , this seems like a far more elegant and controllable one . Having a tiny kitchen , I was iffy about getting another contraption , but I find this an invaluable addition . The locking mechanism is simple and useful , I 've never had a problem with the non - slip grips , the scalloped edges are great for grip , and the tension is just right ( at least for me ) for getting the job done . Now , of course , I have no experience with alternative designs , so this should be taken with a grain of salt .
5 #### My knife is now almost 4 years old and is as nice today as when I bought it . I use it for any cutting chore in the kitchen and it has stayed very sharp . You can pay more but why would you ?
1 #### I bought this kettle in September of 2009 , so I 've had it for about 1 1/2 years ... not veryt long for an expensive tea kettle . Today I flipped up the whistle and the whistle " innards " flew all about . There are two tiny parts , a screw and a spring , both rusted out , which could easily have gone unnoticed back into the teakettle and have been a choking hazard . As it is there is no way to reinstall the whistle part and I 'm lucky I found the spring , tenuously hanging from the spout cover , before it dropped back into the pot . Beautiful to look at , but it should n't have failed in this way and so soon after purchase .
5 #### Item arrived on time and as described ; truly a high quality product . Would recommend and would for sure purchase again as it is very well made
5 #### I use this car to replant Earthbox containers . Handy to cart my supplies and tools to the location on the deck and then sit at the same level of the planter . After 2 seasons it still looks new . Everything is still sturdy .
4 #### Easy to set up and use . Seems it would be easy to clean . However , as I have n't caught anything in it as yet , I ca nt say for sure . The fact that I have n't caught anything is why only 5 stars . Several mornings the light indicated that it had been triggered , but there was nothing inside . To be fair , we evacuated for hurricane Irma , and I had packed it up , and have n't put it back out . I will be doing that this weekend , and hopefully will trap the rodent visiting my yard at night .
5 #### Tool makes removing cylinders from Kwikset locks a breeze . Easier than struggling with screw drivers to remove the lock cylinder . If you need to rotate the cylinder 180 degrees for positioning the key properly in the lock , this tool will make your life much easier getting the cylinder out . Too bad Kwikset never thought of including this tool in the lock set , or making it part of an installation kit .
5 #### Seems like Gilmour has been slowly diminishing the quality of their Flexogen line ; they 're not as kink - proof as they used to be . Still better than all the others in the category ( ca n't speak to the things that cost double and triple the price , as I do n't feel like shucking out close to $ 100 to see if it makes a difference ) . I 'll be buying more of these , since I have a lot of yard to get around , and this continues to be my first choice of hose . It will kink , but it is , as its name suggests , very flexible , and never feels like I 'm trying to wrestle a python when it 's time to coil it back up . I also like the neutral grey color ; it does n't stand out on the crushed gravel and flagstone walks surrounding planted areas and the driveway .
2 #### I 've used this model Gilmour hose - end sprayer and I 've also used the model with the teal - colored handle . This one costs a bit more , but it 's worth the extra cash as both its construction and design is superior to its cheaper cousin . For example , I found that the point of connection on the cheaper unit was a veritable Achille 's heel ie as I walked , the hose tended work loose fairly easily and , of course , as soon as the seal was broken , I 'd get an unwanted ' shower ' . That mishap did n't happen once when I sprayed my 1/2 acre lawn with the 362 Pro . UPDATE : 2.17.17 : I paid $ 19 for this item 2.5 years ago & now it 's going for $ 50 ? ? If you want this type hose - end sprayer , check out the Chapin G362 model . As far as I can tell , it 's virtually identical to the Gilmour unit and is available for $ 20 ! !
5 #### This is the perfect filter . I was simply unable to get this size at the store . Great to find it on Amazon .
5 #### We got these for a stocking gift and I seem to grab them every time I open the drawer next to the stove . Stir fry , turning foods of any kind on the grill , and last night , I reached in and safely took two baked potatoes from the oven . Quick , fast , easy to clean . The locking feature keeps them closed in the drawer so they are n't always tangled . OXO did it again with these tongs ... get them ! You 'll love them .
5 #### I have serveal and I use it on my water system for the flowers , garden , and other bushes and grass . I like them over the others I have seen . It is really to bad that they discontinued them in that case I hope these never wear out .
5 #### Purchased three ( 3 ) exterior lights , very attractive looking , easy to install , perfect for garage , patio or walkway . Using 5 watt led bulbs , plenty of light for security purposes . Highly recommend .
5 #### This spatula is so thin and flexible it works unbelievably well at getting under an omelet . I 've tried several spatulas , a few of which I purchased at the same time as this one in an attempt to find one that would work well for this task . I definitely found what I was looking for with this one . It works better than I could have imagined . I 'm going to buy another one or two just to have some spares around .
4 #### I have n't needed this . But it is nearly impossible to find someone to sharpen reel lawn mowers .... so I 'm glad I have it . Since I have n't used it its is hard to review . but after watching the lawn mower sharpened professionally , this kit looks like I can handle the job myself .
1 #### Worthless ! Caught 0 wasps in my barn and there were 100 or so to trap . Save your money and time and use something else .
5 #### It is very easy to set up a guide tells you which blades and which shims to use to get what width cut .
5 #### OXO products are of great quality . Simply put , OXO products are must haves in your kitchen . Each tool is designed to do a job and does it well . This baby is no exception . This is my second peeler and it wo n't be my last . Do n't worry my little peeler ... daddy will come and find you again ...
5 #### This is the easiest way to catch and kill mice ever ! I love it ! ! !
5 #### Great price , reasonable finish and just the right size . They are the masters at making these ; I call all tongue and groove pliers b the name " Channellock " for a reason ...
3 #### I thought I was ordering a silicone whisk , my mistake .
5 #### i just bought a backup for the same model that we 've been using each winter for five years . I bought it just in case our old one fails , and because this is such an excellent little performer . We set it up each winter in a large foam plant saucer , with the cord weighted down with a small stone . We 've never had any issues with it doing its job , and the birds , chipmunks , etc . are grateful .
2 #### Its not universal . It did n't fit on my " Dewalt Miter Saw . "
1 #### I bought 2 of these because I eat a lot of apples and pears . Both of them split on the sides within 6 months . These OXO units ' look ' like they are sturdier , better quality than other plastic units , but they are n't . If you use a corer / divider on a regular basis , do n't waste your money on these ; go for an all stainless steel unit instead .
5 #### Forget about poison worms and poison smoke . This trap is the most effective solution for getting rid of moles . Follow the directions posted by Mr. Klos . I fed this mole a lot of Tomcat and Talprid and I think he liked it and just got bigger and more energetic . Finally put this trap on a piece of straight run and Mr. Mole was history in less than 24 hours . With the money I wasted on the poison worms , I could have bought 10 traps , but only need this one . Not saying the poison is ineffective , it 's just not verifiable . This method is - dead mole .
5 #### This is a well built unit ... my only complaint is .. I bought it because it was stainless steel rather than aluminum , but the drain insert is made of aluminum ! I love it anyway and I am glad I got the 4 quart instead of the 6 as I am an older woman and when you fill this unit with food it is about all the weight I can handle . I am glad it has a handle opposite the main handle which makes it easier to lift . I am glad I bought this item ... I use it 2 to 5 times a week because it is a quick , healthy way to cook . This is a good buy ! ! !
5 #### Ten for the price of one . It is a no brainer . They work perfect . Even if they should have a shorter life , it wo n't be so short that it would make be buy a single bulb for more money from the local hardware store . So far , it is still burning bright .
2 #### I bought this item with a new deep fryer and was excited to try this cutter . The first potato would not go through the cutter . Not enough leverage torque to push potato through . By cutting potato in half , I could get it through the cutter blades . So if you like 2.5 " french fries , this cutter is for you . I like long fries and will be looking for a different cutter . Not worth the effort to send back so will put in my spring tag sale !
5 #### Used to trim some leaves from recent outdoor plant I had . Worked great , comfortable to use , pointed tip makes for easy snipping of small stems and it 's slim design helps not pick up anything you might have on the leaves . Highly recommended .
5 #### This is as helpful as can be and the magnets backing is strong and stays on my refrigerator
5 #### Title says it all . We 've bought more expensive brushes at the local hardware store which shed . These stay put use after use . It feels good to buy a quality product .
3 #### This fan is good , it 's quiet for it 's size , but it 's BIG ! I have it in a very large room ( about 900 sf ) and the issue I 've notice is that is sucks a lot of heat out of the room , which is not a good thing in the winter . Also , it sits on the sill ( not like an air conditioner ) so it 's a bit precarious when it comes to securing in the window without the screws . All the other fans I 've had break quite frequently , are hard to clean , and for those reasons , this fan is better . But it is very very large .
4 #### So ... I 'm probably the most oblivious person possible - but I thought this was about cats when I bought it for a present . so if anyone out there is as dense as me ( doubtful ) be forewarned it 's * thinly * veiled sexual innuendo .
5 #### The problem with hauling a wheel barrow , a green waste container or a plastic bin up & down stairs ( we live on a hill ) while it 's full of leaves is that the item holding the leaves is always heavy . Then it gets heavier when it 's full of leaves & garden debris . I would bump , bump , bump the wheel barrow up the back stairs to the street & it was exhausting . This is so light - weight , it does the job with very little effort . I just grab the handles & go . I love it !
5 #### another Stanley product that is easy to use and last forever . is covered by lifetime warranty it is a tool of many uses in addition to prybar
5 #### Nice quality and weight ! Handle could be thicker but its sharp and I ca n't wait to try it !
4 #### This product is okay . It is not very heavy duty . It slices Yukon gold potatoes with lots of effort . I 'm sure that it would n't be able to slice a harder potato and I 'm not going to try because it feels as if it may break with to Yukons . But for the price I 'm satisfied .
5 #### Arrived timely , package in good condition and now I have millions of large worms . Great for my garden , I am planning to invite a few of these worms to a fishing party . I was impressed with the proliferation of these worms .
2 #### VERY LIGHT WEIGHT , almost flimsey . Save over half , buy from Harbor Freight if you must . Most all products , " BIG HORN " , are available from Harbor Freight at half price or less ! ! !
1 #### Only reason I gave 1 star is because there is no 0 ! Gauges are plastic from China . Not calibrated you will have to adjust all 3 . Wood is Fischer pice play school quality . Price tag should be $ 5 . I 'm returning .
5 #### Works perfect ! Definitely the best peeler I 've probably ever owned . I heard this brand was good for kitchen utensils & it did not disappoint . Would definitely recommend !
1 #### What a waste of time . I tried slicing carrots into julienne slices like it shows on the packaging which does n't work AT ALL . This is false advertising at its worst . These are the problems I ran into doing so : * The julienne slicer falls out of place after each push and has to be re - adjusted * The plastic is so flimsy that you have to hold the whole thing together on front and back ends while you are slicing anything * The julienne blades do n't cut the carrot all the way through unless you are putting zero pressure on the pusher in which case you 'll end up chopping up your fingers when it skips * The pusher ca n't get close enough to slice more than 2/3 of the carrot width - wise * The carrot gets funky holes on the last part from the pusher I suppose this unit could be alright as a basic slicer , but in that case I 'd just use my food processor instead . I knew this thing would be cheap and something just to sort of get by until I bought a more expensive unit , but I ended up with something USELESS . Anyone who recommends this unit has no experience with a moderately sharp kitchen knife .
5 #### I waited for a while before I wrote the review - had the lights installed in the kitchen fixtures now for a couple of months . With teenagers in the house , our lights are on a lot - AND on / off a lot ! These have outlasted the ones that came from the fixture manufacturer . Great price , great quality - yes , I 'd buy them again if and or when I need more !
4 #### Everything should be non stick . This thing is really heavy duty , too . Surprisingly , it does n't weigh much considering how substantial it is .
3 #### Based on the other reviews , I hoped I would be able to use this unit to wash my house . Although it reaches the very top floor , it does not have enough power to remove the mildew . I 've been reading and that may be related to my water pressure . I can use it for a good rinse or applying detergent but it does not have enough power to remove the soften stains once the detergent has dissolved the grim . I may use it later this year to spray my fruit trees . It looks like it will handle that job much better .
4 #### I was surprised by the size of this spoon rest , but it works well . It 's more than 10 " long and more than 5 " wide , and is shallower than the picture appears . It does it 's job though , and wo n't break like ceramic / porcelain ones .
5 #### Great tool for working around small shrubs and tight spaces along buildings walls etc . The extendable feature gives the extra reach for behind and under larger shrubs .
5 #### great mower and just right for trimming in the hard places .
5 #### These are the exact bulbs that I 've been paying triple the price for locally . I was a little hesitant to order them , since a lot of the review said they arrived broken . I 'm glad I gave it a chance , because I had no problem with the packaging . All of the bulbs worked and not one of them was broken . I would definitely purchase them again !
4 #### This is perfect for hardwood floors and cleaning the furniture . We have it at our beach house and use it there extensively as there is a lot of sand tracked in on a daily basis . I agree with previous reviews that it DOES run hot and the hose is pretty cheap quality despite its long length . We 've owned the unit for at least 5 years and other than bag changes , it has required no other maintenance . This machine would n't work well on wall to wall carpeting because there 's no powernozzle but we use the Sanitaire upright for the bedrooms with the carpeting so it 's a non - issue .
5 #### I have so little faith in this type of product , but other reviewers seemed to think this ThermaCELL contraption worked for them , so I tried it . Our back porch is my favorite place to write , but bugs have run me off so many times I considered going to all the expense and trouble of screening it in . I figured before going through all that , I 'd try ThermaCELL . Okay , first it takes maybe 15 minutes to start being effective ... and it has a slight odor to it ( but not repugnant or anything ) ... and it gets slightly warm ( but not enough to burn you or anything like that ) . Now , for the good news . I wanted to not believe in this thing , I really did . I 'm a natural born skeptic with gadgets and gizmos that seem to sell more snake oil than anything else . But I put this thing on and there 's no more pesky bugs around ! No mosquitoes ( and mosquitoes skip lunch to come dine on my blood ) , no little pesky no see ums , no flies ... Nothing . I used this on the back porch 5 or 6 times before my wife came out one night and remarked about how there were no bugs that night . I smiled and held up my ThermaCELL contraption . One last thing ... it 's not really cheap - as the replacement butane cartridges and repellent sticks are a little expensive . But they are WORTH IT ! Because they work . I 'm a skeptic ... yet I 'm convinced .
5 #### Product is as described and so far so good , no problems with install ; pins are sturdy . Bulbs seem to be of a better quality than what is offered at the local hardware big box stores . Huge bang for your buck , good value , bulbs have not blown out and will probably last longer than the expensive bulbs that were previously purchased at local hardware store . Will definitely purchase this again in the future when needed . September 2014 - Ok had to update my review , Bulb completely blew out and shattered particles everywhere , will not buy this product again and will be discarding the remainder of the unused bulbs for safety reasons ( NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES ) . This bulb was used in a bathroom light fixture , will be going back to buying the box store brand , since past experience has shown that it is safer to use because it did not explode when it burnt out . Furthermore after reading various materials on exploding bulbs , we are planning to entirely replace the current bathroom fixture that utilize the halogen bulb with one that does not . On a positive note , we were very grateful that no one was physically seriously injured because had they had been standing directly at the vanity at the time the bulb exploded , it probably would have been a totally different story !
5 #### I was surprised at how thin the metal was on this . But upon using , I realized the flexible spring steel is actually a key part of this pie server 's functionality . It is firm vertically for cutting , but flexible laterally when scooping into the pie . It 's nothing beautiful but works like a charm .
4 #### Nice tools have used Klein for years . but the tools pricing is getting to high . the competition is of equal quality for less $ $
5 #### Love them and they usually last me a few years .
4 #### I have had one of these for years and just ordered another one . I like that the silicone bends a bit but not too much . The the spatular is curved so it scraps bowls well . It does what a spatula should do . Why other ones do n't have this simple design is strange .
5 #### This magnetic driver works great for easy change outs . I use it daily with repairs around the garage and house .
5 #### This trap worked really well last year , and the ones I saved from last April are already full after two days ! Best trap I have ever tried for my apple tree .
5 #### Great price . fast shipping . If you are doing wood projects then you have to get titebond its just the best . I am very new to the woodworking projects but everyone that I have talked to told me to buy this .. so I did . and its great .
5 #### Works really well . Makes perfectly round pancakes and they cook evenly . These are perfect for kids breakfast / snacks .
5 #### fold able garbage can , just line it and go ! ( they want 12 more words to review ? why why why why )
5 #### Does n't seem like much for the money , but it works well . While working with nuts & bolts I spend less time looking for where I put them and segregating them helps . Glad I have it .
5 #### I got by husband one of these for Christmas as a gag gift . A few days later he used it to zap a huge spider and the sparks were cool but I think it was the sizzling sound that really amused him . He grinned like a devilish 10 year old and proclaimed that this was the neatest gift that he had ever received . ( Is n't it always that way ? Spend hundreds of dollars on thoughtfully planned gifts and it 's the $ 10.00 toy that steals the show ... ) I also got one for my mom , who rarely likes anything I get her and she told me right off that she did n't like it . She likes it now , after using it to kill a scary wasp . Also got one for an elderly family friend who is only partially ambulatory . My mom said that he , " Wo n't be able to use that , " but his wife reports that he keeps it beside his recliner and takes flies out in mid - air . ( Another 10 year old ... ) You do need to press both buttons at the same time in order for it to work , which is a safety precaution . I would n't get it for real 10 year olds but do highly recommend it for second - time - around 10 year olds .
5 #### Nothing bad to say about it ... easy to assemble ... cuts the grass well . Thus we may know that there are five essentials for victory : 1 He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight . 2 He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces . 3 He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks . 4 He will win who , prepared himself , waits to take the enemy unprepared . 5 He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign .
1 #### sticky feeling handle , which to me harbors a lot of germs . Weird plastic made in China out of I do n't know what . I do n't like it---- wanted to return it but Amazon would have charged me $ 6.95 just to drop it at their return locker when they sent me two items first class for less than $ 3.00 . Not very happy about all this , donated the whisk to the Goodwill and bought a nice wood handle one on Ebay .
5 #### These are much better than the cheap no - name ones from the big box stores
3 #### I used this grill for about 4 years and it has held up very well . It is very light weight , compact , and well built so it will last a long time . It cooks fairly evenly except for the left rear corner ( ignitor side ) , which seems to be the hottest area but you can use that to your advantage by sticking the biggest item there . My issues with the grill : With anything over a slight breeze I have to fight to keep it lit . I would block as much wind as possible with coolers and such but it would still blow out frequently . The handles are n't very well insulated so after grilling for a while they get very hot . The ignitor is held in place by a metal bracket , which gets blistering hot . This becomes a problem when the grill blows out and you have to re - light it . All in all , it is a good grill with a few flaws . It is well worth the price and performs well for grilling at home or while camping . Just keep a set of oven mitts nearby if you are going to be grilling for a while !
5 #### I bought a cheap peeler at the grocery that looked like the OXO peeler . It even peeled stuff . Then ... then I used my sister 's OXO peeler . Night and day . So I threw the cheap peeler in the yard sale box and bought this . Buy this , you 'll love it .
5 #### I have been given samples of teas over the years but never tried them because while I wanted to drink the flavored water , i did n't want to ingest the fallout in the cup . I 've seen these at others ' homes and wanted it myself . I love it . The mesh is tightly woven enough that little leaks out into the tea but is large enough to make a tea however strong you want . Either with this ball or with the teas I would prefer suggestions about how much to use . The latch closes tightly . Cleanup is n't the greatest but it 's something I can deal with . No more teabags here , I 'll just use this . I 've ordered two more of these , one to take to work and one I plan to use while cooking , adding herbs I want in a dish but not a part of , like coriander or bay leaves . WARNING : I believe this item was an add - on , having to be added to another , more expensive order . Since then , this company did n't do that anymore . My second order was from someone else , neither Amazon nor Prime eligible . I ordered it at the beginning of January with a shipping date ( something that can not be tracked by carrier ) sometime after January 31 . I have not received it . It may be beneficial to look elsewhere , either locally or online . If you ever get this item , it 's wonderful .
4 #### This scoop has a nice edge to it that lets the scoop dig down deep no matter how hard your ice cream is . The no - slip grip on the handle is easy to grasp and not nearly as thick as some I have tried . I would of given it the full 5 stars if I could make it scoop out perfect balls of ice cream but either there is a trick to it that I have n't discovered yet or my ice cream is frozen too hard . All things considered , this is a quality item that will get lots of use in most kitchens .
4 #### It is a good hose reel . I have bought three of these . I recently bought a more expensive one , click here : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FJF8P8?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage This one is the best one that I have ever owned and i recommend it more than this one . It costs more , but you get what you pay for and it looks a lot better as you can not see the hose reel . It has a petitioner that guides the hose across the reel to evenly roll the hose up .
5 #### Nice rewiring kit . Quite complete and fixed my lamp . Five stars !
4 #### Definitely great for the money . Very very short and cut through drywall with ease . Would definitely recommend for the price of the tool
4 #### This is a nice hose for a very good price . It 's rubber so it 's easy to work with because it has little memory . There are better hoses out there that have no memory but they cost a lot more . The hose I 'm replacing with this was a pvc hose and it was impossible to roll up .
1 #### Unless I just happened to get a really horrible defective unit - this product is terrible . leaks from the top where it has the part that turns it on or off ( not the places you connect it to the pipe ) so there is nothing you can do about it . I had the original U25 before and it was fine , but assuming I could replace it with the U25E was apparently wrong , and I ended up with a similar style Whirlpool unit instead . After getting really really soaked in cold water , a lot , in the middle of winter .
5 #### I 've had two of these in my shed for a week now and have collected 8 dead mice . It works , period . I had purchased an ultrasonic unit to deter the mice . Well , that is installed and on right above these traps and I am still getting mice . So , the noise emitting device is useless and this works !
5 #### i got this gift for a friend and she love it love the designs its a perfect gift for a birthday
5 #### I ca n't believe I did n't know this existed ! It 's marvelous ! We 've had ours for a while now and it works so well you honestly ca n't believe it . Your hands will never wreak of garlic again . It washes easy and really just needs a rinse when you 're done , although we throw ours in the dishwasher . If you use fresh garlic , you wo n't regret this buy .
4 #### From my reserch , this is the best mole trap out there . It does work for me but took lots of trial and error to figure out how to set it correctly . I bought two , one worked perfectly , but one had too much powder coat on the trigger pan to release properly . Do n't be afraid to use pliers on it to adjust the release/ trigger pan lip to set the release force . And make sure the legs pass each other when released , one leg was slightly bent striking the other on one . What I found works best for Pacific NW moles was to dig the trap hole just barely large enough for the trap . No loose dirt on ends of trap . Clear the mole tunnel of all loose dirt with a spoon and pack the bottom solid so he does n't dig around in the soft dirt . I used sod to cover the trap with NO dirt back fill in the hole like the instructions say . Once I found a main tunnel to set it in , its deadly !
5 #### A very nice addition to my PC router . With this , I can see much more of what I 'm working on .
5 #### I think Klein invented this tool . My Dad had a pair when I was a kid - and now I 'm an old man . They would easily be a ' lifetime ' tool except for one thing : construction workers know they are the best but do n't want to pay the premium to have the best . So they steal them . I finally had to quit buying $ 60 Klein spud wrenches because I could not lay one down and turn around without it disappearing . But I will always have at least one pair of Klein lineman pliers .
4 #### I bought a cheap " china " one and then went for the gold with the Dremel ( for my dremel ) . This was actually much more difficult to put on ! But it works wonderfully . Only gave it a 4 because of how hard it was to put on .
5 #### Very happy with purchase . Such an improvement over my old one !
4 #### This turner is very good for turning food in a skillet . I used it turn some sticky carmelized onions and it handled the batch very well . It also cleaned up the edge of the plastic turner I was using . I am going to try it on some more items in the near future .
4 #### We love it except for the zippers around the doors .... very tight where the joints are ... hard to zip past these joints ... in the future I feel these zippers will break or the screen netting and the plastic on the doors will give away as a result of the tension at these spots .... the manufacture should take this into consideration when they make it ..... add a little more fabric to the joints so the zipper glides easily over the joints rather than having so much stress or make the screening and plastic on the doors a bit larger .... definitely needs to be addressed ! ! ! The Plastic on the door is pulling away from the zipper ... which is not good because eventually the plastic will give way altogether . Very disappointed in this part of the greenhouse . Dawson 's of Michigan
5 #### My wife and I used this when we go to weekend getaways to cabins or to the beach where the local kitchen tools are n't always well equipped . It holds multiple knives of various shapes and sizes . I think 8 in total . The handles are held secure while a flap presses against the blades to hold them in place without the sharp blades cutting / destroying any seams . It wraps and holds secure . Overall very satisfied . I can not speak of the longevity of using it every day as we only use it occasionally .
5 #### These tongs are great . Locking so they do n't take up as much space in a drawer or in the dishwasher . I put on nylon cord loop at the end so they can hang from the side of my grill .
5 #### This new little wunderkind is worth its weight in gold . Not only arrived when you said , this NEW Eureka works really , really well . Thank you all for being great to work with ! Ding
5 #### My trailer came with the plastic light fixture covers but they finally bit the dust . Went to purchase one of these online to see how good they was instead of buying enough for all my fixtures . Its good quality easy to install . Only decided to buy one because i ended up finding them cheaper at my local hardware store couple days after ordering this one .
3 #### Do not purchase this product if the water connection fitting is metal ( as with diverter valves , etc . The unthreaded portion of the pipe is too short to properly seat a metal nut , and if there 's the slightest misalignment , will cross - thread . Unlike other reviewers , I 've had good luck with the product in toilets with plastic connectors , but destroyed two of them finding this design flaw the hard way .
5 #### Go to bowl in our household . Would highly recommend and buy again .
1 #### I hung this up at my lake house where my last one had hung for 3 years . The plastic face cover broke off in 2 months . Next summer I 'll look for one of better quality .
2 #### this bit lost it 's ability to hold bits way to soon after purchase . I do not recommend it .
5 #### I purchased this ( based on Cook 's Illustrated comparison of similar products ) . The " blade " portion of this turner is very , very flexible ( in on direction ) but will hold quite a load . Nice and thin and will get under just about anything - great for cookies !
5 #### Thing that surprises me is how expensive these can run . A sound pressure cooker is a sound pressure cooker -- not much too it . Never thought I 'd own one ( grew up with one -- home cooking ) , so thought I 'd try it myself . So you know , bought one at Walmart ( has the Wearever brand)-- $ 40.00 , and it comes with a real return policy vs. Amazon 's 30 day return policy ( make sure you read that before buying anything here ... surprising how inflexible they are if you miss it by only a few days , even for long standing customers who have never asked for any special preferences . )
5 #### Perfect , perfect , perfect ! I had use other bundt pan before , this is by far the best bundt pan I ever use .
5 #### Great product at the best price . I would recommend this over any other brand . My tomato plants love it .
3 #### Nice and shiny , but the handles are very thin and almost hurt your hands when used .. If handles were thicker , this would be a great product .
3 #### Just wanted to add my experience to others here who 've had their press break after about a year . The hinge breaks and is essentially un - repairable . However it 's comfortable and does a good job . So if you do n't mind spending ( dollar amount ) every year or so for a new one , this is a a good press .
5 #### This saw replaced my original Makita miter box that was 27 years old . This new one was actually cheaper than what I paid 27 years ago , and it is the same top quality that you would expect from Makita . Cuts dead on right out of the box . Paid for regular shipping and I received it in only 2days . Win , win all the way around
5 #### A good additive for plants at a reasonable price . I top dress house plants with it annually and it will last a year or so .
5 #### Growing up , my mother always used a pressure cooker for quick meals , but all I remember was her telling me to stay away from it or it would blow up ! Now that I am a busy grandma , I wanted something that would save time cooking and after reading several of these reviews , I decided on this Farberware Programmable Pressure Cooker . I read the directions which were easy to understand and made our first meal in it - a boneless pork roast . Wow ! The flavor was unbelieveable and it only took 50 minutes . There is even a browning and a warming mode so I only had to use this one pan . This is definitely worth the money ( and I got it as a steal through Chef 's catalog ) . I highly recommend this product .
4 #### Catch - master Peanut Butter Scented Glue Board To use a glue board , simply peel off the plastic film , and put in place . The glue is extremely sticky , so handle it with care . We have a small storage building that crickets love and these glue boards catch those critters by the dozens . We replace the full boards every couple of months in warm weather . Use scissors to make smaller glue boards before removing the plastic film . One note of caution though ; if you have a curious pet and they get stuck to this thing , they will make a ruckus trying to get free . One board we left outside overnight had feathers on it the next day , so these things can be harmful to birds . You also would n't want to use them where children might touch them . The peanut butter smell is n't too noticeable with one glue board , but the open box of boards stunk so bad , I bought a waterproof plastic box to store them in . Do n't expect it to solve your critter problem overnight . Leave it in place , and keep replacing a glue board as it fills or gets dirty . We do n't have mice in our area , so I ca n't attest to its rodent catching ability . This product works for crickets and other bugs !
5 #### I had a terrible chipmunk problem , someone suggested I give this a shot as nothing else was working . A cap of peanut butter was all it took , I 'd set it before I left for work in the morning , empty the dead chipmunk when I came home . Wish I would have bought a couple to put around the outside of my house .
5 #### I 've used the saw a lot for the past two years . I use a slit length of garden hose as a blade cover , held on with a rubber band . The blade shows no signs of dulling , but I just bought two replacements from the maker 's website for $ 10.07 each . I use it mostly for volunteer work on the Appalachian Trail and elsewhere . It 's great for removing large branches and small trees . It 's good up to eight inches diameter . It barely fits in my day - hike pack . With the handle removed it fits in my lumbar pack .
5 #### A must have for filing your depth gauges . The file is absolutely necessary . Do n't think you can get by with one you already have .
5 #### Oxo makes quality products ! This whisk works very well ! It is very durable so do n't worry about breaking it or having to replace it quickly !
5 #### I wanted to upgrade my cheese grater . My old one was just one side and had 2 different holes on it which made it difficult and awkward to use . I 've really enjoyed this new one . It 's sturdy , does n't move around , easy to use , and folds up for easy storage . My one very minor disappointment is that when folded up , the end where the sides are joined is a little bulky . It does its job well . Edited to add : Over a year later and it 's held up quite nicely . When grating harder cheeses , the grating part actually pushes in some . It 's very thin and apparently not all that strong . It still grates fine but a point of cheapness that makes me question the price some . Overall , glad to have it !
3 #### I bought this to help with fruit flies . Although it did kill some of them , there were still a lot left over , and that was disappointing .
5 #### We are working several projects this winter and wanted to have the extra blades on hand for the cordless saw .
1 #### Thin with sharper uncomfortable edges .Small but cheap . Dollar store flatwear is better . Ok for picnics or for losing and not feeling bad .
5 #### Yes , this cover is probably the thickest grill cover I have found so far . Many of my past covers would rip and tear soon after placing on the grill . I just bought the new Char Griller model 2121 Super pro bbq , and it fits it to a tee . ( including the smokestack on top)Very , very satified . Good luck and keep grillin . Retired Early
4 #### This is ok , flimsier than the previous model , have to stop , drain some water and do again . It is nice that it comes apart for cleaning which the previous gen did nt .
1 #### Amazon - Woods 50013 Outdoor 24 - Hour Digital Outlet Timer with light sensor I bought this item as it was supposed to be usable with my bug zapper . Evidently it is not designed for that much current load as when I hooked it up and turned it on it seemed to work fine but withing 60 minutes it switched itself off . I took the load off and let it set all night and it worked fine but within 60 minutes of hooking it back up to the bug zapper it failed again . I do not recommend this product for use with any bug zapper . The cord that I used to hook it too was much heavier than either the timer or bug zapper cords so that is not the problem . I may be able to use it for turning on and off lights or maybe even a radio but definitely not for the use that I purchased it for .
5 #### Wonderful reel mower that is lightweight and easy to use ! I bought this for the arm workout and cheaper way of maintaining my yard . Works great .
4 #### Works good . I would not give it a 5 start though I have nothing to campare it to . My mom had a hard time using it and said it did not dry greens well . Seems to work fine for me .
5 #### loved this many wired whisk right away , and still love it . Easy to clean in dishwasher .
5 #### I baked a large pound cake in this pan & it turned out beautifully . I would highly recommend it to my friends .
5 #### I actually ordered this for my parents who are both almost 80 . I have had the exact same one for several years now and love it . No running out of fuel or worrying about leaks and explosions , just plug it in . With it 's wheels and tall versus wide stature it is quite a space saver if you do n't have a deck which I do not . It sits nicely in the corner of my garage and I just wheel it out in front of the garage when I want to use it which is all year long . I grill when the urge hits me even in the middle of winter this way . The unit cooks consistently and while it does not have the surface area of the standard large gas grills it has more than enough even when I have the extended family ( 17 or so ) over . The controls are simple and straightforward and the taste of the food on this is great . You do need to assemble it , but it 's not rocket science . Love the grill and all it 's strongpoints work even better for my 80 year old parents .
2 #### I was hoping to use this to can small quantities but it is not tall enough for a pint jar . Have only used it once and it sits in the back of a storage cupboard .
3 #### The directions are pretty bad , the photos almost useless . Leveling feet will probably need to be counterbored ( not mentioned in the directions ) . For my contractor style table saw it works pretty well , but for my 6 " jointer it does n't stay up in the rolling position when you try to move it . The milling of parts ( stamping , actually ) is pretty weak too . The holes in the wood needed to be reamed out several times to get the bolts through , because the holes in the metal brackets do n't line up square . They 're useable now , but they took much more time to assemble than I had anticipated . A few simple fixes and a new set of directions are all that are needed drastically improve the quality of this product . I 'm disappointed .
5 #### I bought this because my family loves to leave the exhaust fan on for the full hour the other timer was . Worked flawlessly . I used to leave for work and turn off the other timer . Now , I just leave with no regrets with this 5 minute timer . I would recommend to a friend to buy NOW ! I wish I had done this last year !
5 #### I musta spent a gazillion dollars on nozzles from wally world , k - notsmart , etc . I just wish I had bought one of these in the first place ! I heard about it from a friend who owns several aircraft and he says it 's the best for use around aircraft . I figure if it 's good enough for his airplanes , it 's good enough for me ! Love it !
5 #### Great use as an alternative to hazardous chemicals ! Traps anything that flies
5 #### I ave been using these peelers for about 10 years now , they last about 4 years and work better then most . With reasonable care they last well and hold their edge , the steel seems to better grade then most . Only drawback is since its so sharp you need to watch peeling yur knuckle by accident
5 #### I bought these for the purpose of carrying my own salad dressing in my purse , and they meet my needs perfectly . They hold exactly two tablespoons , which is what I needed . The seal is tight with no leakage at all . I did not experience what some reviewers did with the lids not fitting well . I took the advice of another reviewer and put these in a pot of boiling water for a couple of minutes . I removed them with tongs and immediately put the seals on the container with no problem at all . I left them on until they cooled . Now the lids go on and off just the way you would want them too . You do n't want it to be too easy because then it will not be a tight enough seal . Maybe it is a little tricky for young children as another reviewer pointed out , but for me it is relatively easy to seal them . They are perfect for carrying a liquid ingredient without worrying about a leak .
4 #### Just like the majority of reviews I 've read , it 's cheap . Know this going in . If you;re the abusing type , it 'll be a ' disposable ' grill to you , probably lasting a season . If you 're like me , my last one lasted 5 years and this one will too , if treated gently .
5 #### Outstanding blades , works as described . Recommend them to everyone , especially for the great price . Fits all saws . Dewalt makes a great blade .
1 #### I February I had bought one from Tractor Supply for 4.99 .... worked great . Then decided to order these for my 80 gallon water trough , which was filled with clean and fresh tab water ! Within 10 - 14 days it was greenish cloudy ... cleaned the trough again and put it back in- 10 days later same result . Not worth the money . These are supposedly for 6 months Each ! Nope not possible .
5 #### This is the type of simple tool for which you will find 100 different uses in and around the kitchen over the years . I grew up with a pair of these in my parents home and recently introduced a pair to my first home with my wife . Three months married and it has already cut twine to tie down my grill and trash cans during a storm , trimmed flowers , opened plastic packaging , cut candle wicks , sliced cardboard , trimmed fat from chicken cutlets , and countless other conveniences around our home . My parents still have the same shears today so I know these will prove durable , functional , and versatile for many years to come ! Worth the extra money to get a sturdy pair that will last and is up to most any task !
5 #### I recently purchased this saw and am exremely impressed so far ! Cuts through all types of lumber with ease . Very smooth and surprisingly quiet . This is the finest circular saw available !
5 #### Everyone has a " flip bit " in their product list . I own one from every company on the planet ( or so it seems ) . The DeWALT is just smooth , strong as a horse and will not fail in any environment . Definitely my " go to " flipper .
2 #### If you prune only a few branches a year , this may be adequate . Anything more , you will be screaming with each use . The cutting mechanism gets jammed with each pull of the rope . The saw blade attachment is not very sharp , and it takes forever to cut a small limb . The pole is too whippy and difficult to control . Get something better for your arms ' sake .
5 #### We received this OXO Good Grip 32480 salad spiner just in time because our old one was broken . This one works very well and it is so easy to operate . We simply love it !
4 #### Good steel of British quality , but could be a bit thicker as the original one
5 #### One of these bales cleared up my small water feature in a few weeks without poisons or stinky stuff !
5 #### I do not think you can write a sexy review of a circuit breaker . This replaced a 20 amp breaker that had been in service for 20 years . I only decided to change the breaker when installing new fixtures on the circuit and learned it was wire with 14 gauge wire , so I stepped down the breaker . This is breaker matches the brand of my breaker box everything lines up . In closing , it is a good simple breaker that does its job .
5 #### There 's and old adage when it comes to tools : Buy a quality tool and cry once when you pay for it ; but a cheap tool and cry every time you use it . This ca n't be any more appropriate than with this combination square . The square I received was perfect out of the box ; perfectly square ( checked with the parallel line technique ) , the head slides incredibly smooth across the rule and the satin chrome finish on the rule makes visibility in any lighting perfect . When I was shopping I almost went for the cast iron head version ( C11H-12 - 4R ) , but decided to treat myself to the hardened steel version since I was buying for life . I 'll likely pass this on to my daughter , and knowing it will have a lifetime of my use will make it that much more special to her . I 'm sure the same ca n't be said for a cheap empire square .
5 #### I realize this is heresy but I 'm not the biggest Milwaukee fan . However , the reviews on this thing were great and I decided to take a chance . Love it . Balance , guide , power , cord , everything is absolutely perfect . Feel good every time I go to pick it up . Worth the bucks . Update 9/10/11 : I 've used this thing at least once a week since I got it . Absolutely the best , I feel good every time I drag it out of the garage . If you use a circular saw , get this one , even if your current one seems okay because , trust me , it wo n't seem okay after using this one !
5 #### Lots of breeze / wind here in the High Desert of So Cal . These have a beautiful , deep , melodious , soothing sound .
5 #### I use this as my jewelry " box " at home , can open it up and see my jewels at one glance . Protects as well , could also be used for travel . Small enough to hide , so thieves ca n't find it as easily as they did my free standing jewelry armoire when they broke in to my house last June . AMAZON.com also sells great jewelry at good prices !
5 #### When my workers are happy I 'm happy ... I did 2000 sq ft of hard wood and the guys only had to change the blade once .
2 #### My ONLY complaint is the motor is too hummy and loud . I swapped out a different motor from my previous fountain and now it 's silent so you can actually hear the water . Fairly easy to adjust just read the trouble shooting sheet that comes with it . I may have to remove the floating bells at night to stop the sound but that 's easy enough to do . Very attractive and a substantial size . I 'll also be adding glass pebbles to the inside of the bowl just for aesthetic reasons . UPDATE after a few months ... I have removed the floating bells since all they did was get stuck and not move . I added the clear crystals to the water and it 's a nice effect . There is a green water mark forming at the top which is unattractive to deal with . Overall at this point I would not buy again .
1 #### cut one screw with the metal blade , and teeth were basically gone . I expected much better from dewalt , very disappointed .
5 #### I purchased this as an accessory item for the DW788 that I bought for my wife . I could n't be happier with it . It is solid , goes together easily and is very stable . It raises the work surface up to just below chest level for a 5'8 " woman . My wife is VERY picky about her things , including tools . She loves the stand . I 'm also going to post a review on the DW788 itself .
5 #### I aqm impressed with the cost and quality of this product , Also impressed on the fast shipment by Amazon as I received it in 4 days , Has not kinked and a great hose as I had one before which I left in the yard during all seasons and even ran across driveway , But it lasted 5 good years through all the abuse , I would recommend this to anyone , Thanks
5 #### This is a great addition to my Bosh 4100 table saw ! It allows me to cut larger boards and not have to worry about having some kind of support in place . When I do n't need it , it slides in nice and close and out of the way .
4 #### Works well with our dry vac ; npt easily cleaned . We now just replace .
5 #### They worked and were a 1/5th the price the Big Box provider was charging .
5 #### Works very well ! If I had a bit more water pressure it would work much better at scaring off the geese on my lawn . The decals of the scarecrow fade from the sun in about a week . But been using it for a few months and have not changed the battery yet . Need to get another one because one does not cover enough space for me . Can only get about 20 ft from it ...
5 #### Very well - made . These are great with my big air fryer , providing enough length to reach in and get everything out while avoiding the heat . The spring is sturdy and the grips are solid .
5 #### Nice sample pack , after you pick what works best , but that blade only . Great way to test out blades .
5 #### great pump works as described fairly powerful would recommend to anyone my pond gets dirty quick and it is still pumping and not clogging yet
5 #### For the quality and the price you ca n't beat this product . I live in upstate New York and during the winter I buy on line because of the road conditions and some times if I have to pay a little more I do n't mind
5 #### It 's only weather rated when hung vertically . But I was able to hang it under my deck and it works perfectly for my holiday lights .
3 #### Saw this item and decided it would be worth trying to solve my problem of dogs crapping on my front lawn . I strategically placed it out front and so far it seems to be working . One issue I have with it is the spray goes off periodically to reduce the water pressure . Wish it had a valve below to do that instead . But in general this is a well - made product that features adjustable spray settings and angle . The sensor is basically a turn knob and goes from ' off ' to full sensor . Maybe one change could be a setting from 1 - 5 or something along those lines so it 's more predictable and consistent to change .
5 #### This thing rocks . Way better than anything in the local stores . We shall see how it holds up this summer !
4 #### The Milwaukee 6390 - 21 was my first circular saw purchase . It is fairly lightweight , quiet for a circular saw , zipped right through a bunch of cedar planks and cedar 4x4s once I got the hang of it . ( Note that I used a&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Freud - D0740X - Diablo-7 - 1 - 4 - 40 - Tooth - ATB - Finishing - Saw - Blade / dp / B00008WQ2H / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Freud D0740X Diablo 7 - 1/4 40 Tooth ATB Finishing Saw Blade</a>&nbsp;for these cuts . ) I 'm not sure yet whether the adjustable handle is a must - have feature , but it is a nice option to have . And adjusting the cutting depth and angle is a cinch . After using this for a full day I think the electric brake and replaceable power cord on the Milwaukee 6394 - 21 would be a nice upgrade - but perhaps not worth the significant extra cost for my DIY use . My only other concern is the aluminum base plate , which flexes a bit under pressure . If Milwaukee had included a stiff magnesium base plate this would be a 5 - star saw . As is , it is still a great bargain - the only other saw I considered ( a Makita with magnesium base plate ) was $ 35 more at the local big box store .
4 #### Fox farms is a good soil nutrients line general hydroponics is by far the best for hydroponics
1 #### I have a little over an acre in Central Florida . This summer , the mosquitoes got so bad they drove me inside . I 'm an avid gardener , so I hate staying inside . I had great hopes for this thing , but it did n't live up to them . Just an occasional zip sound as bugs got done in . No big pile of dead mosquitoes beneath . Not a dent on the mosquito population .
5 #### I have vivid memories of my mother and grandmother back in Cuba in the1950 's when Cuba was free and beautiful and can yet see my mother cooking with these Presto pressure cookers almost every day ... So many great meals she prepared with it . I came to the US in 1965 and had to left them in Havana until 1970 when she and my father finally came to joint me here in the US . After a few days of them here we went to buy cooking utensils and kitchenware for our new home here in Miami . I purchased for her a Presto 6 quart and 4 quart cooker . Do not have to say she was delighted . She used them like in Cuba , almost every day for many , many delicious meals , until she was very old ( 92 years old ) and passed away in 1995 . I still have these Prestos and they are like new . I just have ordered the gaskets and pressure valve through the Presto site here in the Web . Just to say I cook a lot myself and used them very often . Presto stands back on all their models and have replacement parts for all their cookers old and new . They even have the originals Manuals with recipes and user instructions and times for every model the have ever produced . I should say these cookers would last for generations if well treated and cleaned . They are part of the dear memories I have of my family .
2 #### I would not recommend . We are unable to get the hand held vac apart from the main unit . It is not worth the money to buy this . Instead go for the extra money buying the Electrolux for twice the money - this is a great vacuum .
2 #### I ordered three pair of gloves . The first two pair fit fine . Four months later I went to use the last pair , and the right glove is much smaller - I ca n't bend my fingers . And Amazon tells me it 's too late to return . This return policy sucks in a situation like this . I guess you are expected to try on each pair right away ....
5 #### I got the brand name for this product from my Pond Guy . I had a bad case of string algae in my koi pond , and it was everywhere . I 've had the pond for 8 years and never had such an outbreak . My pond guy knew just the right brand to recommend , and of course , Amazon had it in their inventory for sale ... do n't they always ? I followed the directions and applied 2 doses and voila , the algae was no more . Wow , this is one powerful product , and my fish had no ill effects . Now that 's what I call a SOLUTION ! !
4 #### I bought this to cut wood for my deck . The quality is not so good , a part was broken in a few cuts . I called the customer service , a new part was sent to me very quickly . When I called again to express that it 's hard to replace the part myself , a RN it given to me , and a new saw was sent to me in a few days . The saw has all the good functionalies I needs for all the cuts , at the price , it 's a great deal .
1 #### The pruner will not release easily if you grab hold of a branch a little too thick , and at five feet away it 's not always the easiest thing to do to notice if that branch is an 1/8th inch too thick . As a result , it broke on the second day . Amazon replaced with another , which broke due to same issue , but this time was too late to return . I bought another , more expensive one that I am happy with and I would recommend it to anyone else : ARS LA-180ZR203 4 - to-7 - Feet Long Reach Pruner
4 #### I have had one of these for many years . Before I moved , the feeder had to be in a place where squirrels could easily jump on it . They often would but I never saw any actually get any feeder out of it . It was also a lot of fun watching them try . It does get dirty on top , especially if the squirrel express their frustration by soiling the lid , and the drain holes inside often clog up which can result in the bird seed in the feed slots turning into a moldy mess that you have to pick out with a stick . Aside from those two issues , it is a great feeder and the only squirrel proof one I 've had that works .
4 #### Remarkably powerful suction and " tracks " reasonably well . Serves its purpose well . Unfortunately the auction does not translate into power for the blower ; I feel like it has much less power when used in that capacity ( which seems counterintuitive , because the airflow should be the same ... ) Could be user error of some sort ; I will post an update if I 'm able to figure out a way to get improved performance for the blower function .
5 #### I think the Freud blades for power saws are really cutting edge technology . Very clean cuts . I wo n't buy anything else for serious work .
5 #### EXCELLENT PRODUCT . I PURCHASED 2 - -ONE FOR MY RIP BLADE & 2ND FOR MY DADO BLADE ; WILL PURCHASE ATLEAST 2 MORE FOR THE DADOs .
1 #### This is without a doubt the worst thing I 've ever bought from Amazon . The frame is " redesigned " with these plastic quick connectors that are supposed to make assemble a breeze . There is one major problem with that . They are JUNK ! The connectors either snapped when you tried to put them together or they wo n't seat properly in the holes and then you ca n't get the legs / feet the whole way together . Then you ca n't get the connectors back out . I 'm not sure how the old design went together , but these connectors are way to flimsy to hold everything together . I 'm in the process of sending this back for a refund . Do n't waste your money on this one .
5 #### Moved into a new house , and the under cabinet lighting uses about 40 of these bulbs . These are nice and bright , and much cheaper then the GE Halogen bulbs that were in there before - about 1/4th the cost . When these bulbs are side by side with a GE bulb , you ca n't tell which is which ! Sometimes you need to be careful buying " off - brand " items but these bulbs work great with nothing to worry about . Also , the bulbs are individually packaged / wrapped within a bigger box which is great when you do n't need to use all 10 at once - that way they stay stored more safely until needed .
4 #### Like that makes a lot ... so I can eat for several days ... also is relatively easy to use ... a bit large to store if you have a storage problem ...
5 #### Sturdy and well made . These bad boys are killer on larger branches . Super easy to use , even on dry , dead branches . Faster and easier than a chain saw on anything under 1.5 inches . Works great on roots too . I loaned them to my yard guys one day , and even they were impressed . If you have trees , you should have a pair of these .
3 #### Cracked too easily in install . Otherwise , it does what it is designed to do .
5 #### Adjust the lo mixture for highest RPM 'S at idle and hi mixture for highest RPM 'S at full throttle . Adjust the idle just until the chain just stops . Repair Clinic and E - Replacement Parts have parts . E Replacement Parts has exploded views and videos . Morrison Outdoor Equipment has parts and Brigg valve guides and valve guide tools for Brigg lawnmowers . A CJ8 is a little hotter than a CJ7 . A J61 is MUCH hotter !
4 #### Squirrels love it except for the corn . Resealable bag is convenient too for storage .
5 #### great replacement bar and chain for price fit great and Oregon is a very durable chain and bar company have used many times in past
1 #### Go to Mennards or Lowes or Home Depot and get an $ 11.00 Cooper instead . You will be happy you did .
5 #### Great deal on Amazon . I 've used these tapes for 30 yrs . I guess I got hooked after working a few years roughing and framing residential housing . They have all performed well and were long - lasting through very rough use .
2 #### Overall quite unimpressed with this knife , does not seem sharp enough at all . I got a crusty ciabatta loaf and it struggles to break the crust . Not much more to say than that , it 's just not a very good bread knife .
5 #### I was buying cheap made in China stuff and became frustrated with the quality . Pony pipe clamps have been a quality tool in the shop for me for 35 years . Handles are secure . Easy to crank with material in the clamp .
5 #### Excellent . Hardened tip that grips . I got stuck using this in a space on a # 2 as this was the only thing I had that fit . Serious transfer of torque from your hand through the handle , it powered right through . Wish I had a # 2 that performs in this way ... I am going to look into other Klein drivers . Worth the money , and worth adding to your toolbox .
3 #### a little small for carpentry use and the markings can be hard to see in certain light .
5 #### I purchased this bit to match the edges of my new cabinet doors with some of the commercially made ones installed in my kitchen . It was a perfect match ! Again ..... what can I say ... it is a Freud bit ... well made and sharp ! I will probably buy more of them in the future .
5 #### And right out of the package . Surface Pro , and Lenovo Carbon both like this adapter and it drives a 1080p display without hesitation . Does the job .
5 #### My friend had one so I bought one after seeing how easy it was and it does work as advertised . I use garlic a lot so saves me time from getting that smell on my fingers . The only negative would be that it 's rubber so the peels stick inside and can be a tiny bit annoying to clean but it 's to be expected .
5 #### Great vacuum . I purchased the little one to get the cat hair off of my furniture and this one for the rest of the house . Works great on my rugs and hardwoods . Superb sucking power !
1 #### While we had great hope for the 200 foot cable , it proved completely ineffective ( in Connecticut . ) We purchased the cable together with the thermostat ( Easy Heat RS-2 Automatic Roof De - Icing Cable Control ) . A roofing contractor installed the cables and thermostat . Precisely as per instructions . Soon enough , we realized that the cable control did n't work at all . Regrettably , we only found out after considerable ice dams had built up and water damage had created havoc inside the house ( we had installed an entirely new roof a mere three months ago and had covered the roof entire surface with an ice and water barrier shield . ) In an effort to mitigate further problems , we circumvented the cable control ( thermostat . ) Again , it was of no use . The cable , while emitting some heat , did not control the ice build - up at all . We will remove the cables after the winter . It is tremendously regrettable . We certainly believed that after installing an entirely new roof ( with allegedly over - the - top water - proof measures taken ) , the cable would add another ( theoretically unnecessary ) layer of security . Instead , we will be battling not only the weather in the remaining winter months , but with the roofing contractor and the insurance company as well .
5 #### Nice hinges , easy install . Great tension . My kitties can not easily get into the cabinets now , and none of the hinges squeak !
3 #### Build cheap , made in china , but surprisingly accurate temp reading
4 #### Time consuming , but gave me the info I needed . Next year , I will send soil samples off to be tested .
4 #### The swoosh sound of the water is enough to get the deer moving fast . The sound is not the only this that scares deer , they also avoid the startled shock of water coming their way . So far it has saved my Creeping Jenny and Hostas from being eaten to the ground . The red flashing lights I purchased before these motion activated sprinklers did not have any affect in scaring the deer .
1 #### I would suggest passing on this and do not look back . Just use a stove and a pot , it works better and is much faster . I have had 3 of these ( 2 as replacements ) . They start out working OK but after a couple uses the popcorn just turns and turns and the majority never pop . We tried fresh kernels , different oils , less oil , more oil . It is a waste of time . I think as some others have stated - it just does n't get hot enough . I even took videos of it just turning the kernels for 20 minutes with just a few popped .
2 #### There are many flaws in this product . I was expecting much better . First the top does n't crank up high enough to handle half an orange . The metals used are very cheap and may not stand up to a lot of citrus use , we shall see . When cleaning , the bottom of the sqeeze tray comes out easily to be washed in soapy water . But the top part of the device does not come out to be cleaned properly and you literally have to turn the device upside down to clean the cone part . You can not rinse it because then all the water gets trapped in the upper part of the device . To say the least , I am very disappointed in this product .
4 #### I wanted a long handled lopper . This has long handles and cuts through things easily with mechanical advantage designed leverage of cutting blades . Two problems which I did n't anticipate . The longer handles mean you have to open the handles much wider to get the cutting blades around a large diameter branch which is slightly awkward and " shortens " the reach somewhat . Also , the regular size Fiskars is super light but this is a bit heavier than I would have imagined . Overall fairly satisfied . Ship , arrive time etc great .
2 #### After making the purchase and using a few times , decided the Cooker was too much of a challenge . Purchased one that was electric that does not need me to watch the timer .
5 #### The deep rich tone these give are very soothing . I love sitting on the patio while a gentle breeze moves this into melody !
1 #### no bulb - description is somewhat misleading- do n't buy if you 're not buying bulb as well
1 #### Great design concept , poor construction . Broke mine after pruning two crepe myrtles . Spent an hour trying to fix but ended up throwing them away .
5 #### This is a heavy , durable batter bowl . It has an easy - grip handle . It should last for years .
5 #### Replacement blades are great and install easily . Do read the instructions on installing , or it takes awhile to get the pieces back togeather .
5 #### I love this cake pan ! It 's heavy and durable , and made in the USA . The first one I received had flaws in the coating inside the pan - I sent an e - mail to Amazon and another pan came within 2 days . I am extremely happy with the Amazon customer service . I have made several recipes in this pan , and all have turned out ( and turned out ! pardon the pun ) superbly . I do n't have any problem with sticking , but I use a baking spray with flour , as stated in the instructions that came with the pan . Update 12/8/2012 : I still love this pan , I use it all the time and it still looks brand - new after many , many cakes , and I am trying to decide which will be my next Bundt pan ( I wish they still made the Star , http://www.amazon.com / Nordic - Ware - Cast - Star - Bundt / dp / B00004RFQ2 / ref = cm_cr_pr_product_top I 've seen it on E - bay and I hope it 's as high quality as this pan ) . I went to Costco today and saw the Bundt pan and cake keeper set , but the pan definitely does n't have the quality feel of this Platinum Collection . I have the clear acrylic cake keeper from Nordic Ware and it is such a great thing for carrying cakes to gatherings , or just for keeping the cake in the fridge . I also bought this book : http://www.amazon.com/Nordicware-70000-Accessories-Original-Cookbook/dp/B0002ZFUZ8/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top and absolutely love it ! I 've made several recipes from it and it is just an outstanding book - over 50 recipes for scratch cakes .
5 #### In 20 years of home ownership , I have been through several pairs of pruners . Mostly because I lose them in the yard waste bucket :-( I started out with a nice pair of Corona and moved on to Fiskars with the rotating handle . The lock button on the Fiskars had a tendency to lock while using which was irritating . They cut pretty well and quality was decent as I had them for five years . Upon shopping for a new set , it seemed like the heftier box store pruners were $ 25 minimum . After reading all the great reviews for these I decided to put an additional $ 10 to take a chance on these and I am not disappointed ! These cut like butter ! ! ! ! ! I got them just in time to do spring yard cleaning and I have a lot of shrubs and bushes around the house . They have a really nice heft to them and are comfortable to use for a couple of hours . I appreciate the orange handle . Since I paid a lot for these pruners , I invested $ 10 in a belt pouch to hold the pruners when they are not in use . I recommend these high priced pruners if you spend a lot of time pruning .
1 #### This is made by Flexgen ( Flexogen ? ) , which is the worst hose I 've had the misfortune to use . Do n't buy this unless you need to brush up on your curse words . no stars This is the most prone - to - kinks hose ( I was going to say ' kinkiest hose ' ) I 've ever worked with , and I 'm 70 years old and seen a lot o ' hoses , honey ! Weather 50 * , slight breeze , in the shade . Perfect conditions for strenuous yard work . I worked an hour trying to get this wound around one of those " roller " things mounted on the wall . Sweat was pouring down me . I knew I would never get it straightened out enough to get it on the roller . I quit trying . I got this at Lowe 's , but I wanted to warn you not to buy it . I got a Flexilla , and it 's far better ! Does not kink ; honest ! Mine 's * 100 ft long * , too ! Flexilla is more expensive , granted , but you wo n't learn any new curse words with it . mb
5 #### Good quality . Has n't scratched or browned after multiple uses . Be better if everything fit into the larger pan and the lid fastened to the set , but when everything is inside there is a gap between the large pan and the lid . Still compacts well though , preventing shifting during movement .
5 #### Heavy duty cover . Hoping it can stand up to extreme conditions found in desert area . So far , so good . Update:02/2016 ; Cover 's outer shell tore in December of 2015 , as a result of extreme cold . Between extreme heat of desert summer and extreme cold of desert winter , cover outer shell becomes brittle in winter . I still like the cover , however I would like to find one that could last longer than 18 months .
5 #### Awesome , fit my Craftsman chainsaw as expected and cut thru trees like butter .
5 #### bought this as a gift and the person loved it
5 #### This is the best peeler i have ever used . Well .. its like the 2nd one i 've ever owned so .. i guess that 's not saying much . But hey ... why would i lie to you . whatever you do , DO NOT try to use it to shave if you run out of mach III razors because they are so expensive . You ve been warned
1 #### Nope , tried everything . Found about 5 yellow jackets flying in a area , and set this right down among them . Nothing . Really wanted it to work . They seemed more interested in one I killed then the trap .
5 #### He adquirido este producto hace un tiempo y me ha resultado simplemente excelente , muy buena resistencia y corte limpio , sin lugar a dudas lo recomiendo al 100 % y el precio esta muy bueno , es mejor unos dolares mas pero un producto que lo vale realmente .
4 #### Bought these about 5 years ago for Christmas , and they 've been great knives . I really like J.A. Henckels knives , and these are some good ones . These are stamped , high carbon steel knives with no bolster and full tangs . The handles are POM synthetic which is good for sanitation . They cut very good , and a lot of it is the blade design . Only the first 1/4 of the blade is serrated , and the rest is straight . The serrations are micro - type and because they 're along the drop point ( where the most cutting is done ) it helps to glide through just about anything . Even thick steaks cut well . The only gripe is that the straight edge needs to be sharp for these to work well , and the serrations do eventally get dull . A dull edge wo n't slice meat , it tears it , and makes a mess of your steak . That 's a problem because you ca n't sharpen them unless you get creative . You also need to handwash these ( no dishwasher ) , or they will rust because of the high carbon content in the steel . Other than that , these are great knives at a reasonable price !
5 #### I ca n't believe I waited so long to start using one of these ! I make a lot of salads and we eat a lot of raw veggies and fruits and washing all of those different foods is incredibly easy thanks to this salad spinner . It 's really effective too as you can literally see all of the water and dirt in the bowl that comes from the fruits / veggies that you 're washing . It also has many uses because you can use it as a serving bowl and you can use it to store lettuce and other fresh produce in the fridge without it wilting or turning brown over night . Definitely worth the $ 30 .
5 #### I like this soaker hose because it soaks evenly whether facing up for sprinkler effect or faced down for soaker effect . It is durable and well made .
5 #### Excellent quality and workmanship . The cinch wrist strap is great . Makes for a great fit .
2 #### I did n't see a reduction in the number of mosquitos . We do n't even use it anymore .
1 #### I could n't get the thing to do what it was supposed to do . It just seemed broken . Had a buddy try it too and he agreed .
3 #### I bought a flowtron before . It worked fantastic . Hundreds of dead mosquitos . This one does n't work as well . I do n't know if it 's the bulb or the little cartridge .. Certainly does n't cover half an acre . Maybe I made a mistake ! Update . We moved and it kills insects but mainly it attracts them . Definitely does n't work like our first one . We live in Suriname , south America , where I could use the machine . Ca n't recommend it .
5 #### This is a really good knife . It 's functional , sharp and quite well balanced . Do n't be fooled by the designer/ signature knife market out there asking for a super high premium on single or sets , at the end of the day you 'll have to consider a few things balance , weight & price . This knife has all 3 qualities so it 's an easy choice . There are only very few knifes out there that are worth the premium due to the strength and composition of steel , but for the average to home ' professional ' cook this will do nicely . The handle is personal preference , and this suits me very well , it has enough ' catch ' and grip surfaces . I avoid handles that are smooth and oval as your hands will slip while cutting , especially when wet or if oily . I like that the handle is low maintenance as well , I considered buying the model with wood but decided against as it 's one more thing you 'll have to maintain and it serves not function other than looking good . Do yourself a favor and also get a good cleaver to compliment , do NOT use a chef knife in place of a cleaver you will shatter the blade eventually . Keep is sharp with a good quality sharpening stone and this will last you years .
2 #### had high hopes for this as a cat deterrent .. but after 2 days of hearing and seeing it go on / off i was dissapointed . I would sit there watching it go ON but no animals or anything around my yard ? Then i would wave a broom in front of it ... and NOTHING .... usually . Not sure why it had a mind of its own , i was very hopeful but dissapointed . I would have given it a 1 - star , but Amazon had it for almost 1/2 the cost of Homedepot and other web sites and the return policy seemed very user friendly so i bummped it up to 2 - star for that reason alone . good luck with yours if you buy one . steve / N.California
4 #### These are discontinued , so they 're not returnable . Only 12 " in length , so a longer chain may be needed in rooms where children will be . I can feel the decorative ornament in the dark . The chains are long enough for me , and look great .
5 #### I 've had the 75 ' NeverKink hose a number of years . When I needed a 50 ' marine hose I went right back to the NeverKink brand . It is very durable for marine use and YES it never kinked for me !
5 #### Like with all Fiskars products I have owned , this axe does a great job of doing what it is designed to do . I split a couple hundred logs a year and the ergonomics on this product make it a far easier chore . I am on the small side ( 170 # ) , so I really appreciate that . Work smarter , not harder .
5 #### using this cover with my Intex family lounge pool , and it works fine . it is only about 8x8
5 #### Great tool . Easy to use and adjust . This is the Kleenex of channel locks . They have earned the name . Sturdy , durable and made in the USA .
5 #### I have 6 of these and so far I like the flexibility .
4 #### Nice heavy - weight grill cover . Expect it to hold up well . The only improvement would be to widen it to accomodate leaving the side table attachment on the grill . Feel it is a good value for the money .
5 #### This is a very nicely made Bundt pan . I have used Bundt pans since they were resurrected in the 60 's . This pan is larger than some I have used and I like not having to worry about the cake running over . Cake came out easily and in one piece . Very simple cleanup . Very pleased with purchase .
5 #### I used this to defrost my freezer . It worked perfectly
5 #### Easy to assemble , though I will admit that one of the wheels keeps popping off the side when i roll it around my patio . But then again , i rarely have to move the grill so it 's not like it 's a big deal . The grill is large and easy to clean and the thing that stands out most with this grill is the ash - catching compartment on the bottom . Plus my steaks taste way better using this thing compared to my previous grill which used propane
5 #### Works well for tea leaves . Easy open / close latch and easy to dispose tea leaves and rinse . Comes with chain with hook to latch onto edge of cup for easy retrieval of ball . Will recommend .
5 #### works great ! the first heater worked for 7yrs at -6 degree . love it
5 #### This is a hard switch to find at Lowes or Home Depot . They used to carry it but seems no longer . Amazon saves the day !
3 #### Ditch your slop - jaw chuck for these , but buy two sets because the aluminum wears quickly . They 're reasonably concentric out of the box . I get roughly 30 bit changes before the collet gets sloppy from aluminum erosion . If you need precision from Dremel products , collets are the only way .
5 #### Great tool , has held up well . I sometimes put a little oil on it before flipping eggs so that the eggs do n't stick to the turner . I would buy this again !
5 #### Big or small , Maglite is the best . I hang this from the ceiling in my tent and it provides lots of light .
4 #### Hubby 's Christmas gift ... he loves it . Wish well for butter was different .
3 #### I bought Stanley because I thought it was supposed to be good but it 's darn near impossible to slide the lock into place on this thing when the tape measure is extended . Have to wrestle it with two thumbs and even then it does n't always work .
5 #### This is the best brush ever ! ! ! I actually painted the entire bathroom and did n't have to waste hours taping off everything ! I washed it everyday and never lost a bristle ! ! ! ! !
5 #### We have had two of these on our house , for several years . They have completely eliminated the ice dams and clogged downspouts that used to trouble us . It has been exceptionally snowy , and cold this winter , and the cables have still done the job . One thing to keep in mind is the power consumption . At 5 watts per foot , 50 feet of cable uses 6 kWh per day , or 180 kWh per month . At 20 cents per kWh , that costs $ 36 per month . To reduce that cost , I 've started unplugging the cables when the roof was clear of snow . The reviews on the optional automatic control have been mixed , but I may give that a try , next season .
5 #### This is my second unit . My first one I bought almost 20 years ago . It lasted a long time and finally gave up the ghost . This new model is very similar , with a few refinements in the bulb design and the cage . We set ours on a outdoor Christmas Tree timer . It comes on at dusk and turns off 4 hours later . On a warm night , you can hear bugs crackling every few seconds . It 's a non - stop orchestra of bugs that will not be landing on me or my kids and taking blood samples . 75 watts for 4 hours is a reasonable price to pay for this satisfaction .
5 #### This thing has been used just about every day since I opened the box and washed it . It 's the perfect size and super easy to clean and store . Love it ! ! !
5 #### I have burned through several pairs of " side cutters " over the years ( literally - try cutting a hot wire to see what I mean ) , and this is the best pair I 've owned by far . Solid construction , a little heavier weight than others - which means heavier duty . Plus , it 's made in America which counts more and more for me these days . Worth the extra few bucks for a solid tool and supporting American manufacturing .
5 #### It makes good joints and its not too difficult to set up . I really like the adjustability would not want to have bought one of the fixed bits .
2 #### My wife hated it . Too much cleanup . The stand up poppers were easier to use .
1 #### I bought this vac and it worked fine for a while . Now it is almost 2 years old and the batteries wo n't charge . If they do the vac runs only for a few minutes . This is so frustrating to me . I even bought the extra battery pack . I am on a fixed income and ca n't afford to replace . Perhaps it is only supposed to run 2 years but my Electrolux ran for years .
5 #### Works well and excellent quality . Will buy more for sure . Very useful assortment , especially during demolition work . Would recommend as general all purpose uses .
3 #### To echo the other reviews , these gloves are clearly of excellent quality . The fabric is durable / well - stitched and the composition ( breathable , yet protective against thorns ) is nicer than any other glove I 've tried . Unfortunately while the gloves may be of good fit for the large sizes , the gloves do not seem to fit smaller hands . There is about 1/4 - 1/2 " of space left at the tips of each of the fingers which increases to about 3/4 " space when my fingers are bent ( ie when grasping something ) . Because I lose the fine motor control of having fingertips , I then have a difficult time wearing these when doing any yard work that is not pulling very large weeds or pruning large branches . Not to mention your hands become quite clumsy with 1/2 " of excess material at their tips . So for those with small hands , I recommend to keep looking .
1 #### Just returned our Stir Crazy . After using it 4 times in 2 weeks the heating element quit working even though the stirring rod continued to rotate . Over the years we have had numerous Stir Crazy poppers and have never had a problem like this . We usually bought a new one when the old one got really difficult to cleane and looked ugly . It is nice to have Amazon and its user friendly return policy and procedure but we will be looking elsewhere for a popper which is not West Bend .
5 #### Reliable , easy install . Does n't require a neutral like the keypad style timers do .
5 #### This was a great quantity of wood chips at a great price delivered to my door . The chips work perfectly in my electric smoker . I would recommend them . Apple wood is my preferred smoke wood
3 #### Works great . When it works . Scares off critters and the mail carrier ( oops - sorry ) . However , over time the sun beats up the plastic construction , and its black absorbing color does n't help . The decals peel off with drying out but that 's no biggie . The motion detector does n't last , either -- mine stopped working even after storing it away in my basement shop . How does that happen ? But because we get foxes , coyotes , raccoons , opossums and cats coming through our yard , I 'll keep buying them even if they wear out quickly .
5 #### So far , works great ! Going to take lots of adjustment but the pork loin roast cooked in less than 20 minutes and was tender .. i actually ate it and I do n't like much meat ! Great texture .. cooked veggies faster than i thought but hey , its a learning curve ! Very happy so far ! This cooker is deeper than it is wide , and could make maybe a two service pot of soup . Would be great for roasts .
5 #### Perfect for an entire bunch of greens ! The rubber feet hold it perfectly stable even on wet countertops .
3 #### Should copy the one offered by Rockler . It has an easily removable jack wheel that can be removed in about 10 - 15 seconds to get it out of the way and/or used on another mobile base . This could reduce the overall cost if one needs more than one base . There could be a little more attention paid to the manufacture so that the holes line up better , and there is a small problem with the bends not allowing it to all be at 90 degrees to the bottom and consequently the when the lumber is inserted , it is not square and plumb to the adjacent piece . The instructions SUCK , but they should n't be needed for any intelligent person . If you ca n't put it together without the instructions , you probably should not plug in any of your power tools .
5 #### Works perfect for the toaster oven , non stick , love it
5 #### Awesome . I love all the different chips from this brand . Great prices and superb quality wood !
5 #### Its the simple things in life . This thing is amazing and just works grrrreat ! no cheap plastic to break , just top quality pistol grip nozzle !
5 #### I inherited one of these from my grandfather . It still holds up to abuse well , and has a very smooth ratcheting mechanism .
5 #### These worked great for me . Directions made everything simple . Have been very impressed with results
5 #### Our second beaker . Absolutely the easiest measuring cup to use .
1 #### This whisk has the same problem that all OXO plastic - crap - handle products have : water gets in the grip . You need to disassemble it after use ( and hope it 's meant for being diassembled and assembled again ) or you will build a stinky , dirty pool inside the stuff you use for cooking .
3 #### Anything I have to " fix " does n't get more than 2 or 3 stars . The product itself is n't bad , however they containers are lightly snapped onto the strap , and started falling off after about a week . So , now I need to glue them on permanently . Other than that , the product is good quality , does n't seem like cheap flimsy chinese crap .
2 #### Sad to say this was such a disappointment to me . I had one for years with no problems . After 10 years my guess it died . I ordered another one . It died in less then a year . Got extra battery cuz saw review that other person just needed new battery . Nope . So 1 more try n bought new one . Did n't last a year . Why ca nt anyone make something that last like it use to . We did n't use it on rugs just hardwood floors . No pets n very clean people . This should have lasted .
2 #### This hose was a real disappointment . It 's described as flexible ; it 's about as flexible as a lead pipe . No way can I curl it up or , for that matter , really uncurl it . Beware !
5 #### these b ulbs work great , and for the price , i could n't find anything close . thumbs up from me .
5 #### It 's good quality . Mine keep " walking off " . So I 'm sure I will be buying again .
5 #### Keep one handy , you may never need it , but it 's a good investment for when you do .
5 #### basic hedge clippers says it all . cuts up to 1/4 inch , but that 's pushing it , better to use small pruner at that point . nice and sharp , easy to use
5 #### Love it , very thin and will need to be stored carefully
5 #### Bought this over five or six years ago and it still delivers accurate temperatures , It is op = outside in the elements every day in the hot desert sun and although it has faded a little it still works great . Actually I am surprised that it has not completely fallen apart like other things do out in the sun and the weather every day .
5 #### Works great no more soggy salad 's , also well built and easy to use
5 #### Yep , it 's a 6 quart pressure cooker and does what it should .
5 #### I 've had this for going on two years now , and it 's still holding up very well . I have n't even had to replace the gaskets yet .
5 #### I 've used this to apply insecticide several times and it is easy to use and well made . I did follow the instructions to clean it well after each use and have not had any issues with clogging or leaking .
3 #### I have a love hate with these , They do n't last as long as they used too . But i have n't found a better replacement yet .
4 #### Great for use in the toaster oven . I needed this exact size and it is perfect for cooking small meals in the toaster oven and slow roasting . Perfect .
5 #### This is a great clamp for general purpose framing , but if the frame is less than about 1 " thick on the outside , then you are better off using an adjustable frame clamp ( < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/B0000DD1GT / dp / B0000DD1GT / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">B0000DD1GT</a>&nbsp;because when you tighten this the corners will not be stable , which is critical . I actually prefer this clamp , but it is not for all applications .
4 #### Got this as a gift . Yes , in terms of convenience it is the anti - Keurig pod brewer . But , I like my coffee strong and dark and flavorful . This classic brewer produces it every time . Tips - I use bottled water - not the hard tap water I would otherwise drink . I grind dark roast beans a bit coarse . Use low heat and take it off the stove about 2/3 of the way through and let it finish . I took off one star b / c thorough cleaning requires some scrubbing with a sponge . You do n't want any residue spoiling your next mug .
5 #### Works well , we were septic . The reviews and rating are right on this product . It looks like it will hold up for a long time .
5 #### This little beauty completes the set I 've had for two decades . They 're not giving these away but for the long term , these knives are hard to beat .
5 #### This kettle has been doing its job in my kitchen for 12 years of almost daily use . All previous kettles I 've had broke or corroded after less than a year . This one was worth the investment . The construction is solid , the whistle loud and the heat conduction excellent . I 've had no problems with rust or corrosion but I do not keep it full and closed when not in use . The handle conducts heat so a pot holder is required . I believe Chantal now includes an insulated handle cover with this product which would solve that problem .
5 #### These work great . If you need more adjustment just add on slit brackets and you can cut bigger crown .
3 #### I got it because it was featured as something that went along with the dehumidifier that drains directly rather than in the bucket but I DIDN'T NEED IT . The product comes with its own hose so why was this featured as a suggested bundled purchase ? I ca n't be bothered returning it which would probably cost almost as much as the hose . Caveat emptor I guess .
3 #### Decent fixture for the money , but the assembly was shoddy and needed some reworking to get them to hang properly .
5 #### Very bright and easy to clip to the book . Battery life is acceptable .
1 #### Useless never worked - do n't bother to waste your money ! !
5 #### Colors in this chime amazing . Love to look at it flowing with the wind .
2 #### Comfortable but not treated at all for sun exposure as they should be . In less than a month , they look severely faded & no longer match .
4 #### Works fine . Worth the money . Does what 's expected . Cord a bit short
5 #### I had a hose with a leak in the middle of a 100 ' hose . I guess I could have made 2 50 ' hoses but with this I just cut out the leaky part and slid this on and tightened it up . The hose is back to 100 ' with no leaks .
5 #### I have been buying this on amazon for years . Living in the Rockies and elk and deer in the area this keeps them all away . I even have a beaver it helps keep away from our trees .
4 #### I likeds this product , the only draw back is the length of the neck . I had to adjust the light often . If you use the double light that 's works great but is hard on the batteries , however , you can use an A.C. power supply ( not included ) A fun product and does work well
5 #### This brush has many uses , not only for brushing vegetables . I used it to scrub my wok , after it cooled down of course . Comfortable grip .
5 #### I got this Leviton wall plate as an add - on purchase , hoping it would be the right size and color to match a Wemo switch . I was delighted to find out that it is perfect with Wemo .
5 #### Interesting . My hummers love the red juice ! Everybody else uses sugar and water I try homemade sugar and water and the hummers stay away . I use this red stuff and have to hang 4 feeders . They love it . Update : it 's fall and the migration is on . They are here at my feeders eating this red juice by the droves ..... yet my neighbors want to know if they are all ' gone south ' because there are n't eating at their house .... NOT . You get several buzzing around you here . Maybe they are saying Thank You !
5 #### super sharp and very easy to use . fits well in hand and cuts like a dream . be careful though they are very sharp both at the point and the blade , do n't get your fingers in there or you will be bleeding . these have served me well for quite sometime i have actual bought a few more pairs to leave inside my garden
4 #### These measuring cups are great looking , very durable and a fun addition to my kitchen ! I was a little worried because they arrived with one cup detached from the handle , so I had to return them and get a new set . I am still concerned about that happening in the future , but I guess I will just jave to wait and see .
5 #### Bought this is a gift . My son say it did a great job cooking broccoli . Still have to try other dishes .
5 #### Great for salads . Really indispensable kitchen tool . Fun to use , too !
5 #### My wife loved these and they are perfect to show off your true colors ! The porch looks fantastic with these on it .
4 #### I bought this DeWalt to replace a Freud jointer that died after only a dozen or so cuts . The positive reviews on this site played a large role in my decision ( it 's the only DeWalt tool I own ) . I also considered the Porter Cable ( which looks bulky ) and the less - expensive Ryobi ( which of course you ca n't get here on Amazon ) . I 've had this jointer for over a year now and have put it to moderate use with home woodworking projects . It seems to be of good quality . The tool is lightweight and I agree with other reviews that the trigger placement is very user - friendly . However , I have one annoyance with this tool that I just ca n't seem to get over . I use this primarily in oak and pine , and the dust chute clogs with chips after just 2 or 3 cuts . The chute seems too small for the amount and/or size of the chips that are extracted . I am constantly removing the dust bag to clear the chips from the tool . Perhaps this problem could be avoided with a dust collection attachment , but bulky collection hoses can be restricting , and the bag otherwise does a great job catching dust ( until it clogs ) . I suspect this DeWalt will last a very long time . But if I were to buy another biscuit jointer , I would be very tempted to try the Ryobi at half the price . It too has very good reviews , and the specs are comparable .
5 #### It works great . I would say it is on the larger side .
4 #### First one leaked , replaced with no issue and works great . Used all summer and surviving winter . Keeps water clear and actually have not had need to replace filter .
5 #### Great pond net . Keeps all the critters out and perfect for keeping leaves from going inside pond
5 #### Everyone has a 5 gallon bucket or ten around , great for small parts screw nut and bolts stack around three in a bucket and clean up your work bench holds a lot .
5 #### I bought this spoon along with a slotted to use in my kitchen . Both were very durable , comfortable and had just the right length handles for me .. They are an excellent buy and I recommend .
5 #### Really good quality whisk - all my others now reside in the " utensil drawer of shame "
1 #### I am not going to extoll the virtues of a mandoline . I have a couple and they are very useful . However , the Hoffritz product is poorly constructed . The most important elements of a mandoline are a sharp blade and firm , even cutting surface . The cutting blade used for this item can not be removed for sharpening and it is made of flimsy , cheap steel that could not be sharpened even if it were accessible . In addition , you need a firm surface so that you get even cuts as you push food through the blade . Again , the Hoffritz fails here . The slicing surface " bows " easily , making for uneven slices . You do n't have to spend hundreds of dollars to get a good mandoline , but there are far better low cost options that this item .
5 #### Great air hose for the Money ! Being a auto tech for over 25 years I think I have used every kind of air hose know to man and tho yes some might be better and some for sure are worse having a good quality rubber hose to use esp around the house speaks for itself esp when trying to wind or roll up on a cold winter day ! This hose is very ply able and being yellow very viable to those that have to walk over it while unwound .
5 #### I used it to make raised panel wainscoting for my living room . Worked fantastical ! The fence is dead accurate and easy to adjust and I used a 3.5HP router with a Router Razer that makes adjusting the router height a piece of cake .
5 #### Came as expected ... Hope I never have to find out if it works
5 #### this is one of my favorite tools , its come in handy countless times . flooring , siding , deck work , general farm work . everybody should be issued one at birth . always ready , this is the best tool stanley has ever made . do n't loan it out you might not get it back .
5 #### Noticed those tiny worm - like mosquito larvae wiggling around in my bird bath . Sprinkled a tea spoon in , and next day ... no wiggling around . Everything stopped moving . Time will tell if it affects the wild birds .
2 #### I do n't like the lock button , too hard to lock . I just purchased the Klein Tools 86375 Double Hook Magnetic Tape Measure , 7.5 - Meter . Much better . Has a quick hold function on the bottom as well as a easy to use lock button .
4 #### Just another favorable review of one of my favorite power tools ... The weight is right , the handle angle is right , plenty of power , and it works every time . I bought this saw to replace a cheap DIY - special Black and Decker and the difference was a revelation ( of course , any professional - quality tool would have been a revelation ) . The saw has lived in indignity under my side bench for years , getting hauled out for a variety of tasks . I am a woodworker hobbyist and amateur household carpenter . I use this saw for the occasional garden shed , rough - cutting sheet goods , and to make sets and furniture for theatrical productions ( I married an actress ) . In my light - duty work the saw is a marvel . I can not speak to its suitability for a professional framer , but it works great for me . As a side note , I kind of lust after the left - bladed Porter - Cable , but I worry about safety . Is a left - handed blade more dangerous for a right - handed woodworker ? You can see the blade more easily , which sounds good to me , but it would put the blade much closer to my left hand ( i.e. , my movable clamp ) . Just a question for thought ...
4 #### I purchased one of these at a garage sale . First time I used it we smoked turkey legs , chicken , and ribs . The only problem I encountered was when we were finished using it ; I tried to unplug it from the extension chord and could not . The plug was melted to the extension chord . Also , the extension chord was burning hot . I did not see any deficiencies with any parts or in the chords I used , and although I could repair it , I do n't want to experiment with burning down my house . So , after contacting Brinkmann , I have decided to convert it into a charcoal smoker . Just be cautious when using this guy .
5 #### Great product ! Love the way my cakes bake up . The larger size accommodates large cakes , unlike some older bundt pans . You will not be disappointed . I have ordered three !
5 #### Brass Valves are more costly but they pay for themselves . I have used the cheapie PVC type and they only last about one season . You get what you pay for . I recommend these valves .
4 #### I 'm sorry -- I grew up the youngest of 9 and we had a dishwasher , but since I have been on my own ( I am 58 ) I have been washing my dishes in a sink . These crybabies who do n't like a product because they can not put it in a dishwasher are simply pathetic . I do n't like to be negative , but c'm on !
4 #### This device opens the can nicely but I find it awkward to use because you 're twisting the knob horizontally rather than vertically . My previous smooth edge opener operated vertically and it was more intuitive .
5 #### Wonderful mixing bowl . The spout makes it easy to pour and with a rubber spatula easy to get all the liquid out . I just use wooden spoons or rubber tools as I do n't want to scratch the insides . Heavy duty and the rubber bottom keeps the bowl from scooting around . The rubber at the top edge makes it easy to hold and also pour without losing your grip . Great addition to the kitchen tools .
2 #### I love how this kind of product works . I was disappointed with this brand . It leaks at connections . The version in solid brass from home depot , with additional lever shut off switches at each connection are far superior . If you can deal with leaky connections , these are really convenient . once attached to ends , everything connects and disconnects within one second .. effortless !
5 #### I really liked it it saved me a trip in chaotic lines at the store and it works as it supposed too . good quality product so far
5 #### The print quality is outstanding . I love this painting . I got it framed and hung it on our bedroom wall ; I never get tired of seeing it !
5 #### simple with a comfortable grip . Does what it supposed to . Exactly what i expect from Stanley tool brand
4 #### decent quality , seems like it will take some abuse and not fall apart like most others i have had .
1 #### I returned this item because I am an old person who does not have the physical strength to work this product . Also they look very dangerous , if I were younger I would say formidable , but at my age just dangerous .
5 #### I have five feeders and these were the very best . No leaks and when I bring them in to refill them they do n't leak all over my floor . I 've replaced all the other feeders with these and bought one for a friend . I 've gone through many other types of feeders and love these because they 're big and my Hummies go through the food very quickly and the little critters can land and drink while taking a break . Have brought me many happy hummie hours .
5 #### Exactly like the one I have used for over 20 years
5 #### Bought for edge treatment on cabinet doors . It works great and cuts smooth . Freud bits cut very smooth and will last .
5 #### Produced a great flavor . Family loved it because it produced a less smoky flavor . Some woods are too strong for them .
5 #### I keep this open all the time and use it for weeding . Just pull it around from place to place and put my garden scraps in there . We do n't have a city service for yard waste so I just dump in the trash when full . Do n't put hard objects inside , though - it will put holes in it .
5 #### The squirrels really like eating this food,,,although to be honest,,,I think there could have been a lot more peanuts added to the bag,,,it was mostly corn and sunflower seeds , , ,
4 #### looks good on pool deck . Ca n't wait to use the wind chill dial here it Tampa FL LOL
5 #### When I purchase my sander , I debated between the 3 x 21 and the 4 x 24 . Looking back , I 'm glad I purchased the smaller of the two . For a much lower price , I got a belt sander that handles all of my rough sanding needs . The 7 amp motor is extreemly strong and handles quick material removal with ease . I like the swiveling dust bag and the cord on the top of the handle . This keeps the bag away from your hands and the cord up off of the work surface and away from the sanding belt . Overall , I got even more for my money that I originally thought .
5 #### I live in a very hilly area of Wisconsin . This product is very useful in proviving a great amount of safety for the user . Great price and fast delivery .
4 #### Purchased this Hammock and it works perfectly . I would highly recommend this product and seller . No issues , very high quality product , as expected . Would rate a five , but reserve those for ungodly excellence , which is basically unattainable so you should understand .
2 #### For some reason this spinner does not really take out most of the water of the leafs . I find I have to use a paper towel to absorb the rest of the water . Going to try the smaller version and see if that works .
3 #### This is okay , but I found it difficult to set up . Those tiny pins are a chore fir me to push in or pull out . And I can never remember if they need to go in or out for the times I want the product to go on or off . The instructions should be printed on the back of the timer for convenience and bad memories . lol But otherwise , for a normal person , it 's an okay product . Price is reasonable too . So not that bad . Seems durable enough also .
5 #### Not a oregon brand , see how quick they fill up
5 #### It helps save energy and it will last a lifetime . Great product to have in the kitchen for cooking . Simple to use and fantastic .
1 #### I purchased my grass hog 700 last summer . I had no problems until I tried using it today . It advances line much to quickly I blew through 2 pre - wound spools . The line got jambed under the spool housing , I got the whole thing pulled apart and cleaned out some melted line in the works . I got it reassembled and try to go back to cutting old dead grass and the line fouls again . I 'm done with B&D weed wackers- I 've just ordered a Poulan .
5 #### I have half a dozen or so routers , mostly PC , but also a large Dewalt plunge router and a smooth Makita with standard and plunge bases . More often than not I pick up one of the PC 690s because they 're perfect for almost anything . I bought the 7518 for router table and a Shop Fox W1736 over arm router . The 7518 is huge compared to most things , and running by hand on really large projects like a boat or bar top might make sense , but it 's the ideal stationary router . Has huge bearings and tons of torque . Pretty expensive but it will out live me !
5 #### I always wanted a bundt pan to make monkey bread . Now I got one , also this pan is great and non stick . Very nice .
5 #### I have been feeding the birds for the fast couple of winters . I thought they might like something to drink . I ordered the de - icer , the birds loved it . I was a little nervous when the birds where splashing around in the water when it was below 0 but they where fine ... very happy that I bought it .
3 #### I like it yet there already seems to be rust particles developing inside the water reservoir . Makes great coffee but I 'm not sure about the longevity or authenticity if it rusts after less than a week of use .
5 #### It is Stanley ; it is durable , and it is a 35 ' long tape . Exactly as advertised and I am very pleased .
5 #### I have had this one for 2 years . I fried it yesterday by plugging in the timer with a high load already attached . I was probably exceeding it 's designed limits since new . I ordered another one .
5 #### For years I struggled with wire whisks I could n't use on my non - stick cookware -- whisking things in separate bowls , or when I had to whisk in a pan , making sure not to touch the sides or bottom of the pan or pot . Finally , I bought these silicone coated whisks and they 're fantastic . No more worrying or being careful about my non - stick pot . If something needs whisking while it 's on the stove , I can just dive right in with the silicone whisk . It makes me wonder why I took so long to buy one .
5 #### Hopefully I am not the only one who thinks peeling is fun with this tool . I absolutely love it . The best peeler I have ever had !
5 #### These reusable liners make everything slide right off . They are easy to clean up . I love them . Well worth the price .
4 #### Nice little light , not so bright it wakes up spouse , but it 's not easy to attach to magazines or newspapers that flop . Better with hardback books .
4 #### Permethrin is a very effective and non toxic ( for humans ) insect repellent . It can kill insects but over time as its strength dissipates on the clothing or other area it continues to serve as a repellent . On clothing it can be diluted 20 to 1 for a 0.5 % solution and applied with a garden sprayer for a very cheap clothing treatment . I recently us 3 oz . of this solution diluted to make 60 ounces of solution and treated 6 pairs of slacks , 5 pairs of shorts , 12 pairs of socks , 8 shirts , and 2 hats at a cost of less than $ 2 in solution . Buy this 10 % or a stronger concentration and you can treat clothes for pennies . Pre - mix 0.5 % spray is more than 20 times the cost of concentrated permethrin . The spray needs to thoroughly coat the clothing to be effective and it lasts for 6 or more washings or one year , whichever comes first . No reason to apply at a greater strength unless you actually plan to wash the clothes every week over the course of the year . Effective against ticks and sand fleas ( used by US Army in Kuwait , Afghanistan , Iraq , and soon in Libya ) to control the disease spread by these insects . With malaria bearing mosquitoes now found in more than 25 states in the US it is a good at home control method as well as being great for use on clothing worn outside the USA .
3 #### I guess the width is based on the fan blades instead of the overall fan . It 's much larger then 12 " and does n't quite fit where I wanted to use . I like the quality of the fan and will find a place for it .
5 #### Good quality cut . Nothing too special , cuts like it should , holds an edge well , and is cheap .
5 #### I really like this bowl . The weighted bottom keeps it from tipping over and it is made of nice , tough material .
5 #### I purchased a set of these for myself a few years back and loved them . When my teenage son told me he wanted to borrow my Bible because of the tabs , I ordered a set for him . They came and when I gave them to him , he was able to quickly figure out how to use the instructions and the guide to line the tabs up neatly . He was a happy guy when the job was complete . I definitely recommend these tabs .
4 #### Served my purposes . But if you are looking for a specific metal you will need a more advanced model .
4 #### Got this for my Flowtron bug zapper . One tube burned out so I had to replace it . At least the Flowtron bug zapper lasted longer than a couple weeks like the Stinger bug zapper I got last summer .
4 #### I bought one of these a few years ago and put it away until I moved to a new home . I just ran across it several months ago . I introduced it to my husband who loves using it . I bought nine more to give as gifts this past Christmas . Everyone has told me they enjoy using it . I like using it . It works really well and it is easy to clean .
4 #### See my review of the 30 minute version of this unit . I would give this timer exactly the same rating . It replaced a 23 year old timer of the same type and maker .
3 #### I use it w / out the flimsy plastic piece on my flex hose it works fine for soft wood .
5 #### These bags seem to be a bit expensive ; however , their capacity is quite phenomenal . They keep the shop air clean .
5 #### Certainly will catch those nasty little bugs that you need to get rid of .
5 #### Great little pressure cooker , built to last , simple as can be .
1 #### the lock / unlock slide , pinches hand between the slide lock and against the other handle ( the lock slide stays attached to one side , sliding up and down , and it pinches skin against the other handle when using cutters wheither the slide is in lock or unlock mode , it pinches in either position when cutting or pruning ) . they are not as sharp as other brands either . just not a commercial or ' use on a regular basis ' type of product . the pinching will make you throw them in the garbage , the cutting is actually not too bad , but i only use these for emergency , when i ca n't find my other pair .
5 #### I purchased these after buying and returning the Oshlun 6 " dado set . Look for my review of the SDS-060 on that product 's page . This set is beefy and as far as I can tell is high quality , the same of other Freud 's products . I have not used it yet but will update once I have made some cuts . This is my first dado set and I am confident it will produce great results . For those worried about cutting to ' nominal thickness ' or undersized plywood , it included instructions for 1/4 " to 7/8 " in 32nd increments . That was one of my concerns as the product packaging is n't exactly clear about the 1/32 " increments .
5 #### We always forgot to either turn our lights on or off . No more ! On at dusk , off after a preset delay or at dawn . Also has a manual override too .
5 #### Has a great edge , very nice sheath , feels good in the hand . Sharpens easily .
4 #### These works well , but the handles are so big , you could use two hands ... Perfect if you have a cauldron ...
3 #### Start your recipe in a cold oven in your muffin pans and use the cupboard space for something else you can buy with your $ $ .
5 #### NICE AND BIG , JUST AS I WANTED . I DID THINK IT WAS RATHER EXPENSIVE , BUT YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR .
5 #### Nicholson is the quality file standard . The best quality and durability files on the planet I have found thus far . I have tried cheaper files , but I have learned that , at least in files , you definately get what you pay for . I use this for all sorts of metal manipulation , but mostly to touch of my chainsaw chain cutting depth guages as the chains wear . Do not go cheap on your files . The cheaper ones are junk . Pay a little extra for this baby you will be glad you did . Besides the amazon price for these are very good .
2 #### Not the Zinc Pistol Grip Nozzle your grandpa used . This hunk of pot metal is painted a glossy battleship grey . It works . I did n't have time to send it back or I would have .
5 #### Product as described , delivered on schedule . Worked well to eliminate a fungus gnat problem when combined with " Gnat Nix ! " topping .
4 #### i use this for rifle and pistol brass,,good for organizing and can stack nicely
5 #### Used this in conjunction with a KREG Deck Jig and screws . This tool works exceptionally well and really helps keep the boards aligned while screwing them down . Makes a deck project a 1 person job .
5 #### After ordering this product it came properly packaged and I was excited to receive and try it out . This item is as the directions or the descriptions states it is and the use thereof . I have since enjoyed every minute of using this item and like new item it takes minor adjustments but overall I am happy with my purchase and I d highly recommend it others , thank you for a great product .
5 #### I almost did n't order this because several reviews complained about the feeder contantly falling off of the window . I ve had my feeder for 6 weeks . Its been through heavy rain , high winds and freezing temperatures . It has NEVER come off the window its attached to . The only problem I ve had is having to fill it up everyday and no , it does nt leak
5 #### Great Microtip shears and the nonstick coating makes trimming resin / sap producing plants / shrubs / trees a breeze . Blade clean up easily after use and stay sharp . I have regular micro - tip fiskars that are awesome as well but I use the regular sheers on " drier " plants .
3 #### Too small to read at a far distance . Had to move it closer to the house . Also , as the temperature gets down to about 30 degrees the needle seems to disappear . Should also have considered my husband 's red / green color issues .
5 #### we always put extra stuff in our ground to help our plants grow and they are looking good
5 #### Very happy for this inexpensive quick square made of metal and a lip on one side to line up edges quick and easy . Much better than my plastic one purchased from local hardware store for more $ $ .
5 #### Nice , heavy , high quality , and just what I needed to replace the old , cheap one that I finally broke !
5 #### Exactly what I needed , I had one before but lost it in the move to a new house . Thank you .
5 #### This is an ideal size for roses . You can cut the small stems for cut flower and also the bigger canes when heavier pruning is needed . I like that they will sell replacement blades . I sharpen mine often and after a few dozen times they need to be replaced . This time I treated myself to a whole new pruner and love it .
5 #### This saw is fairly large and takes a little getting used to . It cuts on the pull stroke and so has a very fine flexible blade . Does a great job on plain old firing and also on hardwoods . Indispensable addition to the shop although it is moderately large and takes some effort to find a good place for storage . The current handle is plastic and does n't see to be particularly sturdy but no signs on any problems so far . A great tool but like power tools should only be used by kids with direct supervision .
5 #### Nice gloves . Soft leather but so far have been quite durable .
5 #### Makes taco night super special ! great for those that are watching their weight . Shell 's have a nice crisp baked taste , without the added calories . Would order again .
5 #### Love XOXO products . This is no exception and can be placed in the dishwasher for easy cleanup . No slip handle is perfect . Would definitely recommend !
1 #### USING ONLY A 400GPH PUMP , FILTER LEAKS LIKE A SIVE , NO MATTER HOW TIGHT THE LID IS.can imagine what would happen with a 500gph pump . might work better if the lid had a rubber gasket ....
3 #### The lid was bought for another pool that did not have it 's own cover . What I did not know , was that there are holes in the top that are big enough to let pieces of leaves and dirt inside .
5 #### This is an excellent knife for some one who needs a small paring knife . The handle is comfortable and a good grip , does nt slip when wet or your hands are geasy . The edge is compact enough to manuver easily around bones and is sharp enough to easily slice any meat or veggie I ve tried it with . This is my 3rd henckel Twin 4 star and i ca nt say I ve discovered anything I do n't like about any of them . The price is a bonus for a really great knife . For an all around quality knife that you do n't have to worry about the edge ( as with a ceramic knife ) I do n't think you can beat the value . Did I mention it holds its edge . A professional quality knife at a bargain price .
4 #### Fairly easy to put together and holds the weight fine . But when the wheels are down the base still has wobble in it that my shop fox base does n't . But , I like the fact that two of the wheels on this go up and down , shop fox does n't offer that .
1 #### I really like the nylon version of these spatulas . This metal one , however , is good for flipping a quarter sized pancake . It 's just way too flexible to be useful . Disappointed .
5 #### Lots of fun , guests at parties are entertained at refrigerator and interacting together creatively ND laughing the entire time !
5 #### This gasket fits an old Mirro canner that I 've used for over 30 years . Nice to know I do n't have to run all over the country trying to find a gasket .
5 #### I use router bits everyday all day long . I 'm usually hesitant to buy Freud bits because they are expensive but every time I buy one it makes me realize why they are expensive . They cut exceptionally smooth and last much longer than the rest . I suppose eventually I will learn to buy Freud everytime
5 #### So far after a cord I like this axe . The wood explodes when you split it . Light weight unit is very sharp and easy to swing . 36 " length takes some getting used too . The handle seems tough . Blade does hold an edge , but it is very hard . It may be brittle so use a good chopping block under your wood . A well designed and built axe . I am surprised and pleased , so far .
5 #### These are my favorite pruners , but I feel they are overpriced at the current approximately $ 47 price . You could easily buy two to four other pruners for this price , and I really think you should buy others because I think you would waste ( wear out ) these on repetitive and abundant pruning if you have lots and lots of general pruning to do , as I do in Maine . I try to use mine only on harder brush type plants , like roses and rosa rugosas , and even then they do about 85 % great cuts . For my other general pruning I use my cheaper pruners ( Fiskars ) . I paid $ 37 ( and I thought that was crazy ) two years ago so if you buy them now you appear to be paying extra for the currency drop of the dollar . I saw these pruners being used at a local nursery and asked to try them . Do the same if you can to see if they provide that much of a better cut over cheaper priced , but still good , other pruners , especially at this price .
1 #### DOES NOT WORK ON THE 7491 SAW ! ! ! Watch out . On Amazon thoe are paired together . Returning mine today
5 #### Exact replacement for original . No issues . Good as new . Just throw away the messy filter and you are good to go .
5 #### Never seen on the local market . Excellent quality priced right .
4 #### These little granules work great and last a long time ! I will definitely be buying these regularly for my rain barrels !
5 #### They seem to work just fine at a good price
3 #### I am only giving this espresso maker three stars because of the following issues : the silver coating on the metal part of the unit that cooks on the stove is starting to peel off , and I only made roughly 20 batches of espresso with it . Secondly , my electric coils turn black where the metal part of this espresso machine rests while cooking . I 'm concerned that my electric coil is going to burn out . None of my other stainless steel pots turn my stove coil rings black while cooking like this espresso pot does . I 'm currently looking for another espresso stovetop pot that is a 100 percent high grade stainless steel construction with no painted on coating . Frankly , in my opinion , this esspresso pot is made of very cheap aluminium with a very cheap silver coating of some type of paint -- it looks like it was in China , not Italy .
5 #### I love popcorn and have n't had a popper in a very long time ( I 've been using microwave popcorn ) . This machine made excellent popcorn . I used jolly time popcorn and it tasted wonderful . Most of the kernels were popped and I did not use the butter dispenser because I do n't like buttered popcorn . I loved the circular motion at the bottom of the container because I did n't have to do anything but plug in the machine . It washes up easily and ready for the next usage .
5 #### I do n't understand how OXO can figure out how to make the most simple tools comfortable to use . Their design and quality are dependable to be one notch ( or more ) above the competition . A go - to brand that does n't disappoint . Using a teaspoon , I struggled making small new - potatoes twice baked . This melon baller works perfectly !
5 #### The bowl works great . I used it to mix pancake batter with a mixer . Did great .
5 #### Just as described , latch replaced old one perfectly and works good
5 #### My computer desk is in an area that is n't in the open so there 's a lot of places for fleas to hide , and with a few cats in the house that go near this area , I was getting bitten on the legs whenever I sat down at the desk . Treating the cats with Advantage reduced the problem on them , but did n't get rid of the fleas on the floor . After I put the flea trap in the desk area the pad was filling up ... IN ONLY A FEW DAYS ! And best thing for me is I was n't getting bitten on my legs when I sat at the desk . Now I changed the glue pad and here and there some get trapped , most did in the first few days . I 'm glad I got it . One comment , I saw on here placing duct tape under a lamp would do the same thing , I disagree ! The glue pad seems a bit stickier than duct tape , the night light is mounted under a cover so paper or debris ca n't fall on it and cause a fire , the glue pad has a grid cover on top of it so if paper or debris falls on it the grid will keep it from sticking , I imagine the light is mounted in the best position and distance from the pad to lure fleas in and the light is only a couple inches from the floor , close to where the fleas are . And it worked great for me .
5 #### This is a good router base plate for the price range . It does n't seem to be perfectly level by itself , but with the weight of the router attached it flattens out . It comes with an assortment of hardware to assist in attaching to a table . I made a custom router table with the plate . The process is documented at the following link . [ ... ] Definitely recommend .
5 #### My brother purchased one of these at a trade show for almost double what it sells for here . After I saw it , I had to have one too . This thing is put together very well , with quality parts and good fit and finish . If you have the water pressure , using this will probably allow you to roll a small dog or cat down your driveway ( not that you should , but you 'd be able to ) ! Operation is smooth and it 's comfortable in the hand . Made in China .
5 #### I do like the grass catcher . However it does not catch all the grass all the time . Some grass will fly over the back . But it does catch 80 % or so of the grass cut . That is me walking at a normal pace . It is easy to attach to a reel mower , no special tools are needed to attach it . I would not hesitate to buy this product again .
4 #### Smooth and much easier on the hands than one of those dollar store cheap openers . Durable .
3 #### Kinda small but if it works could be worth the price
5 #### A little liquid . I like soy and vinegar along with crushed garlic , granulated onion and powdered bay leaves . Makes flavor to the bone , moist tender chicken without the work . Using a 4 lb bird it even fit on my Weber performer with the required inch at the top . * * * * * * * P E R F E C T * * * * * * *
5 #### This method is must easier than boiling water and waiting for sugar to dissolve . Our hummingbirds did n't seem to notice when we switched .
5 #### Makes washing and drying veggies SO much easier ! ! ! Works amazingly and wo n't go back to hand washing again !
5 #### Works well for longer measures without the need for another body .
5 #### Was originally a little hesitant to try a rope hammock over a padded hammock . The duracord is very comfortable and durable . Stretches a bit after use but just enough to give it that " broken in feeling " . We live in the Pacific Northwest and it dries very quickly .
5 #### Very nice trellis better than I expected and very easy to put together .
1 #### WASTE OF MONEY ON THIS CHEAPO PLASTC FAN . HAD TO RETURN IT .
3 #### This is more a review of using a router - table to make box - joints . However , I bought this bit specifically to make box joints . I am using Incra 's original jig with their fence and right - angle attachment . As you probably know , the right - angle attachment is n't firmly attached to anything , it merely slides along the fence . I bought this bit so that I could begin making box - joints . But is has n't worked out . As soon as the bit touches the stock , it yanks the right - angle fence / stock forward . It 's disconcerting to say the least . I am sure I will find other uses for the bit .
5 #### I FIRST SAW THIS STYLE WHISK / WHIP USED BY MY FAVORITE COOKBOOK AND FOOD NETWORK CHEF REE DRUMMOND - THE PIONEER WOMAN ...... NEVER REALIZED THE MYRIAD OF USES FOR THIS TYPE OF WHISK ... I AM IMPRESSED - SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN ONE YEARS AGO ! GREAT PURCHASE , VERY FAIR PRICE , SPEEDY SHIPPING AND PRACTIVAL USAGE -- U CAINT BEAT THAT WITH A STICK ! !
5 #### Great melody whatever Tuscany should sound like . Very well made and responds to the lightest wind which may be good or bad . The mail carrier even commented on the great sounds that it produces ..
2 #### Guess I got the remnant remnants . Double ended male fitting makes what I received different to what is shown and quite useless without additional fittings .
5 #### Just like my Mama 's . Ca n't wait to try it for the holidays .
5 #### I purchased this item a year now . This pretty leather knife roll bag with bellcro strap works good , and all my knives are safe and secure , but you have to put your knife with edge guard , so it wo n't damage or cut your roll bag .
4 #### Use it almost every day . Great tool only taking away one star due to the adjustment screw does nt seem to stay tight all the time so I have to double check more often than I would like to that its set before marking out .
5 #### Yes , it is a whisk . I have owned many . I asked for one for Christmas that would be safe for my non stick cookware . It is small . But it works . I use it to make scrambled eggs in the pan . I have a nylon whisk and it is a pain in the a$$ to clean after eggs . You ca n't run it through the dishwasher because it wo n't come clean . This whisk is non - stick or magical ! Cooked eggs come right off . I even left it with cooked eggs on it for two days just to see if they 'd come off . Literally rinsed off . I have time back in my life ! ! And absolutely no chance these are going to damage my new non - stick pans ! Size wise the 9 " is like a mini whisk . I may order the 11 " too . I do not like to buy the expensive utensils . Most of the time there is no point . Just paying for a name . But this whisk is worth the price and the fact I am not spending 5 minutes scrubbing each individual whisky thing . Splurge buy this whisk especially if you cook eggs like I do ! It is magic !
5 #### Okay , bought this one recently to deter bugs for a graduation party . Had to clean the thing three times the first day , it literally took out thousands of mosquitos in one evening ! ! Of course to clean it you need to use an air compressor to remove the dead bugs that do not fall . I have several other units which are the Stinger brand but the Flowtron way out does them in performance .
5 #### I have not used the blades much but from what I did they work well . The price is right for a nice set of blades
2 #### what you would expect for a cheap handle , a cheap handle . cracked after a week . better to spend a few bucks more and get a fiberglass or plastic handle .
5 #### This ended up being better then I expected . Its not flimsy as I thought , great heavy duty . Easy to put on . Glad to know I wo n't have to empty this pool now to store away for the winter .
4 #### These seemed a little large for my mini hang - it - up shop vac . It 's the first time I 've bought these . Maybe user error , but I 'd be ok if they fit a little better .
5 #### Like the instructions say , you do n't want to put this thing near where your sitting because it attracts a ton of bugs . It took it a few days to cut down on the mosquito population - mosquitoes are n't attracted to the light but to a small thing that attaches to the bottom . Also it does a wonderful job getting rid of the pesky insects that hover around the exterior lights at night .
1 #### I bought 16 pounds of this stuff ... The RATS LOVE IT and keep coming back for more . They 're becoming like pets .... this stuff does n't kill them it just feeds them
5 #### Writing my review now because I 'm back to buy a second one . Love it ... very thin like parchment , and reusable ( so no more buying parchment ) . Better than parchment because it does n't roll up at the edges and curl / ripple in the oven . I use this for making macarons and they release cleanly and perfectly every time . Randomly found this on Amazon myself and have never heard anyone talk about them and I ca n't figure out why either . I think it 's the best fusion of parchment and silpat . Would definitely recommend to friends / family and anyone making french macarons .
5 #### The container is much smaller than I expected when I bought it . However , i 've used this several times and had reasonable success with this . Of course , make sure you read up on how to root a plant , etc before you use this . Overall , good product .
4 #### One of the larger ones broke while making " pizza pockets " . The hinges could use a bit tougher plastic . Other then that they function well enough .
5 #### Only bags I will use . No dust out the blower port !
3 #### Three stars for great werner ladder but that 's why I bought it I knew it was a good product .. Ladder came damaged and looked as if I had used it for work for two years already .
5 #### Great item for removing the core from apples . I 've been searching for one like this and it does n't disappoint . I like that it 's dishwasher safe , too .
5 #### I have only been using this for about a week , but it feels great and chops through anything with ease .
5 #### Exactly what i was looking for . Not physically or visually too obtrusive .
5 #### Purchased 8 steak knives to complete set as Christmas gift for my daughter . She was very pleased , as was I.
4 #### Bought this because we were moving and needed to measure our new furniture to fit . This came to help us out greatly . Long enough to measure any wall or furniture , but also heavy duty enough to withstand the many falls it has taken since it was delivered .
5 #### Use for clam bakes , frying turkeys , steamers . We took it to a large gathering to cook 72 hot dogs , the pot started boiling in minutes and everyone was happy . Plenty of heat for any occasion .
5 #### this is a really great book light and works with the kindle 2 . there are two light levels , and clips easily to my kindle 2 case / cover . the battery cover is easy to open and close . it uses 3 AAA batteries which are easy to obtain so no obscure batteries to find . the flexible neck on the light is very well fashioned . all in all this is a great reading light .
5 #### These things work ! We had a bad flea season in 2013 and I do n't like spraying alot of chemicals in the house as my wife is sensitive to chemicals smells . Turn these on every night and it captured all sorts of critters in the dark . highly recommend .
5 #### I like this product for what it is but more so because of the flat handle . I store my spoons in a utensil carrier and this fits in very well . there are so many that have handles that take up more space than is needed .
5 #### This is nice and sharp ! The size is good for even big apples . Our last slicer broke so I chose a different brand and am happy I did . The ' profile ' is flat enough that it does n't jam our drawer which is handy !
5 #### I 'm happy with this level . It seems true , is light weight , and the price was very reasonable .
5 #### Good shears , no wobble , lock works , sharp . I 've cut up to 1/3 " stem easily . Good value for the price .
5 #### I love these racks . They are strong . They do n't dip in the middle , and cookies or muffins do n't stick . quality is just exceptional
5 #### This peeler is excellent and so buttery smooth I could n't hardly believe it ! I had to stop peeling potatoes a couple times to look at the blades . I 've been peeling potatoes at home for over 30 years and used various peelers and paring knives and this one is the best ever . The peels do n't get stuck on top of the blades like other peelers . I also peeled carrots with the same ease and smoothness . I recently tried the highly reviewed dual julienne peeler and had to return it right away . I did a side by side comparison with the OXO comparable Kitchen Aid swivel peeler and the OXO wins hands down . This is a great peeler with a great price , you do n't get that combination too often !
5 #### The one I got was exactly like the 7 or 8 others I have . This is not the Harbor Freight / Made in China knock - off . Easy to use f(lock and release ) and the design does have detail too . Not a casting . I 'd buy another before Irwin subs it to the Pacific rim .
1 #### Significantly louder on low speed than the Lasko # 3723 20 " Premium box fan . In fact , it 's a loud fan by any standard . I ca n't believe they put " Three Whisper - Quiet speeds " in the description here . Do n't expect to sleep near it if you ca n't sleep with excessive noise , even on low it 's terrible . Go with # 3723 for the bedroom .
5 #### Woodpeckers love these .... so do the raccoons ! I guess we feed them both in the winter !
4 #### We actually purchased this as an extra layer of protection for our duck pen . We had already covered the pen in 1inch chicken wire , however we wanted something with a smaller opening to deter snakes . This stuff works really well . It 's much sturdier than I would have guessed and we were able to wrap the entire pen with it to give it an extra barrier against snakes and other predators . I would not recommend it on it 's own as a ' fencing ' because it would n't hold up against dogs and raccoons , but it will keep out snakes and probably birds . My only issue was that it was folded in half and then rolled , so you have to struggle with it a bit to get the full seven foot height out of the roll . It would have just been easier if it would have come as it 's seven foot roll or had been rolled , then folded so we could have unrolled it easier .
5 #### exactly what i wanted . comes in a nice plastic case that you can hang . Blades seem like they are well made .
5 #### I live in Hawaii on the big island and have these installed at each corner of my house under the eaves . They are controlled by a timer inside the house . However they could be hooked up using a day / night light sensor and turn on only at night . They say not to install them close to the house , however , since we have a lot of bugs trying to get into the house trying to get to the bright lights , these do kill most of the bugs before they get inside .. We still get some bugs , but not like before and having them running across the TV screen .
3 #### One side worked well , but they other leaks profusely . Disappointing .
5 #### I really wish I could find a 10 " model oof this .
5 #### I use the flat whip when making my pie crust or crumb topping . It is great to work in the shortening with the flour .
5 #### Nice little valve , I 'm using it as a control valve for my pool solar heater , very little power needed to open and close it . responds fast and the quality is to notch .
4 #### i get these often but never so inexpensive , they are imperitive to my dremel tool i love em and am sure you will too
5 #### It 's simple and works very well . The handle wo n't burn or melt if you use it on a small burner and do n't let the flame run up the sides . Rinse out the bottom chamber soon after using , the chamber stays hot and any remaining water will evaporate and leave deposits on the bottom . Do n't put it in the dishwasher or scrub off the surface treatment and it wo n't turn black . It needs an air tight seal between the bottom and top chamber , Make sure no grounds are on the seal . It takes a little time to get the water to boil but once it does the brew process is over in seconds . Stand watch and remove from the heat immediately . Very close to genuine espresso for very little money .
5 #### quick delivery , good quality , very sharp , working well . I like it .
5 #### We have a horrible feral cat problem in our neighborhood , and our sandy playground area in our background is a haven for cats who choose to relieve themselves . The Scarecrow has been our perfect response . With hose hooked into this device and a 9V battery , cats are extremely wary about approaching our background , much less actually be brave enough to venture into it . The fact that it does n't require an outlet and that a 9V battery is sufficient to run it is spectacular . The senstitivity of the motion sensor ( which works better at tracking movements from left - to - right rather than to / from ) can be adjusted to whatever size target you want it to spot . Higher sensitivities will track cats and smaller critters , lower sensitivities will only trigger if humans walk through the field of view . The water projects a pretty good distance , approximately 30 feet although we 're not sure if higher ranges could be accommodated or not . Highly recommend !
4 #### Great timer . Jumper wires are just long enough and I mean just . I would recommend making your own a little longer . Install was fairly easy . I do electronics for a living . Follow the diagram provided and not the labeled cover in the box . They do not match . The diagram is correct
5 #### I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR ME AND I LOVE IT . I FEEL SO HAPPY WHIT THIS PRODUCT IT WOKS PERFECTLY . I RECOMEND THIS ITEM IT CAME TO MY HOUSE ON TIME . GREAT SUPPORT .
5 #### At first glance most folks would thing this was an antiquated disconnect because of the plug fuses . Actually it is a very economical disconnect that can be used for home use in many applications . The ability for it to use different types of screw in plug fuses makes it very unusual . If you need a tutorial on screw in plug fuses just search Bob Formisano Fuses 101 , and you will find an article that details which fuses are used for various purposes . I used this to protect my submersible 1 HP well pump . It had a 30 amp breaker in the main panel to protect the 10 gauge wire ran to the pump , but by the time that breaker would throw my pump would be ruined . Also , occasionally a breaker will fail and bleed a small amount of current through . This disconnect uses a knife switch that ensures that all current is interrupted . I installed this disconnect near the well pump head with 15amp Type T fuses that will pop and save my well pump if a problem ensues . We use Amazon for most of our purchases and I update my reviews if anything changes with the products . I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product . I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own .
5 #### This is a real nice roller , easy to put together and just right for our yard , It flattens those mole runs like nothing . I have even loaned it to a couple of the neighbors and they like it to , just the right size for my LT-150 John Deere to pull . very happy with it .
5 #### On my second one after breaking the first ( my fault , yanked the head off ) .
5 #### Veggie people will love this . It is sturdy , very easy to use , and more effective at drying lettuce , etc . than any spinner I have owned . The bonus is you can use it to store in the frig and it keeps salad beautifully . Highly recommend .
5 #### After seeing some of the reviews on this Dewalt DW911 radio and the reception issue I was a little worried it would n't work in my rural area . I found it pulls in FM radio stations from 25 miles away and I have it inside a metal building most of the time and is better reception than I expected . Both AM and FM reception seems to be on par with every other radio in our area . Everybody in our shop has their own radio and listens to their own different station . My Dewalt 911 is now the envy of the shop and I can hear my radio above the other radios and all the other noise in the shop . I like the large speakers and although the bass may not be as great as a home system it sound is great and carries a long way which is what the radio was designed for . No problem with not having a CD either as I just plug in a CD to auxillary port if I want one . Maybe it is a little spendy for work radio but it helps pass the time at work and works great for me .
3 #### We have a lot of Yellow Jackets out here and I needed something easy to use . Since I hung this up the number of Yellow jackets I have seen have reduced . Would buy again and would recommend this product .
4 #### This is a great container for camping , or other events where you need to lift or lock containers . At 24 gallons it is not too heavy for a woman to lift when loaded and 2 of them hold all the basics for camping . Once they are unloaded at the campsite they can be used for seats ( for 200 - pounders ) , step stools , or wash basins for dirty dishes . If you drop them while they 're loaded they will not crack , unlike the clear plastic ones ( learned this the hard way ) . They are lockable and while I have never experienced human thievery while camping , I have experienced the raccoon version so to keep them out I thread long twist - ties through the padlock holes in the handles . I only wish they came in clear plastic , but other than that they are great .
5 #### I got this popcorn popper machine for a work team event . Everyone just Loved it ! i used to think microwave popcorn is great , the real popcorn is much better . and it is so much fun watchin the corns pop in front of you ! also it 's pretty each to clean . i think this product is great and i would recommend it
4 #### I have had a pair of these Vise - Grip pinch - off pliers for years and have found them to be very well made . The Yellow Jacket # 60666 are the exact same Vise - Grip branded pliers in a blister pack with their name on it which YJ sells at a substantial markup . These pliers have a maximum 1/2 " tubing capacity , but I find that I usually need to take multiple bites and readjust the tension screw between each pinch to close off a line that size . With smaller lines like 1/4 " though , I can often pinch them closed with just one good squeeze of the handles .
5 #### Increasing the capacity of your band saw opens up many possibilities . The Jet block worked well on a 14 " Rockwell machine .
5 #### Well worth to cost , very high quality bits . If you want bits that cut smooth and will last and last get Freud bits . All of the Freud bits I have purchased are of the same high value .
5 #### This popover pan is a life saver if you like making popovers , which I do . I have tried making them in muffin pans but they just are n't the same . I thought there was something wrong with the recipe or with me but , lo and behold , it was the pan . This popover pan makes a huge difference in the rise and browning of your popovers . I am very pleased with this pan and would highly recommend it .
5 #### I PURCHASED THE COOK 'S ESSENTIALS PROGRAMMABLE ELECT . PRESSURE COOKER ( MODEL PC400 ) FROM [ local store ] RECENTLY . IT 'S A DEAD RINGER FOR THE FARBERWARD MODEL ( FPC400 ) ; SAME CAPACITY , ETC . I AM MOST PLEASED WITH IT , BUT WOULD PREFER A 6 QT . CAPACITY . THE RECIPES THAT CAME WITH IT WERE EXTREMELY FEW . I'VE USED THE STANDAR TOP - OF - THE - STOVE COOKERS FOR YEARS ( AND LOVED THEM ) ; BUT THE ELECTRIC IS GREAT ( NO TENDING REQUIRED ) . THERE IS NO RACK INCLUDED WITH THIS MODEL ( WHICH I'D REALLY LIKE TO HAVE ) . THE MANUFACTURER SUGGESTED A PLASTIC HEAT RESISTANT RACK FOR USE . GUESS WHAT ; I CAN'T SEEM TO FIND ONE . DUE TO POSSIBLE ELECTRIC SHOCK , DIRECTIONS INDICATED NOT TO USE METAL IN THE COOKER ! AS AN ASIDE , SAW A REVERE ELEC . PRESS . COOKER THAT HAD A STAINLESS STEEL RACK INCLUDED . ANY COMMENTS / SUGGESTIONS ON THIS ISSUE WOULD BE MOST APPRECIATED .
5 #### This worked incredibly fast . I have a bunch of trap - door humane mouse traps which work great on little mice , but this time I had something bigger . I just threw in Duracell Ultras , tossed in some peanuts , and it worked over night -- a little light flashes so you know to take the thing outside and shake . It would be nice if it came with an optional quiet beeper to let you know it worked .
1 #### I bought this item feeling comfortable with the reliability of Woods products . This product simply did not work , period . Timer would nut turn even though unit was plugged in . I tried several outlets with no luck . I went online with Amazon to return the item and was told that this particular item was unreturnable . After communicating with Amazon chat they refunded my money on a one time basis . In other words , if I ordered a replacement item and the new item was faulty also , I was on my own . My recommendation : Do not buy .
5 #### Love it very well maid , the base is metal and the rest is maid of plastic but I think its aircraft grade its very well maid and has a lot of adjustments on it . You can adjust the spread or coverage area as well as the width . I ve had it all summer now and it works fantastic . I will purchase another if needed and will purchase from this vendor again .
5 #### Works really well . Tried these after the 12 yr . old Frost King cables died . Both Easy Heat and Frost King work well but Easy Heat runs a watt or so less per foot and were a really good buy on Amazon . Since testing this cable on one roof during the snowiest winter in MI , I added 4 more last year ( 2 - 160 ft , 1 - 80 ft , and 1 - 100 ft ) . 3 of them run can be turned on and off as needed . I turn them on when it snows and off after a warm up melts the snow off that part of the roof . It does cost between $ 30-$50 / mo . more in electric per month ( probably $ 6-$10 / mo per cable ) but nice not have to run out after a snow storm to rake the roof anymore . U just get too old for that :) For some reason , there was a review here under my name that I did NOT make . It has been deleted . Thank u for the comment that brought this to my attention . I just sent a email to Amazon to look into it . And yes , I DO know the difference between cable brands .
2 #### The finish it shipped with was pretty crappy . I had to spend a decent amount of time re - honing the blade / iron and flattening the base ( or sole , whatever it 's called ) . It 's really hard to do micro adjustments to the depth and more often than not my cuts are much deeper than I wanted . Lesson learned , spend money on a better quality plane and save myself a lot of time in the future .
5 #### These are really easy to turn on and off . I use them with some fruit trees . The trees only get water once every couple weeks , but are on a sprinkler zone with other shrubs that get water more often . When I want to water the trees , I turn on their bubbler heads and let it gently water them as long as necessary , then turn them back off .
5 #### I am rather new to woodworking after having not done very much in a number of years . I 'm amazed at the new tools and products that are making it easier to accomplish tasks much faster with better results that the old ways . Freud has always crafted quality tools and this one is no exception . Fast , sharp and easy to use bit . Glad I 'm spending the extra cash instead of trying to make an inferior bit work . Will keep buying the Freud bits one or two at a time until I get a complete set together . VERY HAPPY ! !
5 #### I get so frustrated when the other expensive fancy plastic nozzles break or leak . These are 100 % metal , inexpensive , and work great for years . What 's not to like ?
5 #### Good value for the money . Does exactly what it is supposed to do . Serrated edge OK to cut most pies . Easy to clean .
5 #### I really like the rubber handles and the fact that they are stainless steel . I keep them in my knife bag without worrying about damage .
5 #### Love this thing . Runs smoothly and does n't need you putting pressure on it for it to cut . Easy for me to use .
4 #### Handy cheese grater , one way , but two sizes . So far the handle holds it up for grating on a plate , but no attachment for on a bowl .
3 #### If you need an outfeed support for your Bosch table saw , this is it . There are not really any other alternatives . The design looks pretty good and the price is reasonable . The problem is in the manufacturing . Tolerances are WAY out of line . In order for this accessory to be usable , expect to drill & tap new 1/4 - 20 holes for the friction clamps , then order new 1/4 - 20 thumb screws to replace the ridiculously tiny ( and VERY loose ) screws that came with the unit . If you do this , the Outfeed support will function well . These issues are not what you expect for a tool with the Bosch name on it , not even close . Dan
5 #### The plate is well made and fits perfectly . Recommend to anybody who is thinking of getting a dado blade for the DW 744 .
2 #### Bought two . One broke before it was even hung up . The second one lasted about three weeks before it was completely full of water from rain leaking in , so overflowing stinky water on the area below .
4 #### I have just made my router table and so far so good . I 'm yet to find out if this will stand the test of time
4 #### Does what it is supposed to do well but keep in mind it is not meant to do large areas .
5 #### The last time I bought a salad spinner was in the 1990 's I use it all the time . Recently , my beloved one bit the dust ( in many different ways ) . I ordered the OXO Good Grips because I 've had great experiences with their products . Although unpacking was a bit like opening a Russian Matrushka Doll , 3 boxes to get to the product , I was very happy when I finally got to the end of it all . I love the clear , acrylic bowl - and yes , I have used it as a salad bowl . Why wash two things ? As others have said , it may take more than one pump to get the lettuce completely dry , but it 's so much easier than my old , crank - style , spinner . I look forward to a long and happy relationship .
5 #### Works . Removed the green algae . So I m growing barley for this and maybe BEER ?
4 #### Works good for fine dust collection but not good for metal grindings , will catch on fire with hot metal shavings . Connection on the smaller 5 gallon units is not great with its slip on over nozzle fit .
5 #### After three years of use on several major projects , this item gets 5 stars . Before purchasing , I researched and interviewed several professionals that used the Paslode Impulse Cordless Framing Nailer . I carefully read and understood the manufacturer 's technical material . Anyone that does likewise - and knows what to expect before they buy - should be well pleased with this tool . Jobs that once took all day to complete can now be finished in one hour . It 's the next best thing to hiring someone to do the job for you . Thanks , Paslode .
5 #### It 's a good plunger and it looks great . The little stand holder hides it away nicely and allows it to dry quickly . Not sure what people are talking about with the smell , but I rinse mine out pretty well . I do n't know ; if you do n't clean something that you cover in excrement , what do you think is going to happen ? No complaints , great purchase !
4 #### Perfect size . The insert only holds approx 5cups of liquid though . 2 quarts should hold 8 cups , so I am guessing the outer pot holds 8 cups , not exactly what I wanted but it still is good . If you are looking for a double boiler that holds 2 quarts you need to order a 3 quart that way the insert will hold 8 cups .
5 #### I have had my ShopVac for over five years now and I always found it a hassle when vacuuming out my car . I would have to roll it to one side and then pull it all the way around to get to the other side . Occasionally this would be impractical because my wife 's vehicle would be in the garage at the same time and there would be no room . With this new nozzle , the vacuum can remain in one central position in the garage and easily reach both sides of the car , both front and back seats as well . The extra long hose really makes a difference . I have also noticed that this nozzle produces a much more powerful suction than the one that came with the ShopVac . Even with a dirty filter the suction was strong . The only problem I had when I first got it was some difficulty getting the nozzle mounted onto the hose . It was so tight I thought that it might have been the wrong size . After awhile it finally slid on fully and I have no intention of ever taking it off . I highly recommend this product .
4 #### It arrived intact and on time , and does what it is supposed to do . The price is a bit high compared to the price of the original drill kit . But I am told the reason they can sell the kits so cheap is that the original batteries are not as good as the replacement batteries . Maybe , but we 'll see how long it holds a charge .
5 #### Works well and adjusts to with and length of coverage This is my second one and they hold up very well for years of leaving in all weather .
5 #### If you want the best always buy Purdy ! This is a very solid roller . I have always loved Purdy products and brushes .
4 #### Bought a shop - vac in the 80s and it use to use the what they call ' lunch bag ' filter for dust control and these are the new latest n greatest deals approbriately called ' coffee ' filters . What I did n't know is they require the foam filter to fit properly .
5 #### Fits my pool and I am very pleased with it .
5 #### These bins are the same dimensions as the one that came with my Hornady Progressive press . I would recommend these items for small parts catologing .
5 #### This is a great way to keep a big lawn watered . We have n't installed a sprinkler system yet but needed to plant some new grass . This kept it watered and is actually kind of fun to watch - my Grandkids thought it was " magic " !
5 #### It only takes a few seconds to pop a cylinder with this tool . Even if you only use it once or twice , it is worth it .
4 #### My scarecrow is great fun . I have it in line with my back window so I can see the results ! It 's hilarious to watch the squirrels try to avoid getting wet . If you are really mean , you can bait it with peanuts or pistachios that did n't open . You need to secure the hose fittings so you do n't waste water , and it 's a bit tricky to aim , but this can be overcome by trial and error . DON'T FORGET TO TURN OFF YOUR HOSE WHEN ADJUSTING FITTINGS , OR YOU'LL BE THE ONE GETTING WET . I ca n't wait for warmer weather to hook mine up for the season . Those bushy - tailed lawn wreckers had better beware ! If you can afford it , two that would aim a ' V ' shaped pattern on your lawn would be ideal . For the money , you ca n't buy more fun than a scarecrow or two .
5 #### All sizes you could need . All different types of substances can be cut with these five little blades . DeWalt quality is always worth every penny !
5 #### I had one of these for six years or more , a great product that worked well until I lost it .
3 #### I admit it was n't what I expected when I purchased it . I was expecting something a bit sturdier for flipping or scrapping things off of a pan / skillet . I find it works well for lifting and moving around light objects but for trying to do pancakes , meats , eggs , or things with a high density it just ends up caving it . cookies and baked goods on a flat tray is what this was made for . Flexible is the operable word since it is just a wobbly piece of metal soldered to a handle . Functional but very limited
5 #### I have owned my Turbo II vacuum for a number of years now , and I will admit that I was never willing to spend the money for these attachments . It is true that there are many lesser vacuums out there that include the tools , but I always told myself that I would rather have an awesome shop vac and no tools versus a so - so vac with tools . Recently , I finally coughed up the money for these attachments and I am thrilled to have so much more versatility when using a favored tool . I have had absolutely zero problems with any of the attachments . It is true that there are no " positive lock " mechanisms on the mating pieces , yet I have never had the attachments come apart even after hours of continuous use . I have cleaned our cars , sucked up sawdust , and vanquished cobwebs all to my great satisfaction . The adjustable " bristles " on the floor attachment make pulling stuff off of carpet ( such as dust / dirt / woodchips in a car trunk ) a painless task . If there is a downside , it is the lack of a convenient way to store these tools " onboard " the Turbo II machine ( as some other shop vacs offer ) . For now I am keeping the attachments in a drawer and the metal extension wands lean in a corner . But I guess this is more my problem than a criticism of this tool set . Overall I am thrilled with the performance of this product and I recommend its purchase without reservation !
5 #### Ca n't beat the price for these filters . This size was not available in local home stores in this model .
5 #### Like Hangtree , I have a rigid bandsaw and could n't find a fence anywhere . This fence fits with only one modification . The rigid table is about one inch too narrow . I drilled one hole on the fence itself , now it fits great . The resaw guide is a bit too far back as well , but I do n't do much resaw anyways . This fence is very sturdy and will make rigid and jet saw owners real happy .
4 #### I had high hopes for this base and honestly for me to be able to give it any stars is being kind . Lets say the parts seem to be beefy and well made . The base unfortunately was not able to be assembled because it was missing ALL of the hardware and the adjustable rubber feet . Hopefully I can get some replacement parts or a new base . I hate having to send stuff like this back . I will give it a day or two to see what happens.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Adjustable - Mobile - Base - for - Power - Tools - HTC-2000 - Give - Your - Workshop - Breathing - Room - by - Making - Your - Larger - Tools - Mobile - up - to-500 - lbs / dp / B00002262M / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Adjustable Mobile Base for Power Tools HTC-2000 - Give Your Workshop Breathing Room by Making Your Larger Tools Mobile ( up to 500 lbs.!)</a > UPDATE : I contacted HTC directly and let them know the base was missing hardware and they expresss shipped a bag of hardware out to me every thing fits good I just need to do a little fine tuning to get my jointer to sit flat buyt all in all I think this base will work out well . HTC customer service was great .
5 #### What can I say - I bought this trap and learned how to " carefully " set it up and have not seen a single mole tunnel since . I guess they saw the packaging and left town . Keeping this on the ready in case one of the dumber ones comes back .
5 #### Between the cost of saving of no longer stripping out screws and very little premature worn out driver bits these guides easily pay for them selves with in the first five pound box of screws you use with them . I 'm currently on my second set of these guides now . My first set is still very usable but the longer one ( which is my most used ) has worn down and if I 'm not careful the plastic sleeve will fall off since the end stop has worn off from heavy use . Well worth the investment with a quick return on saved material and saved driver bits .
4 #### Good : ( 1 ) heavy , beefy , and stable clamp on wood ( 2 ) good line alignment visibility . Could be better , but still is good . There is a port on the side that allows you to view the white line to align with your wood marking . Bad : The jig arrived with the center dowel guide ( black part in the middle ) loose . I did not know that , and hole wiggled . I had to tighten up the jig with an allen wrench to make it usable . This product should have gone through quality check before sending out in this incomplete condition .
5 #### I love this stuff ! Best rabbit repellent ( & I 've tried several ) ! ! Highly recommend !
5 #### Great vibrations . Fast removal of material . Easy to use sand paper sheets with . I love it ! ! ! Powerful ! ! ! Thanks Porter Cable .
4 #### Works flawlessly but is bit unhandy to install . The unit comes in four parts : the unit itself ; the rectangular faceplate showing the minutes , the dial and the wall plate . The instructions are precise and easy to understand but the actual dial does not fit well on the " post " of the timer . I had to ream it out a bit in order for it to be completely pushed back toward the faceplate . It was just an annoyance , not a show - stopper .
4 #### This is a great product- its best use will be early spring when you start to have algae build up from the leaves that got stuck in the pond over the winter . Just be careful with amount as it will kill fish if you use too much . I would use slightly less than it calls for and just do a second treatment if needed a week or so later to be on the safe side . Unless you do n't have fish then you can knock it out without worry of using too much .
5 #### A little complicated to program but once set up , it works beautifully . Had one running for about a year and is running as good as new . For what you get with this unit , I think the price is really quite good .
5 #### I really like this feeder . It holds a lot of see , which it protects from the elements , you can set the weight bar to keep heavier birds and squirrels from eating all your seed , and the lid locks open , which is a huge plus when filling it . I have been very pleased with it so far , though my birds have yet to figure out that the new feeder is full of seed . Some have caught on , but the others are slow . I 'm hoping that with time , it will become more popular .
5 #### Great little grill . Very Heavy but fun too cook on . It is very easy to clean after cooking Made in USA
5 #### Excellent quality and extremely stable . Definitely a great gift item .
4 #### These will be used as needed and only time will tell how good the quality is . Right now they look good .
4 #### I use this every day for a variety of teas . It is very simple to use and works very well . It has a nice tight mesh and keeps all the leaf out of my cup . It does what it needs to do and does it well .
5 #### Worked fine , fit well . I like because I can blow or vac out and they last a long time . I use with the vac bags so the suction is maintained for much longer time . ( I like to use my leaf blower , just hold them in the air stream and they clean up well )
5 #### I have owned a Super Wonder Bar for 18 years or more . After using it contracting , carpentering and on household projects , it finally broke yesterday pulling screw shank nails from oak pallets ! I think that 's pretty good for a track record and am getting ready to buy another onw . This has been one of the , if not the most useful tool I have ever owned . I have done lots of demo work and this is the bomb !
4 #### This is a great starter carving set or a good every day use set . If you 're a pro , semi - pro , or weekend warrior chef , this is n't a set for you . $ 20 is fair price to have this set in your drawers .
4 #### Have n't used yet but I have confidence in Dewalt tools .
5 #### A contractor installed a crappy , cheap light in my laundry room to replace one that was old . A little over a year later , and the chain ripped out of the housing . I took the light apart and realized that I could buy a replacement switch just like the one that was in it . There were several options , but this one ( actually Westinghouse brand was shipped ) had good reviews and was cheap . I installed it in just a few minutes with nothing but my hands , a screwdriver to remove the light plate and pliers to crimp the wires . It pulls easier than the one that was in it before . I 'm hoping it lasts longer .
5 #### Never used a pressure cooker before and this one is so easy to use . Just follow the directions and you will be all set . Braised chicken in 10 minutes ! ! ! ! Fall off the bone tender . Want to buy a bigger one soon .
5 #### ADORABLE collar ! i got it for my small puppy . it fits him perfectly . the bell is adorable , too . now he jingles about . i bought it because he likes to hide in weird places and i have to go looking for him . he also likes to sneak up on us ... we 're just worried about stepping on him . i 'm so happy i got it . i even got it at a discounted rate
5 #### It 's OXO ! To me , if I see OXO brand anything , I usually opt for that knowing I 've purchased a good kitchen product !
1 #### This is our second Chantal Teakettle . It is lighter in weight than our old one but still seems sturdy and well made . Nice finish ; nice color . 2/14 Update - My teakettle has an area on the inside below the handle where the enamel is breaking away . Chantal has a 1 yr . warranty so I contacted the company . They requested pictures of inside and outside of kettle which I sent and was told after they reviewed them that the damage was caused by hitting it on a hard surface . There was no damage on the outside of the teakettle . I was offered a replacement at a discount . I had the teakettle about 7 months when I notified them of the problem . The quality and workmanship are substandard compared to the old Chantal teakettle that was used every day for nearly 15 years . Warranty useless . If you want a decorative teakettle , it may be okay . For one that you intend to use , look elsewhere . I will never buy anything Chantal again .
4 #### This is a decent knife honer sold at a excellent price . If you 're confused what honing is , or not sure how to do it , Alton Brown has a very good video on youtube called " Shun Training Video . " Basically , he runs the blade across the honing surface 5 times on one side , 4 times on the other , 3x on the original , 2x on opposite , and then once on the original side . As another reviewer mentioned this item is made in China , not Germany . As you can see from my picture , the plastic looks slightly different from the other Henckel brand knifes in my block which may or may not be an issue for you .
5 #### Made in the USA , and it shows in the quality . Makes me glad that I lost my old pair and needed a replacement .
1 #### It just did not hold up . The first time I watered it the bottom ripped out .
5 #### This is really great for outside storage for all of our pool toys and equipment . Easy to move around and keep everything off the deck and nice and neat . Seem to keep things dry and not bad as an occasional seat .
4 #### This thing moves some serious air . It does have a few issues , but I can put up with them for how well it works . It seems a bit flimsy , but once mounted it is relatively solid . It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side . The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws , so it is removable . The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it . If it bothers you , put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on . It is electrically reversable , but it exhausts air much better than it draws air , and mounting it backwards would make it so you could not close the window . The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed . The noise goes away on high speed , which is how we run it anyway .
3 #### I purchased this clock to use near a spa in an outdoor pool area . Having read previous reviews , I understood that the rear surface of the clock was not weatherproofed . Consequently , we kept it under a cover on a nearby bench . One day , while re - covering the clock , the cover accidentally tipped the clock over . It fell , face down on the wooden bench from its upright position . Much to my surprise , the face of the clock shattered . It was not a violent fall , and it did n't fall far . But the stress of the fall was enough to have the glass shatter into many pieces . I brought the clock into the house and carefully removed the remaining shattered pieces . The next day , I found a local glass company and had the face replaced with plexiglass for $ 24 . The glass company commented on how thin the glass was that was used on the face of the clock . So , my advice to a future buyer would be that this is a fine product ... BUT if you 're going to use it where it might have some physical stress , be very careful . You might even preemptively decide to replace the glass withe plexi . Now that I have done that , I 'm satisfied with the product .
5 #### Opens cans when used . Cans wo n't know what hit them , their thin metal yields easily to the sharp cutting blade . Easy to hold and turn the crank .
5 #### bought this for my son who is in a auto - collision class . This is a professional version compared to what the other kids bought , works much faster and better than theirs .
5 #### High quality whisk with a comfortable grip . I had the larger balloon whisk before getting this one . This one was however a bit smaller than I had originally imagined . This was , in my case , to my own benefit . Great for whisking small amounts in small containers / bowls . There are other good whisks out there , but this one is sturdy and a very safe buy . Good god OXO !
5 #### Since I always replace my own belts , I was happy to get these at a good price too . They work as they are supposed to and the delivery was great .
4 #### Nice set of blades at a very competitive price . Wish it had at least one 12 " blade for shrubs and palm trimming !
5 #### This is much more comfortable to hold than the whole dremel unit . I have much more control , especially for fine work and in tight places . Attaches easy , and changing attachments out of the end is a breeze .
5 #### I ca n't tell if it attracts mosquitos ... The entertaining purple zapper keeps buzzing .
4 #### Order came promptly and correct . I would revisit this vendor if I needed something else . This was a good experience .
4 #### It took the better part of an hour to adequately flatten and polish the sole of the plane , But after a careful blade sharpening , it removes transparent shavings and works well on end grain . It costs a lot less than a Lie Nielsen or even a Stanley Sweetheart , and works fine .
5 #### It works great for making P P & J sandwiches or spreading mayonnaise on bread . I also like the cutting ability of this tool which means that for items that you do n't really need a more dedicated knife for this item is great . The handle is easy to hang onto and does n't slip . I use it all the time .
5 #### I have never needed a strainer like this before now , so I did n't know what to expect when I ordered this one . I just knew that the brand OXO has been good in earlier purchases . It was true to its reputation . This strainer is well made , and has just the right straining capacity for canned vegetables , etc . It also seems to be unhurt by the dishwasher because it has been through that many times already . If you need this kind of thing , this is a good one .
3 #### I can not see any improvement in smoothness of cut using my Freud blades , which is why I bought the product . The machining is pretty rough on this item . The faces of the dampener are machined like a standard saw blade , which is fine , but the outside surface is so rough it looks like it was cut out by a band saw or ground with a very rough grinder . With something that roughly cut it raises doubt in my mind about the degree of balance of the disk . It makes me wonder if this is really manufactured by Forrest , which has very high quality saw blades . On the positive side the surfaces of the disk are very flat , I can not see any light under my Starrett precision ruler at all , except near the hole .
5 #### Great for those random parts you need to put away .
5 #### I bought this out of frustration with a big rewiring project at work . My employer only buys the cheapest tools they can find . It hurts my hands and does n't do a good job . This wire cutter made my job so much easier , the jaws align and mate across the entire length of the cutting surface . It feels good in my hand , and cuts easily and the joint is very smooth .
5 #### Finally , a flat free tire that is absolutely perfect for my wheel barrow . I now have a 20 - year old wheel barrow with a brand new tire that will last longer . Now I no longer have to pump up a tire every single spring or every time I want to use my wheel barrow . This tire is perfect and I would love to have these tires for all of my equipment .
5 #### We bought this for the demo work we had to do for our kitchen remodel . It was actually quite verisitile and helped more than any other tool we had . Definitely plan to use again for bathroom remodel .
4 #### I wanted this lawn mower to : - Not have to deal with gas and oil - Be able to mow without feeling like I need a shower due to exhaust fumes - Save my hearing - Keep me from re - injuring my right shoulder by not having to pull the cord to start - Mulch This mower did all of these fantastically . In addition , one thing I was very pleasantly surprised with was the one touch wheel height adjustment . It works like a charm . My only real complaint is that it does a crummy job on long grass . I have to go slowly over the grass in one direction and go back over it a second time from the opposite direction . My nit picks are n't serious . - Although it is light enough for me to not worry about not being powered , it is too heavy for my wife to do more than a portion of the yard . - I am concerned about everyone saying that the battery only lasts a couple years . - The mowing deck is deceptive . It has a wide side area embedded within the deck that prevents the blade from going out as far as the edge of the deck . You have to have more overlap between strips of grass when mowing . ( I think that the frame of the mower with the wheel height adjustment is hidden in the mowing deck . ) BOTTOM LINE : It is n't perfect , but it met my goals and I would purchase again .
4 #### I 'm not sure what else I can add here other than that this sharpening attachment was a perfect fit for my older Dremel model 398 . I did have to use it with the standard collect that originally came with the tool though because there was n't enough clearance with the guide plate installed to use it with the larger diameter 4486 keyless chuck I normally use with the tool . I initially found the instructions regarding the use of the gauge and spacers for adjustment a little bit confusing , but after reading through them a couple more times it became clear as to their intended purpose and how to use them . The only possible issue I can see with the design is that there are no threaded metal screw inserts in the plastic body , so I do n't know how long it will ultimately hold up before it strips out from the guide plate and spacer screws being installed and removed repeatedly , but at least at the current price , the attachment is probably inexpensive enough to replace every couple of years if needed . Overall , I 've been quite pleased with this sharpening attachment . Using it along with the Milescraft 5/32 " and 7/32 " diamond sharpening bits , it has saved a lot of time and so far has done a great job keeping all of my chainsaw chains sharp .
5 #### I am on year 5 with mine and it sits outdoors in the weather and still works perfect and simple
1 #### Very disappointed , I have not been able to nail a single nail into any wood without it bending up .
5 #### Great tool for the kitchen . Sometimes it 's better than a whisk .
5 #### Very strong suction for a small vacuum . I use a different floor brush than what it came with as I wanted one with lots of bristles to capture pet hair . This vacuum is used everyday and meets my expectations . It is my third Mighty Mite in 12 years
5 #### This makes a great cup of java . I bought the six cup size and that makes the perfect cup for me .
5 #### Great for smaller jobs and occasional work " in - place . " Easy to use and no maintainance . But you will want to look at the very reasonably priced PorterCable belt sanders for larger jobs like doors , or large flat finished surfaces . But if you can only afford one tool to get started or are just getting started , this one is the one to start with .
1 #### suction cup falls off window and the prism falls and the glass breaks , end of story
5 #### My brackets broke and these worked just like the original parts . It was much better than buying a whole new shelving kit .
5 #### well made clean lines hides what you need to and works well as a plunger
5 #### Wrote the date we hung it up . After one month to the day it was loaded to capacity with dead flies . Smells a bit .
5 #### Very easy to use on my Scott 's classic mower . The instructions on making adjustments to mower were very good . There is enough sharpening compound to last for many years . A great buy !
5 #### Woodpeckers , cardinals , and lots of other birds are enjoying this suet cake . Seems there 's always a bird ( or squirrel ) snacking on it .
2 #### Did not keep good time . The thermometer was never accurate although it was always in the shade the reading was always off by about 7 degrees .
5 #### I purchased this pan about 3 years ago , when I disposed of the microwave . The finish is still perfect and we use it frequently . It 's simple to clean , which is a big plus ! We do n't have a dishwasher , just so you know . I 'd recommend this to anyone that needs a toaster oven pan .
4 #### Could not find one of the for an attic fan at local hardware stores . Works fine since installing 5 weeks ago .
5 #### Make sure to test by clicking at least two times before using . This will properly calibrate the tool .
5 #### Bought this before making it the second we own . Good for in doors and out .
1 #### Used 6 times , warped on bottom . The reason I purchased Stainless Steel is so it would not warp like aluminum . I have an electric glass cooktop , so pots must be flat to heat evenly . Was to start with , not now . Bought in 2006 , it has a 12 year warranty , we 'll see how that goes . UPDATE : Presto has decided to give me a " one time courtesy replacement " . They have no reason why this is not a straight Warranty replacement . However , they want me to sped another 1/3rd of the cost of a new one to ship the lid back . Apparently this is to ensure I can not use the old one again . So they are more worried about their possible loss than my having a product that is not defective . They do n't want the actual pot that warped back , so they could examine it themselves . If they did , they could pay the return freight . The customer should not have to be punished because their product is defective , which is what return freight charges are . It is good money after bad , like an internet scam of some obscure lottery win , where you send a fee for " processing " . Not buying it .
5 #### I love them . Other 's would say I 'm obsessed . Keeps me regular . Lets me properly engage my core for heavy lifts in the field or at work . Does n't leave me tense after a full day of work . Still lets me hit deep squats @ 305lbs after work . Side note : These bad_boys in red will make some girls text you inappropriate pictures . Best of luck . Honestly , I just do n't understand how others restrict themselves all day with belts . Belts just mess up my rhythm .
5 #### This is a great light - weight cordless vac that can be used anywhere . I keep it downstairs for the kitchen and touch - ups in all the other rooms . It 's great for a quick clean up by the litter box each time you scoop . I keep my reg vac upstairs because this Eureka Quick Up is better as a daily vac , so then I only need to bring the heavier one down once a week or so . Bonus - the cordless vac does stairs effortlessly - cleaning them as well as being carried up and down . LOL Note too that with this bundle it comes with an extra battery pack which can be charged in the charger while the other charges in the vac all at the same time . This way you do n't run out of power before you 're done . I never had that problem with my first one and I only had one battery pack anyway . Nothing wrong with that one , gave it to one of my daughters to take to college and bought the new one for me ! Overall : Great vac , super suction , easy to clean , they 've upgraded the rotating bristles so it 's much more effective on carpet , great value . Do n't hesitate if you 're thinking of getting one !
5 #### Perfect for my veggie garden . Keeps all those deer out . Easy to handle / unroll . Flexible , yet sturdy enough to detract deer . About the right height too .
5 #### I want 10 of these . I used this one for my thickness planer . I had it mounted on a metal table that was very difficult to move . My shop is small and having tools movable is very helpful . This item is solid and easy to assemble and operate . I think I 'm going to buy more .
5 #### Everything a great speed square should be heavy duty amd the swing arm is awesome ! ! ! !
5 #### This along with pool perfect and phos free and pool balance tabs got rid of oil in my pool from a pump leak ... Also great to open in spring !
4 #### Not exactly a lab test but super fast and easy and gives a ballpark analysis that might help . Better for maintaining soil than fixing problem soil in my opinion .
5 #### My dad always had these in his work truck and every guy in my shop has one in their box . I do n't think this tape has undergone any serious changes in 20 years and there 's a reason . This is the standby , if you 're in need of serious stand out , pay twice as much for his Fat brother . If you need a good layout tape for half the price of Max , this is the tried and true tool . Grab a 16 footer while you 're at it . I did .
1 #### The " brass " coupling , the part below the threaded piece that screws into the tap that spins around , leaked very badly . I ca n't see the hole , but as much water was spurting out of the hole as was coming out of the other end of the hose . Useless .
3 #### works well for precision pruning but design deficiency in the way lock is installed causes the tool to constantly lock itself up
4 #### Wish the size of the top hole was standard so I could attach a hose or different item to it . Works well . When battery starts to go , either the cycle will be very abbreviated , or it just will not have enough energy to open the solenoid . Alkaline lasts for about a month .
5 #### I got this because we have an ongoing problem with fruit / drain flies . I do n't know if it would work on larger flies . But for our purposes , this paper really works . It 's gross to handle because of how sticky it is , but that 's what makes it so good . You have to pull it out very slowly to get it to unravel correctly which is kind of annoying , but it 's worth it to get the job done .
5 #### I struggle with making concrete statements when it comes to air filters because without proper air quality testing it is very hard to know if you are getting your money 's worth . My family suffers from allergies , so we bought these and they get very dirty after a few months so I assume they are doing what they are supposed to be doing .
5 #### love these knives and would have no other as well as my son who also is a cook . I have just about all the different sizes .
5 #### All the sizes you need so you do n't have to use multiple spoons as often .
5 #### I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife and she 's been baking bread ever since . I 'm the happy recipient . I 've put photos of her finished product on Facebook and it looks ( and tastes ) as good as the finest artisian bread . The brotform gives the bread the contoured look of a professional product .
5 #### wonderful product , I keep this one on hand all summer .
5 #### The nailer arrived so carelessly packaged I 'm sending it back . A very flimsy box , the tool tossed in the bottom of the box with no packing under it , a heavy box of 2,500 nails tossed in on top . The nailer cut into the bottom of the box during transit . It 's probably fine , I 'm sure it 's rugged enough , but I do n't want to use it and find out later there 's a hairline crack somewhere , or something 's bent . I 'll buy one from the local big box store today , same price . P.S. I did pick one up at Lowe 's . I 've only run about 500 nails through it so far but it 's a great tool , does everything as advertised . I 'm using the GripRite aftermarket nails , too , not as pricey as Paslode nails . I would n't hesitate to buy this nailer from Amazon ; I just happened to run into a shipper who did n't care about doing a decent job that day .

1 #### Kit was missing the 40 powder capsules needed to do the tests . I 've returned it and am buying a different brand .
4 #### A little over three years ago , I bought a new low - volume toilet for our redecorated bathroom . It worked fine until a couple weeks ago when the fill valve ceased to function . I 've had this happen numerous times in my life with other toilets so it was no big deal . I took the valve out , took it to the local hardware store and bought a new identical model , a Fluidmaster Toilet Fill Valve . It was fairly easy to install , although I had a few minor gripes about leaking until I finally fixed it . Now it works fine , just like the old one did , I like the fact that it is adjustable . Well , my only gripe is the short life span . Do toilet valves really have to be replaced every three years . Surely not . This one must have been defective . My only reason for buying a new one of the same make and model was my hope for simplicity of repair . I 'm annoyed at the short life span and hope this new one will do better . Gary Peterson
4 #### this coupled with the diamond burrs from Hobbytool i think it 's called and you can get the job done in no time at all . Just make sure your rotary tool has the same way to attach it .
5 #### used for my drill press plate form and works great
4 #### Overpriced , but works well . Has a nice grip and design , seems sturdy . Like all whisks can be difficult to wash .
5 #### this item has survived fierce weather , and still works well . it does also get a lot of moths , but has reduced , but not eliminated the mosquito population
5 #### I really like this - easy to hold and mix with it . I have arthritis in my hands and Oxo Good Grip tools work the best for me.= best product for a great price .
5 #### I used this big with a home made jig to flatten my bench top . Wow ! So much faster than trying to hand plane it and it came out fantastic ! I was worried about trying to get the absolute largest diameter I could , but that turned out to be folly . This bit was perfect . I used it again for some rabbet work . It 's a massive bit , so you have to be careful about how much material you 're trying to remove in a single pass , of course . I 've had a 100 % satisfaction rate with Freud bits so far , and I 've got quite a few , including sash and panel sets . You ca n't go wrong with Freud .
4 #### Works better than a pan plus you have a bowl attached ready to go
4 #### Did nt fit our gh but hubby improvis3d , so all good
5 #### To all out there who buys a tape measure My expertise is I ve been in the trades self employed for 35 years . What to look for in a tape is how many rivets holds on the end that hooks onto an object . Some come with 2 but 3 is riviets is what you want This tape like all I buy has 3 rivets meaning a good tape wo n't get sloppy at the end in measuring not to mention Stanely is the best all around tool to buy . Great tape for the price and QUICK delivery LOVE it all Thanks to the supplier and Amazon
5 #### I triangulated my 3 acres of clear property that is used for outdoor recreation out of all the acres I have . Thes mosquito attractants have kept me bite free all summer so far ! Used in the Flowtron , it is an effective method of killing mosquitos . It 's been a reallyl wet summer , and I have n't had a bite ! So many mosquitos are dead on the Flowtron , I have to tap it every day to clean it off ! I started using this product in May , to catch the first batch of mosquitos , so they would'n't be able to breed too much ! It worked !
5 #### Beast price I found for 1.5 " cleat nails that would fit my Senco floor nailer ... plus they were delivered to my door in 2 days for FREE with Amazon Prime . Sweet .
5 #### I plan on adding this to my compost mixture along with a few other ingredients to make great soil .
5 #### these are great sponges . They are God to clean George Foreman grills and panini presses .
1 #### TRULY A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY ! Think about it for a minute . Why are you buying a router table ? For the router guide , fense and top OR for the table it sits on ? Yes , this seemed like a neat item and I took the bait . After hours of putting this thing together and using it make some molding I realized I could have made the same molding by just buying a very good router fence and table top system like one from Kreg ( which is what I eventually did . ) Look carefully at the fence and how it works . Does it have an adjustable outfeed fense ? NO . Think that the vacuum is going to suck up the sawdust from the top ? NO , it 's going to fall down inside the table to cover any tools you got in there . Working with long boards , is the height adjustable to something else in your shop like the workbench ? NO , you 're on your own . Again , DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY ON THE BENCH . PUT IT INTO THE TABLE TOP AND FENSE SYSTEM .
4 #### I 'm pleased with this spoon rest - big enough for a wide spatula or two other utensils . Nice - looking enough to leave out on the counter . 4 rather than 5 stars because the stainless steel shows water spots out of the dishwasher but this is an aesthetic vs. a functional issue .
5 #### I bought this little vegetable scrub brush because I was tired of using paper towels to scrub vegetables every time I cooked them . This brush has been great so far . It has strong bristles and is very easy to handle . I trust highly in the Oxo name and have n't been let down by one of their products yet . I highly recommend this product , especially for the price . You ca n't beat it with Amazon Prime .
5 #### This fan is perfect for cooling down my room at night . It is pretty quiet on the lowest setting and still moves a lot of air . It 's not that loud on the highest setting but it 's loud enough that I wo n't forget that it is on , and I will usually turn it down after my room cools off a bit .
5 #### We moved to a new neighborhood about a year ago and about this time last year I planted a bunch of pansies . About a week after I planted them the deer eight about 75 % of each plant . I had heard about Liquid Fence and I think I bought a quart bottle of the concentrate . I did the recommended spray program on the pansies and they gradually grew back the following spring . I continued the spray program throughout the summer as I set out new plants . All my plants were okay , but I never saw any signs of deer being in the yard . This year I bought a gallon of the Liquid Fence concentrate and began the spray program for this year 's pansies . 1 1/2 weeks after the second spraying I had evidence that deer were in the yard . They ate my flat leaf parsley ( but they did not curly leaf parsley ) . They also ate the new growth on my hydrangea . There are at least a dozen pansies plants within 3 to 6 feet of the hydrangea . Not even one leaf or flower on the pansies was touched by the deer , so it really works . I will update this review if the pansies start disappearing , but right now my results say that Liquid Fence is great stuff .
5 #### My old cutting pliers recently developed deformations on the cutting surfaces . These are an inexpensive " Made in the USA " replacement set . Feels good in the hand . The tool packaging did not have any warrantee info , so I checked their website . " Tools are not warranted against abuse or wear from faithful service " . I have other Channellock items accumulated over the years , and have been happy with them .
5 #### The installation was fairly straight forward . I did the installation myself after watching a YouTube video . Everything is functioning well . I have n't had it long enough to analize the cost savings on my electric bill , but I am confident it will have a make a positive impact .
1 #### The channel knife is entirely dull . It is like using a dull butterknife . It wo n't cut the peel to create a strip to use as a garnish . This is not what I expect from Oxo
4 #### I 've rediscovered how great pressure cooking is . I can soak beans overnight and have a fresh pot of delicious beans in half an hour , including ten minutes to cool and depressurize . The beans are soft and tender in a way that some beans never were after cooking a day in a crock pot . The pressure cooker does n't boil away a lot of water and flavor , and pressure cooking is not only twenty times faster , it uses much less energy . I made beans without soaking them , and I could taste a slight bitterness , but they were better beans in half an hour than 12 hour beans in the crock pot . The pressure cooker is great for quick and delicious homemade soups and stews . It 's also a great way to cook potatoes , rice , and steamed vegetables . This pressure cooker works well , but the handle mounting hardware seems barely up to the task . The handle is a highly tensioned part and while the handle itself is sturdy , the mounting screws seem flimsy . I can tighten the hardware almost to the limit of the tensile strength ( until the screws are about to break ) and the handles are barely tight enough not to work loose in a use or two . When they inevitably loosen , I 'll use blue Loctite on them to hopefully secure them when reassembling . If Presto used a beefier mounting for the handles , I 'd give this pressure cooker five stars instead of four .
5 #### Well worth the money Pays for itself in 3 - 4 months . Should be standard equipment in any house . If you want to cut your electricity charges by 30 % BUY ONE NOW > My provider Reliant sends a weekly usage graph that to see exactly when I used any appliance . Relatively easy to install and can be done DIY . Remember to turn off power at breaker panel . The water heater I put on one hour per day . Noticeable reduction in power usage . Tip if you can put the timer in the house , as I did . The timer is conveniently located in kitchen pantry . Avoids trips to garage when you need to manually turn heater on . Note If your water heater is in the garage get a WH blanket to further insulate the heater .
5 #### Very good quality -similar used on TOH all the time - love it
5 #### I have 2 cats + a dog + they all have double coat fur . You pet owners will understand when i say , no matter what u do u can never eliminate ALL of the hair they shed on your clothes but i have a top loader + the double mesh strainer will get nearly all of it and then my dryer can handle the rest . But without my 1st " skimming " the water while washing my dryer was leaving some behind . So the next time your back is itchy , turn your shirt inside out + you may find you need a double mesh strainer too!- I should caution u that this product was not meant 4 this purpose so skim the top of the water , do n't go " into " the wash + fight against the weight of the clothes .
4 #### This is the best travel mug i have ever used , its stainless on the inside , there is a rubber " o " ring that seals very well on the lid . Also it fits perfectly in a Colman 5272 cooler right in a recess in the lid . The lever is nice because it only opens while you are drinking , so if some dirt falls on the lid you can just wash of the top of the cup and continue with your hot coffee . I only gave it 4 stars becaue i generally do n't read 5 star reviews .
4 #### i switched because aluminum reacts and taints many acid foods stainless steel was a real good move its stronger too nice easy to use unit
4 #### Work fine and last longer that some of the cheaper ones I have purchased on Amazon .
5 #### This seems to be a fairly well - made item , and because the flat part is so thin , it really gets under fried eggs to turn them over without breaking them . Fairly priced , too .
5 #### Great quality . Perfect for pet food . It holds a lot more than you would think it could hold . They are built sturdy and should last a long time . They also stack , which is a great feature .
5 #### I should have bought one of these years ago . The skimmer works really well and I use it frequently . It 's a useful tool and I should n't be required to write at least 20 words to recommend it !
5 #### This unit makes very good espresso from grind ( as long as you have a good grinder ) and spectacular shots from pods . Pods are actually pretty hard to find , but really worth trying if you want to see how good it can get . I like the stainless , it 's very heavy , easy to fill , big solid - feeling buttons , and pretty easy to clean . It 's even got a plug in the bottom for letting out water that makes into the case through the tray . The first unit I got was defective , so if you 're having big problems , it might be the machine and not you . Water leaking , bad brewing , no pressure -- just return it . It looks like quite a few people god bad units -- if they work , they 're flawless . I do n't know if that 's a sign of future reliability , but mine 's in an office setting , used daily for a year without missing a beat . Also , it 's a piston - driven unit , so be aware it does make a fair amount of buzzing noise . One nitpick -- the steam knob is n't knurled , so it 's not always easy to get a good grip on it if your hands are wet .
4 #### I specifically went in search of the hoover floor shampooer as I remember mom and grand mom using this type of hoover . I really like the machine , my large area rugs are very clean , I find this machine easy to use and found one review fair and reasonable . I would recommend this shampooer to everyone better than my expensive 1400.00 machine .
4 #### This will mow the grass really well if you stay on top of it . If you let the grass grow too tall , it wo n't cut it without a lot of effort . I live in Florida and have to mow about twice as often with this as I do with my electric mower if I want to avoid spending hours mowing .
5 #### With having a tank full of tetra , Cory 's , clown loaches , and weather loaches , this product is the only one I will use for ick . Very safe when used properly , great product !
5 #### Fit perfectly , charge quickly , powerful and long lasting , although a bit expensive .
1 #### Dumb idea . A knife and cutting board work just as well . And you probably already have a bowl too
5 #### Excellent value as regards cost as well as quality of product . Actually , this product is offered at a bargain price and at a similar high quality as the higher priced lamps .
5 #### Wish I would have purchased this quality , adjustable square decades ago . Well - made , easy - to - read , easy - to - adjust . Amazon Prime delivered it the day after the purchase . Very pleased ...
5 #### I have to replace these on a regular basis due to sub- freezing temperatures in the winter where I live . I do insulate the valves but mother nature still wins out sometimes . Have found Rain Bird to be a high quality valve that work a long time if nature does n't interfere .
5 #### Works great ! Easy to assemble and clean ! Am going to purchase another for a gift :)
5 #### Now that I finally bought my new Weber grill ( One - Touch Silver ) and some new Weber tools , I needed something to hold them . I did n't want to hang them on one of my other crappy grills , so I went ahead and bought this handy tool holder . Now , I have read previous reviews on this and people have said that they could n't get their lid to close , or that the tool holder would fall off . Well , it does n't take much creativity to realize that you can pinch the tool holder onto your grill with a simple set of pliers . This will take care of both problems . I highly recommend this simple - yet - handy gadget to anyone with a Weber One - Touch grill ( except for maybe the One - Touch Platinum , since it has everything you need ) . It is very easy to use , your lid will still close and you grill - cover will still fit =)
5 #### Best box to buy for storing things that you do n't want to crush . I put my biking gear in these and then I can take the whole thing with me when I am heading to the trails . I can fit my chest protector , helmet , knee and elbow guards , extra tubes , shoes , jerseys , tools , hydration pack , etc- easily .
5 #### Just test - drove these on a 1 1/2"-thick , tangled bitter - sweet vine . What fun ! They cut through this thing like a hot knife through butter . No struggling . Impressive since I burned my left hand last night and could n't exert a lot of pressure with that hand -- plus , I 'm a 5 - foot - tall , 120 - pound , 72 year - old woman . Highly recommended -- will use them for things for which I would ordinarily need to haul out the electric saw . Be aware -- you need some clearance to be able to open the blades completely ; needed to do some maneuvering to get into position . They seemed a little heavy when I first hefted them , but I had no trouble working below head - level . Plan to bring them to our mountain place and clear some brush . Just what I wanted .
5 #### I purchase this for my daughter . She uses it often .
4 #### Slightly smaller than what I wanted . Worked after some slight modification to the bore of the pulley . Not sure if the bore was wrong or the imported motor shaft was just larger .
2 #### Bristles too short and too soft . Did not last very long . Eat a whole food , plant based diet so scrub lots of vegetables every day . Did like the shape of the brush , fits nicely in my hand as I work .
5 #### I got one of these at Target for my son for Christmas and loved the easy spinning so checked Amazon and sure enough , it was $ 5 less . So I got this one and love the pump - spin action . Looks well made , hope it lasts . A cheaper model I had cracked after a year .
3 #### I 've had one of these for several years . It does , indeed , start coals quickly and efficiently . There is a downside , however . While the paper is catching fire , a great deal of smoke is generated . Definitely stay away from colored newspaper inks . They 're the worst . It 's marginally better than stinking up the yard / neighborhood with lighter fluid fumes , but be warned that you need to close the windows on the side of the house closest to the starter , unless you want to enjoy that nice newspaper - burning smell indoors for a few days ! UPDATE : I am still using this starter , FIFTEEN YEARS LATER ! It 's got a few dings and dents and a little rust , but it still does the job . A+++
4 #### This is a well built product . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because of the way it 's designed you have to spread the handles really far to get it around the branch you want to cut . Sometimes it 's hard to find room between the other branches to make the cut .
3 #### Ok I was very pleased to get and install these parts in my band saw . Makes the saw muc more versatile . Having said that one size does not really fit all . Yes the parts fit . Disassembly and reassembly are straight forward . Would have helped to have a friend in order to help hold and balance the upper wheel while tryig to install the retaining bolt . But they did a poor job relocating the power switch . It would no merely bolt back on as it had originally . The holes in the rizer were not located properly . I could have drilled through the switch mounting bracket and used 1 screw to secure it . I chose to add 1/4 ply to the original holes , and mount switch to that .
5 #### Excellent product . Does exactly what it claims to do . Have been using now for a few years and will continue to use it .
5 #### Klein tools are the one to have when you are tacking any electrical work and I would not purchase any other brand .
4 #### I used to buy the large bag version of this , but it held so many flies that the smell was just too much . This smaller version obviously holds less flies and so I can dispose of it more often and have a sweet smelling back yard at least for a while . It is amazing how many flies these attract .
5 #### I ordered this set as well as a set from another Mfg . This set is much much better . Tuff plastic and you can cut the circle size with the back side of each press . Pick up a set and have fun making all sorts of good eats in pockets . I plan to make my first Philly cheese paddies with Bison loin and chives . If you have a pasta machine you 'll make some excellent boil ready giant ravioli .
5 #### So much more leverage than a hatchet But almost same weight
5 #### I bought these to trim my plants after harvest . They are by far the sharpest scissors I have ever owned . I poked my thumb with the tip and it hurt , so do n't do that :) They also cut through leaves and branches like a hot knife through butter . I have never used a scissor without holes to put your fingers and thumb through , so they feel a little awkward for me . They are also much smaller than I expected , but that makes them very precise . I am a tall guy with large hands , so the size may be better for smaller people . Anyway , they seem to be quite effective and the spring is convenient and had no problem popping the scissors open after each snip even after the blades starts to get a little sticky . Update : After using these for a couple of days on my harvest they have become like a second very sharp hand . The lack of holes for my fingers does n't matter any more and they are just as precise and sharp as can be . I love them and will be ordering a second set .
5 #### OK , after getting this axe and another Fiskars had saw , I will always view Fiskars as a company that makes high quality products . This axe is incredible ! This axe is proof that you can drastically improve an ancient tool . Denille
5 #### I love these shapes ! I love the container it comes in as well , which makes storaging these so easy !
5 #### I have been peeling potatoes ( and other things ) wrong my whole life clearly . I was in a rush for dinner and thinking " okay peeling the potatoes will take about 7 minutes " because with my old peeler .. it did . We received one of these for the wedding , and it . is . a. game . changer . it took me less than 45 seconds to peel 3 large sweet potatoes . i know it seems silly , but this is seriously one of the best things in my kitchen .
5 #### I 'm a plumber , so channelocks are our go to pliers . Use them daily , well one size or another , I own about every size made . Would definitely recommend . Great quality product .
5 #### The serrated edge makes peeling vegetables a breeze . If you 've never used a high quality peeler , you do n't know what you 're missing out on . Peels twice as fast as a conventional peeler and far less prone to nicks and cuts .
5 #### I 've used this a few times . Love it ! High quality . Interesting design for storage and blade change , but once you figure it out , it 's functional . Does n't come with clear directions on how to do those things , but not too hard to work it .
2 #### What you ca n't see from the pictures is the VERY narrow opening to the bottle making this very difficult to clean . Not recommended .
5 #### This is the third Pondmaster pump I 've had . My first one actually did break ( impeller ) , but after about 8 years of constant use . The second one I sold along with other pond supplies I owned . I have a pond again and when it came time to purchase a pump I knew exactly what to buy , old faithful Pondmaster . This pump is a solidly built workhorse , no question . Highly recommended .
5 #### Awesome price for these little bulbs that fit in the lights under my kitchen cabinets . In the store these bulbs are so much more expensive . I like that I can keep them on hand for when they burn out . Totally recommend buying these bulbs . Each one comes in a little box . Thanks for reading my review Becky Brooks I paid full price for these bulbs
1 #### The larger of the two pans arrived with a loose handle that could not be tightened and my attempts to reach their customer service department failed . I do not feel the pan is safe to use .
5 #### Its great quality , but the handles make it too wide to fit into my smoker . I may just cut the handles off .
5 #### A very good whisk , not to big for a small pan . Works well .
5 #### I have had this light on my key chain for 3.5 years now . Like all Maglites the beam of light can be narrowed or widened . It is great for adding light to dark little corner especially when nothing else is handy .
5 #### Holds up my band saw and works as described . I would def buy again at the price
5 #### This is my favorite attachment . I purchased an extra Dremel 4000 just to leave it hooked up to it all the time . You really need small hands to tighten up the tool , but that s not a problem for me . I bolted it to my work bench and it works really well .
5 #### This is beyond a doubt the greatest whisk one can own ! If you have n't had one like this , get one !
5 #### < div id="video - block - R2F362KHWQFNGN " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / B1IfSEbwZPS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/81GMZR6AEPS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;I purchased this hose to use of my marina for the purpose of washing my boat down . Previously , I had a different NeverKink hose in a half inch/25 feet and I found that the hose marked up the white exterior of my boat and also melted from the hot sun ... It only lasted one season . I 've been using this hose for a couple months now and I really like it a lot . I like it because : * The 5/8 inch diameter is a lot easier to maneuver * The spray and pressure really is still the same in my opinion * It does not mark up the white exterior boat * It is very easy to coil backup when I need to put it away * I have n't had any kinking issue at all The Bottom Line : If you are in the market for a new hose for really any Marine or camper application I think you 'll be pretty happy with this . The video included just shows the hose out and use real quick .
5 #### Very sturdy whisk ! I do n't think I 'll ever have to buy another one again . The ones I purchased before were always flimsy and got rust in between the handle and bristles . I 've been using this whisk for almost a year now and absolutely no rust . It is easy to hand - wash , and also washes well in the dishwasher . It 's very strong so it does n't take as much effort or arm power to whisk up my dishes . It 's definitely worth the extra few bucks to get this strong , sturdy whisk instead of constantly replacing cheap ones and worrying about rust .
4 #### My wife and I really like this B&D electric Broom . We are both senior citizens , and the light weight make tis unit ideal for clearing off grass from our sidewalk and Driveway .
5 #### This block plane needs in cleaning / blade sharping and finish tuning . After these things the plane works very good as tool .
5 #### Awesome expresso maker ! My grandma used the same one when I was a little girl , my mom still uses it ! Now I have my own .
5 #### I have an Aero Garden and they need a lot of pruning . These are the perfect size ! Use them all the time !
2 #### The product does its job Ok but the workmanship is very poor . The handle is not smooth in places and there is even a small hole where both parts are joined together . I have many Oxo products and this one is very different from my other much older ones .
5 #### I use my toaster over constantly so I using pans that actually fit inside is important . This works ! I have cooked many dishes from lasagna , mac and cheese , small roasts , chicken , etc .. It makes enough for two , or for one with leftovers for lunch or whatever for It cleans up nicely . I would recommend this for people that use a toaster oven . I have not used it in a regular oven .
5 #### Fits sander well ( mind is 15 years old ) . East to change out and works well .
4 #### I purchased this fence for my 20 + year old Craftsman table saw . It fits perfectly without having to drill and tap any extra holes , which is great . I am planning on building an extension table , so I needed the Pro 40 , but if you do n't have a need for an extension table , I would recommend the utility model . The fence took me approximately 1.5 hours to install and align appropriately . The installation was fairly straightforward , but aligning the fence to the miter slot took some time because alignment instructions were unclear ( in my opinion ) . The only issue preventing me from rating this product as 5 - star is the quality of the instructions . Otherwise , I am very satisfied with the purchase .
4 #### I have used versions of this sprinkler for years . It delivers a nice gentle spray of water in a " Fan " shape very quickly . If you need to hand water your yard ( such as when re - seeding ) this is great because it covers a fairly wide area fairly fast . As with any sprayer , the further you aim , the wider the spray and the less water . For about 3 - 4 feet in front of me it watered a path ( I held it so the long side went up and down ) about 3 feet wide . Walking slowly , and overlapping 50 % created an obvious well watered area . I had some bare spots that actually ended up with little puddles ! As for the spike , I ca n't imagine why you would use it , this would flood the area it was aimed at . The shut off at the base is nice and works as expected . Unfortunately , this thing feels like cheap plastic . I do n't think it would survive dropping onto concrete ( for example)--so I dropped it one star .
4 #### When the cheapo bag that came with my jumper cables eventually ( inevitably ) ripped I picked tihs up to put my 16 foot cables into and keep them neat in my truck cab . They fit fine and I like the utility side pocket where I keep a set of gloves , small pliers , and a cheap flashlight that clips to the bag pocket . It looks like it will last some time but I 'm not exactly using my jumper cable every day , or week , maybe one a year at most .
4 #### Nice fell off the backing the first day it was hanging on the wall . Desk mount works better .
5 #### It 's a hunk of metal that does what it is suppose to do .
4 #### Have n't had this long enough to judge wear but like the ivory color and soft duracord . The birds ate the ends off the last one and I 'm hoping this wo n't be as tasty .
5 #### my first time at chopping wood , works great . just make sure wood is n't green .
4 #### Due to arthritis , I needed a lightweight vacuum cleaner . This does a good job for being so light .
1 #### I purchased these on Amazon and thought I 'd just got a bad unit because we could n't set the traps . My landscaper attempted as well and failed . I then purchased one at the big chain hardware store thinking it was just a faulty unit we 'd received . Nope . Both were same design and could n't be set . I had an older mole trap , same style , that was very sturdy and tough to set , but not impossible . Wish the older trap was still available .
5 #### Do n't waste your time buying other router bits I keep using this bit and it never fails me cuts perfect every time
4 #### I 've carried one of these for years , but I lost my old one so I ordered a replacement ... well 2 , I also ordered the LCD to see how that works out . This one is not the brightest bulb ... but it was very sturdy and I must say I used it at least once every week , If only to find lock to open my front door , or plug in the HDMI cable behind my TV set . It was truly the most used flashlight in my collection . I only gave it 4 stars because it really is not all that bright , but other than that it is the most useful mini - torch you could want .
5 #### Used a scarecrow and couple of years back . the mechanical guts broke and tried other items to keep raccoons away from our pond and never worked as well as these units . I think they are a good buy . Keeps herons , cats and raccoons away from fish pond .
5 #### seems to be working great , nice and light and I like how it cleans the carpets , it does n't ruin my oriental carpets . I hope it lasts . Updating my review August 2016 , works great , I do n't mind the loud sound it makes as it is powerful and works great .
5 #### Used this along with a timer for the bathroom fans . Works great .
4 #### Good product overall . I wish the price was a little less than the $ 16 I spent on it , but that is honestly the only thing I can complain about . The tool itself was exactly as described in the listing . And I did n't find in imperfections or issues with the carpenters square I received .
4 #### As far as I know , the only replacement papers for the Fly Web Fly Trap . They are easy to use , clean , chemical free and trap all sorts of flying insects , as well as the occasional spider and silverfish .
3 #### The " hold " feature failed after 3 days . Quality . However , the actual timer feature has worked flawlessly and the lack of a hold is not a deal breaker .
5 #### Though I have only use the pan a fews times , so far it has worked great ! I love the glass bottom , though I feel I need to be careful handling the glass . The glass works great for serving . My cheesecakes have not stuck to the sides or the bottom in this pan yet . The pan side is black , so I do need to watch the baking time as the black seems to absorb more heat in my oven . Overall a great product , and I like it much better than an all metal springform pan .
4 #### It 's heavy with nice handles . Some cakes do stick , even when sprayed with Pam , but not as many as in my old pan .
5 #### This knife is very sharp , I really like it . It makes cutting pretty much anything very easy .
5 #### These come in excellent condition they do the job they do n't break they fit easily into my device and I have no complaints about this product at all . The quality is pretty good too worth the money
5 #### This was the first nailer that I ever purchased . Now that I have it I would hate to lose it . It has worked perfectly everytime I have used it . I have never used a Senco framer but as well as this one works I do n't see a reason to need to try any other brand .
5 #### This router works beautifully and fits my Jointech Smart Digital router system . Has plenty of power for cabinet doors , jewelry boxes . Superior product .
4 #### I have always used Mirro pressure cookers over the years . If a product works as designed , stick with it .
4 #### Great product for the money ( caught it on sale for under $ 200 ) . This table folds up nicely and stores well when not in use . The clips for securing the folding supports are plastic but very sturdy and secure . Seats 6 adults easily with room to spare or 8 if everyone minds their elbows . Table does rock a little from side to side if bumped but never felt like it would fall over . If it felt more sturdy it would have gotten 5 stars .
4 #### Has great suction . Wish it had a crevice tool and retractable cord though . there is an opening on the handle that keeps moving when I vacuum and I pinch myself vacuuming . not sure the purpose of that . / Easy to assemble .
5 #### I use these for garden stakes , I find them lightweight but able to hold up heavy tomato vines and stake small trellis netting for peas .
5 #### knives fit like they should , mic'd all the knives and they were right on . Have used them for a couple of months now and they seem to be doing quite well . would recommend them to anyone looking for a new set of jointer knives .
5 #### Very high germination rate . I am very satisfied with these seeds .
5 #### High quality , durable edge with all the features you would want . I 'm very happy with this guide . Its very well made and offers precise control .
5 #### Amazing item . Used it for my dremel 8220 . It fits exaclty without wobling , it is very tight just do n't overtighten it . One month non stop work and no damage , except some paint worn off coz of changing heads too often . Its not quick change if i understand what quick change means corectly . Other then that item is really good but I used it only for 8220 dremel , so for other rotary tools incompetent .
5 #### This is a neat little item . It has a light sensor so it turns off when there is too much light . The timer options seem failry simple , 2,4 , ad 6 hours .
5 #### Filters are the right size for my Intex upgraded pump . Fabric is durable and can be cleaned for multiple uses . Usually , one lasts me the entire season . This is a good buy at a reasonable price .
5 #### I cure and smoke mainly pork and this is my go to wood . I have used hickory , cherry , pecan . I like this one tastes the best to me . Cherry is too fruity , pecan and hickory are a little plain . This is a good balance between the two for pork .
5 #### We 've used it a couple times and both times the cakes baked evenly and slid right out of the pan . Vast improvement over the thin aluminum one I had before .
5 #### It is a great kettle . It cooks even & easy to clean .
5 #### I must say this little machine sands out wood or rust of all house jobs . Works just as expected . Will recommend it to others
5 #### I have several Purdy brushes in synthetic bristle for water based paints and China bristle for oil based finishes . I use them for general painting and furniture finishing , and I think they work well , holding a reasonable amount of paint , and holding their shape . A quick clean - up in ammonia and water , or mineral spirits ( depending on finish ) and their ready to go again .
4 #### solid , well made product . works and works well if placed well . the only beef i have is that it is difficult for me to set . Read my full review on my blog [ ... ]
5 #### I love this vegetable brush . The bristles are stiff enough to do a thorough cleaning job . I have arthritis and fibromyalgia and find this tool very easy and comfortable to hold . I highly recommend it !
3 #### The hold down rod did not fit into the fence . It seems like the hole was never milled out after casting . Otherwise everything is solidly made , heavy castings all on parts . Chisels seem sharp enough but I doubt they would have lasted very long in dense woods . I wanted to like this very much but it just simply did not work for me . The amount of effort involved in getting this on ( requires I remove the depth gauge / stop from the press before clamping on the chisel holder ) negated the benefits . If I required production quantities of mortises to be made then I can see how the lengthy setup would be worth it , but if I were a production shop I would just invest in a real mortiser .
5 #### Upgraded from a throw in vinyl hose and I am kicking myself for waiting as long as I did . Flexible , little if any memory in the hose , in short it is everything a vinyl hose it not . Best $ 20 I have spend in some time .
5 #### Love these cutters ! So many sizes , durable and really quick delivery !
3 #### This item is not a very efficient unit not sturdy enough to handle a large task
5 #### I aquired these for my Wife for a Bonsai that she just received . She 's happy poking at it so There you go .
2 #### These gates clog often for me . Since the blast door is contained , chips get jammed into the slot and they keep the door from closing completely . Since these doors can not be disassembled , they are difficult to clean .
5 #### These are the best pruners I have ever used . I intend to buy another one as a gift .
5 #### A must have when trimming they are sharp and the curved edge helps so so much especially when the stems have crystals and are sticky .
3 #### It 's ok , I just realized the only thing I needed was the muffin pan . The rack does raise the broiled foods a plus . Ok I 'm not unhappy .
5 #### I really like Big Bloom . I like that it 's truly organic , that it 's gentle yet effective , and the ingredients ( I could almost make it myself-- it 's just more work than I care to do regularly with everything else ) . What I LOVE is the effect it has on my plants . I 'm not going to try to make claims of percentages or anything like that-- you 'd have to do everything I do , or I 'd have to do everything YOU do , to make that work out for us .... IT WORKS FOR ME AND MY METHODS . It IS a little expensive , but well worth it . Just watch out because not all Fox Farm products ARE organic ( if you care about organic like me-- if not , I 'm sure we have other things in common ) . I 've used their non - organic products too , and like those as well .
4 #### This is a great brush for use on vegetables . The bristles are stiff enough to scrape off dirt , but not as harsh as to damage . The size is just right and fits in the hand well . The rubber makes it comfortable and easy to grip without fatigue .
4 #### This is an innovative product that is easy to assemble , set up and use . Really clever design . The good : 1 . Waters large areas of lawn and eliminates the need to constantly move hoses and sprinklers . 2 . Ease of use . 3 . Auto shutoff 4 . Powered by water pressure . 5 . Adjustable in terms of pattern and amount of water to be added to lawn . 6 . Really good price for what it does . Appears to have high quality construction and parts . The bad : 1 . Probably not great for newly seeded lawns . The weight of the hose will soon be too much for the tractor to pull and it will get stuck in the mud . It needs the root system of established grass or sod to maintain traction . 2 . Occasionally jumps the guiding hose and goes rogue . Not sure why . 3 . Rarely shuts off prematurely if a dirt clod or bump is big enough to push the shutoff button . Overall I am very happy with this item . It allows you to water a lot of grass without having to move hoses or even be present .
5 #### Inexpensive way to water lawn . Puts water exactly where you want it . Five pattern choices .
5 #### Good spring action , seems very well made , I have been using this almost a year now fairly moderately without any issues .
5 #### When I fill the reservoir I frequently change out a guard or 2 that are starting to get black so I can clean them . These go on easily and work perfectly . Interestingly they are not the square cornered ones you see that look like a cylinder . They are rounded like a dome . Still work great ( if not better ) .
1 #### This thing was totally useless . It would not open any can cleanly , bending the can and lid every time . I had to use my P38 to fully open any can that I tried to use this on !
5 #### This is quite a large router bit . 2 - 5/32 inch , lay that out on a ruler . This is a serious bit that you 'll need a powerful router for . Most routers with a 1/2 " collet should be able to handle it , but under 2 - 1/2 hp you would have to take it pretty easy I 'd think . Freud bits are great , the stay sharp a long time . One word of note , I had a freud bit shatter once when I was going fast transitioning from a knot in the wood to normal grain . I think the front of the bit went slow while the back went fast , then the bit started to wobble and since carbide is brittle .. bam . So if you are routing non - uniform wood it pays to go slow . Max RPM is 11,000 so if you do n't have a speed control for your router you 'll need one , this bit takes a huge bite . Hope that helps .
5 #### Just like my 50 year old version , only a bit lighter and works better !
5 #### We trapped as many as 4 chickens at once . If the animal you want to catch is very small / light it will not trip the door to close . This was great to trap the feral chickens overrunning our yard .
5 #### These blades are sharp and cut very smoothly . I have used them with both my corded Porter Cable and my cordless 18v Makita and they work well with both . I will purchase more of these .
4 #### Nice quality . Three of the four screws were lost during shipping ( I guess ) , but other than that it was just fine .
1 #### Harmful junk food for hummingbirds ! . If you love these little flying jewels , you will not feed them this toxic brew . There is no need to color the fluid red ; if your feeder is red or partly red , they 'll find it . They 've been coming for years to my feeder , which has a red base ... it 's all they need to know ! . I found this online from Cornell University : " There is absolutely no reason to add any red dyes to hummingbird sugar water . After all , natural flower nectar is clear , and hummingbird feeders have colorful parts that attract hummingbird regardless of the color of the sugar water . " There are also warnings published in hummingbird books : " The bottom line is that instant nectar products containing artificial coloring are at best a waste of your hard - earned money and at worst a source of disease , suffering , and premature death in hummingbirds . Keep things safe and natural for your hummingbirds . Do n't harm them by feeding them unnatural food ( this stuff has preservatives , too . )
5 #### I use this knife for two things : slicing / dicing tomatoes and jalapenos . The serrations really bite into the tomatoes without smashing them . On jalapenos not only can the outside of the pepper be tough to slice through but also the hearts and seed on the inside . The serrations in this knife remedy that a lot . So while it does n't get used every day , it does get used quite a bit especially if I 'm making pico de gallo . It 's a high quality serrated knife and I 'm glad it 's a part of my set .
5 #### This thing is the bomb ! I have left it one 24/7 & is still running strong & I bought it months ago but just now reviewing because I wanted to give a real review . It still has to be blown out from time to time but I have mine at the tree line of our woods so it kills many , even the biggest meet their end . I would most definitely recommend it ! Arrived on time , no damage . Make sure to buy replacement attractant , only comes with one , has 2 slots for them though .
4 #### I have had one of these for years on my bandsaw , and now I am building a new base for my table saw , for which I bought this one . It is sturdy when wheels are up , and easy to move when they are down . I 've had one for years , and bought another . Need I say more ?
2 #### In a week 's time , on 24X7 with octenol , this has killed 1 fly and two mosquitoes . The cloud of gnats remains unaffected , hovering literally above the device . I think they are taunting me ..
5 #### For a price just south of $ ... , you really ca n't beat this knife . It could be a bit longer , but it gets the job done in style . It looks great , feels solid and just has an all around feel of quality .
5 #### I have had this hammock for a year , and there have been four ten year olds in it swinging , two medium to large adults lounging together , and a large hairy dog relaxing in it , and it looks good as new . I 'd definitely take it in during the winter months , though , as the rope may mold and fade .
5 #### Great products works very good . Got two one for my US flag , the other to light up my back yard . No problems with its installation , get the correct flood light bulb , and you will not have problems , with the unit breaking etc . I placed mine with a timer and its working just fine .
5 #### I am so happy with this purchase . Having a apple corer has been so helpful . My toddler likes to eat an apple whole , and by peeling and coring the apple , it makes it possible , Such a great little kitchen gadget !
4 #### The addition of the fulcrum on the pry bar is a useful innovation . Like all the other pry bars on the market nowadays and unlike my now misplaced Sears pry bar acquired in the 70 's , the prying ends of this tool are rather blunt and therefore difficult to prize in between joined pieces without damaging them . This was remedied with a grinder and belt sander but it would be nice if someone would produce a well ground tool like those of yore .
2 #### I used this in a 270 gallon pond that is continuously aerated by a 600 gal filter / pump . 7 small goldfish , 6 small lilies , handful of water hyacinth in a pond that is drained and refilled with fresh water in mid - April . The pond receives morning shade only . Over the course of several very hot and very sunny days the pond turned green and visibility was at 3 inches . I used this product for about four weeks and saw little difference in clarity or in the amount of algae rinsed from the filter . The weather cooled ( water cooled slightly ) , I added more water hyacinth and fresh barley straw and the pond cleared in two weeks . I 'm not sure if the Algaefix finally worked or if other factors did it . This product is certainly not a quick fix if that is what you are looking for .
5 #### I use this one all the time . It is my go - to spatula for stovetop cooking .
3 #### It is a good can opener and easy to use . I would give it a 5 star but it rusts so 3 star .
4 #### This gets four stars , because with use , a crack will develop at the top of the handle in the black silicone . That said , I still love this bowl and have bought two as gifts since I got my own and grew the crack . It is the perfect size to make a box of bread , a cake mix , or use under a mandoline slicer for vegetables , among other things . It comes nicely clean in the dishwasher , and the measurements marked on the inside are still bright and vivid . If the handle breaks off , I will buy another to replace it .
4 #### this is a nice , lightweight hose and is " somewhat " kink resistent .. after using it a few days i m afraid i would refrain from using the words " never kink " .. given the proper conditions like moving around the yard from one end to another it will kink ..
4 #### It was easy to put on . I was very happy with this product .
4 #### This stuff works great with the larger flies you find around the house or farmyard - not so well with these little flies we have here in Washington State that are about half that size and orbit around in calm wind areas in a loose cloud . The big house files gobble this stuff up and die almost immediately . There are piles of them around my bait stations . It is really quite amazing , compared to some sprays I have tried . The little flies I mentioned eventually land , eat it and die , but not nearly as fast and in as great a number as the larger ones . This stuff really reeks - I guess it has to , to draw in the flies . Stand back when you open the container :-) Painting it on as per instructions did not work so well - I recommend bait stations instead . A cheap plastic container with a thin layer in the bottom seems to work well . Put it out of reach of kids , pets and farm animals . I will buy more when I run out . It really beats any other fly control product I have tried .
5 #### Cheap but a great vac . This is more portable , lighter weight and more useful than our two Orecks . Buy the large vacuum head at the same time .
5 #### Very Cool lil product , not yellow as shown , but all black and easier to hide . Really scaress the Cats away ! Has hose outlet on front so you can hook up another hose to do daily watering .
1 #### Perhaps I 'm expecting too much , but if I spend this much on a countertop appliance , I expect it to last . I agree with some of the other reviewers that the toasting function * does * tend to dry out the toast . My solution is to preheat the oven until both elements are glowing and * then * put in the bread . I watch until it is done & then immediately remove it . It works , but it 's a hassle . What disappoints me the most is that over the last few months I 've begun to have problems closing the door . When it started it was only after the oven was quite hot ( broiling , etc . ) . I assumed something in the guide mechanism was warping due to the heat and it always worked again once the oven cooled down . It gradually began occuring sooner and sooner and now the door will not close at all . I probably only use the oven 2 - 3 times a month . In my experience , this is not an appliance that can tolerate regular use . I 'm very disappointed .
5 #### it 's a standardreplacement for the shop vac I have this time I 'm going to use the foam sleeve and see if it will last me a little longer than the original one
5 #### Small / normal plate size , just like every normal new house . Came perfect in plastic . Mine was missing 1 screw but I had a whole box . Besides that everything was great
5 #### I love this bowl . All batters should be mixed in this bowl . I will never use any other batter bowl again . I highly recommend it as well as the 3 set bowls .
5 #### I wish they would include some staples . No one in town had the staples so I had to special order . I was rather upset and left a negative review but this is a great product . Thank the other reviewers for the enlightening comments .
5 #### This weed blade cuts real well up to 1/4 inch . I would approve this cutter for anyone that has grown up weeds and brush .
1 #### What a piece of junk . One of the magnifiers broke off the first day , but they do n't work well anyway . Takes forever to tighten and then have to tap it with a hammer to move it again . Spend the money now for the Kreg , you will not regret it .
4 #### This plane is pretty comfortable . The one we had , had a wooden handle that split . Leaving us with just the plane . Having a full rubber handle is nice . The blade seems okay . Could be a little sharper to help with flaking at the end of the block but it gets the job done .
3 #### I did not have much luck with this prroduct . It fired multiple times because kf smaller creatures went in eg frog etc . up to now it did not work for me but will continue trying as we do have a big problem with fruit rats .
3 #### We have an old clositmaid system and these were the closest to the originals that I could find . They are not an exact replacement but they work .
5 #### use them alot and they are made in the USA
5 #### This bundt pan is very sturdy and the cake drops out from it easily producing s beautiful presentation ! Here is a photo of the Cream Cheese Pound cake made with it ! Also purchased the cake keeper which is great ! Very happy with the purchase !
5 #### Can not say enough about these ! ! ! ! On my way to purchasing more ! ! ! ! Cakes are perfect size , easy release when properly buttered and floured . Highly Recommend ! ! ! !
5 #### fox farm makes great products but remember sometimes less will get you more wink wink
3 #### The head does not rotate . They are heavy and there is NO cushioning at all in the handles . The rotating aspect is the reason I bought them . When the grass dries I 'll try the functionality . Maybe technically the blades rotate when you undo the screw that holds the two parts together , irks me .
5 #### Very sturdy and strong pry bar . I used to for removing molding and wood work . Does the job well . Note the blue paint will come off though .
5 #### ... after hauling around my 20 - oz . Estwing , I bought this 16 - oz . model as a spare . I was skeptical about this tool after previous reviewers complained of an annoying ringing sound , but I either can not hear this or it just does not bother me . When I first picked it up , I appreciated the shock reduction grip . It is quite an improvement over Estwing models of just a few years ago . My concerns about 16 ounces not being enough mass to drive large nails were alleviated the first time I used this hammer to demolish and re - frame parts of an exterior wall for window and door installation . I found it comfortable to swing and easy to aim given the decrease in mass . It is perfectly balanced . The one - piece design inspires confidence that I wo n't see the head of this baby go flying by my head on the back swing . If my mind were to wander to thoughts of lunch , I know that a misplaced blow wo n't pulverize some wooden handle or worse , send slivers of fiberglass into my eye . All metal construction , sufficient mass , and quality craftsmanship combine in an exceptional all - purpose hammer .
5 #### We love to have s clock outside , we love that hhis is atomic !
5 #### This is a practical Lazy Susan with a lip that prevents things from falling off , but much more important is that it is a beautiful piece of craftsmanship . After looking at several Lazy Susan 's I decided on this one . There is something special about a household item made with skill by hand . I love it ! !
5 #### This opener has taken all the terror out of opening bottles of wine , and I mean terror ! Do n't tell me how easy those waiter - type openers are . For me , they just mean chewed - up corks and tears . And the ones that you hook on the rim just never hook right for me and then they skreek off . More tears , You might assume that I do n't drink a lot of wine , and you would be correct . But , when I do or when I want to serve it , it is essential that I am able to get it open , and now it 's so simple . Whew , I 'm so relieved .
5 #### Double Boilers are hard to fine . This is great price and does a great job . Very pleased with Farberware .
5 #### Jumper cables have a tendency of getting all tangled up in your trunk . This is a nice bag made out of durable material that keeps things all nice and neat . I have some 6 gauge 12 ' jumper cables that stay in here and there is plenty of space for longer / bigger cables . This has kept the trunk a lot more tidy looking than just having a set of cables in there , so I 'm happy . Recommended
5 #### Excellent lightweight , strong pruning shears . Good size , too . I thought they might be small given the lighter weight , but they are one . Excellent for zipping through twigs and small branches . Good and sharp .
1 #### I purchased this design over a year ago . You have to push the hose through the opening and clamp it into place from the inside . You can fix this with sealant and pipe or like I did with duct tape which will leak . I recently found another one at Woodcraft that is made much better and has fittings that you clamp the hoses onto . Brilliant ! Save yourself a major headache and disappointment and buy the one from Woodcraft .
5 #### Love this netting ! It keeps the deer out and is almost invisible . Used it around the perimeter of the backyard and it has worked very well .
5 #### I have owned this model for years ( and given it as gifts ) and it is by far the most versatile opener I have had . It has a " wow " factor when guests see me use it . Simple design , and requires little effort to open a bottle . No twisting , tugging , pulling or damaged corks with this opener .
5 #### It 's a little smaller than I expected . The Amazon product features section says it is 24 oz . capacity but that is incorrect . I thought I had made a mistake when I read the description but it was Amazon that goofed ! It says right on the box it is 21 oz . capacity but what you are working with is more like about 16 oz . If you try to put in more than that it is just too full . Even so , it still comes in handy for all the little jobs . This is great for chopping up small amounts of veggies for my personal size salads and salsa . I even manage to make some hummus in this . Just be careful when disassembling and cleaning the blade ! I 'm saving for one of the bigger ones for the medium to large size jobs but this will be handy for the little ones . Cleans easily and tucks away nicely .
5 #### Works fine and got 10 for price of 1 at local Lamps Plus and it was the wrong size and broke the prong trying to force it into the holes . Did n't need 10 bulbs but will have plenty of spares and the price was right with quick delivery and no running around to try and find the GY6.35 base .
4 #### OK plane , about what I expected . Other vendors are superior .
5 #### My family has this super weird joke about salad spinners , and I received this as a gift , and then liked it so much , I bought one as a gift for my cousin . Anyway , for something that seems superfluous , this thing is amazing . It changes the texture of the lettuce , which really changes the whole salad . Its fun to use , and I sometimes just use it as a strainer for other vegetables . I also like how the top goes down so I can stack other bowls on top of it .
5 #### I 've used these Filtrete air filters for several years in different houses and I am very pleased with them . Yes , they are pricey but if you 're prone to sneezing fits ( as I am ) , they 're worth every penny . Supposedly , the filter media is fine enough to capture even wee tiny particulate matter , including smoke and smog . In addition to breathing easier and filtering out nasty smells from your house ( which are huge benefits ) , I 've noticed that using these filters also helps keep the house and tabletops cleaner , and there 's less need for that dreaded chore of periodic dusting . Another significant benefit is the benefit to your heating and cooling equipment . With a central air system costing thousands and thousands of dollars , this is not a small benefit ! These high efficiency filters do a fine job of keeping dirt and dust out of the blower housing in your HVAC system . The traditional fiberglass filters ( those cheap blue filters ) keep small animals and yard waste from entering into your HVAC , but little else . Ever look at a 20 - year - old blower housing ? Usually they 're caked with lots and lots of fine dust . In addition to being gross , that ca n't be good for an electrical appliance . I highly recommend these Filtrete filters and I change mine more often than the manufacturer 's 90 - day recommended interval . And I think they 're worth every penny of their hefty price tag .
5 #### I drilled a 2.5 " hole in the back and installed vacuum port on the back . Works very well .
5 #### Worked perfectly as a plug in replacement for old filler valve .
5 #### Oregon product is always a winner especially at this price
5 #### I learned from family handyman in order to sharpen knives you need a steel rod ( this does n't sharpen it as much as it does straighten the knives out as they tend to get waavy ) in conjuction with a knife sharpener . Henckels is a good German product .
4 #### a lot smaller than I expected but it did the job .. took me a bit to get the blade just right - very hard to do
5 #### What is to say about vacuum bags . They work fine and fit my cleaner , the old Hoover Hornet Canister Vac , which I love . Keep on making these bags !
5 #### This is my first metal detector and I have a lot of fun with it . easy to use and accurate .
5 #### I 've been buying Filtrete filters for my house for the past 15 years , and for a long time I kept moving up to higher MPR ratings as they released them . While they may be expensive compared to other filters , something that I love about Filtrete is the consistent quality - I always know what I 've going to get , and I know that it 's going to be good . These filters are no exception . Very well made , with good filtering . I tended to use higher MPR ratings than this for years . 2200 is the highest Filtrete MPR that I 've purchased , and after using four of those , I 've decided to back down a bit . The reason is that , while I ca n't say for sure , it sounded like my blower was working a bit too hard to pull air through the 2200 ones . After years of using higher and higher ratings , I decided to try out these MPR 1000 filters , and I quite like them . They seem to work fine in my house , and they are easier on my system . The price is also easier on the wallet than the higher MPR filters . So , after several years of using higher rated filters , I 've decided to use these instead and am very happy with them .
5 #### If you rip or crosscut cabinit grade plywood this is what you need . I have 1 for 90s 1 for 45s and 1 for 22 1/2 and they work great with a thin kerf 120 tooth blade for no tearout .
5 #### My husband and I love these things ! We now have 2 , placed on either side of the house , such that they catch bugs from either direction before reaching us on the porch . Although we can simply relocate them if needed , we still may purchase a few more - one to put back by the garage , and one by the back door . I do n't care for the octenol packs however , as I can smell them and they seem to choke me up a bit ( they do n't affect my husband ) . However the light works so well , I 'm not sure they are needed .
5 #### Product was as described and worked perfectly . Not even sure if my standoff was the right brand , but it worked perfectly .
5 #### The 14 - inch is only good if you have a really small yard . I recommend a longer cutting blade . I LOVE that I could be cutting the grass early to avoid summer heat and not wake my neighbors . It 's quiet , easy to adjust and chewed through most grass . It struggled some with thicker weeds so not as good as a power mower but I love the environmentally friendly approach to lawn maintenance .
1 #### The 4 inch end wo n't fit any of my tools . It is the same size as the tool dust collector . I am going to buy a piece of 4 " sewer pipe to see if it will work to connect this item to my Dewalt Planer , Jet bandsaw , and delta joiner .
3 #### I have 4 of these hooked up to my irrigation system and each one runs about 60 - 80 minutes per week . I 've been using them for years and find the oscillation consistently stops working after about 9 - 12 months . Same with the various metal versions . When they work . they do a fine job . Warranty replacement has been better than average
4 #### I did n't realize this was so tiny . It 's about 1 1/4 inch by 1 1/2 inch . The tape inside has nice large bold numbers . It locks good and retracts very well . It 's a good buy .
5 #### It works great for reheating pizza , french fries , and all kinds of meat and bakery . For things that might drip , I set it inside the baking pan with the identical dimensions . That way it can also be used to broil . It is used so often , that I now have 2 .
5 #### Have only used it once so far , but after years of battling with the hand powered kind , this is awesome ! I agree with one of the other reviewers who said you need to use it in dry weather .
5 #### It works just as it says as no to many board are straight . It did not take long for my husband to say thank you when he was replacing the board on our deck
5 #### The best splitting axe on the market . Great balance , good handle , perfect angle for splitting wood . Much lighter than usual splitting axe .
5 #### I have a number of Bessey products and each is well built and works well . I had built my own picture frame jigs but the problem is tweaking it just too far when applying pressure to the corners . This clamp works well due to the fine adjustment handle you can give the frame just the right amount of pressure without over cranking it and having to reset .
3 #### As expected a replacement part Poor connection between paper part and the rubber sealer
5 #### Perfect for re - cutting take out pizza and more This bad boy is built like a tank , comfortable on the hand and actually looks cool
5 #### These are awesome . Ca n't beat the price . Used with milwakki
5 #### I saw Ree Drummond use this on her cooking show " The Pioneer Woman " . She said she could n't live without it so I ordered one and I now feel the same way . I have sense ordered 2 more , one for my son who is a fabulous cook , and one for my BFF who is also a good cook . Highly recommend this item for anyone who makes any type of roux or gravy .
5 #### Easy to install , program , and use . Been saving on average $ 1 a day .
5 #### This unit lives up to the reviews I read before purchase , got two of them to cover 1 acre and works great .
5 #### My favorite , reasonably priced countersink bit , have used for many years , for construction and finish carpentry work .
5 #### This is an extremely well made Lazy Susan . The wood is solid , the hardware is sturdy and appropriate to its use . It spins really well and with the size it fits everything I want to keep on it . We use it for small tins and pencil cups to store arts & crafts supplies and colored pencils , markers , and twistable crayons . The spinner makes it simple to get to the correct cup for whatever project we have going . And the fact that it 's made right here in AMERICA is a definite buying incentive ! Worth every penny to support Americans and have this kind of a quality product . Highly recommended !
5 #### A co - worker showed me these little guys .... I had no idea Channellock made pliers this small . You wo n't find them at Home Depot or Lowe 's . Absolutely amazing gripping power for such a small tool ! ! ! Not that the design needs any improvement , but I would love to see these offered with V - Jaws , but that 's just a personal preference ....
5 #### This filter fit perfectly into my shopvac . No issues and works much better than the cloth filter that originally came with the shop vac .
5 #### Fantastic , bright light . With two settings , there is a brightness that will be just right .
5 #### Intermatic plug - in timers are not that good , but this in - the - wall one is great . Has lasted for 10 years . Installing the same in other bathroom finally , so that is what this purchase was , because these are great . I hope the quality is still as good , looks and feels identical to what I got 10 years ago , nice job on this one Intermatic - so do n't go changing it ! Leave it alone , do n't you dare fix what is n't broken and I will keep buying and recommending these .
5 #### Bought this to replace an ancestor device of the same make in which the timer finally quit . This device is exactly the same only has the addition of a little red light that shows when the 240V circuit is on the " on " position . A nice feature to a device that 's been excellent for at least 40 years .
2 #### The stated diameter of this tea ball is two inches . What they did n't tell you is that it 's two inches on the OUTSIDE ! I already have one that size was looking for something a little bigger . Needless to say , this was a total waste of money .
5 #### got them fast - did not install yet . They are as pictured
5 #### I love Freud bits & blades . As expected , this bit spins true & cuts cleanly . It 's a very long bit , but there is absolutely no noticeable deflection . The cut is just as clean & straight at the tip of the bit as it is at the base of the cutters . I have been using this mostly for jointing on a router table . This works very well as long as the work piece is thick / wide enough to remain straight while being pushed across the table . I tried to joint a few thin pieces , but they bent into the blade at the ends , leaving them with convex sides ( fat in the middle & thin at the ends ) . I imagine attaching them to a wider board / jig before jointing will solve this issue , but I have n't tried it yet .
5 #### I am using these in an old Craftsman jointer . I started by running a large amount of hard maple over them , and they performed as well as any knives I 've used and for a much better price .
5 #### This is a superior product for melting ice . It is easily swept up if too much is sprinkled and redistributed over another area in need of melting ice . It really beats pushing slush around and picking up chunks of ice . I love the fact that this product is safe for my active dog who loves the outdoors .
1 #### The bird food is not protected from moisture . Therefore , the seed gets wet and hardens so that the birds can not get to the seeds ,
5 #### These are simply amazing . They blow every other lopper I 've ever had away . You can cut through some pretty big branches with no effort . These are strong and powerful . Best loppers I know of . I first bought the racheting type but they were n't as good .
4 #### This air hose works good . I use this hose on an air compressor that produces 200psi and have no problem with fittings coming off due to improper crimping . The hose is flexible and lays flat and the safety yellow color allows the hose to be seen easily so it is less likely to trip over . Great to use in a garage or for outdoor use .
4 #### This little guy is one stout ladder . It is steady even while standing on the top ( where we all know we should n't be ) My only complaint : MADE IN MEXICO .
5 #### Keeping the cats and birds out of our greens patch ! they hate it !
5 #### I used to hear it go off everyday from all the cats that roamed the neighborhood . Now , its rare to hear it go off as they cats no longer come around my yard .
5 #### I got this for my old Vac . Fits fine , works , i have a spare , life is good . three more words to make 20 .
5 #### This is probably my favorite hose because it 's drinking water safe , made in the USA , and has the " Thum Thing coupling for easier attachment to the faucet " . I also like that it 's only 25 feet long so it 's not unwieldy . It also does n't kink . I actually use it for my backyard because I do n't need a long hose and I often use it to fill bird baths with bathing and drinking water for the birds .
5 #### I LOVE MY SALADS ! ! I;M VERY PICKY ABOUT WASHING MY SPINACH BEFORE I CREATE MY SALAD . THIS OXO IS ONE OF THE GREATEST SPINNERSI EVER USED . IF YOU LIKE SALADS LIKE I DO . YOU NEED TO GET THIS OXO LETTACE SPINNER . C.INFUSINO CHICAGOLAND
5 #### We 've broken many a cheese grater . I like this one because it does not have plastic parts . Has different size grating areas & food falls in the middle so you can sit it in a bowl & grate away without the mess . We 've washed it in the dishwasher on the top rack .
5 #### The unit is pretty much as described , and does what it is supposed to do . The construction is a bit flimsy ; and the adjustments of the lights and sensor are a bit cumbersome , primarily because the construction is not top of the line . The peripheral sensing range is minimal , and the sensitivity is just on this side of acceptable . All told , this is a serviceable basic light , and it is priced appropriately .
5 #### Trees and shrubs grow year - round here in Hawaii , and trimming is a constant job . I much prefer using thisno cords , more control and a bit of exerciseover an electric trimmer .
3 #### A lot heavier than I expected . I did not return the hose because it works well where I using it . I 'm glad that I do not have to lug it around . I do not doubt it 's strength and durability .... it 's more like I have problems carrying it .
4 #### The only reason I bought this was to make the order large enough to get free shipping . I have used it before and feel that the chips are a little to small for my use . Also can buy at my local Home Depot
3 #### I have owned several Stir - Crazy popcorn makers over the years , and they are wonderful . I noticed my 8 - quart is no longer being made and wanted to buy one for my son for college . The price jumped significantly on the item on my Wish List ( and I understand that 's the game in the Amazon marketplace ) but I was disappointed to see it go from $ 21.99 to $ 36.70 . Even worse , after ordering I found the exact model at Target for $ 19.99 . West Bend has just released a deluxe model that has a removable insert for easier cleaning ( a big improvement ) . I got that model for $ 34.99 at Meijers . I processed a return for the one I received from Amazon today , but with the shipping ding , I may not come out ahead ! I love my popper , but I 'm concerned about the other reviews on the Teflon finish flaking off the models made in the past few years . I 'll report on the performance of the deluxe model soon . Check other stores since this item should not be more than $ 20 .
5 #### I BUY THESE ALL THE TIME FOR ME AND FOR OTHERS WITH PLANTS ! !
5 #### bought the wrong size , so I put these in my aquariums for the algae eaters to hide in . good quality . bought the smaller size now . I use them for the pond spitters .
5 #### I was working on a couple small projects with no jamming at all . It 's ok when you only need a box or two .
4 #### I got this grow light to try starting seeds at home . It was a good price and all of the reviews were pretty good . It set up in about 5 minutes and I had no issues with the light . I 've since set it up on a timer with some seeds under it , so I 'll update later with whether or not it is effective . The only thing I would change is that the while most parts fit together snugly and would be difficult to disassemble ( they would n't fall apart easily ) , the two pieces that make up either side of the base slid together pretty loosely . It is fine and stable , but I can see these falling out if I try to move it somewhere .
5 #### This pedestal roller stand is nearly perfect . It was easy to assemble and is easy to correctly adjust to the proper height . The stand is study and well made . The feet can be easily adjusted if your shop floor is not level . The stand is heavy enough that it will not easily tip over . Before , I had a cheap light - weight stand from Sears . This stand is a significant improvement . I would purchase this stand again . Its made in the USA , so that is good .
5 #### this works fine . I replaced two of them . also found them actually cheaper at the local Home Depot store . Both seem to work fine .
1 #### JUNK FOOD FOR HUMMINGBIRDS . I have been reading dozens of sites on the care and feeding of hummingbirds ... they all advise against adding red dye to the nectar ( which can easily be made fresh by mixing sugar and water ) . Here is what the Audubon Society says : " No , red coloring is not necessary and the reddening chemicals could prove to be harmful to the birds . Natural nectar itself is a clear solution . " Do n't buy this junk food ! If you care for these little flying jewels , you 'll provide what 's healthy for them and not give them anything that could harm them . Again the Audubon Society : " Fill the feeders with sugar water ; made by combining four parts hot water to one part white [ not brown ] sugar , boiled for one to two minutes . Never use honey , artificial sweeteners , or red dye . "
4 #### This 5 - 1/2 " Stanley 21 - 398 replacement blade was a perfect fit for my older 21 - 399 Surform pocket plane . The plane now shapes and forms Bondo filler for auto body repairs nicely and is working as good as new so overall , I 'm very happy with the purchase .
4 #### Other than the really short power cord like so many products have , the two we have work just fine . We added a photo sensor so it 's only on at night , saves a lot of power and extends the life of the lamp . A neighbor saw it and bought one for his yard .
5 #### Paid as much for one file as I did for the box of 12 ! Super quality ! ! My chains always have a fine edge in the woods now .
5 #### More heavy duty than most whips and works nice for gravy , dissolving cornstarch in water ( we use large amounts ) and easy to clean as well .
5 #### I was happy to find these on Amazon because I actually was having a hard time finding these now that it 's fall . Places either did n't have any or did n't have the size I needed . These are really nice quality , not flimsy at all .
5 #### I have only used it on a few light duty projects but so far it works great , good value
5 #### I used these to install hardwood floors . My nailer ( Freeman PFL618BR 3 - in-1 Pneumatic Flooring Nailer ) took L shaped nails and based on reviews and price I chose these . They worked great . Absolutely no problems with the nails .
5 #### I bought this for my three burner Dyna Glow gas grill . It seems to be of decent quality . It has held up for the past several months and it completely covers the grill down to the ground . It has Velcro straps on the two ends to tighten it down but I do n't find that they are necessary to use . This cover has withstood several storms and constant direct sunlight . Happy with it so far .
5 #### Love this cake pan . Easy release finish , detailed design , handles for easy use , nice thick metal . Wish I had it years ago , would have saved a lot of broken cakes !
5 #### quality product . I use these every day , going on 4 years of abuse cutting finish - nails all day long
5 #### I love this feeder ... I now get to watch the hummingbirds while I drink my morning coffee in the kitchen . :-)
5 #### Killed Rats quickly . Be careful this would really hurt if your finger got snapped . I used a varielty of baits in the traps . I found leaving them along the wall where the rats travel without bait works better . Find a hole they walk through or something and leave the trap out . It also helped If I wore latex gloves any time i handled the traps .
5 #### Nice plastic handle . Wing nut tightens enough to hold your desired angle . Ca n't beat it for the price and about the same as the off brand at lowes .
3 #### I really like the design and the no - frills approach these measuring spoons employ , but my set had a pretty significant burr on the inside lip of the smallest spoon that did hminorn impact on how they worked . It definitely made it harder to clean . I absolutely love the design , but the finish problem was a bigger deal than I would have liked . If it did n't have the burr , I would give it five stars without hesitation . For the price , I understand that the quality checks wo n't be as stringent , but still would think this could have been noticed during manufacturing . For the price , I would still recommend the set , just know that yours might need a little help with sandpaper before it is ready for prime time .
5 #### Love this pan and use it in place of regular pie tins for my one crust pies and even my meat pies . I love the removable bottom ...
4 #### Good whisk but actually quite heavy . If you do n't work out you may have some extra trouble beating ingredients for a prolonged period .
2 #### I just bought a new RAS-120 angle square to replace my old RAS-120 . I think my anger with the new tool is proportional to how much I liked the old one . The new square is thinner than the old one , and came from the store bent . For the savings of a few pennies Johnson ruined one of the most useful tools I own . I called Johnson and gave them an earful . To their credit it appears that they stand behind their products with a strong warranty , but frankly I 'd much rather never have to use that warranty . I do n't know if there is a good alternative out there , but if you are replacing your good old square do n't expect a good new one to replace it .
4 #### I purchased this to repair my Gilmour sprayer . It installed fairly easy , but was a bit pricey . If I get good life out of it , then it will justify the cost .
4 #### This bag works great - do NOT throw away the plastic collar from the old bag . The collar is not ( as of 3/2013 ) sold on Amazon & if you throw it out you might find it difficult to replace . My 3rd bag ... always wears out around the collar .
5 #### Super clean cuts and a great quality dado blade . Because of the price I hesitated but glad I pulled the trigger for this dado set . Highly recommended .
5 #### Nice , well - made and quality grater . Perfect size for making hash browns . Heavy duty enough to last a long , long time . Very happy with this product . Would highly recommend .
5 #### It 's weird how much a salad spinner can actually help your salads ... It does make a difference . This one is a quality build , strong plastics , easy to clean , easy to maintain . Packing was nice and simple . It 's stylish and has a nice aesthetic for a reasonable price . Overall , very pleased .
4 #### If you need to measure stuff , use this . It works .
5 #### Goes through a stud , and a nail like a hot knife through water .
3 #### I purchases about 2 of these a year for my business and they have excellent staying power . The only issue I have every found is that the slip tends to come off the shaft after 4 - 6 months of what I consider to be normal useage .
5 #### Got this so I could tell what time it was while swimming in the pool . for the $ 40 I paid it is a great product . Solid / heavy and easy to read from across the yard . I put the batteries in , hung it up and 30 minutes later it was set to the WWDC time . Piece of cake !
5 #### As advertised and listed . Very nice spoon rest , wo n't break , very good looking and large enough for any spoon to fit in it . I 'm very happy with this .
4 #### We had great luck with this and love how you can lower it close to the plants , only thing is the light has gone out and we are having a hard time finding a replacement
4 #### Seem to be helping with our wet spring and the mosquito outbreak
4 #### Does the job I bought it to do . Well made . No problems .
5 #### I 'm still using Klein tools that I bought 47 years ago . Klein tools are high quality tools , made in the U.S.A.
5 #### Got this to work with a travelling sprinkler . It does feel more substantial than the less expense hoses I have and unlike them , I have not even come close to experiencing any kinking problem . Using it with a quality Ames rolling cart for storage . I found the pricing comparable to the big box home supply stores .
5 #### Kitchen work is becoming harder for me due to lack of small motor skills ( MS ) . This bowl is great because it stays put and then there is a handle . I need to get one size larger too !
4 #### I bought this sander several years ago and use it a lot at times in building guitars and other detail work . It is uniquely useful at times . It is great for shaping irregular parts such as guitar necks when one is nearly finished with the neck and for faceted curved parts . A few negatives tho . Dust removal on any but the shortest triangular pad is very poor hooked up to a vac . Also , very hard to get a wide range of sandpaper for all the pads . I cut up old 5 hole loop and hook sandpaper which as become tattered at the edges . It still works well . Sometimes does n't stick all that well but very useful . It is very easy to burn an adapter pad and I have burned several and have n't been able to find replacements . Seems durable and well made . Kind of noisy but I like it 's variable speed and aggressiveness at high speed .
3 #### This bag is alright . Be aware it is smaller than the one that came with your saw . Not big deal but surprised me .
5 #### This is the best gas cooker I 've ever owned . I especially like the wind breaker on it . It has great control and lights easily .
5 #### I have owned the Kuhn Rikon 5 Quart Pressure Braiser for several years and have been perfectly delighted with it . I used it for many wonderful things , especially soups and stocks . It eventually became tedious to make stock in a 5 Quart capacity in such a wide and shallow pot , so I decided to purchase the Kuhn Rikon Duromatic 8 - 1/2 - Quart Stockpot as well . It is as advertised with 18/10 stainless steel , but it is definitely lighter than the 5 Quart Pressure Braiser . I suppose the shape and narrow mouth of this pot simply requires less steel support than the 5 Quart Braiser . The rubber o - ring is also lighter and less bulky . These are not criticisms , simply observations that I found curious . Overall , it is expertly made , easy to maintain , a snap to clean in the dishwasher , a shape that is easy to store , and works flawlessly every time . Excellent product .
5 #### As this is a single use item there is n't much to say about it other than it 's very well made . A no worry buy .
5 #### Very fine value for this indispensable cooker . Chicken cacciatore in 8 minutes !
5 #### Only used it once to make a chicken but it turned out excellent ! Sits perfectly on top of my Weber grill . Granted it was only one chicken but the motor worked perfectly . Clean up of the spit can be a pain but not a deal breaker . Definitely glad I spent the extra and got the rotisserie meant for my grill EDIT : I did cook a 12 pound turkey on this recently and it worked flawlessly ! It had no problem spinning the bird . Just need to make sure to tie legs and wings tight .
5 #### It is a simple and sturdy little box fan . It does just as it says it does . It is nothing fancy but does the trick ! ! I would buy one again if I needed to .
4 #### Small pans to use in my RV itty bitty oven . Not sure how long it will last ! !
5 #### Yes , these are the perfect little brushes : they can bend to accommodate hard - to - reach corners and spaces and keeping my hummer feeders clean is a priority . Really great price , too !
4 #### a little difficult to use and i could not ever get the coffee to taste great
5 #### Great product . The replacements go on nice and smooth and there are no issues . Same quality as the original ones that the Shur - Line comes with .
5 #### This pruning stick is the best thing to come along in a long time . I had been trying to figure out how to prune our big Rhododendron bush without ruining its shape , but no matter how I tried , I just could n't get at the top . This stick allows selective pruning while on a ladder or from the ground . It is lightweight and comfortable to handle . Definitely well worth the price .
5 #### I use earthworm castings in conjunction with several other types of compost for maximum nutrient effectiveness . Of the earthworm castings I 've used , I find that these have the darkest color and the best texture . It has a pleasant earthy smell that reminds me of the woods . My daughter loves to run her fingers through this stuff , and she calls it " black gold . " Yeah , I know that may sound odd when you are talking about a 12 year old girl , but she recognizes the benefit this stuff gives her tomatoes . I have had excellent results using this product as an amendment . I use it in my " soil " mixture for my Square Foot Garden . I follow the methods developed by Mel Bartholomew and I 've had amazing successes . This product does cost a bit more than what I pay for another brand at my local nursery , but the difference between the two is like night and day . The texture , the color , the smell and even the density are all different . If I could afford to use this brand exclusively , I would . I 've purchased quite a few bags here , and I 've never been disappointed .
5 #### This was just the thing my daughter needed to complete her unicorn lamp project . Very nice quality and easy to install .
1 #### Very disappointed that the DuraCord Rope started breaking in just two years , even though we only used it for 5 or 6 months each year and stored it indoors in the winter . Need to buy a replacement and will avoid DuraCord this time .
4 #### I 've used this for a couple of times and it 's working good . It heats up fast and cooks fast . I used it for doing hamburgers and they came out juicy even well done . I put it under the exhaust fan since there is smoke coming out during the cooking process . After removing the burgers ( can only put two patties ) I put a few sheets of wet paper towel and closed the grill to start cleaning . This made the cleanup a breeze . This is a basic model which does not have temperature control and cooks for one or two persons . It 's nothing fancy but very sturdy and I think it 'll last me for a while and prepare good healthy food .
5 #### Birds loves this product and the best thing is , you do n't have to fill it everyday and it looks good .
4 #### It is heavy duty , but it 's probably heavier than it actually needs to be . The handle and pour spout make for a very convenient product .
5 #### I 've had several of these over the years and find them to be unbeatable .
5 #### My aunt bought me a pair of these loppers years ago . I bought a second pair to have onhand because they work so well . Great price for these as well . Hard to find them locally and I 'm sure they were cheaper online ! My other fiskars loppers / pruners with metal blades tend to rust even though they are kept in the garage [ they do n't cut as well either ] . These work great and they are easy on the hands / wrist which is a bonus .
5 #### I have used this product for years and found it to be safe while doing the job of melting snow and ice .
5 #### This is a very handy size . It seems to be of good quality .
4 #### This is my first " Stick " vacuum . I am surprised at how well it works .. Gets the corners and under furniture so much better than my upright . Definite flaw in the handle design as mentioned in other reviews . The handle feels whimpy for the weight of the unit .
3 #### It does work , but I think it really beats the crap out of the wood - I expect these would be really nice on metal to remove rust or old paint better than wood if your trying to keep the wood in any shape . And I tried these for both the fine and course .
4 #### Works perfect almost all of the time , sometimes hangs up after I try to reduce the initial time by a little .
4 #### Good deal for the money . I 've been using them quite a bit , and even washing them in the dishwasher . So far so good .
2 #### The brass wand is too heavy for the cheap plastic collar that holds it to the trigger section and when you wave it back and forth to spray it causes the collar to loosen and leak . If it had a more sturdy collar it would probably be OK
5 #### Much better than another cheaper one I bought previously . Everyone needs one of these in the kitchen
1 #### Bought it brand new . Tried 2 of their recipes , one Krusteaz bread machine mix , two of my own recipes . None turned out right . This was my 4th bread machine , wore out the previous 3 , so have lots of experience with bread machines , this one was the worst I ever had . Contacted the company , did n't get much help , just kept saying do a dough ball test , I explained that I had never had to do one before , in years and years of using bread machines . Just too much trouble ... so , got myself a Zojirushi , even though lots more money it works like a champ ... first time , every time , right out of the box !
5 #### It sure scares the dogs and people , let hope it works for deer . Hard to say if it works since I 'm not around and we have only had it a month . We lost one hosta but not sure if it was a deer or rabbit and it was away from the sprinkler . I would like a couple more for the dogs in the neighborhood and the walkers that let the dogs go on the grass without clean up .
5 #### Have only used one bale and cleared whole pond . Ca n't believe how good this stuff is . Used to use barley grain in a bag but this works better and is easier to use .
5 #### Nice to have a new fire extinguisher , my other one was 12 years old . These should be replaced periodically .
3 #### Will attract small sweet loving insects like mini ants and the spiders that go after them . Not bad for the money and will free you of bad chemicals in the house . But yet to trap the big bad boys , like roaches .
5 #### very cute ... doen't really make any noise but looks good ... ;-)
5 #### Needed this for my Shop - Vac and fits perfectly . I just used it to vacuum some drywall dust and worked great . Did n't see any dust fly out the exhaust vent so it works for my intended purchase . I would definitely buy again when its time for a replacement
3 #### These work well , but usually on last 1 year , so be prepared to buy one every year . I use it in my chicken 's water trough .
5 #### Great soldering gun , much better than the cheap Chinese made junk that you can buy at Harbor Freight .
5 #### After trying to find a way to make bacon - weave taco shells for a few weeks , I happened upon these . Good size , and they make the bacon weave process very simple to make taco shells . Non - stick surface makes the shells slide off and the grease drips off onto the baking trays underneath . Easy to clean . I put them in my dishwasher and they are good to go .
1 #### The handle is so short , only a 4 ' person can use it ! If you are 5'5 " tall or taller , it 's way too short to you 'll put stress on your back . It also does n't cut much . Very disappointed ; waste of money .
5 #### good thing I was there - my husband wanted to flatten the tines ! The unusual shape adds in stirring but is still fairly flat . For me , the fork speeds up stirring and blending . Have to admit I saw on an old Julia Child show and I was intrigued , so had to try .
3 #### Device worked well for first few months . It did what it was designed to do , and I appreciated having it . After several months , while coring and dividing a new red delicious apple , it broke into two pieces . More specifically , the metallic divider remained intact , but the plastic handle broke on opposite sides , mid - way between the handles and the core remover . I am now debating whether or not to re - purchase a replacement or go to a single function corer ... or even abandoning the gadgetry , and returning to the use of a kitchen knife . I have , by the way , never had an OXO product break before , so I am not knocking their good name or products .
5 #### Fits the Coleman cable 08660 perfectly fine . Love it !
3 #### A little difficult to use , probably should of bought one more sturdy with sharper blades .
5 #### Great product , great price and quick shipping . Stands up great to our weather in the Outer Banks
5 #### This is best simple invention ever ! We use garlic a lot . This little thing saved me so much time and effort . It 's super easy to use , super easy to clean . I ca n't believe that I did n't buy it earlier . I recommended to all my friends and they all love it .
5 #### This is one serious set of replacement utility knife blades . The dispenser can be mounted on a garage wall and is made of metal .
5 #### Nice choice of colors , they work perfectly , and they are small enough to fit in the silverware drawer until needed .
5 #### Bought it because someone reviewed that it caught a couple of snakes YES ! but alas , no snakes yet . The netting is thin , it sticks to itself when you curtain it about , but once it 's in place , it works well . It will NOT keep deer out , if those guys want your stargazer lilies , they will get past this netting . Birds however , they do n't dive for the strawberries any longer . YES ! So depending on what you need , it is pretty sturdy , very very thin , and almost invisible when hanged , birds will be like " what the " but deer will be like " hmm , another cobweb to carry in my antlers ... "
1 #### Broke the second i tried to put the extinguisher in . Cheap product .
5 #### As a rule I do n't like using these tandem devices , but if your out of space and understand the pitfalls- like overloading the neutrals on a multi - wire circuit . Then they 're fine . Actually , you must have a handle - tie on multi - wire circuits now , so that would be two violations if you used this on a multi - wire circuit . If anything I 've said is unfamiliar , call an electrician .
5 #### Works as stated . Adds stability to ladder especially for long extensions . I do not have a Werner ladder , but this attachment still works .
5 #### At work , we call it " The Best Saw In The World . " I am a timberframer and use this saw to cut kerfs at the correct depth . It has also done some duty as a general framing saw and a diamond blade wet saw for cutting stone . It gets dropped a lot too . We have other saws on the job , but this one is always getting used because it is light , powerful , and stays where it is set . The only real flaw to this saw is that the aluminum plate gets bent , compromising the precision this saw is capable of . But that is our fault for being so hard on it .
5 #### I have used and owned all kinds of framing nailers . This one is the berries ! Read ToolPig 's review . And Hey ! Guess what ? Paslode makes full - head nails to shoot from this gun . Surprised ? I was . You can not beat this gun for performance , price , or utility . Just wish I could get paid for saying this .
4 #### Good product- does what it is supposed to do ! Not a bad deal . Got these for security around the house . Makes me feel softer when I am at home !
4 #### I like the non - slip bowl -- in fact I often use it as just a bowl without the slicer , it 's a good size and shape for lots of things . It 's a little difficult to change inserts in the slicer , but once you 've got the right one in , slicing is quick and easy .
3 #### It is still setting on my husbands work bench collecting misc stuff so apparently after he got it , he decided to do something different ! I may end up using it for my craft supplies and then my rating might go way up ! !
5 #### We have the individual size but wanted to be able to make multiple espresso without waiting for the smaller one to cool . Works awesomw , delicious rich espresso whenever we want it . Remember to close tightly and heat slowly over medium high heat
4 #### The de - icer works great . I turn it on early in the morning and within 10 - 15 minutes enough ice has melted for the birds to get some water . I do turn it off after dark . The only negative thing is the heater collects this white deposits on the heating element . I 'm thinking it may be from the salt in my water . A longer cord would make this de - icer perfect .
5 #### Well made , roomy - a little larger and longer than the furniture , so they are very easy to remove and replace . The only downside is that the furniture still gets a little dusty . Durable and well made with a vinyl top and fleecy lining .
5 #### I needed to put garden tools and electric lawn mower etc . somewhere . I was turning my garage into a working shop for guitars . I bought 2 of these ( 120 cubic feet ) . The looks are not obtrusive . No faux shingles , no barn appearance which made these ideal for placing on my deck . PROS : Everything I can think of . There could be enhanced color choices but that would increase prices . CONS : None ( unless Suncaster wants to lower the low price and probably sell more )
5 #### Great strainer . Sturdy , will not fall apart when you look at it .
5 #### If you do not have a green thumb then this is your answer ! I highly recommend this for houseplants . This product is the only one I have ever found that consistently maintains healthy and thriving plants / trees . I am sure that it works just as well outdoors with vegetables and such . Plus its organic ! ! !
5 #### Good for what it was , still works and was a good deal for an older canner . Great to can again .
4 #### There seem to be two types of timers available now , this one with clips to define on - off and another with 48 buttons to determine on - off . I could only find the latter locally . I objected to it for two reasons . First , it was too easy to mash a few buttons and get undesired on times . Second , the override switch was absolute ; if you turned it on , it stayed on until you turned it off , a day or a week later . The one I 'm reviewing has two clips which can be set with about the same resolution as the above . I think you can reverse one pair if you want only one on period which is better than losing the clips . It has the disadvantage that if you turn it on / off too close to when it would do that itself , you might make a 15 minute or so reprogramming and it is a bother . Either do n't do that or pick it up and reset the dial to the correct time . But ! ! when you turn it on with the override , it will stay on until it would otherwise turn off . That way it does n't run all night . So ... get the one that suits your requirement .
3 #### Well made clamp but too expensive for what it does . A short bar clamp works just as well and has many other uses than the one function Dewalt .
5 #### we had mice in our office . now we do n't . so it is great .
1 #### Read most of the reviews on Amazon and decided this knife was worth a shot . In fact , I found this knife based on some other reviews as being the best knife for the money . But I assure you , this is the furthest thing from the truth . I 'm not a knife basher -- I'm not here to downplay this knife in hopes of making other knives rise to glory . This knife just straight up sucks . I ordered it in hopes that it would be the knife in our block that ruled them all . My precious . Our go - to knife . The knife that we could rely on to get us through the thick .. and the thin . But alas , no . No sir - E - bob . Took it out of the packaging and immediately noticed that the J.A. Henckels writing on the blade was smudged . Is this a knock - off ? If that 's not a red - flag I do n't know what is . The blade as one would expect should have an edge on it . Run your finger away from it and you should feel some sense of sharpness -- but not with this knife . We tried to cut a watermelon and it hardly scratched the surface . Without hesitation I plopped it back into the packaging and sent it back . Save your money , save your time , and try something else .
5 #### This is a quality plug that has some heavy duty lugs inside for the wire . The same plug was 26 dollars here local .
4 #### I 've been using a 2 - stroke gas blower for the past 6 year or so , but I 've been getting tired of the noise , the vibration , mixing gas and oil and in general all the fuss required to start and run it . About a year ago I found a Toro Ultra Blower at the yeard sale of a couple moving to Australia at a very attractive price , and I bought it . Much to my surprise , this light electric blower puts out a lot more air than my noisy gas blower- and it weighs a lot less , too . Trailing a cord as I work is n't that much trouble , and the lower noise level is a big plus , especially when I 'm working in the garage , blowing out the dead leaves , dust , and other detrius that manages to work its way in . I only paid about a quarter of what this thing normally sells for , but base don how it 's performed so far , the asking price seems pretty reasonable .
5 #### My wife jealously guards her Henckel knife set . We did n't have the steak knives , so these make her a very happy and contented kitchen goddess . This is a good thing .
4 #### I 'm pretty new to splitting logs and was looking for a better way to disassemble the oak that my son - in - law dropped for me 8 months earlier . The reviews and youtube videos made this look like a dream come true . Alas , I found limited success with this axe . Maybe older wood would split more easily , and he had good luck with this on his birch and aspen , but I went back to the good old wedges , splitting maul and sledgehammer . The one additional tool that really helped me was the Ace Collins 4 lb . wood - splitting wedge . I do use this axe , but mostly to finish cutting the wood fibers to separate the pieces .
5 #### It 's a breaker , it fits and it was a good price .
4 #### Nice little saw . MUCH easier to handle than my 7.25 " B&D. I do n't miss the difference in cutting depth since I really only cut sheet goods and 2x4 's with it . The thin kerf blade really zips through 3/4 " plywood with little tearing . The stamped sheet metal base is a little wimpy -- would have preferred cast aluminum -- but it works fine , really . All adjustments are easy and precise . The dust collection pipe works well , too . I would buy it again . Minus one star for the base -- picky , picky .
5 #### Price is right and works perfectly , what more can be said .
5 #### I returned this strainer because I found one at the dollar store . I am sure it would have worked great for me , but I am also sure that the one that I got at the dollar store would work the same .
5 #### Had previously bought one of these years ago , lost it in a move . Works great , have had sub zero weather already and it keeps the birdbath open ...
5 #### What can I say , other than it does its job well ! As always , OXO products are of good quality , and love the large handle on this whisk .
5 #### My friend had a pampered chef Melon Baller , but I did n't want to pay that much . Picked this one out because of the reviews and I have been very happy with it . The handle is soft but you can keep a firm grip . Have used this numerous times over the summer . I believe this will hold up very well and last many years .
4 #### I use it mostly for furniture and small carpets . The idea of a lightweight canister easy to move around appealed to me . It is quite noisy and the handle gets very warm when the motor is running . I would recommend it for light work . It is just what I need .
5 #### People love playing around with these when they are over ! ! Adds some lovely drunken humor to our fridge !
4 #### Takes a while for the squirrels to fall for the bait .
5 #### sturdy and and very nicely formed for the hand . easy to snip with
5 #### Working as expected . I have n't had enough time to evaluate yet .
5 #### We irrigate off a canal , which is notoriously muddy . No problems with plugging yet !
1 #### Although I have used Rootech in the past with success The last batch of Rootech failed ! It does n't even seem to be water soluble . The quality control seems nonexistent . When I buy products that fail ; I fail .
5 #### This is my favorite bowl . It 's just the right size for most jobs and the handle is great for mixing and pouring .
5 #### I bought this to keep the birds off my tomatoes and it has worked ! This is the first year that I can actually leave my tomatoes on the vine until they are truly vine ripened . The netting is made of sturdy material and should last many seasons .
2 #### I 'm very disappointed with this hose after 3 months of use . It was absolutely perfect for my use and exactly the right size , it also never kinked . When using this product with an attachable device like a water wand , the brass piece at the end starts to loosen and eventually comes off , leaving you with a useless hose which ca n't screw onto any watering nozzle . The only redeeming quality is that Amazon is letting me return it for a full refund after this long of a period due to the lifetime warranty included . For that reason I 'm going to give it 2 stars , but I highly recommend getting a hose made in the USA like the platinum flexgen hose from Gilmore if a larger diameter is ok for your needs .
2 #### First of all I think that the board buddy is a good idea . Safety is always an important issue with me . The board buddy is well made . In saying that I gave only 2 stars because the board buddy is a pain for people with metal fences . I have an expensive biesemeyer fence on my saw . I 'm not about to drill holes and tap them in my fence to put in a track so I can use the board buddy.(fence has no pre - drilled holes ) I think that this should have been something that Woodstock should have stated in their description or made an adapter . I had to go online and research this to fix my problem . I was very disappointed that I could n't use the board buddy when I needed it . I would not have bought the board buddy if I knew what I know now . I would have done something else . Good wood fences are not cheap unless you make one . It is something that a good wood worker can do and I 'm not at that skill level yet . Not happy with Woodstock .
5 #### This is a work of art , made in the US . I saw a TV show on how they make them , so cool . I have wanted one for a long time even though my cheapo rubber handled 16 oz is ok . I also am not seeing them in stores anymore and I worried they might cease production . I felt flush and bought it happily .
5 #### I had never tested my own soil before and had wanted to , but the tests seemed so complicated and hard to use . After looking through the soil testers on Amazon I thought I would take the plunge and do my own testing . Well , it was a lot easier than I thought and the results are easy to read and are accurate . My neighbor has a larger , more expensive kit and he did a test right after I did mine and they were pretty close to each other with the results . I could not be happier with the kit and I found out exactly what I needed for my garden . The best part of the Luster Leaf kit is the price . So inexpensive and such a great result !
5 #### Great price . Fits my Siemens PL panels . You will not find a better price anywhere !
3 #### I ve owned several of these , since they are suppose to be " the best " on the market . The first one I received , one of the screws holding the tip on were in crooked and stripped out so it never tightened on right . In my opinion this tool is sub par . With my current tool , it does heat quickly , but for some reason every 10 minutes of use I have to re - tighten the screws due to loosening , or perhaps carbon buildup . This is quite inconvenient and after you unscrew it a dozen times the alloy body strips out and needs to be re - tapped with larger threads . I like my new ' home tapped ' threads better anyways because with the larger screws , it hold tighter , and loosens up less often . The high setting is also a pain to use since you have to hold the trigger in half way to activate it . This is uncomfortable and cramps my fingers very quickly . Its also counter - intuitive having the high setting at half pressed in and low at fully pressed . I 'm not all squawk though , I 'm more about making things better , so IMO ; the design should include a better tightening system for the tips , and a switch on the side of the body for switching between high and low rather than holding the trigger in half way .
5 #### This thing makes piles of bugs under it . If the house gets too infested here near the lake , I take it inside and let the pile up begin .
5 #### I was amazed to get crema the first time I made expresso . This machine is well designed with many nice features , like a storage spot for the measuring spoon , build in coffee tamper . The timer is a great feature to get the exact strength of coffee needed every time . The frother works great , excellent froth from skim milk and easy to clean too .
4 #### Get your taste buds set for an explosion of popcorn the way it should be made . Gather a few family members or friends and make this an event ; or , snuggle up by yourself with a favorite show . Personally , I like to pop the seeds in garlic oil , sprinkle with melted butter and garlic . Positively , sensational . The West Bend has a nice clear dome to watch the excitement going on inside . The swing arm makes certain that all your seeds pop . You can transfer the popcorn to a bowl or just place the cap on the top and voila you have a bowl . Would highly recommend to popcorn enthusiasts and those who just want popcorn the way they remember .
5 #### The price is right for this item . Quality is great . Will buy again when needed . No need to buy any other .
5 #### I live in FL , so sometimes the St Augustine grass we have can get kind of thick if I do n't do it regularly . I had a weed eater / edger combo and I think my yard has killed that thing . So I decided to go with a standalone edger again . This runs very well , and the adjustments for height work well . I can now edge in a timely fashion without having to worry about trimmer line for that part anymore .
5 #### What else can you ask for in a can opener ?
3 #### I called Mars fish care and asked them why someone on Amazon has written a review that says this product does not work in all water conditions and that Mars does n't disclose this . They answered that the product does n't work right when there are " very high " phosphates or " very high " hardness conditions . They do n't know the exact numbers where the product stops working , but you should avoid it in those conditions Be aware of that . Outside of those conditions ( which the manufacturer does n't reveal apparently unless you call and ask ) it is a good product .
5 #### I love this apple corer . It is so easy to use and better than most with a great grip handle .
5 #### This baby will replace a small chainsaw , really does a job on small branches . Under 3 inches .
3 #### While it did work and I got a few kills last year , it barely lasted a year before the unit died and wo n't work anymore . I only found out after having it sit a long while without a kill . Thought it was stale batteries so I put in fresh batteries and discovered that the blinking light that turns on briefly does n't work anymore .
5 #### Like how compact it is . Easily tucked away and does n't draw attention to itself .
1 #### This does not fit a standard four inch pipe you buy at your hardware store or in fact any store . Only flexable tubing . That can be really pricey getting a decent quality to hold up for an entire shop . I 'd recommend getting regular elbows locally if you do n't want to use boatload of duck tape
5 #### got this for soaking cotton balls to make my own tick tubes . It works , and i see the mice are stealing the balls for their dens . But it is pretty viscous , kind of like molasses , just FYI
1 #### Both the peeling blade and coring blade are flumsy and bend . The peeler does not peel evenly or consistantly . No matter how you push the apple onto the spikes , the corer does not align well and does not remove the entire core . The crank handle constantly falls off due to the bad design of not having a metal mut to help it stay on . The peeler will not stay still when clamped on the counter.when it is tightened . You have to try holding it still while turning crank . This is a high maintence gizmo and you need tons of patience . I suggest you try a different one and read all the negative reviews ! I also have a suction style peeler , it too is a hassel . I wish I had a non problematic peeler . :-(
4 #### It is a great replacement part for 2001 Craftsman tractor mower with B&S Inteck V - twin 25hp motor .
5 #### The quality and workmanship is very good . The chestnut wood was more beautifully than I had expected it could be . It is a nice size and good feel in my hand .
5 #### My kids are all about the emojis and these were an affordable way to please them . Better made than some I 've seen .
5 #### Very well made bag and zipper . I like to keep my jumper cable in the back of the vehicle but do n't want the cables strung out all the trunk . I would recommend to others .
5 #### This product is simple to use , just the right size , looks nice , good price ... couldn't ask for much more . The extra filter between the main container and the spout is a nice touch ( which I have not had on other press pots ) and it does a nice job of catching any grounds that make it past the plunger filter .
1 #### I bought this flashlight because I have always had amazing luck with Maglite products . They tend to be indestructible so naturally when I wanted a little flashlight for my 3 and 4 year old daughters I went with this . Unfortunately this has the brand name but it is no Maglite . My kids managed to destroy these in two nights . Now I 'm not going to say they are n't hard on them . They leave them on until the batteries die , they stick them in their mouths , they drop them and swing them around , but I have run over a full size Maglite with my truck , dropped them in pools , had them fall in campfires and they always hold up . Not this little guy . If two little girls can kill this thing so quickly I would hate to rely on it out in the woods .
5 #### its ALL YOU COULD ASK FOR IN A FORK , AT ANY PRICE . shopped AROUND FOR A CARVING FORK , everything was $ 30.00+++ . This one was one half of that , made with 18/10 stainless , comfy grip , long tines . Just terrific . Could not ask for anything better .
1 #### Junk . Do not buy these . Bottom wears out in one season . needs to be re - inforced .
1 #### I had mine for a couple of years maybe , maybe less and being cautious not to use sharp objects and hand washing , for no apparent reason the teflon started to flake off ... not a quality product to last and who wants to injest teflon . It 's now a drip pan for my Weber propane grill ...
5 #### I had one of these for 30 years and it finally stopped working . Cheaper to replace than mess with warranty so I have a new one for the next 30 years carrying on my keychain .
5 #### How to use : 1 . put up to corner . 2 . cuss . 3 . adjust angle to 90 degrees 4 . cuss again . 5 . get it right this time . 6 . celebrate victory . 7 . repeat
3 #### Still kinks on the pump inlet side . Had to return
4 #### The machine functions very well and is easy to use , but I 'm contemplating getting ear plus for when I use it .
5 #### It 's one of those tools that when you need one , nothing else will do ... and it does the job really well .
4 #### This saves quite a bit of work . It cuts and cores and apple in seconds . Make sure you get it straight and it works perfectly . SOmewhat hard to clean is my only complain . Its sharp but not too sharp . Good quality , rubbery grip . Dishwasher safe . Its a very handy tool .
4 #### A great cutter and very accurate too . The chart , shims and spacers , all of it is nicely done , even the carry case is nice . The ONLY reason I did not select 5 Stars is I read the chart , then I assemble the dado and load it onto my table saw and tighten . Then I measure the width to make sure its correct . Almost every time it is NOT ! Why I ask myself ? It is because the dang chart is so small , and its ' crowded . When I 've followed the chart I 've actually followed the wrong settings . C'm on Freud ! I happen to be an engineer , your chart sucks ! I scanned your supplied chart and exploded it to 300 % and then took a highlighter to make every other column stand out . THAT works . When will manufacturers learn to design for the user interface ?
5 #### Received this free with my PM2000 saw . Kept it to sell but bought the Jet jointer ( 6inch ) and used this base for it . Works like a champ . Best non - dedicated stand I have ever used . Easy to set up and adjust to fit the jointer . Buck
4 #### Just what I was wanting and at a good price . Fits my Echo saw properly and I did not have to go to town to get it .
5 #### great for my mom in florida - tiled floors - it is light --- good suction
5 #### This has worked great for us . I love the hook on one end that allows me to rest the strainer on a bowl and free up my hands . I am very happy with the purchase .
5 #### Good quality chain . Cuts well and was a perfect fit to replace my original chain .
4 #### My original bowls are 30 + years and still going . These seem a little thinner but still heavy duty . I will complete my set of 5 bowls ranging in size from 3qt to 12qt from those offered on Amazon . The free shipping is great because they are bulky especially since I live outside the 48 contiguous states .
4 #### Glad these belts are so readily available . They are not the easiest to replace but now that I 'm on my third replacement I have the technique well rehearsed .
3 #### This is the second one of these that I 've purchased . They are great measuring devices , but they do n't wear well . I only hand wash these beakers in tepid water ( never , ever in the dishwasher ! ) , and this latest beaker still developed cracks within the first two weeks of usage . These cracks do n't leak , but they are concerning .
1 #### I just purchased this one , and after 1st use , cut my finger . " Why ? " might you ask , because the area is too small that you peel with . It is inset between the parts that hold the blade . This MIGHT be good for carrots , but if you have a large potato or one with a flat side , it is very ineffective .
4 #### I 've been working on a yard rehab project , now concluding . I have run this sprinkler 30 - 60 minutes a day , for 7 weeks . It has performed reliably , and given good coverage . Also , I have moved it just about every day ... non - abusively . I have noted the negative reviews , and have wondered if people may have messed the sprinklers up by moving them carelessly -- possibly by grasping the center hoop , rather than the base . IF the drive gears are fragile ( as suggested by others ) , then moving the sprinkler like that might cause damage . Coverage adjustments are made by sliding the two yellow tabs near the hose connection . I like the adjusters , but , have not yet decided if they are better than the old , labeled dial adjustment on other sprinklers of this style . The yellow sliders allow a little more customization , but , what you 'll actually get from the " intuitive " visual setting is less obvious than one might expect .
5 #### Great pool cover . Attaches easily and stays in place when the wind blows .
5 #### this is great , easy to fill , does sway in the wind the hummingbirds took right to it and offers a place to sit and feed , I love it
3 #### As seed sowers go , this is OK for the investment . Seed size is still a problem and the bending over to plant each little seed if tough . OK if you 're not sowing the entire south 40 .
1 #### YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR . Half the usual price . Very cheap . The amount of threading is less than a good set . We 'll see how it holds up .
1 #### This company has really gone down hill . We got a presto for our wedding in 1977 and has lasted 39 years . It finally gave up the ghost . Bought this and I can not believe how bad this is . It is light weight , the handle gets so hot you can not touch , interior stained after 1st use . The safety feature in the handle will drive you nuts .
5 #### Is a tight fit getting the hose on this fitting but is expected if you do n't want it to leak . Works great and I have not had any issues so far . I use it on a regular garden hose that I ran over with the lawn mower . Cut the ends flush and used this to slice them back together .
4 #### I 've had a steady lineage of Stir Crazy poppers . When one wears out or breaks , I buy another . These are the best . The only real problem with them is the useless butter chamber and lid on the top . It 's completely worthless and just makes the bowl harder to clean . Hey West Bend , save us all some time and money -- redesign the bowl without that top chamber . Also , I had to laugh at the reviews that complained about the stirring wire rubbing against the non - stick surface . As another reviewer pointed out , it 's a metal wire . Bend it to where you want it ! Someone else complained that oil gets inside the mechanism . Maybe it does , but I get at least a year out each Stir Crazy , and I use them a lot . They 're easy to clean and easy to use . I 've tried others including the microwave bowls with the gimmicky " powercups " , but Stir Crazy is still the best .
3 #### The light is okay but not great . It needs to be brighter . I do n't use anymore since I bought a brighter magnifying light .
5 #### Great size , feels good in hand , like all Oxo products .
5 #### great great axe ! i d buy another , but i do n't see how ill ever need to . strong and sturdy , i feel it will last me forever .
3 #### I have tried everything possible to use the 220 grit paper and have it last more than 5 passes - angling the wood into the feeder , slower speeds , less pressure on the work - piece and combinations of all . All of the other grits work well and last quite a while .
1 #### Very disappointed in this speed square . Craftsmanship is poor at best . The top edge of the square is not even flat it looks like this when u site down it /. :( . I would not ever buy another one . Waste of money .
3 #### is n't ribbed for true strength and quality-- I have n't used it yet !
5 #### Great product ! Easy to use , have only used it a few times but seems very sturdy , is very easy to turn .
5 #### Receptacle is of good quality and should work fine for supplying " shore power " to your RV . Since it will be used outdoors , I mounted mine in a weather proof box and cover from Lowe 's , their stock numbers 49867 and 50943 , respectively . I had to modify the cover to accept the round face of the Leviton 30A. receptacle , as it was designed for a regular 15A. wall receptacle .
5 #### Nice tool to check lots of things . Must be handled carefully .
5 #### I am relatively new to outdoor work , recently divorced and a 57 year old woman . I have always done the inside cleaning , NOT the outdoor work that always seemed so terrible . So , here I am , on my own , and I am definitely doing a lot of research before I buy an item . These hedgers are very sharp , so working with them is easy . Believe me I am not strong , so the length and sharpness of the blade is very important to me . I am in Alabama and the heat has been very bad lately , but my work goes quickly because of the ease of the use of these hedge cutters . I had been using a pair I borrowed from a friend , they looked all shiny and new , but I could hardly cut through small branches , so I knew those were not for me . I would definitely recommend these to everyone !
5 #### Channellock brand is excellent and makes the best assortment of pliers of any name . I 'm an multi - craft industrial maintenance Tech and own several different types of Channellock brand pliers . In my book they are the best kind of pliers anyone can buy .
5 #### NICE VACUUM WORKS A OK FOR ME . ONE UPSTAIRS AND ONE DOWN STAIRS .
3 #### This is good for a cheap light throw a way tape measure and more accurate than others .
5 #### It has a lot of power for such a small and light machine . It is easy to get out and do a quick clean up of barefloors . Because of it 's size and weight , it can easily be taken up and down stairs . Anything that makes housework easier is a happy addition to this home .
5 #### I purchased these bulbs mainly due to cost , Lowes hardware charges $ 6 + dollars per bulb and these were $ 12 for 10count . I have already install one and so far works great .
5 #### Have n't used the metal blades but the wood blades work great on underground roots and small tree branches .
4 #### The finish is good and not much play when opening and closing pliers jaws so It seems well made . Made in USA , but time will tell if it is a durable product .
5 #### I ve had this light for a while and it still works great . I do n't disturb my husband when reading in bed , and when traveling its great when there s not adequate bedside lighting for reading . It has a low and high setting , and both offer more than adequate light for reading .
5 #### Very sturdy , excellent quality . I used it for that recipe where you cover the post in the middle with foil and then put veggies in the bottom and the whole chicken standing up on the post . The chicken turned out so moist , I was afraid I had n't cooked it long enough ! I am going to make a sponge cake for it later and give that a try .
5 #### This ice cream scoop is easy to use and the ice cream does n't get stuck . What more could you want ?
5 #### I WOULD SAY THIS PRODUCT DOES WHAT ITS SUPPOSED TO DO , AND FAIRLY ACCURATELY . I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE .
4 #### Took me a little bit to figure out the spacing requirements and placement of the spacers , but after that it was smooth sailing . I wish they would diagram the placement a little better that way you know exactly where to position things .
2 #### We had to sand the edges a lot . It 's very rough around edges . Not my favorite of this type of product . Kind of wish I had just spent the money on the Williams Sonoma one
4 #### The chunky ribbed handle is very comfortable and easy to grip . It cuts quickly and easily through apples with a back and forth twisting motion as you push down over the core . If you 're a little off center and some of the core is left behind , realign the corer and make a second pass . I used this to make old fashioned apple dumplings for my husband that his grandmother used to make for him .
5 #### Set your drill on the # 1 for torque , and set your mode to the highest setting before drill mode , now try and hold it to stop the drill , do the same with the standard battery , No DOUBT the XR is more powerful and the 9.6 DeWalt drill are almost indestructible , drop a Hitachi from a ladder and it breaks in half , drop the DeWalt and pick it up and continue working , why - because the DeWalt has a heavy metal frame under the plastic . These drill will bury a screw or bolt into wood and take a beating like no other , also if you plan to use battery tools have several back up batteries , and just rotate to charger and tool . I have many battery power tools and love them ! ! -Tony
5 #### Very nice pruning shears ! I 've had 'em all over the years . These work and work well . In addition , the blade lock is within the unit , not on the outside held by a screw which will fall off . Very pleased .
5 #### beautiful light for the price I do not think you will go wrong.i put them on a new shed and they are really nice
3 #### I find this brush to be good for some things , but not for others . The bristles are too short to fit in the cracks and crevices of things like bell peppers , apple tops / bottoms and knobby or uneven root vegetables . At first , the bristles were much too stiff , but have softened up , with use . It is easy to clean and hold , especially for aching hands , but you still need another veggie brush for the things this one ca n't do . It works well for scrubbing cutting boards and the like . I would buy again , but it is n't the only one to own .
4 #### Small , plain and simple . It took ten years to see the previous break down .
5 #### I love this item . Our doggy does too . She yaps like crazy when she hears it run . Spin your salad items . Sprinkle some lemon juice on them . Use the canister to store the salad vegetables in the frig , and you 're ready to go for three to five days depending upon your appetite for salads .
5 #### These are great tabbies - rounded corners so you do n't cut yourself and beautiful colors to easily find each book of the bible . This is the 5th one I have bought in the last several months ( I bought bibles for friends who had just become Catholic ) . Wonderful product , arrived on time and in perfect condition !
5 #### ... And it still works flawlessly . The only problem : Who gets to clean the thing and put it back in the cabinet . ;-)
2 #### I have a Werner extension ladder that I tried these on to protect freshly painted siding . I used a rubber mallet to bop these on as tight as possible . The problem is , they just do not stay on . One is now lost in a very large and prickly bush .
4 #### Does the job I only use one outlet but will use other doing holidays should have a longer cord though .
5 #### Works as described . Definitely a good thing to have just in case .
4 #### I ordered model L8344 because it 's made in the US . It was mounted to a stucco exterior wall after drilling an additional vertically aligned hole in the mounting bracket . So far , after several weeks of daily use , it has performed well . Not yet ready to rate it 5 stars , but it seems a good buy .
5 #### Seems to hold all the bits you could need . Good buy .
5 #### Price was good . Shipping fast . Good quality wood . What else can I say but Thank You .
5 #### My old house had the original water saving toilets that constantly clog . This is very easy to use , makes much less of a splash than others , requires little pressure when using it , and is quickly effective . The storage holder easily opens and closes without making a mess and requiring you to touch it . It also conceals it well . This is worth the money if you have an annoying toilet that clogs frequently . If anyone is having a problem with using it , they may not be using it properly .
5 #### No more bag - less nightmare vacuums ! Great , light weigh canister vac . Seems to pick up hair ( people & animal ) as well as most debris ( including litter & small rocks ) . This is one of the best reasons to have a bagged vacuum as it keeps the mess contained ! Has long reach handle & long cord ( however it wraps on the bottom for storage ) .
5 #### This one lasted a long , long time . The little yellow plastic flowers at the base of the feeder started to fall apart to the point they were old and brittle . This has been an excellent feeder . It is true what they say , add more red to the juice and you will attract more hummingbirds . We moved several times in the past couple of years and we managed to find hummingbirds everywhere we went . We 've always enjoyed our feeder when the birds hover to get a drink . We have purchased a different kind of hummingbird feeder and have yet to hang it out , but I have a feeling that I will order this one again . It does n't look fancy , but the birds sure like it and is n't that 's what its all about after all ?
5 #### I do n't see any mosquitoes around my plants . I 'm trying out self watering system by putting my pots in trays of water so it will water from the bottom up . To keep away mosquitoes , I added some of this into each tray . I have n't seen any !
4 #### Bought them to warm my snow boots . They are easy to insert into boot , with nice long electrical wire , but really would have liked them to get a little hotter . I had no fear that my boots would burst into flames ! I also bought them to dry out my gardening boots next spring , and I think they will do a good job .
5 #### Liquid Fence enables me to maintain a massive perennial flower garden in my front yard . Without it , the deer living in the woods across the street would have devoured everything long ago .
5 #### The first one I received was broken on the edge and had to return . The replacement works great now I do n't have to worry about breaking the impeller in my dust collector . Keep the big chunks in the trash can and out of of the dust collector .
5 #### The bulbs arrived quickly and were as advertised . I was seeking to replace 10W lamps that were too bright . I installed these 5W lamps and they appear to be just as bright as the 10W lamps I had just replaced . I checked the bulbs and they are marked as 5W ... I was hoping for a bit less brightness .
4 #### Small loss of power . Most people will never notice . If you used your Dremel for more than 5 different projects then I am sure you could use this for something .
4 #### This tray worked very good but I could only do one peace at a time . My fault I did n't look at he size which is right there . I still like it and use it .
2 #### Worked out great initially but after 5 or so uses a bunch of loose leaf made its way into my tea and continued to do so . Cheap price for a cheap product
5 #### They give a real nice tone when you give them the preliminary * click - click * before use . They turn steaks on the grill well too , I guess .
5 #### How 're great . Coffee beans are ground very evenly .... no big chunks left . Other reviews were helpful and very true . Have n't tried it on spices ..... want to try it on whole nutmeg .
5 #### We eat a lot of salads and OXO salad spinner is a great option to wash and spin the water from the salad leaves .
4 #### After much online , and local shopping for an insect eliminater we bought the BK-80D ... The unit is large , and effective ... I plugged it into a heavy duty dusk to dawn outdoor timer , and the result has been good ... I 'm not sure if a mosquito vacuum , or trap would have been better , but this unit is pretty straight forward in design ... It just Attracts , and Kills insects by the thousands ... ~Bottom Line~ We can go outside wearing shorts again without getting eaten alive ...
5 #### Farberware classics stainless steel pots and pans are durable and last a lifetime . The aluminum encapsulated base provides even heating .
2 #### This Poulan chain just is n't up to scratch - it was creating sawdust not chips and needed excessive force to cut ( yes , it was mounted in the correct direction ) Maybe I just got a bad one , I do n't know , but I do know that I recently put an Oregon bar and chain on my 400E and now it is better than I ever remember it being , even when new . I ca n't therefore recommend this chain , despite it being inexpensive .
5 #### Very lightweight hose , ends could be a little better in quality but overall in 2 seasons havn't had any issues so far/
5 #### HIgh quality , great price . Just buy it . Likely only cheap versions available in the home stores . Made in the USA .
5 #### Originally ordered the wrong size . This will connect a 4 " bare hose to a rigid shop vac 2.5 " fitting ( or 2.5 " powertec fitting-- both are actually 2.25 " in diameter ) . I use a rubber fitting clamp to connect to a 4 " plastic hose port . This will not be the only fitting you need unless you use bare 4 " hoses .
5 #### Definitely a quality made leather tool belt ! I do n't personally use the belt except to hang my tools on something while working but the portability is nice . Oil it up and it will break in very nicely ! A must have for service electrician !
5 #### Used it on a T&G ceiling . Works very good . Will be using it on a deck this spring . Very handy tool to have . Very well built .
3 #### Why put down made in USA it is not made in the USA is n't that false advertising ? I am American and try as much as possable to buy american .
2 #### I was looking for a whisk to take over my 30 year old whisk . I took a chance on this one and I absolutely hate it . There are too many wires so it causes whatever I am whisking to go everywhere . No Bueno .
3 #### I only bought this set for the dusting brush . I would have been pissed if i was interested in the upholstery brush as it is much bigger than the standard size vacuum tube . Dusting brush works fine , gets all the dust I could never really get . Satisfied but ripped off in a way ...
5 #### I bought this hoping the quality was still good for this unit . Popped every kernel and I hope it lasts ! Use a paper grocery bag to dump the popped corn in and add butter salt and shake . Be advised all metal parts that directly contact the coating will wear the coating out in that spot . My 20 year old one did the same thing .
1 #### I 've had the knife for barely 2 months and the emblem just fell right off today . Very disappointed because I had one as a teenager .
5 #### Gilmour 362 Professional No Pre - Mix Sprayer is awesome . Honestly the extra $ 5 - 6 dollars it cost over the plastic competition to purchase this is well worth it . Can be used for fertilizer or washing the cars . Very easy to use and the teaspoon to tablespoon converter is so easy . I just unscrew the converter from the top and insert it into the straw suction in the bottle and I 'm done . I filled the bottle with Maxicrop Fish emulsion 5 - 1 - 1 concentrate . The water will mix automatically and dilute it so that 's why I used the concentrate directly into the container . Choose 1 - 2 teaspoon per gallon and wonderful results on my lawn , flowers , and veggies . Everything is so green and healthy looking . I think this sprayer will last a very long time . Very happy customer .
5 #### works great is as advertised nothing special just a nozzle
5 #### Well , I owned 2 pairs of Fiskar Soft Touch Spring action pruning scissors that I have had for i d guess 8 - 10 years . I have had them both sharpened on multiple occasions and finally it was time to replace them so I of course ordered the same scissors again . Much to my disappointment they have changed the scissors and they are junk compared to the initial model . These are no longer made in the USA , the metal is thinner , does not hold its edge even 1/3rd of the time the others did . Ill be using Hydrofarms equivalent moving forward , cheaper , comes with a belt holder and durable . However Fiskar did hit the mark perfectly with this scoop , it is about time someone came up with a scoop in this shape , if you are a weekend gardener or a avid gardener you will love it !
3 #### This hotpot keeps my water warm throughout the day . It does n't shut off automatically , and has no temperature adjustment . The design of the heating element makes it hard to clean .
4 #### Overall I like it , it does a great job cleaning the carpet and tile floors of my apartment . The cord is long and the long handle makes it easy to get cob webs or in narrow spaces . One only complaint is that it is a bit loud , but for the price and performance it is a small complaint .
5 #### I am very interested in using this during this years hunting season .
5 #### These knives are terrific . I put them into my Steel City 6 " planer . The knives are a bit too long but where they stick out does n't seem to be a problem .
5 #### Not much to say , it 's a drill chuck that works exactly as I hoped it would on the accessory shaft of my old Craftsman radial arm saw . I use it primarily for chucking up wire wheels , polishing / buffing wheels , etc .
4 #### After reading good reviews I purchased this can opener . It feels pretty solid , though I have not actually opened a can with it yet . My biggest annoyance is that it clearly says " hand wash only " ! This is is stark contrast to the product description here on amazon and the user reviews . That is the one of the biggest selling points ! My guess is that Oxo had enough complaints about rust from dishwashers that they changed the product label . Even stainless steel will rust in the right conditions .
5 #### Seems to be helping to limit bug problems in our yard
5 #### Bought a whole set to replace all in my house . Only complaint is one set came without the matching screws . Bought 40 . Good item , seem quality made .
5 #### Very easy to clean , holds up to frequent use , and just a nice tool to have !
3 #### We bought it to solve an algae problem when the normal algae - clear products did n't work . After two weeks of treatment , this did n't help either . There was still lots of sludge in the pond and fountain when we drained it .
4 #### This product delivers the excellent quality I expect from my vise grip tools . It 's a great non marring wrench to grab either the nut or the head of a bolt while you tighten the other . It is bulkier than an ordinary wrench so you will only be able to use it in those situations where there is plenty of room . That being said , it is no more bulky than a regular locking plier . The advantage here is that it has a special mouth that is non marring to a hex bolt . Of course an ordinary vise grip would grab almost as well , although it might leave some marks on the hardware . As tools go , this is more of a luxury item . I do n't use this very often , but when I do it 's a real joy to use . ( It 's a good gift idea for someone who already has a full tool box . )
5 #### Direct replacement , my brake had worn down in 2 spots , now the new brake and pad back in business !
5 #### My suet feeders are now as popular as my bird feeders . These suets are gone in a few days as opposed to my previous ones that leasted over a week . The birds Love these ! !
5 #### We were trimming an exterior door to fit an old ( out of square ) frame and wanted a smooth cut . With a clamped - on fence to guide the saw , this hollow ground blade performed perfectly .
5 #### this product does the job and keeps the weather out and does nt blow off even with 40 mph winds ! ! ! yaaaaa
5 #### These inexpensive ladder top caps can save your house from being marred by the ends of the ladder . These covers also reduce slippage against the house .
2 #### great size bit while it lasted . I like that there are two set screws to securely hold the stop in place , drill bit is tapered towards the tip , and did n't seem to clog up ... Then snap ! broke the bit above the stop while tighting the set screw . I 'm not hurcles but now I need to make a trip to lowes . Recommend buying parts like this in the store so you can return them hassle free after you open the package . Amazon is n't so nice .
5 #### Did the job --- be sure to read instructions and warnings about food exposure
3 #### This may have worked ... but the REEL mower could n't even cut down a dandelion so just giving it three stars in CASE it worked .. just do n't buy a REEL MOWER if you have more than a 10 foot lawn that you can trim with some scissors on the pieces the mower does n't cut .
1 #### For parmesan cheese , lemon rind and fine delicate grating , I swear by my Microplane zester and grater . I have another shredder from Williams Sonoma that is extremely sturdy but must either be held at an angle over paper / plate or across a bowl flat , and that 's sometimes awkward . I thought the Oxo Good Grips Multi Grater would be different than my box grater because it would be more structurally sound , have a better handle , collapse and take up less space , and mainly because I 'm very pleased with the brand . Wrong . This has fallen apart after falling into the plate many times . The plastic has cracked on both sides , so the fact that it 's collapsible makes me wonder if they were referring to the material and not the design . The blades have remained sharp but it 's going to be recycled today because it simply does n't hold up to the task .
4 #### This is a bit hard to get perfectly tuned but once there it takes shavings perfectly . Love this little thing now that I have it set up !
5 #### This is built to last . I love this pan . It was so easy to clean it up too . Wow great product
5 #### This has two LEDs , but the coverage is so good that I usually switch on just one . You do n't have to reposition it for every page . Possibly too bright for totally dark rooms , but not enough light for an unlit room during the day , if there are windows . If there is any little light in the room at night , it 's fine . Probably about the same amount of light as those key ring LED lights , but more evenly lit , and covers a larger area . The clip portion does not move around when you do n't want it to , and is not too bulky . It does not seem to eat batteries , so an AC adapter is not needed .
4 #### These fit great in my black and decker toaster oven . I do n't wash them much , bc I always use foil or parchment when cooking , so mine have stayed fine .
5 #### I like it , it works well , to bad it is n't diswasher safe . I looked and looked for one that was , but could n't find one like it that was dishwasher safe .
4 #### uh , it may be imperial quarts , not us quarts that explains the difference in size
5 #### I have owned the other Aluminum Taper Jig with the Screw On stop , and I recently purchased the Rockler Fiberboard Jig which went in the trash can . Bear in mind I use these for production work , and I make my living as a professional cabinet builder , and although some people are not happy with this one , I LOVE it . If you need to do tapered box fronts as I do , this unit is perfect . The removable and adjustable stop is the best part of this unit . All taper jigs are a pain to adjust , but with a little patience and time , it can be done just right , and this tool does the job . I was considering modifying my first aluminum one to make the stop easily adjustable , and easier to swap to the other side . This one does all of that . For the money , I find this one the best one so far , and if it gets lost , I 'm buying another one . Whoever came up with the adjustable and easyily removable stop , my hats off to you ! VERY NICE JIG ! ! Take your time when setting up your tools , the payoff is a finer end product .
4 #### I have to repurchase this because a tear at 5 " ( like another reviewer said ) developed after 6 years of use . The tape would n't extend and eventually tore off . Why 5 " ; is that where the lock contacts when the tape is retracted ? Why am I buying this again ? Because it 's a good all - around tape for its size and weight .
5 #### I looooove this thing . I ca n't believe that a little rubbery tube is so useful . I chop garlic all the time and I 'm so glad my hands do n't stink anymore from all that peeling , and it 's so much quicker !
4 #### It got here on time but it 's still in the box . I can hardly wait to use it .
5 #### I was killing myself trying to clean this grill with regular sponges . These are the perfect solution . I am able to clean the grill in one tenth of the time it used to take . I 've used it 3 times so far and the sponge shows little or no signs of wear . So I got 3 packs of 3 - pack , maybe a little overkill .
5 #### Great bug buster ! ! ! Do heed the warnings about keeping it away from close proximity . Not just for the back splash , but also for your eyes . The rays hurt my eyes , so I moved it behind the patio column .
3 #### this is my 3rd Eureka Quick Pick Up cordless sweeper . They are great for picking up cat and dog hair and light floor cleaning . I use it daily as I have 2 inside cats .. I would not recommend it for heavy duty carpet cleaning as it is not powerful enough to do a thorough job . It 's easy to clean the filter cup but is a little dirty to do so . Just empty the filter cup , rinse it out and the container and allow it to dry before placing on the sweeper . I am pleased it has an extra battery . The previous two did not . If you want a light weight easy to use cordless sweeper , you wo n't be disappointed 7/26/2015 . An update for the Eureka Quick Pick up . I am disappointed in the longevity of the batteries . The 2nd battery died after 6 months of installation . I have kept it charged per the instructions . Due to this I changed the star rating to 3 .
5 #### I love oxo products . Only kitchen spatula I will purchase . Always works and easy to clean . Have had many spatula jsut brake or crack on me . Have only broken one handle on this oxo model .
5 #### I change these filters every three months . The inside the home air has markedly improved . Have been using these same filters for about 2 and a half years now and will continue . Excellent product , and packaging .
5 #### Bought this for a lady I know who had a mouse problem . She caught five mice the first night and I have n't heard any more about a mouse problem . She said it was simple to dispose of the rodents too .
5 #### Have been using this model of knife for 25 years , I am on my second one only because I broke the first one in a not thoughtful way ( tried to smash garlic with pressure from only the handle and it snapped ( I know palm to forehead ) ) . Do yourself a favor and get a Henkel knife sharpener with the big handle . The sharpener and knife work great together .
1 #### I specifically bought this item because of its description . " Tupperware Orange Citrus Peeler Set of 6 . Six different colors " I wanted six different colors for project . I received 6 red ones . Now the price has doubled on here so if I send them back and repurchase hoping to get as description saysit will no longer fit in the schools project budget .
3 #### Overall this is a nice pot holder for decks , windows and even cubicles . However the description is rather misleading . The 8 inch holder does n't hold and standard 8 inch pot it IS 8 inches wide at the top . The largest pot I 've been able to comfortably fit in the unit is 6.7 inches . Most decorative 7 inch pots do n't even fit in . Be aware of this is you 're buying this to fit plants you already have potted . Pros : Sturdy construction Adjustable brackets that fit almost anywhere With a quick bending up of the rear brace it can be used in most office cubicles ! Cons : Fits pots smaller that listed in the description .
2 #### I guess I 'm used to LED technology at this point ... this light seems well built ( which is why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1 ) , but the bulb is super dim compared to my cheaper LED flashlights , and when you widen the beam the light is very uneven . It just eats up batteries . I wo n't be buying any more flashlights that use incandescent bulbs .
5 #### Freud makes the best bits on the market . Even the weekend DIY would be smart to purchase these bits . They run smooth , are well balanced and last a very long time .
5 #### these cookie cutter are amazing .. i use them for cookies all the time and they work great ... i love the fact that they are a strong plastic so i know that they are durable ...
5 #### Could not find this anywhere else , a real time saver and finger saver
3 #### This is a good quality tool for making gravy , sauces , and light roux . For a dark roux that takes a long time stirring at high heat to get just right , like for a large batch of Cajun gumbo , I would prefer a longer , heavier - duty whisk with a handle that does not conduct heat .
5 #### Installed on my ancient Craftsman radial arm saw , this blade ripped the full length of an 8 foot 2 x 6 like it was butter ! Wow ! This really gives new life to my old saw that is rather underpowered by today 's standards . The cut was very , very smooth with sharp edges on the top and bottom of the board , requiring no sanding or planing to the finished cut . I also purchased the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Freud - LU88R010 - 10 - Inch-60 - Tooth - ATB - Thin - Kerf - Crosscutting - Saw - Blade - with-5 - 8 - Inch - Arbor - and - PermaShield - Coating / dp / B0000225UI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Freud LU88R010 10 - Inch 60 Tooth ATB Thin Kerf Crosscutting Saw Blade with 5/8 - Inch Arbor and PermaShield Coating</a>&nbsp;with the rip blade , so I 'm really looking forward to using it when I 'm making finish cross cuts . For sure , I 'll be buying nothing but Freud thin kerf blades when they 're needed for this saw . I 'll use my other 10 " blades on my table saw until they wear out , then I 'll be looking at more Freuds for it too .
5 #### I bought mine used from another woodworker but decided to send in my own thumbs up - I 've used several varieties in woodshops through the years and this one rocks . Solidly constructed and well thought out - it 's very precise and safe - all the things you would want in a table . I highly recommend .
5 #### These spikes make fertilizing indoor plants very easy without having to lift bags of pellets or granules .. They are long lasting with slow release so longer periods between feeding of plants .
5 #### Got this for my husband as a birthday gift , and he 's used it every night since . It seems very well made , and the batteries seem to be lasting for a pretty long time . It 's not very heavy , but still feels fairly solid . The clamp is padded on both sides , so it wo n't mar your book pages . The light has 2 LEDs for brightness control - press the button once to turn it on with both LEDs , press it again to dim the light by having only one LED on , and then press it a third time to turn it off completely . I may have to invest in one of these for myself , after seeing how nice it is .
3 #### I asked for as a Christmas present , it makes great hamburgers , steaks , things of that nature . While the fat drips out , you can save the drippings to make a great gravy right before serving if you know how to make homemade gravy . Steaks and burgers were juicy and pretty good overall . However , this ai n't so great when it comes to boneless chicken breast , I did n't like it at all . The chicken was dry , flavorless regardless of the seasoning I used and rubbery . Pork chops were a little dry and crackly . It is great for people on diets , great for apartment living , great if you like a grill look without the barb - que mess . Did n't necessarily care for the clean up along the way especially if you needed to do a little more than wipe it clean . However , since I home cook for my dog , I can say , he absolutely loves all * * of the food from the G.F. Grill .
5 #### Appears to be a high quality hammock . Very comfortable , actually fell asleep in it yesterday , something I never do ! Super fast shipping , arrived ahead of schedule . Now , if it can withstand 2grandkids ....
4 #### True , they are only 3.6 volts each , and the life is not terribly long . However , the VersaPak line is extremely versatile and affordable . The common misconception is that the batteries should last longer ... but you have to consider the use -- these small , light - weight batteries were never meant to build a house , sand a basketball court , or cut through concrete , they were made to be small , versatile , affordable and light - weight . VersaPak IS NOT a Contractor - grade powertool . I highly suggest investing in several sets of batteries if you use your tools often for long periods of time ( more than 10 mins straight ) . But consider the alternative , a larger , heavier tool that costs 3 times as much ( or more ) , and that goes for the battery packs too . The fact is , if you are n't getting enough power from a VersaPak tool , it was not designed for you , you should consider one of B&D 's other higher voltage , contractor - grade powertools .
3 #### This saw will cut . We have 5 of them . We cut 3/8 " aluminum plate with no problem and have yet to burn one out or break a gear box in 2 years . The draw backs are we have to keep a stock of the arms for the blade guard . They are plastic a keep breaking . If the saw is dropped the cast aluminum arms that hold the base on can break . To fix it the whole gear box housing has to be replaced .
5 #### Love this vacuum . Had to get used to a canister vac again . Works great on hard surfaces .
5 #### This is a great product to take camping ( that 's why we bought it ) . Folds up nicely , HUGE and you will need a 50 gal bag or giant leaf bag . We had regular large bags , but they would n't fit . No problem though , the container was great . No complaints at all !
5 #### So easy to use . Fits nicely in your palm . I much prefer these of brushes that have a long handle . This gives you much more control to brush fruits and vegetables . Such a simple design , yet so effective .
5 #### Title says it all . At this price point , it should be in your tool box if you own a home . Some of the things I use it for on a weekly basis : Pull nails Lift heavy sheets of plywood / sheetrock into place for nailing Pry up old boards
5 #### I can not downgrade this product for what bothers me -- my brooms bang a bit when I open and close the door . It does exactly what it is supposed to do without a lot of bells and whistles .
3 #### First of all , the one big negative : The plunge lock / release is difficult to operate while holding the router still enough not to damage the wood . On one other fameous router you plunge down , then move the lever to lock the router down . On this unit , you move the lever up , while plunging down , then release the lever and it locks down . Then you need to push the lever up again , to release the lock . So on this unit , the lever is naturally in the locked position , while on others , it is naturally in the unlocked position . Trying to unlock it while holding it still is hard ( at least for me :) .
5 #### Nice little compact ball of string that wo n't burn or come apart in the oven . Use string all the time in cooking to keep food from coming apart like stuffed meat or stuffed fowl .
5 #### Since I just dumped all over a recent Amazon order , I have a need to play fair . In the 21st Century , this is about the best can opener I have used . There used to be better ones in the mid 20th Century but that was in a galaxy far , far away . In the reviews some complained that it did not take the lid all of the way off . Some complained that it did take the lid all the way off . I do n't care . The handle turns well . The blade remains sharp . The tool is comfortable to hold . Whether or not the lid pops all the way off , for all practical purposes you only have to go around the can once , and you do not have to keep opening and closing the opener in order to find a gripping / cutting point . I have sent them to friends in third world countries where finding a working can opener is like finding a diamond ..
5 #### Lenox hole saws are very good quality . If you have them all in one case they are better yet ! I suppose if you already own several hole saws , this kit may be too expensive . If you experienced a burglary like I did , and need to replace what you have lost , then this is the answer . All the saws and arbors are in one blow molded case . The case is a little heavy , but at least you wo n't be searching for loose saws . They all stack within one another and it is easy to get to the size you need quickly . I think Amazon.coms direct price is better than this .
5 #### Several months back , I acquired a used Delta Left Tilt Contractor Saw ( Model 36 - 979 ) that needed some restoration and upgrading . One vital upgrade was to have a zero - clearance capability . Like so many before me , I wanted a Leecraft Model DL-1U -- but in RED for safety reasons . Having read many reviews here and other places , I realized the fine print that " colors may vary " may not get me the red color I needed . I decided to call one of the Leecraft outlets and was given the manufacturer 's name and phone number . Ron Lee describes his business " as a one - man operation " in Gainesville , Georgia . His telephone number is 770 - 983 - 1797 . I contacted Ron and was able to acquire several RED " seconds " that have worked out perfectly for me . Ron has found a niche in the woodworking arena and he makes a superb product . He is extremely conscientious about producing a top quality product for his various customers , including Amazon . Compared to other Leecraft outlets , Amazon 's price is highly competitive !
5 #### I use this for our electric water heater to reduce usage of same . You will save money by employing this device !
5 #### Bolted right into the existing holes on my Ariens Compact . Work great ! Nice and solid -- will cut firm / hardened snow . I sometimes wish they were a little longer .
5 #### I put this in a white walk - in shower for color purposes . Looks great !
1 #### This thing does n't work and the cost of replacement pads and cartridges is ridiculous - do n't buy this - its a waste of money .
5 #### My first one gave up the ghost after a couple of years service , so am buying a replacement . Being able to paint these black was a plus . They do the job for Oklahoma temperatures . Makes the birds very happy , too . Attracts bluebirds .
2 #### Handle is too short and the bristles look like they will flatten out quickly
5 #### Oh the humanity ! Kills flys by tar - baby'ing them . Not a nice way to go . Have a thing against flys ? THIS is your jam .
5 #### We live in a very dusty area and the dust in the air after vacuuming was always really bad . Not any more . These are great .
5 #### I use for the solar on my pool and hot tub works great . I had it for to summers now . I needed a lot of ons and off this did the trick . best timmer I own so far .
2 #### I liked this , but ca n't find replacement part for it .
5 #### I find them very much to what I had expected . I keep these locked away to make sure I do not lose them again .
5 #### It might seem expensive , but the quality is excellent , and I can tell it will last for years and years . The sieve is very fine and holds a lot -- great for my making yogurt cheese and baking needs . Really love this , and the handle is very comfortable , too ( as are most OXO tools ) . The little tip on the opposite side is terrific for supporting it in a bowl , something I consider essential but many sieves do n't have . This was worth every penny !
1 #### This sifter does n't work very well . Serious design flaws mean I 'll be buying something else to replace it . The first problem is that the thing is pretty small . I noticed that from the description , but did n't realize how small until I got it . Only holds a few cups of flour or whatever - and you ca n't come close to filling to capacity because it works by shaking it around , so stuff would come flying out if too full . Second problem is that the sifting mechanism does n't work . I tried shifting a brown and white sugar combination through it and nothing really went through cause the brown sugar is sticky . With my old rotary sifter , I was able to sift this exact combination ( for pumpkin pie ) very easily . So basically , this is only going to work for nice clean stuff that basically flows through the screen all by itself . I think Amazon is doing a disservice to future buying by featuring such positive reviews on the lead page . Turns out that is n't representative of the actual mix - and my own personal experience is that this product stinks . Summary : buy something else !
5 #### Great knife for bread and tomatoes . It will slice through warm loaf without destroying it .
5 #### No , it does n't look like an Autobot or a Decepticon which definitely decreases its cool factor but when you slide the blade out you can cut stuff , which is kinda ' what the whole idea it . When you retract the blade , it 's gone . Replacing the blade does require to you unscrew a single screw which is a damnable feature according to all the fancy knives that offer push - button releases , etc . But in my experience those fancy push - button blade release knives either break or let go of the blade when I really get down to using the thing . This knife , in all its simplicity , does exactly what it is supposed to do .
5 #### This is the second of these zester I 've purchased . Now I have one for home & one for the RV . I obviously love this zester !
5 #### Excellent filter I have used them for many years , ca n't beat the quality .
4 #### Thia item was installed on ou roof to decrease the ice build up during freezing storms . No storms yet ; we hope it solves the problem when the time comes this winter .
5 #### works well we used it couple of times to melt the ice off the roof . I would purchase again
4 #### It cuts real good the only thing it measure 32 " total . I through the handles were 32 " but not so . also the jaw has a big loop at the end so you have to open it real wide to get over your branch but other than it works well but I would not buy them again . I would find some thing else
4 #### Many commenters do n't like this little pan for people who only cook two small burgers or one larger steak etc it works great . It held up to about 9 washes before it did n't come perfectly clean but hey its a pan placed under great heat so what do you expect will happen to it ! Still works great for my needs ,
3 #### A flexible shaft is very handy , but it 's not very easy to handle it in difficult positions . It gets the job done , but you should not expect it to be perfect for all difficult jobs . I would only use it when it 's absolutely impossible to use any other tool .
4 #### My compost got hot , so I think it worked . But I allowed compost to get too wet , so it smells yucky now . User error .
5 #### Yet another great Fiskars product ! I was surprised at the size of branches these shears would cut , good leverage and sharp cutting blade .
5 #### My husband loves to cook with these . They give good flavor !
3 #### The timer works great , my star deduction is not for its operation . The spring wound type of timer is also the only one that does n't need a neutral . This thing is too large to fit in a metal " old work " box . In that type of box there are metal plates that swing out on either side and the adjusting screw protrudes into the box . There are also plates that hold the romex openings closed that protrude above and below . I spent an hour filing , grinding and bashing the protruding screws to get this to fit . I ca n't believe they could n't manufacture this 1/16 " smaller .
5 #### Seriously . As good . Maybe better . I 'd been using a Freud 40 tooth thin kerf and assumed the Forrest would be better , but HOW MUCH better quality of cut the Forrest gave me absolutely blew my wig back . I 'm a believer ; I 'll use nothing else from here on out .
4 #### This product works great , but could be about two inches bigger in length and width . So far , good results . If I was to purchase this product again I would like it to be just a little bit wider for my toaster over .
5 #### The OXO Good Grips is a good , well - balanced spreader that feels very comfortable in the had and is a pleasure to work with .
4 #### Makes excellent popcorn . We use one half the oil called for in the manual and it still makes excellent popcorn . The only negative I have found is that you have to watch closely and move quickly when the corn is popped , or it will burn very quickly . When it stops popping I quickly slap the plastic lid on and turn the entire popper upside down and then unplug the cord . Even moving quickly the oil will be smoking before I can unplug it .
5 #### This will last me just one summer season . It takes about two days to clear up the algae in our little pond fountain yard feature . I use the barely enzymes to finish off getting the clarity . I have to treat about 1 time a week . Make sure that you keep the water circulating for a couple hours after treatment to get the algae in contact with the molecules of what is in the treatment .
5 #### I love this so much I 'm going to order another one Everyone who comes to my house wants one . Actually two people already ordered there 's after seeing mine .. My seeds are amazing ! !
5 #### I bought mine at the local garden store and paid a tad more than the amazon price ( should have checked amazon first ) . It offers good pressure and is an upgrade over my current nozzle , however is it worth twice the price ? I think it is i get the a spray soft enough for the delicate plants and a spray that can knock off bird droppings with no problem . It does take a little pressure from you to turn the nozzle to the setting you want to use .
5 #### The Weller D550PK Soldering gun works great ! It heats up fast and does a great job . Its also nice that it comes in a nice plastic case with all the spare parts that you will need . Well built and made to last .
5 #### The arrived in a box of 4 . 2 were fine , but the other 2 looked like UPS threw them across country . Not UPS 's fault , just the way ammo always seems to arrive when shipped . Still works , just a million pieces to load .
5 #### Product is great , ten times better than the product you buy in the small cans and Home Depot or Lowes . Great control with this product . Do n't need to use the complete can in one shot ! !
5 #### These are a bunch of good quality blades that seem to last longer and stay sharper than the blades I 've been buying from Harbor Freight .
5 #### I have already used this hose and I have to say I love the color and the durablity ! ! ! ! Does n't leak at all like the cheap one I bought and took back to Wally World !
2 #### Unfortunately I had a family pet recently pass away . Looking to see if this product if accidently consumed , how much would it take to poison a 110 pound dog . Half cap full spilled on floor and was lapped up by the dog . Less than 48 hours animal deceased . Looking to understand how much of this product would need to be consumed before this unwanted result could happen ? Thank you , concerned animal owner ?
4 #### Works well . Pops quickly and I can use my choice of oil . Cleanup is fast & easy too . I like that the top of the unit becomes the bowl which you eat out of , reducing cleanup even more .
5 #### This is a nice corkscrew remover , I have RA , which makes using things like this difficult . I have had this product for some time and it has never failed me . Even when I am having a flare and my hands ache , I can still get into my much needed bottle of wine to end my day .
5 #### These pliers are well built , have a lot of leverage , and should last a lifetime . Highly recommend to anyone appreciating the best .
5 #### ripped out and replaced a smart home zigbee outlet . was unreliable at best . This ' old school ' type controlller has worked flawlessly in an outdoor outlet covered in snow . slowly I m disassembling my smart home and replacing with dumber controlers like this as they actually work . this thing woks great , using for controling patio string lights on my rear deck
5 #### I bought this as a gift for someone - and I 'm a bit envious as I have the original white one . This one is gorgeous ! I love this salad spinner because it works . The pull - string type reverse direction with each pull of the cord and you can never get up to a sufficient speed . This newer model also has a snap out lid liner for easy rinsing . There 's a brake on the lid which even Jacques Pepin did n't seem to know about on one of his cooking shows ! If you love salads , how can you live without one of these ?
1 #### I thought this would be a great timer to use outdoors with my Christmas lights . It did NOT work . No power came out of it . I plugged it in and set it for 9 hours . I then plugged in my Christmas lights drop cord . There were only 3 - 100 light strands that I wanted to light on a shrub outside my front door . When the lights did not come on at dusk , I checked the timer and my drop cord ; I found that no power was coming OUT of the timer . Trying to return it would be time consuming and a hassle so I tossed it and found another at Lowe 's . Wo n't buy this brand again .
4 #### Decent quality . The blade was a bit too soft as it burred even cutting pine and aspen . Does a great job of splitting though . Wish the handle had a recoil pad along the back grip as the span between my pointer finger and thumb got pretty sore with extended use .
5 #### Very comfortable ! Only trouble is the squirrels got to it and chewed several of the strings . Tied em back together and it still works . I recommend taking it in !
5 #### I have been buying Grizzly products lately . If I use a particular bit enough to wear it out or break it I can then justify buying a Freud or some other better brand . This is one bit that I broke out of my Grizzly set . I replaced it with this one . It has done an excellent job so far . The only complaint I have so far is that the shank is longer than the grizzly bit it is replacing and it is almost too long to fit in the case I have for it . Other than that there is not a lot you can say about a router bit .
5 #### Excellent tool . Just used it last week - a HUGE help when installing as a single contractor or w / a small crew . Also ordered the tongue and groove accessory - it took a long time to come , it does not not fit - the pin is too short - it cost way too much and so far it 's of absolutely no value . I have not had time to follow up with returning it or asking whether it was supposed to have a longer pin , but the tongue in groove install went fine without it . At this point it was a waste of money .
5 #### Works great with my drill after losing my old chuck key . Good solid feel and the thumb rest is contoured to really make sure you can tighten your bit down .
4 #### This is NOT a heavy cast iron pan . It is quite light but does the work quite well . It is a fun pan to use for eggs and of course , the pancakes . Does not need a lot of oiling or butter . I just had it for almost a month so I ca n't speak about durability . I hope it will last for a long time though .
5 #### Best tongs ever . Very big and the pull latch at the end makes it really easy to keep these closed .
1 #### I waited a week for these " special " blades to cut a sheet of 1/16 " plastic . I could have done better with a kitchen knife . They splintered and split the plastic to the point that it was worthless . I only rated it a 1 because the seller delivered it on time . Chips
5 #### All these people complaining about this thing breaking need to relax . It works fine , just do n't drop it or wash it in the dishwasher . It dries salad , not hazardous waste . Rinse it out in the sink and you 're good . Do n't handle it like its made of rubber , and it will work just fine .
5 #### this is a great tape measure . It 's big to carry around but the stand out is a worthwhile trade off if you need it . So if you holster it take the clip off .
4 #### Very thin , perfect for getting smaller nails or working in tight spaces , highly recommend .
5 #### Much better than my 16 year old OXO Good Grips spinner . To be fair though the old one was a workhorse and only recently broke
4 #### Works as it is supposed to . Easy to change when needed .
5 #### If you install cabinets , You ca nt be without this product . It saves time and makes the job look so much better
5 #### 5 stars , item arrived in excellent condition and fired right up with my 250watt digital ballast . Nice output
5 #### lasts long , cheaper on amazon than at sears , home depot or lower ! great buy !
5 #### These are good quality bushings and sized perfectly . I use Amazon for most of my purchases and update my reviews if anything changes with the products . I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product . You can look at my review which will be close to my purchase date and tell how the product is doing as time passes . I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own .
3 #### I did n't realize these did n't fit most hummingbird feeders . I have 3 different kinds and these wo n't fit any of them . My fault for not reading the description better .
4 #### The whisk is great but smaller than you would think . If you are looking for a standard size whisk go with the 11 . It is well made and is great for smaller tasks like whipping eggs for omelets .
5 #### No rusting when soaked in dish water , cuts cleanly , beautiful design . They are all that I was looking for .
5 #### I have two other sizes and I love cooking with the Kuhn Rikon
5 #### I ordered this saw when the armature burned out on my 20 year + old one . When I realized the parts to fix were going to approach the price of this one , I just ordered it . I received it in short time and it seems as good as the older model . Chop saw is a must for the farm and I would recommend Makita because their blades cut better than any I have used . Thanks to all involved .
1 #### This was purchased to be used with Kohler Devonshire 1184 - 0 - LA . The drain is too short . I assumed it would work based on another user 's response to my question on the tub product page . Today the plumber tried to install it and it was too short . He had to get an extention . I should have purchased Moen 90480 or ProFlo PFWO250 .
5 #### Once I got the algae under control , this keeps it from coming back . Did not clear my green pond , but has kept it clear once I cleared it .
4 #### could it be that the bowl is imperial quarts , not us liquid or dry quarts ?
5 #### Oxo has never disappointed me . Its nice heavy weight great to cook with and you can tell it will last forever
1 #### It 's a good zapper , cuts down on moths bit have n't really noticed it zaps mosquitos very much Update : 8/17 . The bulb both burned out . I replaced them both and now only one bulb works and it no longer zaps the bugs , too bad I spent the money in the bulbs .... I would not recommend this product .
5 #### Nice , bright reading light . Works great with my old Kindle or a book .
1 #### I purchased these after the recomendation of others to buy the Delta blades for my jointer . Upon recieving them I opened the package to inspect them prior to installing them . They where sharp and " visually looked " nice , but when I got my calipers out and started checking the individual blades I found that they where not parallel or straight . When I measured along the 5/8 side of the knive I found the edge to vary .02 " from the ends to the middle . To me this is unacceptable and not worth the $ 69 I paid for them . Luckily Amazon made the return process easy .
5 #### Awesome . A little big , but after the first use , fit great . Thanks
5 #### Works so easy that you do n't have to use any effort . Great investment .
5 #### Works well , but only works in the dark . I was hoping it would draw daytime flies but that could be my fault for assuming .
5 #### I really loved this in fact I ordered another one for my son . It works very well for trimming around my walks and other places . Not hard to use it is easy to cut with them and trim .
5 #### We purchased 2 of these to line the railing after our cat fell off the 3rd story balcony ! Wish we would 've spent money on these sooner instead of a ridiculous vet bill . Works great as a privacy fence too , so we no longer have to see everyone walking in and out of the building . There is thin spacing in - between each bamboo piece , so light is still let in . Our cats can also still look through it , but it keeps them contained . This height was perfect for us as it comes up about 3 " higher than the balcony railing , so the cats can not jump on or over it . This is better than lattice or netting because the cats can not climb it . We have it secured with zip ties for easy removal during the winter when it will snow . We have it facing inwards , so we do n't have to see the ugly metal railing as well . Can still put railing planters facing the outside . I highly recommend this for pet or kid safety and privacy . It took me about 45 minutes to tie up 26 ' of it by myself .
4 #### Just a good solid tape measure . Nothing fancy it just plain works .
4 #### Worked good all winter long and will plug it again this winter . Very pleased . Only thing was we have a larger bird bath and there was a little icing around the edges in super cold weather .
5 #### I store my recovery straps , various pulleys , and chains in this thing . It 's very strong , as I have about 80 pounds of gear in there , and can lift it without worrying about the bottom falling out . My 200 + pound son has used it as a step stool , and a seat ... no problems so far .
5 #### I have a dog that sheds a good bit . This vaccuum really does the trick . I love it ! It is powerful and the onboard tools are perfect , especially the one with the spinning brush . It 's great for pillows and dog beds . HIGHLY RECOMMEND !
5 #### I have several white roses and these work well with those . I also used them to prune some small peach branches ( not the best time of year , but it 's the neighbors ' coming over my fence , so I do n't care ) , and I had to apply some pressure but they cut through those . The picture instructions for making adjustments to the tightness etc . are a little cryptic , but if I ever need to do that , I 'll find someone who has more experience with tools . Now if I can keep from losing these with the yard waste , like the last pair and probably the pair before that .
5 #### This is a good DIY tool , but working with 80 # bags of cement is work . Additional thought 's are in a comment to Gary 's review at http://www.amazon.com/review/R2JPGDZUK3NIKV/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&asin=B00002N8SO&cdForum=Fx2IU3RP2O2IGNH&cdMsgID=Mx1SU2A2C94QRON&cdMsgNo=4&cdPage=1&cdSort=oldest&cdThread=Tx22T8QDENZTR81&store=hi#Mx1SU2A2C94QRON
5 #### I purchased my zero insert for my Delta unisaw and I found the setup of the insert quick , simple , and easy . There are screws to cover both side to side and up & down . The material the insert is made of is well chosen by the manufacture . I will definitly buy these in the future .
4 #### Love it , but I 'm a little disappointed in the clamping system . I 'd like more stops and a more positive locking . If your work pops out during a cut , your blade is toast ... guess how i know . BTW : I was cutting pipe which is problematic anyway . Other than that , it cuts steel like butter .
5 #### I was a little concerned that my long ( 20 + feet ) , heavy gauge cables would be difficult to fit , but the bag is perfect . With its heavy fabric and sturdy zipper , it is more than enough for casual use .
4 #### The light switch installed easily and is working fine . What to love , it 's just a light switch , either it works or it do n't .
5 #### I have this unit about 3 months now and is very accurate to outside conditions for the Hygrometer and very accurate for indoor temp . I got a very good buy .
5 #### I found through researching online that Canister vacuums are best for hard wood floors . Since 90 % of our floors are hard wood , I choose the MM because Eureka has always proven to never loose suction . I have had this particular vacuum for a year now and it still works great even after tons of use ! I find the bags in a 3 pack at ACE or online anywhere between $ 4-$8 and have to change the bag after about 5 - 7 full house sweeps . However , I have 3 dogs , one which sheds profusely . I have one thick rug and 3 slimmer ones , I use the same brush setting as the hard wood because the " combs " grab the loose hair from the rug and I then pluck it off and let the vac suck it up . I am not gentle with the vac and it takes sometimes the better part of an hour to complete my sweep . I am constantly ( accidentally ) banging it on the doorways and pulling it around by the hose but it still works ! Not too loud but not quiet either . This purchase was a great decision - and the price is amazing .
3 #### I have been in the trades for over 30 years and I have been buying FatMax tape measures for as long as they have been on the market . " Stanley " has once again changed the design and manufacturing specs on another one of their tools ... and not for the better . This has been happening in several other tool lines as they now own many . The tapes are only slightly better than a standard tape now . The steel for the tape is thinner than it used to be and the clear protective coating on the first several inches has also been changed ... it is just some clear tape that peels off unlike previous versions . WAY disappointing . It got 3 stars because it is still OK but I can see these tapes not lasting very long and there is no rebuild offered . I purchased a couple of these because I use them all the time . Stanley has definitely chosen to build with lower quality materials . We all know profit is important but it is really sad that companies think this is a good direction . Building with lower quality means profits can be increased because the materials used for production cost less and the product itself will not last as long . These tape measures are spendy as it is and when the quality declines so will my return business .
5 #### I bought this sander because of the excellent reviews and have not been disappointed . It is a very well made piece of equipment that makes sanding jobs a snap . I would like it if Porter - Cable made these in the USA instead of Mexico - I would even pay a bit more for it under those conditions .
5 #### I have had my 700 gallon ( 8 ft diameter ) stock tank goldfish and lily pond for at least 10 years . A spring algae bloom is normal but this year was the worst ever . Even the bubbles coming off my little waterfall were bright green . It 's still cool where I am so just beneficial bacterial was n't going to work for a while . Less than 24 hours after dosing my pond according to the directions , the green bubbles were gone and I could see down several inches . Today , after a week , it 's clear all the way to the bottom . I now know two things : I need to do some clean up and repotting ; I have way more fish than I thought . By the way , for those that do n't know , that much dying algae really sucks up available oxygen . I misplaced the air stone for my air pump over the winter so I got another today . Make sure your pond is well aerated if your killing a bad bloom .
5 #### Alton Brown knows his stuff . The perfect beaker is indeed the perfect way to measure out all you dry or wet ingredients . It is great to only need one device to measure out most any possible measurement you 'll need . Plus it makes you feel like a mad scientist ! ! Great stuff .
5 #### Light , flexible and adaptable . I use it for Easter Vigil !
4 #### Works good , but is a little sensitive when trying to read the roof slope . Also is light weight . I glued mine to a 2 foot 1x4 to get better readings of the roof slope , not just the slope of a single shingle ( which could be different ) .
3 #### The steel on these bits are not strong enough . After using it for a while , the bit dulls and it tend to walk instead of biting into the pilot hole . This is noticeable especially drilling into hard wood .
5 #### These tongs are fantastic ! I work in food service and seem to have a tong fetish . I have been in the business for 30 years and these are my tongs of choice . I use them for EVERYTHING from juicing a lemon to picking up 2 lb pans . I 've owned a few sets of these over the years and they can stand up to all my abuse . Sometimes even thrown across the floor , I 'm sad to say . But they always come back for more . I have had a couple of sets for over ten years , used constantly for 10 hours a day . The handles are comfortable and never slip . I will say the locking mechanism can sometimes get out of whack due to overuse but they are very easily repaired . I would n't walk into a kitchen without them !
5 #### Nice replacement sensor especially with temp and humidity readout . Recommended .
4 #### Yes , anyone who might need this device could build it ! I build one out scrap 2x4 a few years back for a specific project . This one is more compact , easier to use , much lighter , and in a well thought - out configuration . I , far - and - away , prefer to use jigs to make things then to build jigs .
5 #### I mix this with every watering and the plants love it . Its hard to overdo it with this stuff . good product and sinificant results
5 #### Assembled easily . Water fill took ten minutes ! It rolled easily and was extremely effective behind my John Deere lawn tractor . After a heavy rain I rolled my bumpy recently dug up lawn . The result was immediately observable . I 've rolled about three more times and now it is flat enough my son can run and play soccer without hitting ruts and deep depressions . Wish I had bought it sooner .
5 #### Believe the hype . I do n't heat with wood , so I do n't do a ton of splitting . But , i do burn a couple truck loads a year in my fire pit . It 's mostly pine , which is easy to split , but I also get some hemlock and other harder , pinky woods . This is by far the easiest ax I 've ever used for splitting . It pops the pieces with one or two whacks . I just split up half a pickup truck load in 15 minutes . Compared to previous experiences with other axes / mauls , I know this one saved me tons of time and energy . A modern solution to a old chore .
5 #### Very high quality , easy on the hands , good product . I am disabled and have difficulty with small appliances . This has a great grip , you are not hurting your hands by trying to begin a cut . Well made .
4 #### This does come with the bag and pinpointer so do n't order those separately . Pinpointer is not all that great but I bought a better one by Garrett . Besides the QD2 I also have the Bounty Hunter Loan Star - quite similar to the QD2 . Both assemble in minutes . Towards the back of the manual there is a list of basic settings for coins , relics , jewelry etc . They do seem to work much better than auto notch . If you buy a coil cover , get the one that is a disc as the spider will not fit . The Loan Star only shows coins as one group , not penny , dime , nickel , quarter like the QD2 does . Bag is a tight fit . Take off lower rod , flip coil against rod and place at the bottom . Top piece on its side with unit to outside . Leaves room for headphones , collapsible shovel , trowel etc . Zippered pouch will hold spare batteries and instruction manual but not much else . Very easy to use once you get the hang of the appropriate settings . Head to a beach or sandy area to learn than head to soil .
5 #### I like the unlock idea on this you can use one hand to open it and use or to close .
3 #### I used this to try and keep the critters out of my raised bed garden . Noticed I said tried . It will work and shoot water when " anything " is detected . Hoever , I actually think the squirrels and deer like the cooling down .
5 #### Super fast processing and shipping , if you are looking for flags look no more good quality product and a great company to do business with .
1 #### The square is made from rustable steel and is only protected by a clear film on the faces . Mine began rusting after a few months of living in a ( quite dry ) garage , starting from the edges and proceeding inwards . Buy an aluminum or stainless square instead .
5 #### Very happy with this purchase . I needed a big pot for big batch of soup and this was just right . Food did not stick and it cleaned up very well .
5 #### Love these pliers ! I use them to cut 1/2 " pex as well as wire . Channel lock quality as to be expected . I 'll have them for years as long as they always make it back into my tool bag when I 'm done with them
5 #### We have a pecan orchard and a host of critters after them at night . This has worked very well for racoons . I use Jack Mackerel from a can ( less than $ 1 per dog food sized can ) put into two empty tuna cans underneath the trap door trigger . Instant success !
5 #### I have these in most of the offered colors and I ca n't speak highly enough about them . They are a fantastic addition to the playroom . The storage capacity is surprising -- they hold a ton of toys and they are so soft yet durable . The handles are cute and easy to manage for little ones -- the colors are really vibrant . Love these bins !
5 #### A BIT ON THE PRICEY SIDE , BUT THEN EVERYTHING WITH THE WEBER NAME IS .... HOWEVER THE QUALITY IS THERE .... THIS IS A WONDERFUL UNIT ... WORTH THE EXPENSE .... THX ....
5 #### Fits perfectly in my black and decker toaster after my husband put our other tray in the dishwasher , effectively ruining it . This is a really nice quality and it looks better than the original !
4 #### Barley helps keep the pond clear and these are a good size and price . It is part of keeping our pond / stream clear .
5 #### I already had the batteries so i just needed the light , but wow what a nice flash light . for the money you ca nt go wrong .
4 #### Great little tote to pack audio cables & music accessories . I saw a company use these for production and liked it . Worked as expected .
3 #### I agree with other reviewers here . These end - cutters are particularly well suited to pulling / leveraging nails . They are not as well suited to end - nipping . There are slightly better manual end - cutters for nipping where the pivot is closer to the jaws and the handles flare more widely resulting in better mechanical advantage . There are also ones with double - pivots which generate even better mechanical advantage and work well , but they can be unwieldy . These however are perfect for nail pulling in that the jaws open wider , the head curvature is just right for the cam - action of leveraging a nail out and the narrower handles enable easy one - hand operation . As a carpenter I use these every day to quickly remove large stubborn nails with minimal damage to the lumber . Paired with a small Japanese prybar ( Dogyu or others ) they also work quite well for more delicate trim work . By far , the easiest , quickest and least damaging way to pull nails . UPDATE Aug. 2011 : Ordered a new pair after losing the old ones . Quality and design has definitely gone downhill . Instead of a solid joint , there is a rivet which will wear and loosen faster . Handles are slightly less flared making one hand operation , for me at least more clumsy . Steel / heat - treating seems to be of lower quality and machining is definitely lower quality . Except for the cutting ends , the body is painted black rather than polished . Downgrade from 5 to 3 stars .
5 #### You can always depend on a Zwilling J.A. Henkels knife . They are made of Soligein steel from Germany and of utmost quality . I never want to be without these knives .
5 #### Long ago I had a Swedish veg brush that could make veg pristine with a few strokes . This brush does just as well and has the added bonus of a very comfortable handle . Happy to have this cleaning power again .
1 #### Useless , has not captured a single bug or spider in more than 1 month .
4 #### Much better that those cheap stamped steel devices . Easy to use , effective , reasonably priced . Just get one . You wo n't regret it .
4 #### Bought this for one purpose only . Use it only with my " Dirt Devil ND40015 Pressure Flex 2,000 Plus 1.6 GPM Electric Pressure Washer " . Mines in fantastic shape yet .
4 #### Dremel bits come in a variety of sizes . These collets all use of several different diameter bits . Useful as I plan to use the tool on different types of projects .
5 #### I am a pro remodeling contractor . I used this ladder on jobs since maybe 1980 , and it never wore out , I only lost it when a tree branch fell and crushed it . I think it the best ladder in its class .
5 #### Way better than the smaller one that I had before . This kills a lot of bugs .
5 #### Super sharp so be careful . Exactly what I needed and looks great ! It 's a knife , a very sharp one ! What more could you ask for ?
5 #### Very lightweight transplanter . I use it around rocks , and it has not chipped or broke yet .
5 #### Loved my 9 inch OXO whisk so I sprung for the 11 inch . I love this one just as much as the smaller whisk . I bought this brand for the quality and so far it has n't disappointed .
5 #### We love our OXO good grip 9 and 12 " tongs so I imagine the 16 " will work great , too ! The 12 inch is a great grill tool so I imagine this one will be just as good ! Minus one star for being so big it does n't fit in the dishwasher .
3 #### I got this tape to replace a worn out Evans Rule tape measure . Evans Rule was bought out by the L. S. Starrett Company in 1986 . The old Evans was 3/4 " wide . It is almost impossible to find a 25 ' or 30 ' tape these days that is 3/4 " wide . I liked the narrower tape for its flexibility . 1 " wide tapes are a bit too stiff for my tastes . It 's just one of my eccentricities , but I miss the 3/4 " tapes . This Stanley is certainly heavy duty and should last a long time , so it 's worth a 3 - star OK rating in my book .
5 #### i 've been using this for years . it 's awesome . my plants love it during seedling to flowering . good for veg and flowering . never had a problem with it . this liquid is one the best out there , as far as supplements . i think it 's compatible with any nutrient regiment . i 've only used it in soil .
5 #### Long handle . Scrub pad not wimpy bristles . Replaceable scrub pads . Each pad last me about a year and I grill a lot .
5 #### OXO products all work well and are ergonomically designed . Great for arthritic hands .
5 #### Larger than expected ! Very nice , heavy duty , very easy to mount . Very pleased with this purchase and will buy another for the back spigot as well !
5 #### This thing is awesome ! It cuts through tree limbs like butter .
5 #### Excellent tape measure . It 's the only brand I buy these days , as they have served me well over the years !
4 #### The line on my trimmer is of good quality and lasts quite a while . The replacement reels are easy to install .
4 #### This item does what it is supposed to do . It about eliminates blade wobble .
5 #### We put barley straw bales in our ponds to control algae and it 's working wonderfully !
5 #### I like the spikes . It makes keeping my plants in good shape so much easier than mixing a fluid mix . Just pop it in and you 're good to go !
3 #### Very similar to the one my father had years ago when Stanley was a proud New England company . This one is a little rough and does not fit together smoothly . It does work , but hits bumps as you slide the blade in and out . The blades are very sharp , so cutting should be no problem .
5 #### Excellent router bit . Finish was perfect for glue up and blow out was minimal without support . I use this bit to make mitres on small boxes and it performs really well . The size of the cutter will cope with a variety of work pieces and allow the chamfer to be created in one pass . I had to make a router plate insert to allow for the cutter diameter , it is big .
5 #### I bought this fixtures last week . They work perfectly and the price is truly incredible . Because of the way I installed them , I had to pop the motion sensor out(very easily done ) and to install it remotely . Everything it working perfectly and the fact that the fixture is made or plastic is a plus for an outside installation , no rust and no paint . I am very satisfied with this purchase .
5 #### I bought this salad spinner 2 - 3 years ago and absolutely love it . It 's large enough to hold 2 heads of lettuce . It comes with a storage lid which keeps the salad crisp up to at least 1 week . I clean 2 heads of lettuce at the same time , put the lid on and I have salad for the whole week . The spinner works great as well as the breaking system . It locks down for storage . My daughter - in - law loved it so much when she stayed with us that she wanted her very own and did n't want any other brand or model . She has hers now and is very happy .
5 #### Yes , its a unitasker . But its EXCELLENT at that one task . After ruining a bunch of apples for my bake apple dishes , I bought this and never look back . Coring and wedging apples is now quick and easy . Love it .
5 #### Great for the price . These are a great tool to remove useless shrubs / small trees and dead wood . Remember that anvil loppers should not be used to prune healthy wood on plants since it does not create a clean cut like bypass loppers . Also , there are a lot of review complaining about the cutting capacity . While it states that the cut is 1.5 " , you should never attempt to cut anything that big with these loppers . You should definitely use a pruning saw for anything an inch or larger . These are really ideal in the half inch range .
4 #### The super stop - a - squirrel bird feeder is very sturdy and is definitely squirrel proof .
4 #### Great design except for weather - proof case . Needs easier to use and eadable dial .
5 #### Worked flawlessly and accurately for 67 fence posts- Rubber band large enough for 5"x5 " vinyl posts .
5 #### Had an air popper and popcorn was everywhere . Love this one ... it even has its own bowl , so you do n't have to search for one !
5 #### I love these spatulas ! They are the perfect size for most of the baking that I do ! I also love how easy to clean they are and the bright , bold colors !
5 #### The suction on this thing is awesome . Works WAY better on my floors than my old stick vacuums ( and I 've had a LOT of those ) . Really love this canister vac ! It 's nice when the tools you use actually WORK :)
5 #### My second purchase of this item . I use one outside in the yard and for camping and the other I keep indoors to use for projects around the house . These are nice and sturdy and great how they collapse for storage .
5 #### I just purchased this base and put my table saw on it . Assembly is easy and the range of possibilites makes it a great choice for any shop especially one that is short on space . As I add to my workshop I intend to purchase more of these bases to allow more flexibility in the shop . With the ease of assembly , it 's versility , and decent price you can not go wrong in purchasing this universal mobile base .
5 #### I love this pizza cutter ! The grip is great and blade is awesome ! This pizza cutter is very easy to clean .
5 #### Perfect for around the house and car . I attach it to my Dewalt 18V wet dry vacuum . Perfect for little jobs around the house .
5 #### I kept aquariums for years , and I really like the aerobic properties of this filter . I have a 6 ft diameter water trough ( 425gal ) for a pond , with a 470gpm pump . This filer works perfectly . I think the reviewers who experience the filter overflowing either have too big of a pump or , more likely , installed the small rather than large outlet on the bottom . Read the directions ! ! !
5 #### This worked . My bbq went into flames and I could not for the life of me blow it out . So I ran inside and used this and it resolved the issue . But then my chicken had a coat of white snow on them .
4 #### This brush will clean your veggies with ease . It 's ergonomic with a soft feel . Maybe a bit small for those of us with large hand , but it 's efficiency means we do n't need to hang on to it very long . It 's dishwasher safe so I put it in with each use . It 's held up for a year so far . Definitely need to purchase if you want a quality brush with firm bristles .
3 #### Even tho I am happy with the tool itself . I have been using it a lot lately , and that 's why I bought it . I was upset when I saw the Crescent brand counterpart for $ 8.00 at Home Depot . I own Crescent tools and they are a good tools . I do n't mind paying a couple dollars more for the availability on Amazon . But $ 5.00 more is excessive .... I think .
5 #### I killed a couple fish the first use since I was an idiot and did n't measure properly . It is like it completely deoxygenated the small pond , the fish hung out by the bubbles then started floated upside down . Oops . Now I use it as directed and by day 2 can see the bottom of the pond . Works great with pond lillies too .
5 #### This is a very nice HONING steel . This does NOT sharpen your knife , it hones it . And this does a great job of it . This has kept my Shun chefs knife in good shape for months now , and I love it . One of the best purchases I 've made . If you run your knife over this steel before and after using it , it will keep a nice edge on it for a very long time .
5 #### For splitting most medium - small logs , this is wonderful . It is like a slightly larger than normal hatchet , with great splitting ability .
5 #### I use these for trimming the stems of cut flowers so they 'll last longer . Works well , and they 're a convenient size to keep handy .
5 #### We just used this urn for an annual non profit fundraiser where we serve coffee to just under 300 people . The urn performed wonderfully . Its no flimsy product .. Its takes the full time to to brew the coffee . However we are a group of people learning patience and not looking for the quick fix . I would recommend its use for big groups .
4 #### Brand was actually branded Continental . I have no particular allegiance to Goodyear and maybe they are the same company now , but it 's good to know . Seems to be of good quality and is more flexible than PVC .
5 #### I have n't given this product heavy use but I have been satisfied whenever I use it for projects around the house . It feels solid and I have no complaints .
5 #### I had alwayws wanted to get a barbeque grill ever since we bought our home last year . I had been debating between 751001 and 741001 for quite some time , finally decided to go with this one for its ash catcher and it turned out to be a wise decision . Installation of the grill was fairly easy even for me . We had three families of visitors when we tried it the 1st time , we cooked a lot of meat , pepper , corn and etc , it was awesome . We have used it three times already within the 1st 10 days after we received it , it 's gon na get a lot more use this summer .
3 #### I do n't believe it is a perfect 90 degree angle . It seems to be a bit off . I have to double measure which is a bit of a waste of time and there are small discrepancies . As I 'm not professional woodworker I get by but would not recommend for someone that definitely needs 100 % accuracy .
5 #### This is clearly a very well built router . The height adjustment is brilliant ! I have a rather noisy PC 690 router and was delighted to find that the PC 310P is much quieter . The starting " kick " referred to in another review is definately there but not nearly as much as I expected . For anyone considering a small router or laminate trimmer this is an excellent way to go !
5 #### These are the best wire stripping pliers I have had to date
5 #### Had rabbits doing plenty of damage to our cars wiring systems . After using this spray once a week for a month we have not seen a rabbit in our yard for three weeks . before that it was daily or all day .
5 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Weber-841001 - 22 - 1 - 2 - Inch - Performer - Charcoal - Grill - with - Touch - N - Go - Propane - Ignition - Black / dp / B000659KDM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Weber 841001 22 1/2 - Inch Performer Charcoal Grill with Touch - N - Go Propane Ignition , Black</a > This is a well - made and very functional grill with all sorts of interesting available accessories that really work well . There is a reason for the popularity of the Weber - everything cooks great whether on the outskirts of the sides of the grate or on the center of the grate . I attribute this to the Weber design and the grill 's ability to distribute heat evenly .
5 #### The Mr Heater Big Buddy Heater is great ! Easy to light and operate and really kicks the heat when both sides are lit . For the money this is a no brainer . Thanks Amazon .
5 #### I like this nozzle because it has a setting for every type of water flow that serious gardeners need . I particularly like the mist setting , as it 's perfect for " greenhousing . " So far , this nozzle has held up well , and there have n't been any leaks or water flowing down the side . I recommend this inexpensive nozzle to anyone who has a green thumb , or for those who could derive benefit from other household uses . You ca n't go wrong with this nozzle .
5 #### I have a few of these now and find them small enough to have them when I need one . One in the truck , one with the fencing tools and one in the house . That way I 'm not chasing around for a normal size saw or having it get banging up in transit . It does a great job of cutting and as a plus , it nevers binds ( probably due to the shortness of the blade ( less flexing ) )
5 #### I was surprised when I opened the box from Amazon and found the factory new replacement battery for my Makita tools . I wished I had ordered more , as this is the original equipment battery at a much better price than I have ever found any place else .
5 #### 1st time I ever used these smoker chips and I am very happy with the results . usually soak in beer and these really absorbed it and smoked great !
4 #### We live on one acre and this item is really working great for us . We had a terrible problem with gopher mounds appearing nearly every day in our front yard very close to our front porch , but after using this product our problem is gone ! I bought one of these for my husband for Christmas and he installed it in March so we have been using this product for nearly three months now . We are very pleased with this product and have ordered three more for the other areas of our property . We must remember where we install these though , because once the battery goes dead , they will be hard to find in the yard if looking with a hazy memory !
5 #### The mice are it hours after it was placed . I live in wooded area and the varmints are always in my garage .
5 #### Perfect item , perfect price . exceptional value , I would recommend it to almsot anyone . A grat way to protect youhome and kids from fire and smoke
5 #### As Advertised . Use it for pellet ash in my BBQ , NO dust exhaust . Would buy again . Thanking you
3 #### I got this stand for a DW788 scroll saw . First , let me say I know the instructions call for bolting this to the floor . I think that 's a bit unreasonable for most people . On the other hand , I now know why DeWalt recommends that . Because it 's not very stable . A better design would be to have 4 legs instead of the " tri - pod " arrangement DeWalt came up with . The materials are good , it went together easily , it looks nice , it has a nice finish to it . But it 's just not quite up to snuff in terms of stability . It works ... it just does n't work very well . And it 's one of those things that , at least for me , constantly reminds me that it 's just a mediocre product and I 'm not really happy with it . Having said that , I did use some adjustable feet that were included in a very high - end , pretty blue router table package deal I recently purchased . They went on nicely and the rubber bottoms keep the stand from moving around on the shop floor . Being adjustable ( the screw up / down type ) they make it easy to level everything out on uneven surfaces . I 'd recommend stopping by your local home improvement store for something similar . All in all , if I were still looking , I 'd find something else besides this stand . I ca n't recommend it .
3 #### Kind of flimsy & the hose rubs up against the house but for the price , its a good deal .
5 #### Good grip indeed ... sharp and work great and quickly . Carrots now fear me !
5 #### I have other squirrel proof feeders which work for squirrels , but not for chipmunks . These little guys have figured out how to race down the weight bars , bypass the perch , which closes the ports , and then sit on the ports filling their pouches while chasing away the birds . All day long , they would rob the seed leaving the vast variety of birds that frequent my feeders totally frustrated . I needed to find a feeder that would stop the chipmunks , and this looked like it would . I am totally surprised with this feeder . The design not only foils the chippies but it goes beyond . The sides of the feeder are a shroud . There are no bars that control the weight . There is no perch that is separate from the ports , it is actually a platform that will close the ports . The base of the bin is more angled than my other feeders which allows for a better flow of seed and I do n't have to go out daily to push seed down . And it is well made , sturdy construction .
5 #### Great little vacuum - light weight but powerful , small but has a long hose & multi - part wand . On rollers with a very long power cord , plug it in and clean a very large room , including the ceiling fan and under all the furniture !
5 #### These are GREAT tongs ! ! Very easy to use , on the Bar - B - Q , on the stove top , in the oven , in a salad ! These remind me of the commercial grade tongs I used in the food industry . I liked them so much , I bought two pair ! !
5 #### We have had our Presto 6 quart pressure cooker for 35 years , and it is still going strong . We bought each daughter a pressure cooker this year , one got an insta - pot , and one got this pressure cooker . This is a product that will be around for years , long after the insta - pot has met the scrap pile . If you ever need new gaskets , handles , or anything , Presto will mail you any part needed .
5 #### Received this sweet little paring knife as a gift to join my other Henckels in their block . Great balance and fits nicely in my hand . Thank you !
5 #### Works great and very convenient to use with my drain king .
4 #### I rarely break out my corded drill after buying this great tool . The only very minor complaint is the chuck , which could grab a little better when using a hole saw , etc .
5 #### Love having 2 sizes and can also use both as regular pot / pan with the glass lid . Great for quicker cooking that tastes like all day simmering .
5 #### I really like the fact that the pump turns off when the water level gets low . I keep it running during freezing weather and it did n't have any problems ( of course in central Texas we do n't have much freezing weather ) .
5 #### Bought this chain saw blade combination for a Tanaka TCS-3401S. I merely sought to extend the range of possibilities for this remarkable little chain saw . Had used the 12 and 14 bar sizes before ( from Oregon as well . ) This particular 16 grouping fit the Tanaka perfectly and , as one has come to expect from the Oregon brand , the performance is exceptional . Sadly , during this harsh New England winter , I have had to use the chainsaw more often than expected ( or hoped for ) . Nevertheless , the saw performed brilliantly , cut smoothly and effortlessly , and remained sharp much longer than projected ( in view of the moist , snow- coated timber . ) First - rate saw blade combination .
5 #### 100 percent remarkable product . It perfectly fits the American electric standard six and quarter inches burner . I recommend you do not use abrasive products to clean it . Keep it nice and pretty . A product called BAR KEEPERS works great for me but also I think plain cheap vinegar may help but maybe not as good ..
2 #### I was very happy to find this combo since it was exactly what I needed . However , it is almost unusable since the thin plastic moves around so much while sawing . Saw does not seem to bite well either . Took surprising effort to saw through quarter round stock . A lot of thoughtful touches went into this which makes it all the more disappointing that the execution is so bad . Returning for something of better quality .
5 #### Can not beat the sound and the price . Fast shipping was greatly appreciated
5 #### Replaced all the outlets in the house , worked well . Keep in mind that you ca n't use the stabs with 12 g wire . The screw terminals work though . This is pretty standard now , the ones at hardware store and the electrical supply had same issue .
5 #### Amazing ! I first tried this with a recipe that repeatedly warned that the cake would be extremely moist and would not release from the pan ( it actually called for a traditional tube pan , which I do n't own ) unless excellently prepared - and it still cautioned of possible disastrous release scenarios ( as did the reviews ) ... I braced for such a disaster , but the cake literally slipped right out before I had even turned the pan completely over ! The cake ( and one since ) was cooked very evenly , too . Better than any other bundt pan I 've tried !
4 #### Easy and imparts a nice smoky aroma to my smoked meats .
2 #### This does not have removable grill plates and is a PAIN PAIN PAIN to clean ! ! There is just no easy way to clean this since you can not remove the grill plates from the unit , and of course you ca n't get the unit wet . Spend the money to get a grill with removable plates . In addition the unit does NOT have any adjustable thermostat control so every piece of meat cooks at a high temperature which produces a * crisp * ( not in a good way ) outer layer with a not well done enough middle . I could n't cut through the outer layer of the meat it was so tough !
4 #### I bought these so my mother would stop taking the kitchen shears outside to use in her gardening . She likes this pair of Fiskars very much and says they are comfortable to use .
4 #### this replaced an old veggie brush I had . This one is substantially bigger but offers a nice grip . The bristles would probably work better if they were a little bit shorter to provide a stronger scrub but it still good a did job brushing off the green outer layer of zucchini with minimal effort . If I had to nit pick anything I wish the handle came in green to represent veggies so I would n't have to warn family not to use it on dishes .
3 #### Love this tea ball but it Bends really easy , that hook slide thing , and seems to let a lot of tea get out into cup ) )
5 #### It does n't make any sense really , but these blades cut way faster , and with less deflection on the cut , when compared to the " clean cut " Bosch blades for wood . These are very aggressive , they practically cut so fast it scares me and I think maybe the wood will be torn to little shreds but when Iook at the wood it 's really clean after the cut , no saw marks at all . These blades are the only Bosch blades I 've tried so far that give a vertical cut with a zero degree pitch and very close to zero degree vertical cut even with curved cuts on 3/4 plywood . Somehow they also turn very easily too despite being a wider blade , they make turns very easily in the wood without any friction and without much deflection . I have n't tried these without the splinter guard on my Bosch saw so I do n't know how clean the cut would be without that , more testing is needed . So far this is the most accurate Bosch blade I 've tried and I tried 4 other ones .
5 #### Item is a direct replacement for my Flowtron bug zapper . Was a snap to install and I was back listening to that sweet sizzle in no time . The bulb arrived quickly and was packaged quite well ... The only thing I will say is if one bulb goes bad go ahead and purchase two and replace both as the second will not be too far behind .
5 #### We owned our last Mighty Mite for over 12 years , and it was still working , but many of the plastic parts ( hoses , wheels , casing , cord , attachments ) were at the end of their useful life after much daily use . The new unit works even better and was less expensive than our original purchase . I did n't want to spend a lot of money for a pet vac , and this definitely is the best $ $ value going . Highly recommend this unit at the online price of around $ 70 ! !
2 #### I liked this faucet , and it appeared to be a good value . It worked very well for 2 years . It is still not leaking and the faucet is easy to control , but now the entire faucet mount has loosened up . The reason is the nozzle no longer swivels smoothly . So when you swivel it it turns the entire assembly . It either needs a new bearing washer , or something else . I ordered some parts to fix it . Hopefully that will work . A replacement nozzle is over $ 60 ! If new washers and o rings do n't fix it I will take the advice of an old ex - plumber I worked with years ago , who only recommends Delta . This Moen replaced a Kohler Pull Out faucet , that only started to leak after 8 years .
5 #### This works great . Controls algae . Works the best when paired with beneficial bacteria . My pond cleared right up . Even the algae stuck on the rocks was cleared up . All without me doing any cleaning .
5 #### My wife selected this apron for a friend who was about to start breast cancer treatment . Her friend likes strawberries and this was the perfect apron . The pattern is bright and fun without being gaudy or over the top . The quality looks good . It is not a cheap fabric nor is it what you could call Professional Chef grade . I think it is perfect for a busy home kitchen . How well the pattern holds up will pretty much depend on how you wash it and if you dry it in the sun . Great gift ! Helps one envision a future with tasty berries .
5 #### Weber 's Smokey Weber 121020 Go - Anywhere Charcoal Grill is a real performer . We are so pleased we purchased one of these . We cook a lot on the grill at home or away . The Weber 121020 Go - Anywhere Charcoal Grill fires up quick . It also cooks up burgers , hotdogs and steaks evenly and in short order to perfection . I really mean it . We love it . The food is ready in no time . The Weber 121020 Go - Anywhere Charcoal Grill is really an efficient unit and is quite innocuous in appearance . It is quite mobile and seems to fit anywhere for use or storage . It is actually quite amazing . We get good tasting food and save time on cleanup . This is a very durable unit with a strong handle .
5 #### What can you say about a vac belt . It was the right size , good condition and works as it should . I thought the price was good as well .
4 #### I have window boxes on my deck and have been frustrated rewinding my old hoses . This is indeed more convenient , I ended up buying two to give the length I needed . It does kink on me a little but maybe that is more due to the long length I have to pull it . But otherwise , looks nice , colorful , no leaks .
5 #### I started off with the 3 - cup and quickly ordered the 6 - cup as well . After a bit of trial and error I have my process down . And when you get the process down and can start truly enjoying your coffee ritual , you will be amazed by the wonderful aroma that escapes just before the coffee begins to stream out . It fills the house . I have become a bit of a Bialetti junkie now . I 've won an auction for some Bialetti espresso cups and just won an auction for a 9 - cup with a set of espresso cups and saucers and a creamer and sugar bowl . And ( hangs head in shame ) I 'm here buying a 12 - cup . I have n't slept in months . Help me .
5 #### This bowl is great ! I bought two bowls in this series , and I use them for everything . It ( they ) are so much more useful than any other incarnation of a bowl that has passed my way , that I ca n't understand why someone did n't come up with the idea years ago . You will like this product .
5 #### Purchased these for an " edgy " aunt for xmas ... they were a hit ! She loves them and it is a good sized tin . I thought seriously about keeping them for myself . Now these are on my want list . Highly recommend .
5 #### Delivered as estimated and expected . Product was set up the day after it arrived . Set up was easy and the recipient loved it ; it was a Christmas gift .
5 #### Comes with two ends so you can use the correct end for your vac
4 #### I 've been looking for a box for my garden tools . I need something to withstand weather and sun damage .
5 #### Perfect replacement for pool timer ... except you need an outdoor enclosure !
5 #### Great value in a full kerf industrial blade . Will buy again . Delivered on time and packaged well for product protection .
5 #### Good value . Bulb still functioning much longer than the original one did .
5 #### Nice apple wood chips . Good variety of chip sizes . Great as part of my mixture of Apple , Hickory and Cherry wood for smoking pork . Very pleased with the results .
5 #### these are worth there weight in gold when you have diferent sives of shafts on your dremel tools or bits
5 #### I give these as gifts regularly . I have had mine for about eight years , and the knife is still as sharp as ever .
5 #### This is exactly as I expected . Good weight , nice overall size for functionality .
5 #### Excellent peeler , so much better than the metal one I have used for years . Another great OXO product . Highly recommend !
5 #### After using this vehicle tool to remove the fur from the car after my dog 's shedding season , I decided to try it at the source of the problem - the shedder . It turned out she was also looking for a good way to remove that extra fur and cooperated entirely , rotating to all the parts that were shedding . Ten minutes later both dog and owner were happy with the results . When asked to comment , the dog rated it more effective than rubbing on the auto upholstry , which has been her preferred method of hair removal until the Mr. Nozzle .
4 #### I have loved the OXO brand since my first purchase of an OXO product almost 10 years ago . I have since replaced pretty much every kitchen gadget I own with the OXO Brand . This was my first purchase of a Salad Spinner . I like salad ... but I 've grown tired of those bags of " surprises " you can get that are supposedly " triple " washed for my convenience . I would just as soon buy the items for a salad and make them myself ... this spinner makes it easier to do that . It is very easy to use and easy to wash ( watch the video in the product description ) . The only reason I gave this four stars is because the way the basket is designed ... it allows a lot of pieces of lettuce , etc to stick in it . But this is truly a well designed product that is relatively easy to clean and the ability to " lock " down the knob makes it much easier to stack and store .
5 #### Like most items that need assembly - these directions SUCK ! - however if you have some type of table saw or wood working equipment - you most likely can get an idea of how the product assembles by reviewing the picture and understanding how it works That being said - the product it 's self is great - I 'm using it on a Delta 10 inch table saw and it works perfect ! ! Prior to assembly , measure the base of the legs for your equipment ( Length and width ) . Assemble your mobile base ( L&W ) and set aside - then to your corners , get the front corners and wheels figured out first - then to the back - - join the corners to the L and W - and poof your done
1 #### Received this as a Christmas gift from my wish list . Looking forward to starting dahlias indoors . Did n't get around to setting it up until today ( 1 - 25 - 15 ) . Good thing I did it now , because the light did n't come on . It did n't even make a hint of coming on . It was packaged pretty well , and it was seated in the fixture properly , so I see no cause for it . I did remove the bulb from the fixture once I determined that it was n't coming on ( it came already installed in the fixture , despite the directions which indicate that you have to install the bulb ) and when I shook it gently , I did hear a tiny something shaking around inside , but do n't know if that means anything . Just finished dealing with the return on Amazon chat - for some reason , they ca n't just send a replacement . Sent me a return label , and I have until 1 - 31 - 15 to ship it back . Meanwhile , I had to purchase the second one with my money , mainly because I need the shipping box . To purchase one suitable to ship this long item would 've cost $ 20.00 or more . So as it is , my funds are on the line and I 'll have to trust that this works out and that the refund for the first one goes through . AND that the second one actually works . crossing my fingers ..............
5 #### Excellent spinner . Same spinner is sold at Williams Sonoma ( higher price ) so you know it is top quality !
4 #### Best price i found for this was on amazon by far . Works as described . Really keeps mosquitoes out of my yard . Just remember that this will also kill beneficial bugs too .
5 #### I got this to try to control a rabbit and squirrel infestation we have on our property and in my garden . It was delivered just three or four days ago , I 've already caught 3 or 4 critters . This trap is long enough for the animal ( cottontail rabbit or squirrel ) to be fully inside it before it can reach the trigger mechanism -- this is important because if part of the animal is sticking out then the door will not lock . I also highly recommend the tip I saw online somewhere , to put some of the bait under the trap , below the trip - plate . This ensures the animal will dig and trip the plate .
5 #### These axes are very very well made and split even the toughest logs with one strike . I 'm overwhelmed with how well they work and how well they 're made .
5 #### I 'm totally sold on OXO products - great value for the price .
5 #### This item was bought as a gift for my daughter - in - law . She likes it very much .
4 #### Fits Sthil 350 series with 20 " bar . 72D is the key part of the description . I just put my second one on my saw today and will order a third for a back up .
3 #### I bought this to go with a bird feeder that require black oil sunflowers , and I do n't know if it 's the seeds or the feeder , but not a single bird has shown any interest in it . They all fly right past or perch at wing 's length from it . Nothing . Nada . Again , it could be the feeder . Considering how much I paid , I 'm disappointed . These seem to be of high quality , but then again I 'm not a bird looking for a meal , so what do I know ?
3 #### Upon the second year of use , as indicated by others , the tabs holding the top to the bottom snapped off . We really like the feeder so I tried super gluing it but it 's barely holding together , after re - gluing it once again . Sad because otherwise it was a great feeder . It seems as if the plastic used is getting more brittle as it ages . Part of the clear plastic area also chipped during it 's first year of use but luckily it did n't affect it .
1 #### leaks really bad .... less than 1 year old ... I bought this last august and it worked great . Then I washed it and put away for the winter and now it leaks horribly .... I tightened the screws thinking that was the problem , but it continues to leak really badly . I have it hung on my upstairs porch so there is no problem with any other critters getting at it .... but the sticky puddle that results is a big problem . I am just trashing it . do not buy this feeder .
5 #### I looked at many portable router tables and decided on the Bench Dog and I sure am glad I did ! ! Easy to assemble and quality material !
1 #### PLEASE NOTE ! The description says " number of pieces 5 " but there is only TWO BAGS . Do n't make the same mistake I did . I had to return mine .
5 #### I learned about this brand through the Today 's show one morning . And they were not kidding-- This company does have great products ! I uploaded a picture to illustrate how well the corer does the job . Everything came out nicely and neatly . All it took was bit of turning and pushing , and then the whole core came out like a beauty ! I just love it ! Plus , it saves so much time . Yes-- the handle / grip is absolutely well designed . It fits in my hand well and it does n't slip at all .
5 #### Replacing the bulbs in fancy italian blown glass fixture . It came with ceramic so replacing with ceramic , dunno if that is important or not . Works perfectly and the price is right .
5 #### The spinner works great for its intended purpose of draining water from salad fixings . Shredded carrots get caught & are annoying to get out . It has a bonus use not listed - it entertains my teenage sons who love to play with it . No need for expensive electronics , buy this ! The cat can easily sit in the box & the kids can spin & stop the spinner ! Win - win !
5 #### Channellock comes through again , as I ca n't say enough for the utility of this 358 plier / nipper . My main use is renovation . When I go into a home , for example , that has an unfinished basement , for some reason there are always thousands of nails in the joists -- who does that ! But these 358 nippers can either snip a nail head flush with a wall , ceiling , baseboard , floor , or joist , or it can effortlessly extract it by rolling it out . You 'll never want to use a hammer to extract a nail again since this 358 plier rolls the nail out without marking the face of the board or wall . Also , its handles are curved so that all four fingers can apply equal pressure , giving you more torque . Another use is to cleanly shape material , corners , and edges . I can enlarge a wallboard cutout for an electrical outlet in a precise way rather than using a ziptool or using a clumsy hand saw . No matter what , make sure you have this tool in your belt .
5 #### I bought this for the office . Staff enjoy making sentences to express themselves .
1 #### I am a landlord who has owned dozens of rental properties . I know how to repair a toilet . I normally go for the cheapest fill valve available , but since this time it was my personal residence -- I decided to opt for something a bit more expensive because it claimed to be the quietest . What should have been a 10 minute install turned into a 2 hour long nightmare . The fill valve would not seal against the toilet tank . I tried every trick in the book from years of experience . I cleaned both the rubber washer and the toilet tank . I made sure it was not on upside down . I tried hand tightening the bolt , and when that would work -- I even tried gently tightening it with pliers , being careful not to crack the plastic . This product turned out to be horrible engineered , and just a piece of junk which I will be promptly returning tomorrow . Nobody builds anything to last these days , and this product is proof of another company just outsourcing to the cheapest manufacturer in China , and doing zero quality control . I see numerous other reviews here and elsewhere now where people claim it will not seal .
5 #### Beaker measures liquid and dry food perfectly , no guessing on correct measurement . Had one for years , recently broke and very happy to find that they still make these . Good price as well . Thanks to Amazon , just love your products .
5 #### If you 're using a porter - cable joiner - these things are super - solid and make and " excellent " joint - I do n't know how I ever lived without this joiner and these biscuits . Read up on them - go to woodworking blog sites where pro woodworkers discuss joiners . No doubt , you will come back to buy these . So save yourself the time and just buy them - more time to work on your projects and get away from this computer , eh ? I do n't work for them or anyone who sells them - I have nothing to gain or loose . Just passing on the truth to fellow wood - workers trying to cut through all the bull out there . Simply put , these are the industry standard for a reason .
5 #### This item work very well in line where you are using multiple pieces of equipment with a blast gate on each
5 #### This little storage seat is perfect for storing gardening stuff . It has just the right amount of room to store things I do not want getting wet but use often . It is small enough to not take up valuable space , and is complimenting to other outside furniture . I like it so much I 'm considering getting a second .
3 #### This product does a good job of clearing the water in our fish pond . The reason I did n't rate it a 5 star is because the white filters wear out much more quickly than the black filters . The company does n't sell the white filters separate from the black filters , therefore one ends up having many more black filters but no white filters . A telephone call to the company revealed that they only sell them together . This product would earn 5 stars if we could buy white filters only .
5 #### the gold finch love it , they normaly just pass thru but this year they hae stayed i guess the plenty seed i keep out for them
5 #### Bought these for bowhunting in the south . Was skeptical but WOW . It just works , and well . Use them in the evenings at high school football games and the people in our vicinity are appreciative . Do n't hesitate to buy , great product that does what it says .
4 #### Purchased this vacuum in October of 2012 . It 's been going strong . The hose is n't perfect , coming out of the canister more easily now every year but my kids are tough on it ... I'd say it started being an issue at about year 3 . Today the wand broke and it 's never been banged on anything - it seems a little odd - never had a wand brake in my life . Otherwise a tough machine .
5 #### It just works . I do n't have much else to say . It 's not really nice , but does really work .
5 #### Good quality , Good price , and very useful . Need to order some more for my girls
5 #### Powerful fan and good price . Well made . Would buy again .
4 #### A very nice , small , discreet , ' kitchen corner ' style of fire extinguisher .
4 #### The shape and size are OK but i was disappointed in the " painting " which turns out to be just decals , probably applied before the button shape was stamped out . Also , the image implies a wide variety of designs but , all it is is something like ten of each ( I have n't counted ) of the five designs shown . What the heck - there is plenty of room for these in my Button Tin and they will eventually get used - even if I need to paint a design on one myself to complement a fabric print , that is still an option - or , even applying a button with the wrong side out to display a plain wood surface , which is not a bad idea at all . In fact , for that , I will amend my star rating from three to four .
5 #### These lamps are frosted , but they throw out as much lights as clear lamps . They are the smaller size too ( < 35 mm ) which is necessary to fit some fixtures .
1 #### Talk about Cheesy ! It 's cheaply built . Do n't waste your money .
4 #### Functionally as a meat tenderizer it is quite adequate : hefty enough to do the job and with a grip comfortable to use ( like most Oxo products ) . Its principle drawback is that it ca n't be put into a dishwasher . I use it a lot on chicken and like to sterilize it afterward - which has to be done by hand .
5 #### Get good water flow with a soft and flexible hose . The brass ends are well made of castings , not little thin sheets of brass .
5 #### If you 're going to make popcorn outside of a microwave , this is the way to do it ! Microwave still wins for the convenience and cleanup factor , but popcorn is definitely better - tasting when popped like this , and you can use real butter instead of the mystery substance used in microwave popcorn bags . The clear dome works great as a popcorn bowl ( just remember to put the plastic lid back on ) , but melting butter separately and applying it is easier than trying to melt it on the top of the bowl while popping . Clean - up is easy , and you never burn any kernals due to the stirring rod that is always in motion . Making multiple batches is also easy since you can easily refill with oil and popcorn and go . Microwave popcorn is quick , and comes with it 's own carrying bag , but when you want to do popcorn right , the Stir Crazy is the best way to go !
4 #### works as expected,,,,ordered a metal one , they are obsolete , so they sent me a plastic one , not what I wanted but it does the job for now
5 #### I 've been using these filters for over 10 years . I think they do the best job in reducing dust in your house . Every time I change one , which is 2 - 3 months , they are just covered in crap . Although a little pricey , those .99 blue ones really do n't do anything at all .
5 #### I bought a bunch of these to cover all my ladder tips . Werner consistently delivers quality products and this is nothing but that . These covers are made of high quality material and are very durable .
1 #### Similar to another review , I bought this hose in April 2011 and after 3 months of use , the brass coupler that fits into the watering nozzle began to leak . It must be a bad weld between the 2 brass pieces . It 's now physically loose and absolutely useless . I 'm very disappointed because Amazon says that I am over the return time window so it 's a total waste of $ $ $ .
5 #### It 's Incra . It 's excellent as usual . Well worth the investment . Do buy another mechanical pencil to supplement the one / ones Incra provides . They are n't great and you wo n't be happy when you ca n't get it unjammed while in the middle of a project . A .5 mm pencil will work but a .3 mm engineering pencil is perfect .
2 #### The blades are great , but I find it almost impossible to use for my purpose . I got these so I can cut away unwanted bamboo around my huge prickly pear cactus . I was super excited when it came in and ran out to test it just to find out that it 's almost impossible to cut the bamboo around the cactus because in order to grip the branch ( or bamboo in my case ) you need a lot of open space around , which defeats the purpose because I have cactus thorns in that space which I am trying to avoid ! And even with regular branches - you have to get really close to the branch ( because you have to open up the darn thing real wide ) , so the length listed is deceptive . I want to be able to cut a branch that 's two feet away without the need to get within 5 inches of it !
5 #### I love this nozzle . Used my first one all summer for watering garden , flower beds , spots in my yard , washing cars . This nozzle adjusted to all jobs . Decided to get another one for my other hose . Well worth the money spent on this . It 's very comfortable to use .
5 #### We tried everything to keep our neighbors nine cats from using our yard as a potty - pepper , yard deterrents , dog scents . This is the only thing that has worked . In order to have it sensitive enough for the cats in our front yard though , it also goes off every time a person passes on the sidewalk or a car drives by . Hoping those cats will retrain themselves to go to the bathroom in their own yard as our front lawn is constantly soaked . It is doing its job it is supposed to do !
4 #### If you need a zester this is probably one of the best . It even curls the lemon peel if you like to make fancy desserts or drinks .
5 #### I fugured an electric chain saw would not have enough torque to do " manly " work so I did n't even consider this tool -- but to be sure I rented one from Home Depot for 4 hours yesterday ... WOW-- as an alumni user of several gas - powered chain saws -- I'm hooked ... I just ordered one after that 4 - hour experience of taking down 17 trees from 6 " to 15 " in diameter and turning them all into firewood ... my gas powered saws are goign in the next garage sale ! Keith Drury
3 #### They 're ok . Just as good as any other stakes I 've purchased of the same kind .
4 #### Very sturdy feeder at a good price . You loop the chain around a tree branch and then hook it back into itself to adjust the height somewhat ( by a few inches anyway - it 's a fairly short chain ) . My only complaint is that the latches are VERY tight once the feeder is closed , so it can be VERY difficult to open - even my husband had difficulty prying it open . I 'm hoping this wo n't lead to messes and that it just needs to be broken in . One final note , I caution you about buying the Heath Outdoor Products DD-24 Woodpecker Suet Cakes ... not a single bird touched them . Looking for another brand that might fit this feeder ...
5 #### Arrvd on time & well pkd . Started using it 2 wks ago & can see progress already !
5 #### This rotisseries works incredibly well . Turns out wonderful chicken and prime rib roasts . Only learning trick is to not get the kettle too hot . I close down most all of the upper and lower vents . The thermometer on the hood should be about 325 - 350 ( temp on the meat will be a little lower than what registers on the hood reading ) . I highly recommend this gear ! !
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with OXO products . The whisk is well made and was recommended by Test Kitchen .
1 #### Piece of Junk ! Returning this to HD , installed it after reading and following instructions exactly , when I flush it does n't fill the tank with water , unless you tap the side of the quiet fill in the tank . I check the floater valve and it 's very stiff I am not taking this thing completely apart to troubleshoot it , I paid for it and it should work properly out of the box and it does n't piece of junk .
1 #### The end of the spatula cracked off as I was washing it after it 's 2nd use . My spatulas from Walmart lasted much longer so I would recommend investing the money this costs toward a different item on your kitchen must have list .
5 #### Bought this as a gift for my girlfriend who hated our old salad spinner , which was a cheaper version with a manual spinning knob on top . Was immediately impressed with the size and quality of the OXO salad spinner when opening the box . Love the pop up knob in the center and the braking feature . The spinner works well and pulls much of the moisture on the salad leaves but you have to chop or tear the pieces into smaller bits . Do n't expect to leave the lettuce leaves whole and expect to get all the moisture off them , not sure if any salad spinner is capable of that . The bowl is made of an acrylic material and has a silicone gripper along the bottom so it stays put on the counter when spinning dry some salad leaves . Also the bowl is attractive enough that we occasionally use the bowl as our salad serving bowl . Overall , very satisfied and happy with the salad spinner and look forward to many years of use .
5 #### These are replacement briquettes for me . I BBQ so often that my previous set of briquettes almost disintegrated after about 3 years of use . I would n't BBQ without briquettes because they add that " real barbeque flavor " on gas grills and was disappointed when the manufacturers stopped including them .
5 #### Awesome stove , we love it . Easy install , breaks down for camping ... everyone needs this !
5 #### We 've been using these loppers since 2012 and they are still going strong . The gear mechanism makes it surprisingly easy to lop off larger branches with much less effort than one might expect . The shorter handles allow for cutting in spaces that might be too tight for the longer handled loppers to open . We 've managed to put a few nicks in the blades , but they keep cutting leaving a clean edge .
4 #### This is a handy little whisk good for whipping small amounts of salad dressing , whipping cream , sauces or a couple of eggs ! Nice handle , narrow design gets in the corners of a measuring cup fairly easy , no places to trap residue . Would buy this one again !
3 #### I was expecting for the garlic peeler to work the first time I used it . I had one that I bought at local grocery store that worked better which I misplaced and replaced it with this one .
5 #### I got my dad this same house from Sears about 20 years ago or more . He never had much luck attracting martins but he does n't live hea water and it was mounted only about 10 ft high . When I discovered that he 'd taken it down I asked if I could have it . We live on a lake and I set it up about 15 ft high right on the lake shore . We 've had occupants every year since . The house feels lightweight but it is still in great shape after all these years . I think the light weight is good because with the nests and birds inside that is more weight and the box sways a little in a heavy wind .
5 #### Good wood , good smoke . One of our favorites on poultry .
5 #### This one works even when you leave it outside in freezing temps . I had another brand and I could n't , but this one is okay .
5 #### Mounted in a box with a receptacle feeding fused strips , this is great for charging many different devices using wallwarts .
5 #### Best salad spinner ever . Saw that Cooks Country rated it best also .
5 #### It was bought for my roommate . He seems quite satisfactory .
5 #### I love the coffee this makes , it brings back memories of the apartment we rented in Italy . Word to the wise - DO NOT put this in the dishwasher . My husband did just that while I was out of town and it ruins the finish . It still works but is n't shiny anymore .
5 #### The DeWalt circular blade slices through KD and PT lumber without hesitation . Worth the price and no more expensive than you would find at Home Depot , only you do n't have to suffer the shopping excursion to the place of orange - clad zombies .
5 #### Gave it as a gift and the recipient absolutely LOVES it ! Works great and is easy to clean .
4 #### This is just what I wanted . Its fits my Weber grill perfectly . Its heavy duty and should last a few years . Ca nt beat amazons price and fast shipping . Especially having " Prime " .
5 #### Does exactly what they 're supposed to do . I used them to nail down 500 sq . ft . of solid red oak 3/4 " flooring , I needed the extra length ( as opposed to 1 1/2 " ) since I was using 1/4 " rubber underlayment for sound proofing . No bent nails , no jambs or misfires .
5 #### i'VE HAD SEVERAL OF THESE , SOMEHOW THEY GO MISSING AFTER A VISIT FROM A NEIGHBOR . jUST KIDDING!!Work Great , I keep one on my boat , at the summer place and two at my home .
4 #### This is a simple product and design , but a regular bottle washer does n't fit some of the hummingbird bottle feeders . The thin wire and sponge material fit easily into the bottle making it possible to clean any residue . You need to wet the sponge as directed before forcing it into the bottle dry ( or it might tear upon being forced ) . The only reason I did n't rate this a 5 is because it is just a little too short to reach all the way to the bottom of the feeder bottle . To avoid any mold developing that is difficult to reach , I might suggest avoiding completely filling the bottle with nectar .
5 #### Ca nt run a chain saw without one . My friends love it so much they borrow it and do n't bring it back because they use it so often . I let them keep it as a gift and just purchase myself a new one . Highly recommend the carbide bits though . The stone grinders wear out quickly .
4 #### It 's OK as a flashlight , but new LED lights are much brighter . I bought this primarily to run down ( exhaust ) NiCad batteries and recharge them to keep them in good shape . My usage is highly erratic , and batteries sitting around slowly lose their charge and their ability to be recharged fully .
5 #### Now I know why all the pros use this stuff . WOW.great glue
4 #### Heavy duty pan . No warping in oven . Only thing that would make it better is if it were non stick
5 #### Great product . Works perfectly with my yardwork . Sturdy and powerful . Highly recommended .
4 #### I bought the scarecrow with the sole intent of keeping my neighbors cat out of my vegetable garden . Once installed the cat learned to not go near the garden and now it does n't even enter my yard . The device worked as advertised . I think the device could be designed a little more rugged for the price but this seems to be the nature of the modern manufacturing thinking .
5 #### wife here : Excellent top quality . Very happy with these . Highly recommended .
5 #### The Kangaroo Yard Container is the perfect solution for those gardeners who struggle to put yard cuttings and leaves in garbage bags that seem to have no opening or that fall over spilling the contents . My husband says they are the perfect gift for those who love to work in the garden .
5 #### Mine came in green color . The hose and fittings were reasonable quality . A great bargain considering the price .
5 #### Seed is perfect . However , the bag was so torn up that bird seed was in everything else that was in the box from Amazon .
1 #### Junk ! have purchased 3 over the years ( my mistake ) . ALL have broken off at the spigot connection . The company refused to honor the 2 - year warranty .
5 #### great little heater , we use this to heat our rental house in the winter using a 20 pnd propane tank . You have to purchase a few accessories to use it like this but once I purchased the propane line , bag holder and ac plug wire it has worked out well . It costs us 40 bucks to fill 3 20 pnd propane tanks that last us probably for 2 months of heating . This is much cheaper than the horrible dated home heater . We are saving hundreds of dollars this way . Even better this heater is going to be used on our camping trips as well . A very versatile unit that works extremely well .
5 #### Replaced my old wand and did not need to buy the maintenance kit , because it has everything that is needed to simply replace the old unit . Nothing else was broken on my spray unit .
5 #### Had n't used this brand , so did n't know if it would be sturdy ... ordered " one " ... wish I 'd gotten at least one more , at $ 29 ... because they keep going up ! I wanted " white " but this goes with anything .
5 #### I 've had this sink caddy for over a year and I love it . It fits nicely over the divider in my double sink and can easily be cleaned by hand or in the top shelf of my dishwasher . The holes and slots drain away water from my sponges really well . I used both the sponge holder and the flatware holder for sponges and scrubbing pads . I have n't had any issues with the caddy falling apart or not working ( probably because the items I use it for are not heavy ) . It 's sturdy and easy to assemble or un - assemble . Since my primary use is for sponges and scrubbing pads , I recently bought a second set and have sponge holders on both sides . The sponge holder holes and slots allow the sponges to dry more quickly . I noticed the flatware holder worked for the sponges but took a little longer to dry them , so my preference was for two sponge holders . I 'll find another use for the flatware holders . Definitely a worthwhile purchase .
5 #### This cover is a must - have Great for covering up your camp chef and accessories till the next cookout went camping or just great for storage
4 #### Good product and very sturdy , after a few uses the paint begins to chip and rust begins to form , but a little hegh temperature grill paint will take care of the flaws - overall very happy with the purchase
5 #### I had one of these for years and it disappeared , do n't know if maybe I mistakenly threw it in the wastepaper basket . but ........ this is a great knife , strong and made very well . You will not be disappointed .
5 #### I wanted a strainer that would serve to rinse tiny grains of quinoa . My own strainer would n't work and I could n't find a better one in any local store . This strainer is large enough and filters well enough to do this task .
5 #### I have been looking for a sharp , sturdy , no scratch fork . This one fills the bill . I use it to fry bacon and stir fry . I think that it is strong enough to do everything that I need it to .
5 #### Great ! No garden thieves since I put my two pack up . One must have sprayed meandering bear . Neighbor said bear in the back yard about 1.5 minutes . Knocked the device down and ripped some dripper lines . Still works like a champ ! We love it .
5 #### Amazing the number of flies these catch . I am considering asking all my neighbors to get them so we can control our neighborhood ! Think these should be issued by your local community to control these pests ! The only issue is that they stink but guess that is what makes them so effective as an attractant .
3 #### This machine is really really loud and noisy . We ca n't even hear the TV over it . It does make a decent loaf of bread though . If I were to buy another one I would n't pick this brand or model due to the noise .
5 #### Works great l captures 95 % of chips , leaving shop vac bag empty
5 #### I bought the dewalt drill for Christmas and wanted to get a flashlight that uses same battery . My husband was very pleased with his gift .
5 #### Great for grilled appetizers after soaking of course . My guests thought they were too adorable and asked me where I got them ! I told them I saw them in one of my gourmet cooking magazines and found them on Amazon !
4 #### Really like the unit . Noisy but very good at picking up pet fur . Light weight and has all the accessories I need to get in corners . Price was right and it really picks up better than the electric stick broom I had before .
5 #### I 've owned my set for over 6 years and have gotten more than my money 's worth from the set . The number of times I 've had to start my pilot hole and then set the screw goes on and on . With this , it 's so simple to start my hole , flip the bit and set the screw . After 6 years , one of the bits stopped snapping back into place cleanly . However , there are 3 other bits in the set and I switched to one of the 3 remaining and things are fine . The only negative that I 've had with this is that it extends the length of the drill out about another 2 to 3 inches . When I 'm doing tight work in cabinets , it gets a bit challenging to use . Other than that , it 's the only bit I always keep with my drill .
5 #### This replaced a cheap machete shape that shipped with a shotgun scabbard . I am using the scabbard for carrying my Husqvarna Axe . The Machete is a handy addition to my timber felling kit . It works well for light limbing work . I have it sharpened as a knife so it will work really well for large butchering cuts also .
3 #### The quality of this item is very good and if I had a gas range it would be great but after reading the entire manual It says due to having a concave bottom you can not use this on a Glasstop electric range . So look elsewhere .
4 #### So , this clock is large , and very easy to read . It sets itself , and updates to DST and back when necessary . It also looks great . I 've only had one issue , and that s when its between 3:00 and 3:30 ( when the hour is near the 3 mark ) , and it is 60 degrees . In this case , the hour hand gets stuck on the temperature gauge , and the clock stops telling time . I have to take the clock down and give it a tap to get it running again , and then it takes about a day to reset the time . Were it not for the 60degrees at 3:00 - 3:30 flaw , I 'd give this a 10/10 . Maybe you could open the clock and bend the temp gauge a little , or even remove it . That would solve the problem ... 8/10
5 #### I used the 5/8 TPI blade to cut through old fence planks . Worked great with my Craftsman C3 reciprocating saw . Also provided the impetus to purchase an additional lithium ion battery . But that 's another review .
5 #### I have a odd chandelier in the front of my boutique these bulbs cost $ 5 a piece at my local Home Depot . I was very pleased with this purchase and will be ordering more
5 #### love the design of this scoop . I can achieve a firm grip , slices easily through hard ice cream . A wonderful , comfortable , and well balanced rubberized handle . As it glides over , it produces a curl that easily releases from the scoop . Excellent product .
5 #### Replaced my 40 year old Estwing , it did n't wear out , it was stolen . That should say it all .
5 #### Yep , these are Stanleys . Solid , strong , fast shipping , no complaints .
5 #### I have used electric , wall mounted , and hand can openers in the past . After struggling with our present hand opener wechose this one after reading the great reviews . It has lived up to its accolades . It never skips and cleanly opens the whole can . It is easy and comfortable to use and requires minimum effort .
5 #### Bought this for my wife and she loves it . Easy to use . Efficiently dries veggies and lettuce . Seems to be well designed , durable and easily cleaned .. She would recommend that it should have a handle attached vertically to the outside of the cylinder .
4 #### Nice set and an interesting 2 sided chipper wing . Does not cut perfectly square corners as the item description may allude , but it is very close .
1 #### I have chosen to return this product because I do n't like the nonremovable plastic bracket attached to the glass bottle .
5 #### I have always had a hard time peeling everything . I orderd Cutco knives which helped , but still had a hard time . I love apple pie and will be making it more often now . I was able to peel , core and slice 10 apples in the time it would take to do just one . It has rubber feet to easily mount on any counter .
5 #### As a vegan , I work with a lot of vegetables . As a result , this peeler is practically an extension of my arm ! I love it ! I use it regularly and the blade is still sharp . It works perfectly on carrots , potatoes , cucumbers ... you name it !
3 #### It does n't cut as good as I thought it would . Takes a few times over to cut through .
5 #### nice item ..... worth the price . Seems like its made well .... has a clip on the back if you want to out it on your belt or waist area on pants .
5 #### Perfect hammer for any upholstery needs ! I used it to tack on upholstery nails to my leather couch .. Could not have done this task with a normal sized hammer !
5 #### This is a sturdy , larger spatula for your grilling activities . It features a nice wood handle with plenty of length and , a useful side edge for such things as scoring burgers . You can tell that it has been carefully machined . Has a really nice metal finish too . It 's particularly convenient for barbecuing large - sized hamburgers . Be sure to score ( # ) each side of your burger prior to cooking for nice flat , uniform shape . My order arrived quickly and in good condition .
4 #### Was a christmas gift for my father , it seems like it will work but have n't tested it yet . Great idea for those who like to eat tacos and have hard and soft taco lovers in the household !
5 #### Frued consistently delivers a great product ! These bits are always my first choice . I would recommend to a friend . 5 stars !
4 #### The Good : These tongs are cheap and adequate . I needed a long pair of tongs with metal ends to work in the grill and hot pans and this this did the trick . They open and close with ease , just like the smaller versions you can buy . Additionally , arms of the tongs are well made . The Bad : The ends of these tongs are very thin and mine came twisted a slight bit . It all gave the impression of being slightly cheaply made , but for $ 15 you get what you pay for .
5 #### Just like the good ol' days when things were actually built to last , the Gilmour Nozzle feels hefty and solid . I 've dropped mine on the concrete a couple of times when washing the car and it still looks and performs perfectly . I personally think it 's the best hose nozzle for the money .
3 #### I originally purchased mine for toting up and down some scaffolding on a siding job , but in retrospect it 's not worth the cost . I recently found the Makita 7.5 " sliding miter saw which only weighs 28 lbs . Buy the Makita if you must have a lightweight saw . Also , the Hitachi mitering stop mechanism needs a serious rethinking and redesign . It 's just way too sloppy to stay at zero . Mine has a little play which is annoying . Zero means Zero ( 90^deg ) ! ! ! I appreciate a stop mechanism that is sure and snaps into place with no bones about it , like the Dewalt . While the 8.5 " may be the ' original ' slider , you will be better served with a 10 " that bevels left and right ....
5 #### After hearing so much about this unit , and seeing a couple of them in my neighborhood , I decided to give it a try , even though the price was higher than I ever expected to pay for a lawn sprinkler . I now know why so many people like it . It is very effective in watering the lawn , without spraying water high up in the air ( less chance for evaporation , and not affected by wind as much ) , and it has hands - off operation once you set it up . Adjusting the spray diameter is easy , and using the hose as a way to set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea . The adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much ground you want to cover in a period of time . Inspecting the yard afterwards shows that the ground is nicely saturated , and not needing to go out and move hoses is a welcomed change . This sprinkler is worth the purchase price !
4 #### After you learn how to set this for use , it 's an excellent mole trapper . Providing you 're patient and choose the correct tunnel .
5 #### Good product . Fair price . Packaging contained all the screws ( previous orders of wall plates from Amazon had screws missing ! ) .
5 #### Easy crown molding - the saw is sharp and easy to use . All those modern synthetic materials used for molding these days - takes about 20 seconds to make a cut . Great alternative to compound miter ...
5 #### Perfect for our needs . We are moving abroad and needed a sturdy box that would fit the airline requirements . These fit the bill !
5 #### Fast delivery and excellent communications throughout delivery process . Will buy again from this seller .
5 #### Very handy . I used this to replace the switch for my bathroom heater , because my housemate kept accidentally leaving the heater on ALL DAY while I was at work . The 15 minutes is perfect for the heater .
5 #### This is the good stuff . This attractant + Flowton zapper = millions of dead mosquitos . If you have a bug zapper , you NEED these .
5 #### This is my first pair of pruners , but they work really great . They cut super easily , and have a little bolt in the middle above the handle where you can slide it up and down to unlock and lock the pruners closed . Seem to be very durable and I anticipate them to hold up very well for years to come .
4 #### This seems like a solid tool . So far it is holding up and my husband has n't broken it ( he has broken my last 2 in a very short amount of time ) . It arrived on time .
5 #### I own tongs by other makers , including a beautiful but heavy pair from All - Clad . The Oxo ones ( 12 " and 16 " ) have perfect weight , balance , sure grip and spring tension . They 're useful for far more than just turning or lifting . I reach for these Oxo tongs daily and use them for stirring and moving food around while cooking -- they 're a terrific one - item substitute for a spoon or spatula in many applications . The diswasher does n't hurt them . If I had to settle for just one tool to use in the pot or pan or on the grill , this would be it -- it even goes in my suitcase when I travel .
5 #### I 've cut down hundreds of trees and have split all the wood by hand . I 've been through two different mauls , and this my friends , is the best I 've used . It 's lighter , but it splits like a maul twice its weight . I just wanted to try it out when I first got it , so I took a few pieces of some hardwood into the driveway just to see how far it would go down into the wood - I never expected it to slice completely threw and still have enough energy to makes a nice chip in the concrete . All I can say is wow , I immediately went inside and ordered the 14 " and 8 " hatchets & fiskars sharpener . I 'm 6'4 " and yes , the first couple of strikes I noticed the difference in the length of the handle - however if you follow proper form when splitting wood , you are in absolutely no danger of hitting your shins or feet . I quickly became accustomed to the shorter handle and because of its design , it does not require the " windup " and force of the longer and heavier mauls . Buy it .
5 #### Awsome stuff . Would recomend for any herb farmer for flushing
5 #### This pump worked right out of the box . I will see how long it lasts . I am hoping for the best .
5 #### Finally what I 've been looking for . Under the cover of darkness , Can I find the switch , I ask myself . Kitchen or crapper I CAN ! I CAN ! Alas ! light ! My index and thumb join forces . A well coordinated grasp and rotation Zombies beware ; I can see you there . On left a westinghouse 66654 on the right the same Never will I step into the darkness again .
5 #### Does the job of a balloon whisk without the hassle of top - heavy handle flopping out of the pan . The handle does get a little hot though , but not bad . I like it .
4 #### It basically works , but it 's awfully trigger happy in response to events that have nothing to do with animals invading . Takes a lot of adjusting and jimmying and fiddling , but it 's an effective strategy , although my one big concern , especially with its trigger happy nature , is that it wastes a lot of water , which is a problem in drought stricken areas . One partial solution is to lower the water pressure delivered to it with a simple in - line adjustable shut off valve . One example of the jimmying : I had to use a plastic shim to make the water spray as low to the ground as I wanted . The adjuster on the mechanism is not effective at all for adjusting the height of the spray . It could definitely use better QA / QC .
1 #### Bought this on June 16 .. Few days after that I installed it and it worked fine ..... but just less than 2 months later it has torn by the female end ! ! Up unitl then it was working great .. now it is garbage ! !
5 #### This spinner is easy to use , efficient and effective at removing water from produce . Initially I cringed over paying what I thought was too high of a price for this item . However , due to hand and wrist injury , I needed a spinner that did not use wrist action to function . This was worth every penny ! It is spacious and just takes a quick pump or two to remove excess water from salad greens or other produce . It is easy to clean . When I am washing / drying multiple batches of produce , I just wipe the bowl with a paper towel and add another batch for spin . You can easily control how much or little spinning action you want . This is ideal for anyone with limited hand / wrist strength since all you need to do is lightly push down on the pump .
5 #### The Rain Bird all brass impact sprinkler is simply the BEST ! ! ! It does n't corrode , rust , or plug up . They 're easy to adjust for various coverage patterns . I go back 40 years ( I sound like an old codger ) to Central California where Rain Birds were used by homeowners and farmers alike . I 've tried the cheaper brands ( I could n't find Rain Birds at my local Big Box ) but they do n't even last a single season while the Rain Bird will last for years . I purchased some Orbit Sprinkler Bases to go with the Rain Birds . They make a very functional combination .
5 #### This mixing bowl is absolutely the best I have ever owned . Stays put on the counter and easy to hold onto or pour from . I also own the smaller version which I use constantly
5 #### great product , stands up to the test of time and cleaning twice a week in my outside 110 gal fish tank ! !
2 #### you have to screw apart to put in another blade . I thought that style went out years ago . Do not like .
5 #### I just needed to extend my garden hose a few feet . The garden hose extends across the driveway for temporary watering but did n't quite reach . Rather than buy a new , longer hose that will just be run over , I went with this " remnant . " I did n't care which color I received ( dark red by the way ) and the price was right . It works perfectly . No leaks at either end ! Very happy with my purchase .
5 #### Best snips I have owned for light work , deadheading . Smooth operation and very sharp .
5 #### i should ve been on there marketing team for such a catchy line to this review . well its a fantastic whisk . you can throw it in the washer and not worry about it . has a great weight . i actually keep it in a canister on my counter because i use it so much . comfortable to whisk with also .
5 #### Works well . Programming is a bit complicated and the instructions are less than detailed . Had electrician hook it up to control my hot water circulation pump . Note that the display wo n't work without installing the battery . Caused the electrician and me to scratch our collective heads .
5 #### Easy to use - sturdy , good product . Really spins out the water .
5 #### Strong performer , will not break where handle meets the business end . Should outlast you .
5 #### It is as advertised . The head is small for big jobs , but it retracts nicely .
5 #### I got this for my grand son . His dad says it is better than the one he has . LOL I 'm thinking he swapped with him . Some kids like things that spin . Thank you
5 #### I love it ! ! ! going to be drinking tea next winter . ...
5 #### It is thin , flexible and wide enough for anything . Perfect for making eggs ! Flipping pancakes is great too ! I use this for everything cause of its bendability , it makes it so much easier that a thicker non bendable spatula ! will def buy another when mine wears out !
5 #### What else can I say about this brand . Top notch .
4 #### Sturdy enough , but I chose this one because the reviews said it came already sharpened . My was quite dull and I only had a knife sharpener to work with so it took forever to get a a decent edge on it . Once I get back home and use the proper tool it should be better . Pretty heavy blade , which is good .
5 #### Having my previous heavy corded drill give up .......... I wanted a replacement for bench use . I settled on this unit and have not been disapointed .
4 #### I was surprised when I received this . It looked too BIG but that was only because the blade in the used Edger that I bought was really used up . After I replaced it with this blade it really did the job .
4 #### I have it mounted on a Ridgid 2400LS and have used it about 5 times . I 've cut mostly 4/4 maple , poplar , walnut and cherry with it . Not too many board feet have gone through it .
5 #### All these years my parents constantly bought cheap can openers . I introduced them to the world of amazon and told them I could search for a good quality can opener . It 's amazing ! We are going to buy some more and send it to my family members in the Dominican Republic .
5 #### I bought one musical set for my office and it was boring , this one was fun but a little in appropriate for the office words like dick and bitch and words like that are great but not if this is for your office fridge . Lol .
3 #### you need to adjust the shim on the left to keep the full dado blades on a bosch saw , the outer blade tends to fall on the threads and makes the dado wider/ beveled
5 #### Simple no flash to design but inexpensive and sturdy does what it is intended to do . Just what the doctor ordered .
4 #### I found this product to be much better priced than comparable nails in the local big box store Many brands bind their nails with paper which often causes jams and double feeds . Worst yet , the paper dissolves when it gets damp making the nails unusable . This product is plastic bound which provides much better performance . I have taken a soggy box from the back of the truck , loaded the nails and had no problems .. Continue to reorder
4 #### Pretty looking , big , seem strong enough . Those traits make it better than the cloths pin technique for closing bags . The magnet is too small for the size of the clip , to be useful for hanging things on the fridge . It gets knocked down too easily . Whatever .
5 #### Bought this on May 3rd . Today is June 10th and I already have to replace the little rubber overpressure plug in the lid . It simply does not fit tight enough to hold in any pressure . I 'm not sure if I rec'd a defective one ( since it 's so new ) or if they just wear out every month . I 'm really not happy about this at all . I 'm hoping I hear from Presto about this . Edit : Presto customer support has been prompt & very helpful . Turns out my problems were " user error " , and not a defective overpressure plug . Cooked a whole chicken with it last night and it was incredible . Highly recommend this pressure cooker .
5 #### I bought 2 of these and I love them . Our main source of heat is a wood stove . The heaters help keep our rooms warmer .
5 #### I use this to sharpen my kitchen knives , I can tell the difference for sure after using this .
5 #### It works great or should I say better than great . Ease of use is amazing . Great product and I would recommend it to my friends .
3 #### I built my own home and installed Dexter door handles and hardware throughout the house . The look is contemporary and attractive , not gaudy . But ......... I've had to replace the deadlatch in the set for the door between the house and garage 4 times in 10 years . I question the quality of the internal hardware . My parents were in their home 44 years and never once had to replace any of the door hardward or deadlatches ...... they were made by Weiser .
4 #### Got this on a whim when I ordered the garden gloves . Not a bad scoop for light work . Fiskars makes some good stuff and this does not disappoint .
5 #### We use this weekly- it 's a good , well priced pizza wheel and about what you would expect from OXO .
5 #### Easy to install and work as originals did . Nothing to complain about . Will see how long they last .
5 #### Love this tool ! Saves literally hundreds in buying a huge beam saw ... plus cuts deeper ! Designed well and quality built . Easy to install . It just stayed on my old back - up Skil - saw , so it 's ready to go . Love it !
5 #### These work great . They do stink , especially after a month . Then you toss em . They catch a ton of flies tho . I have horses chickens , cats , dogs .
5 #### works well . Used it only a couple of time as yet .
5 #### Thi of the kit is tailored to the needs associated with a woodworking shop . I find nothing wrong with any component of this kit . Quick clean up is the outcome of using this kit . There is a tool for every need and each is of high quality .
5 #### Great and keeps flies on opposite side of the yard . Flies are drawn away from people areas . Excellent price compared to box stores .
5 #### Received batteries as stated and was able to get the batteries charged and in use within 24 hours . It was great to stay on the project timeline with ordering batteries on Amazon .
5 #### I do n't use a whisk too often but needed to replace ours since it was rusting . I own other OXO products so I decided to get this .
5 #### Makes great coffee , with no grounds in the coffee . Do n't worry about the noises when you first turn it on . We purchased this for a 5 - day - a - week service to about 30 people . The stated minimum brew amount is 40 cups , so if you only want a small quantity of coffee , this is not your machine .
2 #### My wife bought me this for a Christmas present - And I thought she loved me ! The instructions are the absolute worst instructions I 've ever attempted to follow - and I write repair documentation for a living . The sheet that the instructions come on is minuscule - and it 's multi - lingual to boot . The " drawings " are about the size of a matchbook cover - and almost as clear . It took me almost 35 minutes to figure out how to even open this piece of equipment - and the assembly instructions might as well have been written in Martian ! Parts are NOT clearly identified ; They must think that everyone who is going to assemble this workbench must already be " Tim the Toolman . " Having never owned one of these workbenches before and NOT being a carpenter or mechanic , this will take several hours to try to assemble and that 's even by using the horrible instructions . I might be better off not trying to read the instructions and just figure out the assembly by common sense . My wife did purchase the " Amazon Frustration - Free packaging " and maybe the standard Black & Decker box would have helped - I do n't know . I just know that the included multi - lingual instruction sheet is a JOKE ! Black and Decker - YOU NEED TO WRITE THE INSTRUCTIONS IN AMERICA , NOT CHINA ! And include a " real " Instruction Manual .
4 #### I do n't know how useful this is but I m glad I bought it and it is so cute ! Definitely excited to use it for the holiday season
5 #### I bought this thin kerf blade for my ancient 1 - 1/2hp Craftsman table saw after being so impressed with Freud's&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Freud - D0724X - Diablo-7 - 1 - 4 - Inch-24 - Tooth - ATB - Carbide - Framing - Saw - Blade - with-5 - 8 - Inch - and - Diamond - Knockout - Arbor / dp / B00006407Q / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Freud D0724X Diablo 7 - 1/4 - Inch 24 Tooth ATB Carbide Framing Saw Blade with 5/8 - Inch and Diamond Knockout Arbor</a>&nbsp;and it 's six and a half inch cousin on my circular saws . I can say I am impressed and have purchased the < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Freud - LU79R010 - Thin - Kerf - Ultimate - Plywood - Melamine - Saw - Blade-10 - inch - x-80t - Hi - ATB-5 - 8 - inch - arbor - Perma - Shield - Coated / dp / B000GJTIIK / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Freud LU79R010 Thin Kerf Ultimate Plywood & Melamine Saw Blade 10 inch x 80 t Hi - ATB 5/8 inch arbor Perma - Shield Coated</a>&nbsp;to compliment it .

From the reviews it looks as I could have saved my money and just bought the one blade as well as saved myself time changing blades for each cut !
5 #### This is just fine . I use it some , but I kind of prefer steeping loose tea and then pouring through a strainer .
4 #### Good alternative for a tools - free quick connect to a gas grill or other propane fueled device . The quick connect can be a bit hard for a person with a weak grip to engage and disengage . Perhaps this is plus if you have kids around . The hose is 10 ' long , not 4 ' as stated in the ad when I purchased the item . The flexible hose is vulnerable to being chewed by squirrels and raccoons to the point of leaking gas . I have replaced two hoses because of the forest critters . I have now sleeved the hose in flexible blue plastic electrical conduit to stop the damage .
1 #### I do n't know why i bought this but i did ! Actually i know why it was the marketing . Do nt believe everyting you read or even see . Not under any conditions could you possibly get a harvest like they show never this needs constant watering and maintenance just not worth a second look its just a fad nothing more nothing less
4 #### Hella funny . my friends always play with these when they come over .
4 #### It would n't be too difficult to design a wider cutting blade that would create a wider ' trench ' ( although the motor might need some beefing up to handle the additional load ) and it would be great if it was easier to get more depth too ( it 's possible but requires a little backyard re - engineering ) . It 's worth what it costs , though ... I'm basically satisfied .
5 #### Lightweight but strong net . Still early this winter but it appears it will hold up well .
4 #### I have purchased this same product before ...... had to replace due to unit coming up missing from storage .
5 #### I use these for mosquitos and fungus gnats . For fungus gnats in my potted plants and raised beds I sprinkle these on the dirts surface and water like usual . Outdoor and indoor ! I use these on all seed starting set ups . For mosquitoes I put these in any standing water , especially saucers of my potted plants . Anywhere that breeds mosquitoes I sprinkle these ..... standing water , mud etc .
1 #### I missed my return window as I kept giving this more and more chances . It does not keep the water open . It stays a slushy mess that the birds wo n't drink from . I live in Massachusetts ; our weather is difficult at times . This does not meet my expectations . I wish I had returned it earlier .
5 #### This is a genuine Weber cover and fits the specific grill , perfectly . It is an excellent product for the following reasons : 1 . It remains pliable / supple even in cold weather 2 . Exact / proper fit 3 . Has a vent system to avoid condensation under the cover 4 . It has lasted several years without any signs of hardening , tearing or fading . It is very UV resistant 5 . Has velcro tabs at the bottom to form a tight fitting skirt in case of high wind conditions It is not inexpensive but in this case , you get what you pay for ! Like all Weber products , it is an excellent product . Jim
5 #### Does n't leak and operates smoothly , what more can you ask . The quality seems to be heavy duty . I would purchase it again .
4 #### Heavy duty and easy to use with practice . This is not a sander that needs to be forced , just gently controlled . Practice with it first on something that does n't matter because it is a real wood eater .
5 #### The goldfinches love it . They seem to eat all day ; I hope they know not to eat too much !
1 #### The julienne head was unusable . The blades were missing . This upset me . Not the kind of upset you get when you realize that Barney Frank will never be held accountable for the Fannie & Freddy financial meltdown ; but upset nonetheless .
5 #### Using it for the first time but so far it has met all of my expectations .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R2736AQ18CNIO9 " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / C1E59lq6RBS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/711bbbL2%2BIS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">After someone gave us one of these feeders at work , I was amazed to see just how many Hummingbirds it attracts . ( Even in the winter ! ) At first I was n't ready to invest too much money for a feeder at home not knowing if I would get any activity , so I originally purchased this one on sale for only $ 3.82&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Garden - Jewels-453 - 2 - 10 - Ounce - Glass - Hummingbird - Feeder / dp / B00004ZAW3 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Garden Jewels 453 - 2 10 - Ounce Glass Hummingbird Feeder</a > . If you read my review there , you 'll see I had Hummingbirds the very first morning after placing it outside . Because I have been so pleased with this particular feeder at work , I decided to get one for home to use as a second feeder . The biggest difference with the two are their size . One holds 10 ounces and this one holds 30 ounces . I keep the smaller one just outside my kitchen window so that I 'm reminded to fill it more often and the larger unit I have placed over in my side garden . I have added a video to show a couple of my visitors . When Perky Pet labels this " Our Best " , I do have to agree !
5 #### Cuts smooth and clean . Vast improvement over the cheapies I had been using
5 #### Good quality mesh . It keep the chicken coop save . Will buy again when needed .
5 #### As a man working in the trades , I do n't know if you can find a better quality hand tool than those made by Klein . I have been using their hand tools for almost 40 years .
3 #### This collection bag works best for me with a 40 tooth blade in dry wood . I 'm using on a Bosch 4100 table saw and find it less useful when cutting dados or rabbets or ripping in moist wood . There is simply not enough positive pressure generated in the lower blade housing to fill it . So give it a try but keep your shop vac or push broom .
4 #### These are typically replacement bulbs for undercabinent lights . They work just fine & are very reasonably priced .
1 #### Stay away from this bit -- I usually buy Freud but I could not find any set up instructions for the bit . The manufacturer would not even consider a return because I was over the 30 day return policy . I assume they knew full well that the bit was very difficult to set up and doing so takes a lot of stock and time . I will continue to buy Freud but never from this supplier again .
5 #### An excellent salad spinner that operates smoothly . I especially enjoy the little brake for the basket .
4 #### I Was looking for replacement batterie for a B&D 2920torque screwdriver . Ordered batterie , receivedon time . Charged new battery for 24 hours and everything is ok
4 #### First of all these are not the American made drivers in the photo but at just over 15 $ for the set that 's no surprise . More often than not with tools you get what you pay for but with this set I feel you get a little more . The tips on these drivers definitely reflect the low price but they are not too bad . Like most handyman / diy junkies I have a drawer full of screwdrivers of various styles but I bought this set because I like this type of handle the most . Although it does n't feel the same as my classic Stanley / Klein drivers its close , fits my hand very well , and has a nice solid feel for when you really need to crank down . Overall I am very happy with the purchase and feel they are a solid choice for the money ...
5 #### second time I ordered it , no need to say more .
5 #### Used this chain to clear a large oak tree that fell during the recent storm . Great item that stayed sharp through most of the heavy cutting . Tree was about 40 " across and a lot of work . Highly recomment this item .
2 #### I do n't know why anyone would need this . Does n't do what it 's designed to well enough to justify its drawer space . Pros : - It does work , though not with the miraculous ease other reviewers suggest - prevents garlic smelling hands ( though you 'd probably end up having to touch the garlic to chop it anyway , so garlicky hands are unavoidable to some extent ) - pretty easy to clean Cons : - Needs to use some force . The silicone is not very sticky ( a little slippery ) so unless you press a little hard nothing happens to the garlic skin - A pain to use for many cloves of garlic . Little papery garlic skins get stuck after a while and the roller loses what little stickiness it had to begin with . Then you need to clean and dry this thing out to continue using . - Much more time consuming than smashing the garlic with the flat side of a knife - Uni - function . Literally does not have a single other useful purpose in the kitchen . I 've tried to open jars with it ( does n't work , too slippery ) , use it as a potholder in a pinch ( rolls around , barely avoided a burn ) , and as a nonslip trivet ( too narrow )
5 #### I bought this after using buddy 's aviation snips that he had it for over 2 decades and he still uses it cut thin aluminum and steel with it .
5 #### we have had about 2 huge salads a week since we got this . my entire family loves this and it 's worked much better than other 's we have bought and scrapped in the past . I really love this spinner ! ! ! ! we use the bowl as a salad bowl too and it 's just so handy ! ! !
5 #### This Axe is just awesome , splitting rounds 20 + inches across 14 + inches in hight within 3 - 4 strikes . With my other Axe I tried for 20 mins to split the same log , then the head started to become loose , that s why i am at this point , new axe and less work . This will be the last Axe i 'll ever own too , lifetime guarantee , if it breaks that is . The Axe is so light , weighing half of my old one , Had a branch sticking out of a piece of log , inch and a half across , Split the wood then hacked its way through the branch , i am amazed and very happy . Seen these in Stores at $ 55 so price here is cool an free delivery , ca n't go wrong . I brought the hatchet also , another awesome chopping machine .
4 #### sharp , seems like solid construction , little on the light side ( compared to a much more expensive knife ) . I take care of my knife set so I ca n't say how they will do in the dishwasher but for hand washing it seems like this will last .
5 #### seemed like a good price for an original battery part - I have used it a couple of times already and it works great
1 #### DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM . It had the wrong bolt sizes with it , the holes did not line up . I had to purchase the correct hardware from HD to get this piece of junk together , and drill out the metal . Do n't waste your time , DELTA should be kicked in the teeth for selling this .
4 #### This has worked well . Based on other reviews , I knew that it was specifically made for one purpose and would n't fit a standard box . I was able to modify it so that it would work in a standard box , and I 'm very pleased with it .
5 #### These little brushes will come in handy for many things other than cleaning a hummingbird feeder . Was happy to see them listed on line .
5 #### i do a lot of baking , and i love this product . they scoop , which makes it nice when you 're getting something from a canister or straight from the bag . it 's nice having the 2/3 and 3/4 measuring cups as well . i would buy these again and recommend them .
4 #### For my short fingers it 's a little hard to get a grip to spin the top .
4 #### A great improvement over using a table knife . It a serrated edge for cutting that I would have preferred not being there as I use it strictly for spreading . Others may find that feature useful .
5 #### Exactly what I had in mind , and could not find anywhere . I use this item to turn on / off my American flag lighting as required by the National Flag Code . This setting is dusk to dawn . It can also be programmed to turn on / off in accordance with the time of day . Very versatile and durable .
5 #### I do not have a Warner Ladder and was not sure the product would work . I installed the levelers according to the directions on my 20 ft extension ladder and they work great . The directions were easy to follow even though my ladder was not listed in the instructions . The levelers make it very easy to set up the ladder on level or uneven ground . It was one of the best investments I have ever made .
4 #### Works most of the time ; sometimes ice cream wo n't release .
5 #### This little pot makes a great cup of coffee . We us it camping and with a colmen stove . So far so good .
5 #### Great pockets screws . Work great in soft wood which I use a lot . Stick with the fine ones for hard wood .
5 #### This is a great tool that will get those stripped or rounded nuts , bolts or screws off with minimal effort and they are way better than a pair of regular vice grips .
5 #### I 've had one of these for years and love it . Gave one to a friend for Christmas and she also loves it .
5 #### compost tea , just dump it around your plants ... you ca nt go wrong
5 #### Used it to remove a bunch of moulding w/o destroying the moulding like I would have using a regular prybar . Used it to remove finish nails that were buried too deep to get a hammer claw to pull them . Used it to pull out nails that were missing heads . Hey , wait a minute ! This is exactly what the product description says it does . Yep , works as advertised . Amazing :-) Wish I had known they made 10 " and 11 " inch models ( the ... page for this item does n't crosslink those other models ) . There were a few times when I wish I had more leverage and the 10 " model is only 2 bucks more .
5 #### Have n't used this particular bottle yet , thiugh in the past , the results of this product are outstanding ! Use early and often , but in small does , half the recommended amount . All types of plants , there is n't a plant in my house or yard thst does n't got a does of this . 100 satisfaction
4 #### Milwaukee makes a good blade . The only complaint is the high cost of product .
3 #### I purchased these on the strength of the Henckles name . That was a mistake . The construction does not lend itself to heavy use and over time the blades do not meet with the precison necessary to create clean edged cuts . Anyone who uses shears with uncooked ingredients knows that this is unacceptable . I am going to look for a good pair of all stainless steel commercial style shears .
5 #### There have been some reviews complaining that their plate was not lockable , but my plate was infact a lockable plate . It was made for my saw , so it obviously fit perfectly . Nothing to complain about for me on this one .
5 #### It works great on veggies , including corn . Very easy to hold . It can go in the dishwasher , too , for a quick wash . Nice brush .
4 #### Werner says these wo n't fit their multi function ladders , but with a persistence and muscle it does fit on and will protect your wall paint from the scuff marks that those multi - ladders leave . Note : I ordered 1 pair and it protects the wall , but now when I use the ladder as a step ladder one side is higher - I am going to order a second pair to put on the other end of the ladder to even this out .
5 #### This basic accessory set is a perfect match for my Dewalt Wet / Dry battery powered portable vac . The flat nozzle is nicely sized and is short enough to be useful for cleaning in tight vehicle locations like under the pedals . The round brush is well made with dense bristles , and the " wide " nozzle is small enough for tight spaces and also is well designed with leading edge slots and a trailing edge brush . All three pieces use the industry - standard 1.25 inch tapered " Shop - Vac " friction connection and fit my battery - powered ( 18 volt ) Dewalt as well a my AC powered Sears and Shop - Vac large vacs reducers . They seem to be made of " above average " quality plastic and unlike some inexpensive vac accessories these DO have exactly the right taper to provide a snug , airtight fit on " standard " hoses and extension tubes . In other words they do exactly what they 're intended to do and are of high - enough quality to last a long time .
1 #### Do n't buy it ! The material is cheap and I 'm afraid it will break any minute also it 's absolutely impossible to remove the cork after if you have used it .
5 #### Has peanuts , corn and many items the squirrels love . And at a great unit price too ! !
1 #### What exactly does stainless mean ? How about dishwasher safe ? I think that means you can put it in the dishwasher and it wo n't come out with rust spots , but that 's what it does every time . Nice concept , cheap execution .
1 #### It worked for a few times at first . And now it 's virtually impossible to remove stuck popovers from this pan . It 's the gracious replacement pan from Williams Sonoma after the first pan hopelessly clung to each popover too . The instructions were followed to the letter with the same stuck results . It appears the " non - stick " finish might disappear with use . Vegetable spray and chunks of butter as directed did n't resolve the issue . Perhaps there is a pick and shovel popover removal tool that should be included . Will return it .
5 #### Bought this to use a few times a year , mainly when we go on vacation to the beach . I had to read the manual and it took some use to get the hang of the different settings . But it works very well ... the discriminator and depth / object indicator works well and is pretty accurate . It allows you to bypass junk and only dig up wanted items . I have found some jewelry and many coins ( no old ones ) with it . I am by no means a serious metal detector person , but this is perfect for the casual user .
5 #### Works well . Comfortable handle . Requires some force . No assembly is required .
5 #### I love having a stainless pressure cooker ! I had an aluminum one years ago - and I like this much better . My favorite pressure project is to cook chickens or packages of leg quarters to bone out and freeze to have inexpensive & healthy chicken for casseroles and one - dish meals . The pressure cooker does exactly what it should and does it quite well , too .
1 #### 1 . The tie broke as soon as we put it on the pool 2 . The holes in the cover allow everything you 'd want to cover your pool from , inside , with no way of draining or taking the top off without getting inside the pool . 3 . Cheaply made 4 . Would not purchase again .
3 #### This tool is to hard to set up , and I can cut in a hinge just as fast with a wood chisel and sharp knife . If I had several doors to do at one time , then I think it is more practical to use
5 #### Overall I like it . If I was using this for sprouts , I 'd give it 5 stars . Near 100 % germinations rate . However , if using this for microgreens , I 'd take into consideration that this is a seed mix . What this means is that there are 5 types of seeds , and each type will have their own growth rate . So , you 're microgreens tray will have plants that are all over the place in terms of size . Deciding when to harvest is not as straight forward decision . I 'd recommend using single type of seed for microgreens .
4 #### Good , but damn I did n't need this much ! I guess I 'll use it eventually !
5 #### Very handy , size is great but everytime I use , it seems to take a little bit more finish off . That is a shame because it is so sturdy and is such a good size . I would still recommend this to anyone who is tired of drips all over the counter . As always , shipping from Amazon is amazingly fast .
5 #### I use this gun in wiring cars . The 260 watts does a good job of soldering heavy wiring . Be sure to keep the tips securely tightened for best service . I recommend this gun .
5 #### worked as replacement for my 24 volt ridgid flashlight , awesome and fast shipping
5 #### Love all the oxo products . This is a great whisk .
4 #### as with most dremel products it works as advertised and is a useful tool to have . i do recommend dripping some light silicone oil ( kroil oil is the best i 've found ever ) down the shaft periodically if you are in a corrosive air area of the usa .
5 #### Sprouted right away ( 5 - 7 days ) even without following the 24 hour pre - soak instructions . Will update at harvest .
5 #### These work good for cutting up pallets . Last longer than other blades I 've tried .
5 #### It is a little smaller than I though it would be , but I still like it . I may buy a second one
5 #### This is a wonderful item . Before I had this one ( and the same one in another size ) I only had plastic bowls . This one is so much better on alot of levels . First it is a wonderful , all around great size . Its substantial size makes it great for alot of mixing chores . Its easy to clean and maintain . And great for salads as it holds the temperature and the salads stay cold . My old plastic bowls were n't as study and had a tendancy to tip , did n't help with temerature reculation and were harder to clean ( tomato would stain it , you could n't use plastic as a make - shif double boiler , and it was hard to ever be sure any grease was off it , essential for whipping egg whites . this is a great item . They are n't bad for storage either as they nest . I would nt get any other bowls , at this point ...
5 #### Awesome extra large cooling rack can handle two dozen cookies or multiple cakes at a time . Nothing sticks and easy clean up .
5 #### I have had a pair of these before and loved them ! I get a nice clean cut and am able to cut branches up to 1/2 " with ease . The blades do n't wobble and it fits comfortably in my hand .
5 #### Makes a great little seat , keeps the contents dry . I store a 5gal bucket in here with my grilling tools and it fits perfectly with some room to the side for other stuff . This is great for us on our small balcony since it is both a seat and storage . It is sturdy enough to stand on , and it keeps the weather out well . Great value !
5 #### Having high electric bills we had to do something to decrease our electric consumption . This works very well . Hubby says it is real easy to set the times on the timer .
1 #### I was using an old juice king while visiting relatives and it is a great juice squeezer . I thought this would be the same but although the design is identical the function is not . The Metrokane does not have much leverage for squeeze the juice out and large citrus barely fits . I went back to my hand squeezer . The nice thing about the juice king is that you do not get all the pulp . Do n't waste your time and money . Lucky Amazon.com has a great return policy so I was able to return mine and credit my card . ai gave it a one star only becasue I had to give is something . The only redeeming is that it looks good.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Metrokane - Mighty - OJ - Home - Juicer - Orange - with - Chrome - Head - and - Handle / dp / B000EGJRKY / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Metrokane Mighty OJ Home Juicer - Orange with Chrome Head and Handle</a >
4 #### Had my jumper cables in back of SUV . This bag is much better because hides cables and looks better
5 #### GREAT SALAD SPINNER ! I LOVE THE FACT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO MANUALLY SPIN IT ... JUST PUSH THE BUTTON AND IT DOES ALL THE WORK . IT ALSO HAS A VERY NICE CLEAN LOOK .
2 #### We bought this to replace a cheapo ryobi circ saw . Worked great for a month . we cross cut a lot of hardwood moldings . just over a month later , its sitting on my desk smelling pretty burnt up . we 'll see what skill has to say
5 #### OXO products are some of the best kitchen utensils out there , in my opinion . The grip , which they 're known for , remains excellent . Size is great for individual uses and it creates a fine , small grate of food . Has nice rubber " feet " so you can put one end on the cutting board or plate and have it stay in place . We throw it in the dishwasher after every use and so far no degradation or rusting on the item .
1 #### I set the trap and made sure I had really fresh and strong batteries in it . I came back to find a day later the food gone , the trap blinking and no rodent . It did not work for me as they got the food and got away .
3 #### I like these bits , and would actually rate them a 3.5/5 if I could , but all three broke on me yesterday so I 'm a bit frustrated right now . They have been awesome at the job for probably two months now , and the work I do really puts them to the test . Two of the actual bits broke off while drilling into relatively soft wood ( albeit at an angle ) and the third one actually separated from itself and is now useless . I will say that compared to other countersink bits I 've purchased , they are awesome . Not once did the actual countersink come loose and I 've had no trouble with any adjustments . Other bits fall apart in your drill on the first use . I had one that the actual hex - chuck stripped itself and could never tighten or loosen another bit again .
4 #### I have had one of these for about ten years and only purchased another because the bees started robbing it and had lost the bee gaurds . Hummers have no trouble getting past them but bees and finches are kept out . The bottom is easy to overtighten and strip so some care must be taken there . Tighten until the threads just bottom out and it should last for years . Only real drawback is it 's kind of a pain to clean inside of bottle because of the shape .
4 #### A very fine blade as others have noted . I have used mine for about a year and noticed a few chipped teeth ( my fault , since I frequently resaw old lumber ) . I looked up the Forrest site , printed out a work order and sent the blade in for sharpening . I used U.S.P.S. Priority Mail ( $ 11.70 ) since I wanted quick turnaround . Blade was received by Forrest two days later . I waited around for a couple weeks and then Forrest calls me up to get the " security code " from the back of my card - which I provided . I asked when the blade would be shipped back . They stated either that day or the next . NOT . I received the blade a week later and the shipping label indicated they had not shipped until 3 days after I spoke with them . Turn around was 3 weeks . In the meantime , I purchased a cheaper ( $ 39.95 ) thin kerf Freud blade . It is just fine and I can buy 3 of them for the cost of 1 Forrest WWII and one sharpening . The Freud thin kerf cuts just as quickly with a nice finish . Forrest sharpening cost : $ 20.00 Outbound shipping : $ 11.70 Return shipping : $ 7.00 Total : $ 38.70 It is a good blade . Is it worth 2 or 3 times the cost of the Freud ? Not to me .
5 #### Make sure to add Teflon tape to the male side to make it slide . It 's a tight fit
4 #### The product is solid built and kept me safe when I climbed up on a 22 footer extension ladder . I took a star off due to its poor packaging when received . Also , there are scratches all over two square tubing wings .
5 #### We like the ease of purchase , and the bulb actually fit when we installed it . Surprise ! Love my under - the - counter lights . Thanks , Amazon .
5 #### The 750 is very simple to use and gives you clear and accurate readings for both pitch and slope . It is not the right tool for all slope angle measurements as it may not fit some tight spaces . I would like to have received a case and or protective bag for the device , even if it meant paying a little more for it .
5 #### The XtraFlex2 LED book light is light years ( no pun intended ) better than the old itty - bitty - type lights that used incandescent bulbs . The XtraFlex2 gets great battery life , unlike the the itty - bittys , which I found went through batteries like crazy . Of course , the LED " bulbs " do n't burn out like the itty - bitty blubs ( and the XtraFlex2 does n't heat up from its bulbs , either ) . The XtraFlex2 's integrated battery pack is also great ; no getting tangled up in a cord while you 're in bed . I stumbled on the XtraFlex2 at my local Borders . They had a bunch of them in a display when the final Harry Potter book was published ( presumably figuring that a lot of kids , little and big , were going to be doing a lot of reading in bed ... ) . The leftovers were sold at half price , a real bargain . I bought one , tried it out , loved it , and went back to buy several more for use as gifts ( and spares ) . Available in colors other than silver;&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mighty - Bright - XtraFlex2 - Light - Black / dp / B000TXZIDM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 Light - Black</a>,<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mighty - Bright - XtraFlex2 - Book - Craft - Clip - On - Light - Green / dp / B0013AK9ES / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 Book / Craft / Clip - On Light , Green</a>,<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mighty - Bright - XtraFlex2 - Book - Craft - Clip - On - Light - Pink / dp / B0013AG9QK / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 Book / Craft / Clip - On Light , Pink</a>,<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mighty - Bright - XtraFlex2 - Dual - Book - Craft - Clip - On - Light - Purple / dp / B0013AM3TC / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 Dual Book / Craft / Clip - On Light , Purple</a > , and&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Xtra - Flex-2 - LED - Book - Light - Blue / dp / B000OOSDU6 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Xtra Flex 2 LED Book Light , Blue</a > .
5 #### Finally a peeler that is comfortable to hold onto and does not slip away ! Thank You .
5 #### I already had one of these that I received as a wedding present a few years back . It was one of those things that was a suggested item to add to a registry . I was n't sure how much I 'd actually use it .... I use it ALL THE TIME . It 's so nice , and usually when we have people over we have more than one bowl of food to serve up . I kept thinking , I really need to buy another one ! It 's great for bringing to potlucks too , because it 's easy to serve yourself with just one hand using the tongs .
2 #### I was disappointed in this tool which a search for " Stanley Full Octagon Hammer " led me to . Not what I expected or hoped for , and over priced for what it is . The real full octagons are apparently no longer manufactured , and Stanley has followed the market to China . A real shame for a landmark American tool manufacturer .
5 #### Good price 4 a tool needed to set depth guides on my chain used 4 slabbing logs
1 #### After reading a review that said go to Ebay , I did and got 20 belts for $ 17.95 and free shipping from one of their highest rated sellers . They are bulk generic , just like these , but I have had good luck with generic . I have a bag type commercial model from Sams Club and I was told before buying it that it was notorious for breaking belts . Belt breakage is a small price to pay for the way the vacuum works . It was suggested by the carpet installer that did our house and he was right . No dust , clean carpet . I guess I drifted from reviewing the belts , but Walmart gets $ 3.50 for two belts and I got these for less than .50 apiece . Here is the link . [ ... ] Hate to do this to Amazon , but if you have a commercial bag type it will last years and you will save loads . If they turn out to be no good I will edit my post . Amazon is still the number one by far for my purchasing preference . Most of the time you ca n't beat the price and you will never beat their service , never . fredt
2 #### Does not work well for the price . i do not recommend it .
5 #### Best money you can spend in your shop . If you think about the cost of bags this thing will pay for itself in no time flat - even if you are cheap like me and reuse the bag as much as you can . Planing down some rough cut Poplar the other day - it was about 10 boards , 10 ' long and I took out 4 cans of trimmings out to the woods . So easy to take out . Most people have an old metal trash can you can sit this lid on . I have two for those rainy days .
5 #### Great product for frothing my lattes . Glass is rather " thin " so I figure you must be extremely careful or you 'll break it . Actually works better than my espresso machine 's steam wand.and does n't introduce additional water .
4 #### Very functional product that I have gotten a lot of good use out of . Blades have kept a sharp edge even with much use . Ver functional tool that has made small pruning much less of a chore and more a gardening happy task !
5 #### This really works wonderfully ! It kept the deer and the rabbits out of my garden with ease . So glad I bought it .
5 #### It really does n't kink ! I 'm in love . Makes watering a yard with 2 little kids underfoot so much easier and more pleasant .
5 #### The loop - back stop allows me to trim even thin amounts off of a long edge , with accurate cuts , due to the excellent fit into my DeWalt circular saw . Used it to trim about 3/16 inch from the bottom of 2 interior doors and worked great .
5 #### Works great and fits perfectly . Just what my shop vac needed .
5 #### nice tool was looking for a square longer then 12 " . good quality all metal not cheap plastic . 16 " square is the way to go , very handy in a 16 " length would say buy one not a 12 " square
3 #### I have the three inch version of this knife and , while the handle is durable and comfortable , the blade does not hold its edge as I would expect from a knife in this price range .
5 #### Not as functional as suggested , but is still something you need when routing .
5 #### I 've had the opportunity to use many different belt sanders over the years . This one is hands down the best one you can buy . Superb engineering , and design , coupled with flawless manufacturing produces this gem . You simply ca n't go wrong with this sander . I especially like the variable speed feature . This thoughtful feature makes it possible to adjust your at load speeds which helps with softer material . An architect friend and I have used these sanders on many materials including wood . The 3X21 model is this boys little brother , which I found to be a benefit when I need to work upside down . If you 're looking for a belt sander , this one will keep you happy .
5 #### My hose hangs out on it . The hose appears happy
5 #### Best price and these are exactly what you would get in the big box stores for less .
1 #### What I received is NOT what is pictured or described in the listing . Do not purchase this if you 're expecting a genuine Ryobi blade like what is pictured . I received a scratched up grey OEM blade that was not in any kind of retail packaging . It is stamped / embossed with " 375 301 " which per search on the internet is a STENS edger blade . * * Update 8/2015 - After this blade wore out , I ordered a 4 pack of edger blades instead at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UBG88S?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00 It turns out the 4 pack blades were the EXACT same blade that I paid 10 bucks for here . So you can either order 1 blade for 10 bucks here , or go order the 4 pack and get 4 times the number of blades for the same price ... See attached photo , the worn out blade is what I ordered here " Ryobi Trimmer Plus Add - On Edger Replacement Blade 613223 ( Discontinued by Manufacturer ) " and the new blade is one of the ones that came with " 4 Pack , Edger Blades Replace Ryobi 613223 , Echo 720 - 237 - 001 , Stihl 4133 - 713 - 4101 , Maruyama 216062 . Green Machine 237001 " Hope this saves someone from getting ripped off like I did with this item ! !
1 #### I felt confused about the four /five star review for this pressure cooker . It has rust spot after short usage . and it leaks pressure very soon .
5 #### I bought a bunch of individual Oxo SteeL utensils and love them all . They feel substantial in the hand and I think they 'll last a good long time .
5 #### This Knife is all one piece , so bending and breaking is n't an issue . It has stayed sharp quite a bit longer then other knives we own . ( I found this out the hard way by cutting myself ) I definitely recommend this high quality knife which seems to be more reasonably priced then many of the competing knives .
5 #### Back in the day , moms all had pressure cookers and made beef stews and pot roasts in them . These cookers are being rediscovered and are making a big comeback as they 're not just for stew any more . Hundreds of new recipes are appearing and Amazon has some really good pressure cooker cookbooks available . We recently bought this Presto 4 qt . size ( just for 2 of us ) but larger sizes are available . Mom was right , they are FAST , make delicious food and will impress guests . They 're not expensive - give this a try , you wo n't be disappointed .
3 #### I read an article about the Bialetti and wanted to give it a try . The quality and the design is awesome . It 's very simple and it 's easy to clean . However , the coffee it produces actually does not taste all that great . It 's not technically espresso but the result is not really " coffee " either . It 's something in between . It produces a coffee that is very strong which is fine but the overall flavor is hard to describe . I use a French Press for my daily coffee and it 's the best tasting coffee I 've tried to make at home . I was hoping that this would allow me to make lattes at home but it falls way short . I thought that it would have to be seasoned so I made at least 10 batches but the tastes never improved and it 's been sitting in a cabinet ever since .
3 #### Mine arrived broken . It was n't a big deal so I glued it and used it . The suction cups do not hold on too long , it could be because my kitchen sink is brushed stainless steel , I 'm not sure . The plastic is thin and brittle . For the price , you get what you pay for . But if cost is not a problem , they make better quality ones .
4 #### Looks fine , but the plastic bottom makes me think it wo n't last more than a single season .
1 #### The item would seal and all of the tea leaves dumped in my mug . Tried it once and threw in the garbage .
4 #### Works well . I would prefer a non carriage bolt on the pivot though .
5 #### Been using these bulbs for 5 years . Successful flowering bulb that seems to work as well for me as the expensive ones .
5 #### Very happy with these . I have 5 different plant pruning scissors and these are by far the best for their size . Better than ones i have that are 4x the price . I intend to buy another pair . Highly recommended ,
5 #### We always eat the popovers at the Macy 's restaurant and I longed to make these for a long time . I purchased this pan and followed a popover recipe and they turned out absolutely perfect ! The popovers were large and fluffy ! The pan is non stick and so easy to wash up . So happy that I purchased it .
2 #### Not meant to cut 1/2 " plywood . This is more for drywall or think particleboard . They will burn the material you are cutting . Kind of a waste of money .
4 #### This little switch key is an item you never think about until you need it . We had a good lamp - it worked just fine . Loved the style . And somewhere along the way we lost the on - off key . There was just the tiny threaded bolt where the switch knob was supposed to be . While this is n't necessarily my first choice in terms of overall style , it was a lot better than the black plastic which was my only other option . This is a very pale gold , just a fraction of a shade away from silver . If Westinghouse had offered it in brushed steel or silver I 'd have ordered that . Since they did n't , this was as good as I could get , and it works well so I 'm good . It just screws onto the switch post of the lamp , then you use the key - end of the toggle to turn the lamp on and off . Simple solution , small item , and it saved us tossing an expensive mid - century lamp into the trash . I 'm tempted to get a few more of these simply to have them on hand , because you ca n't find them just anywhere . I 'd recommend this for everyone 's repair toolbox . It 's a small item , but when you need it you need it .
5 #### These are everything advertised . Great leverage when cutting . Well worth the money .
5 #### Installed to a 25 year old Craftsman 10 " . Took a lttle time to get it just right , but now I do enjoy using my saw . Amazing .
4 #### I 've used these for years . A little pricey on Amazon , but there 's no way I 'm going to HD for one of these by itself ! Just assume that you 'll need some lubricant to slip the insert into the hose . Do n't waste your time just trying to force it on . I 've been surprised that I 've never stripped one of these before . They seem to be a quality product that lasts forever , and is very easy to install . They even have the combo screw heads so you can go flat or Phillips . MUCH better than going out and buying a new hose .
5 #### Got it from Amazon for $ 35.99 ( with 20 % off on top of Friday sales price ) for my work bench in the garage . Pro : 1 . Low profile . Does not add too much hight to my work bench . 2 . Easy to operate . 3 . Sturdy and flexible for resizing . Con : Not major flaw . Just to be a little picky . The manual is not fool - proof and some people will sure get lost at the very beginning . Just to read the manual couple of times and you will know what it is talking about . During installation , do not tighten up all nuts till you have successfully placed your equipment on this universal base . The fitting may take 1 or 2 trial - and - error . In all , I am very happy with this product . Now I can move my work bench easily in my garage . Even thought reading the manual takes some efforts , I still give this product the whole credit .
5 #### Awesome stickers ! ! ! ! Strong adhesive however if you decide to remove it or use it to seal a envelope they do n't rip and can reseal easily .
5 #### Very nice knife . I bought it for my girlfriend 's son for scouts . Small enough for an eight year old 's hands to learn the basics of knife safety and to whittle with . If properly taken care of should last a lifetime . Tiny enough to loose so be mindful of it 's size . Adults should get a Med or Large depending on what you want to do .
5 #### Oxo is synonymous with quality this wisk is a good staple for any kitchen at an affordable price .
5 #### Love hummingbirds . I added this to my feeders in patio .
5 #### I wipe it clean with a damp paper towel when using to cool / cut my homemade loaves of bread ( that I make twice a week in my Hamilton Beach Bread Machine ) . Daily , I keep our adjustable clear bread box on top and when we want bread , pull out the loaf and we can slice it with no problem . This is a keeper .
1 #### Useless . The ' zapper ' stays engaged so long as there is a battery in it . Save your money . We had a rat infestation a few years ago and we tried everything : this product , several poisons , snap - traps and glue traps . The glue traps , with some small help from the snap traps and an even smaller contribution , did the job . Just place them along the walls ( rats run along walls ) and you 'll get them . No bait required b / c this way you get them in transit .
5 #### WOW ... just WOW ... even the cracks in my walls have air gushing through them when i turn this bad boy on to suck all the air out the house
5 #### This item appears to be an OEM product , based on the box it came in and the appearance of the item itself . Installation was a little tight , but I carefully pushed and pulled all the way around the rubber gasket with my fingers ( I do n't recommend using any tool that might damage the gasket ) as I kept a gentle pressure on the cylinder , and just when I was about to give up and put it back in the box ... the gasket slipped over the lip and the filter was in place . So patience and care while installing the filter is a necessity . On the the other hand , the tight fit makes for a good seal between the filter and the underside of the vacuum 's top , so that 's a good thing . Then just screw on the retainer nut ( you did keep that when you removed the old filter , did n't you ? ) , and you 're good to go .
5 #### Great filter . It works very well and lasts a long time . I use this filter behind another filter in a shop made dust collector .
5 #### I love OXO Good Grips products and have several . I wanted a meat tenderizer so went with a trustworthy brand . The utensil is well built , good looking ( stainless and black ) and has a good weight . Wish it was dishwasher safe , but that is okay . I really like that it has a textured size and a flat side . It works perfect and I would highly recommend .
5 #### so far has been great and not fallen apart or become dull to where it does not open the cans ! ! ! !
5 #### Always handy to have 1 or 2 of these around .
5 #### Great for cleaning out thermal mug tops and coffee maker parts . Bendable so you can get into tight spots .
5 #### Performs very well . As noted in other reviews , the extra torque has both positive and negatives . The positive is that it cuts quickly and easily those oversized branches . The negative is that it must be opened very wide to use it properly . It can be a bit difficult in tight spaces , especially for a small woman .
5 #### You will not find a better hammer than Estwing . The duriablity is unmatched . This 16 ounce has a great balance and swing for everyday use . ( I also have the 22 ounce framing which is my favorite of their line - up . ) I prefer the straight claw as I find it easier to pull nails in tight corners . The handle is the best in the industry ; no question whatsoever . You will not get the hammer fatigue nearly as quickly using an Estwing
5 #### Love ! An essential for using the Pizza Pizazz ( http://www.amazon.com/Presto-03430-Pizzazz-Plus-Rotating/dp/B00005IBXJ ) . An essential for baking . Buy several of them . They cut to size easily with normal scissors , they wash up quickly and easily . And most importantly they stop everything from sticking to anything you put them on . I highly recommend them not only for baking but also to use as a placemat for babies , crafting on with glue ( peels right off ) , as shelf liners in small containers you keep in the fridge with sticky things ( like condiments ) , in a makeup drawer ( washes so easily ) . These are n't just for baking . They are for anything where you want things to be easily cleaned up .
5 #### THIS NEW BLADE HAS MADE MY LAWN MOWER 'S ENGINE WORK MUCH EASIER . THIS PURCHASE ALLOWS ME TO NOT HAVE TO SHARPEN THE BLADE UNTIL NEXT YEAR UNLESS I HIT ANOTHER TREE STUMP .
1 #### I finally got to use this pot tonight , it was to make large batches of spaghetti sauce to freeze . Well it scorched on the bottom even on low heat . It is no better than the cheap pot I bought at Fred Meyer , maybe worse . I am very disappointed in this stockpot ! If you were boiling water maybe it would be great , but for making sauces forget it !
5 #### It works surprising well . I 'm still on the first one , and it sure makes cleaning the GF grill a lot easier .
5 #### Love this little vacuum . Works great for quick small clean up jobs in kitchen . Over time the battery the battery does nt hold charge
2 #### Did n't catch any rats while my spring - loaded traps caught over a dozen .
5 #### This was a great Christmas gift for my mother . She really enjoyed cooking her Christmas cakes in it . She said they were perfect everytime .
5 #### I been using this at least every other week now for about a year and it still works great .
5 #### I have decided to learn to be a home baker since I am retired and was looking for something to sift flour for making bread and so far I could not be happier for this is an extremely well constructed and does the job perfectly despite it being made in China .
5 #### This is exactly as I expected . Good weight , nice overall size for functionality .
5 #### This works great ! I have medium sized water feature and pond that was full of string algae , So I used the whole gallon . Next day the pond was clear ! The fish are still alive and well .
5 #### This is the second season and this valve works great . After spending a lot of money on those timers that screw onto the outside faucet that work for a single season and then break , this one works without any problems and I highly recommend it to anyone serious about long term watering needs .
5 #### These baking sheets work perfectly in my toaster oven . I have n't turned on my oven in months and and I can make all my favorite cookies and hors d'oeuvres .
3 #### Amazing ! I can actually enjoy my patio again . Easy to set up and was effective almost immediately . UPDATE : Still thankful , but there are some negatives . You 'll have to add water periodically if placed in direct sun . No big deal . Effectiveness lessens over time ... I'd recommend replacing every 2 - 3 weeks , depending on how bad your fly problem is . Thought about buying the reusable kind , but the cost of the attractant is no less expensive ; so it 's a lot less hassle but a bit wasteful on the environment to by the disposables .
5 #### Installs fast . Works great . Makes putting the fence away a bit more difficult .
4 #### I received these is a very timely manor and was greatly surprised how they worked in the application that I was using them in . I have used other " off branded " blades which did n't do near as well as these have . For reference purposes I will never give a 5 star rating since that to me means perfection and we all have room to improve .
4 #### Nice large pan which can hold lots apples for processing applesauce as well as making large quantites of soup !
5 #### august 27 , 2013 . have used it for a while now . it really works . this particular sander really spreads the dust around . good dust collector is important
5 #### Talk about awesome popover pans ... these have given rise to ours like no other pan ever has ... highly recommend if you 're a popover freak like us ... even consider 2 !
5 #### Love this sprinkler . It has several ways to adjust the water direction and flow to target certain areas of the yard .
3 #### I wish it had stronger whisk . it is the right size , but kind of flimsy to whisk . I needed the plastic for Emeril pans .
1 #### I have the equivalent Ortho bug killer but wanted something specific to ants . I 'm taking this Bayer product back to the store . I wonder how can a company as big as Bayer produce something this poor ? Not only does it hardly kill anything but the dispenser is the worst I have ever used . I would have preferred a pump sprayer over this one . It has a tiny switch that takes a lot of force to turn it on and then it hardly sprays . Do n't waste your money . This year I am using Spectracide 's ant killer that has a simple trigger pump sprayer and not only does the sprayer work just fine but the product definitely kills ants . I have tried it on black ants , red ants and whatever else is around and in every case it worked .
5 #### Bought this as a hostess gift for a friend who has a set of Henckels knives but had no bread knife . It 's a nice size , good balance you can feel when picked up , and not overwhelmingly long as many bread knives are . She was thrilled !
1 #### Vacuum motor revved and got hot 3 minutes into using it in a flat rug . Sent back promptly . Hose is cheap and will not last . Do n't bother with this one .
5 #### I recently purchased this from Amazon at a great price . The price of this vacuum varies widely from place to place and this was the best price . This little vacuum could suck the paint off of walls . It 's powerful ! It 's light and well build for the price . The only thing I would have wanted additionally is a retractable cord . My guess is that I 'll have this little workhorse for some time . I 'm a 64 year old female who owns 4 dogs and a cat and I live in a two story house . The effectiveness and weight of the vacuum are important features for me and this one delivers in both categories . I wrote a previous review on this item but it was n't detailed enough . I depend greatly on the reviews of others who have purchased and used products I 'm considering buying . I hope this helps you .
1 #### cheap , not much power to feel the breeze at all .
5 #### I am very satisfied with this item ! I recommend this to anyone .
5 #### Gets my greens nice and dry so I can put them in the fridge without them wilting ! Great for salad prep ! ! Difficult to keep the large bowl clean without water spots though !
4 #### This fit get into a small boiler over we just bought . It cleans up nicely as well . The price was great on Amazon and with Amazon Prime you can not beat it .
5 #### Just what I needed . Perfect fit , great price and fast shipping .
4 #### This thing works great , it fits a whole head of lettuce and the spinner is easy to use / stop . My only complaint is that the outer plastic bowl is very rigid and cracks easily when dropped .
5 #### Bought this as a gift for one of my sons who likes to cook . I 've started him on a good knife collection and figured this was the next step . I 've owned one for years now and love it . I keep it on the counter with nothing in front of it so that I can give whatever knife I 'm going to use a few swipes for each cutting session . I 's super easy to use and it will quickly become second nature to just swipe your knife before you use it . You 'll be glad you did . It makes cutting through anything like slicing through butter . I have not noticed any thinning of the blades of my knives even though I 've used it for quite a few years now so I have nothing but unqualified praise for this appliance . My husband and I had researched knife sharperners extensively before buying this one and I 've never been sorry . Since it 's a diamond hone I expect it to last at least my lifetime ( I 'm 71 years young ) . If you like to cook - get one .
3 #### I have several indoor planter boxes and potted plants that were newly planted last summer . I was having trouble getting things to start in them and thought these might help . I have 6 boxes and all of them had the spikes inserted into them . 3 of the boxes seem to be doing okay and the other three are not . They are intermixed with the others , so it is not the lighting . I tried to dissolve the spikes in water to add a more concentrated feeding , but the spikes would not dissolve . I left them for over a week . Some of it dissolved , but about 50 % of the spike remained intact . I will be looking for a water - soluble fertilizer . I ca n't say these do n't help , but I ca n't see that they did much in half of my planters .
5 #### Thought it was steel , but it 's not , but seems to do the job . It will function as my back up snow shovel , sturdy and well balanced , not much else to say , it 's a shovel .
5 #### Been using this for about 8 + years now - nothing comes close to keeping the rust , powdery mildew , etc . down PLUS it gives it a real boost of nutrients !
5 #### This is a great vegetable brush ! Fits well in my hand and does n't slip when it gets wet . So far it has cleaned carrots and zucchini very well . Anything other than a root vegetable you need to be careful with , because it can take off some of the outer skin if used too vigorously , but that has n't been a huge issue for me . I would definitely recommend !
5 #### This stuff really does the job , faster growth when used before the grow big vs not . Big difference using this grow big and tiger bloom together . I would highly recommend for those who wish to use this on potted crops and herbs . I do n't think this is safe for ground soil / water .
5 #### One of a kind pry bar with the custom bump that helps in certain times . Great pry bar for a great price , shipped to your door .
5 #### It 's just what we needed for trimming around our stepping stones , road , flower beds , etc . Works well . Just have to be careful not to cut the cord :}
5 #### I calculated one " heavy " night it killed 50,000 ngats--- which otherwise would have come into the house and flew up my nose !
5 #### OXO makes good gear and this set of tongs is both comfortable and built well . The plastic handle keeps the end from getting too hot when stirring pasta or other work where it 's exposed to heat for a long time . I use this for frying , stirring , turning , tossing , grabbing , and find able to handle it all . I have used these types of tongs for years , and the plastic handle is a nice addition . So is the locking tab that keeps them closed for storage . The smart additions make this gadget even more convenient to use .
5 #### This is a great peeler it is sturdy and peels fruits and veggies . I look forward to adding to my kitchen through more products from OXO
3 #### Adequate for general cutting but not a precision instrument . Item was stamped out so edges are rough and on a slight angle . It 's also a little too thick and heavy , and too small overall for most carpenter type jobs . I wish these came in a slightly larger size like they used to , like 15 " or 18 " , but the next size up is 24 " which is way too big .
5 #### I just made pancakes with this and my cast iron grill with " Dollar " size pancake spots . Same batter with both , the Nordic Ware were a bit bigger and seemed to take a bit longer on the first batch but the pancakes were supper fluffy ! compared to the cast iron . This might be because the pancake spots are deep and the edges are well defined . These Pancakes were much preferred by the kiddies- and the animal imprints were a huge hit with the Gran- kiddies . Thanks again Nordic ware !
5 #### Have owned this biscuit joiner for years now , it has never given me any problems . It also is the easiest to operate of the different brands I have tried . I would recommend it .
5 #### pretty sure the design and fabrication of this tape measure has n't changed in decades . It does what it should , and is what anyone should expect from a standard tape . Only shortcoming is that the label claims a 7 ' standout capability and I 've never had it hold up much past 6 ' , but that 's nothing new for this tape . I noticed many of the 1 - star reviews complained about the tape separating from the retracting spring when it 's pulled out " all the way " . For anyone who does n't know , that will happen with any tape measure from any manufacturer except the really long ( 100 ft ) ones which only roll back up with a hand crank , and none of them can be repaired after that happens ; they can still be used for measurement , but will never retract on their own again . If everything you need to measure is around or over 25 ' then you really need a longer tape than this one .
5 #### So far so good . My previous Mag drive lasted 10 yrs .
2 #### While I like the concept , did not perform as well as others .
3 #### I owned a Mighty Mite vacuum for YEARS ! It was SO old that it was covered with paint from my home redecoration done in 2000 and I had used it for years before THAT ! The on / off button no longer worked so I simply plugged it into the wall to get it running and when the plug finally disintegrated I knew it was time to buy another one . Came here to Amazon , marketplace seller gave the fastest delivery in recorded history ( IN 24 HOURS ! ) BUT ... even though the machine itself does a great job , the parts are CHEAP ! The hose is not flexible , twists all the time , I wish I had saved the hose from the old one ; the electric cord is awful , very stiff , very hard to wrap around the handle , and gets easily tangled in itself . I love the Mighty Mite but the quality of parts just does n't cut it ; next time , I 'll get another brand .
3 #### They seem like okay gloves , but I received the wrong size . Not really worth the hassle of returning them , but they 'd definitely fit better if they were the correct size .
4 #### The construction and material are sturdy , no complaints about that . All the settings work great . There is just a missing option I think . There 's " Center " which does the center holes , " Shower " which does the outer - but not one that does both . Need more water for the plants !
5 #### Really well made . This will probably last for a long time !
5 #### Got it as a gift for someone who has seemed very happy with it ! We have cats so it is perfect .
5 #### This is a great knife have other Henckels they are a great company to buy from !
5 #### Thank you very much , shippingvery fast , i lake , it 's very good vork .
5 #### This prodykt vere good .I do n't have a problem with this product . I recomed this product for my frends . Ivere happe . Thank you vere mach
5 #### I 've had one of these for years now , so I decided to order another one . The only thing is , if it 's in the sun a lot during the day , it fades the white writing . I cover mine with black electrical tape and if I need to change the dial ( hours ) , I just lift the tape so I can turn the dial .
4 #### This is a nice little grill . We could never figure out how to cook without getting the lighter fuel flavor out of our food , so after a year , we threw this away .
5 #### Theses screws are very good to draw joints together . Very quick for joinery and makes the job easy and fast .
5 #### Love Woodstock chimes ! Sound nice , fast shipping and accurate description ! Great Seller ! !
3 #### It is too floppy . The previous smaller whisk made by OXO was firmer and did a great job . Unfortunately , it wore out . Evidently , that size is not made now .
5 #### Classic . Sturdy . Strong . Those 3 things can only be talking about two things ... my wee - wee or this Stanley Powerlock . Since you ca n't buy my wee - wee , you should buy this tape measure . Since it is metal , it can take a beating .
5 #### perfect for our electric weed whacker ... good price and good quality
5 #### Exactly what i wanted . well built and good brass connectors , not cheap plastic .
4 #### This glue seems to be a staple amongst professional woodworkers . I like the bottle design , which squirts the glue in a more controlled fashion and is easier to clean . Here is my summary of pluses and minuses : 1 . This glue is very strong . 2 . The glue sets very quickly , so you have less working time . 3 . If you get a lot of squeeze - out , it 's difficult to clean the glue off the wood . Heavy sanding is necessary to remove traces of the glue . But if you are careful , this glue pays off .
5 #### I used about 3500 of these in 3/4 " hickory . They worked well with my nailer and I had no issues with misfires or anything else . I would use again for future floor g projects
5 #### I 've used this knife for quite some time , and it 's wonderful . The weight is great and well balanced . It holds an edge rather well , and it sharpens easily . For the price , I think this knife ca n't be beat !
4 #### I bought this because I read somewhere that keeping salad in a spinner retains freshness longer . This has been true for me . I do n't buy heads of lettuce , whole tomatoes , cucumbers , etc . to make my salads . It 's bad enough that I 'm eating salad -- don't make me work for it ! I buy the pre - packaged salad products that you just open , pour , and eat ( at least that 's what I do ; I suppose a case can be made to wash it anyway ) . Point being , I basically empty the bag into the spinner and put it in the fridge . I 've had salads go bad ( mostly through accumulated moisture buildup ) in the original packaging within days of purchase , even unopened ! This container maintains freshness for weeks ! My only minor complaint is its size : it 's pretty big and takes up a fair amount of fridge space . The fact that the handle collapses into the lid does help .
5 #### I 've used mine for over 5 years now , and it continues to be a dependable container for numerous lawn & garden tasks . I highly recommend this collapsible , hard shell base container .
5 #### Works great ! The disassembly makes clean - up easy and it 's pretty stable despite just being two sides .
5 #### Channellock knows its stuff and its on full display here .
1 #### This is junk . I never caught 1 flea with this ... do not buy ! I use mine for a night light .
5 #### I have other , heavier wood splitters . They 're all very heavy . This tool , being lightweight , is easy to swing and does just as good a job as my heavy tools . I guess since it can be swung with greater speed , that makes up for the lighter weight . The laws of physics are in your favor !
5 #### Such a great little add - on item for the money , use it all the time .
5 #### I got the Victor Flea trap years ago and used it in my dog grooming shop . When I moved to the coast and had the warm weather nearly all year , I started having flea problems again even with all the vet recommended products for my animals . I got these refills for the trap and leave it on all the time . That way I can make sure I do not get an infestation . It works great and does draw the fleas to the light . It 's very strong adhesive traps them there . I would recommend this to anyone with a pet and the possibility of fleas . Great value too .
4 #### Nice little item . Does n't cut much and looking forward to getting more adept at using it .
4 #### Bought four of these in December 2012 . Worked flawlessly until a couple months ago . Now it sticks at a certain point and defeats the whole purpose of having a timer . While it worked , it also had an annoying trait of turning off with a loud thud . My other timers work fine , but they get far less use than the one that broke .
5 #### This is one powerful saw ! I 've yet to slow it down , yet alone bog it down . It just eats wood . That aside , it has some super features . The tilt handle is great . It is not hard to adjust , and makes the saw much more pleasant to use . The sightline is excellent , and the saw tracks well . I also like the padded forward grip , and being able to see the bevel scale without turning the saw around . The base is flat and promises to stay that way , and the saw is light weight . I have had no problems with it whatever . In fact , I gave my backup yellow saw away - and it was a good saw too . This Milwaukee saw rocks ! It is professional through and through - definitely five star material .
1 #### Very disappointed that maglight would sell such a useless flashlight , even with a new battery it is so dim you can barely see it - do n't wate you money . Another reviewer mentioned the Photon Microlights , I 'll try that instead
5 #### Outstanding craftsmanship that can only come from U.S. craftsmen . It is to all of our benefit to support this manufacturer as they they are one of ( if not THE ) last knife manufacturers based solely in the United States . Although the cost of these knives are higher than the chinese knives , think of it like this .... quality workmanship should cost a bit more than imported junk . After all , this will probably be the last knife that you buy ( unless you lose it ) , so why not get a good one .
5 #### works as advertised , took a full sync cycle to get caught up but after that you will have a great clock and no worries about adjustments ! !
5 #### It is really The Best mousetrap I 've ever used ...... it 's simple & virtually foolproof . Just make sure you check the trap at least once per day as it WILL trap the mouse ..... but the first time I used it , I forgot to check after 2 days , and found dead mice . =( So far I 've caught a mouse each day for the last 4days ..... I let them go far from the house , so I 'm sure it 's not the same one ..... we just have a lot of mice evidently ..... which was a surprise . BTW , I initially ordered 3 traps ....... one was missing the end cap ( where the peanut butter goes) ..... I thought it was n't worth returning , so just put heavy tape over the end ..... the mouse chewed it 's way out , but the other 2 traps caught mice . I ordered 3 more traps , and again , one was missing the end cap ( ! ) I asked for a replacement , and they could tell I was not happy ...... BUT was I surprised to get 2 personal apologies from Amazon , AND they not only replaced the 2 defective traps , but also sent 2 more for FREE ! Thanks Amazon for GREAT CUSTOMER SUPPORT ! ! ! =)
5 #### As described . Works great as a replacement for my Black and Decker toaster oven 's original baking tray .
5 #### A classic - I 've been using these for years and this one is just as good as the one I lost and am replacing .
1 #### This trap was the most unsuccessful trap of the three I own . Lasted one season then parts started snapping off . There are better traps and I usually like Victor traps .
5 #### use this every day ... it 's OXO they make things to last .
5 #### I 'm a landscaper , so I use these snips for deadheading fussy annuals like violas and petunias . But I used to work at a Humboldt County , CA nursery , and , um ... I was probably the only person ever to buy a pair of these for legal purposes ! Seriously , this is the gold standard for pot - growers who need to do trimming . What kind of trimming ? Durn if I know , but I 've seen them at yard sales coated with the sticky sap , and the local growers used to buy stacks of these nippers with their smelly cash , so ... If you need it for either purpose , then these are the best . I 've tried other brands and did n't like them as well . Keep in mind this is for cutting thin , tiny deadheads . It 's not a pruning shear , it 's for very detailed deadheading or nipping of very small stems . If you 're doing a lot of delicate pruning like this , I 'd also recommend picking up some of those thin Atlas Nitrile Touch gloves . Best gloves for tactile sensation while doing fine work .
4 #### It actually works ! I can actually see the bottom of my pond . It 's only about 2 and 1/2 feet deep but the water is much clearer !
4 #### I have used many rose care products but this one seems to work best . I like the concentrated solution , rather than the pellets because it seems to have a much faster effect on the plants . I also like the fact that this is an all - encompassing concentrate that stimulates growth and prevents disease and infestations .
5 #### I purchased the large and I am so glad I did . I had a big garden with lots of different lettuce and herbs this spring and so I have been cleaning and spinning for the last couple of weeks . I love it . I have the start of arthritis and the pump instead of cranking ( my old one ) is much easier on my hands .
4 #### Mixes well and has a sturdy handle , but it does n't hold food items to turn them over . Overall , a good product , but not exactly what I was hoping for .
3 #### Seem to be the same old wood clamps , but was incredibly disappointed when I saw a " Made in China " sticker on them . The threaded rod is a bright shinny silver now - have n't used them long enough to know if the quality has dropped or not . Minus 2 stars for moving production to China . If you do n't care about that , you 'll likely be happy with these .
4 #### This is the third or fourth Mighty Mite that we 've had over the years . They are extremly durable , useful and can be counted on to last for ten years , with normal use . I 'm not in love with the new style floor tool that comes with the vacuum but maybe I 'll learn to like it ? A very good value .
5 #### I have 4 pruners that lasted about 2 years and the Felco is the best one that I have had . Cuts with little pressure and just cuts good .
5 #### This is chocked full of great ideas . Lots of good and easy cakes for kids cakes . The adults are not left out either . Wedding cakes galore . Great book .
5 #### Had no problem with this ladder . It 's not industrial strenght but all I do is change out light bulbs . Works just fine for those kind of light activities .
5 #### Works great . I used some leftover corks and zip ties so it now floats all over the pond .
5 #### I am uses to using an aluminum extension ladder that is rated for 250 lb . I originally thought that I wanted to replace my existing aluminum extension ladder with another aluminum ladder because fiberglass is slightly heavier and I thought that I would not like the added weight . I bought the 20 ' fiberglass ladder rated for 300 lb . and I am amazed ! Aluminum extension ladders have a lot of movement in them when you climb up and down them . This fiberglass extension ladder is rock solid . It 's like walking up a stair case ! I will never own another aluminum extension ladder again !
5 #### Just scan the reviews here , there is a solid consensus . This is a well made , versatile tool that is a solid investment for any tool box . 101 uses around the house or shop . You may find a similar looking item for a few bucks less but you get what you pay for . This is a tool you reach for time and time again .
5 #### Love these things . Light weight , good grip , sharp small blades for delicate trimming of leaves and small stems , and with the spring assisted opening , it cuts down on hand fatigue -nice since I have some arthritis in my hands .
5 #### I had this saw for about 6 years and never had a problem with it . Powerful , easy to use . I recommend it .
2 #### Not very accurate . The thermometer is ok , but the hydrometer is way off .
5 #### Works great and is compact in size which I really like .
5 #### Used this in the south in Zika areas specificallly in city drains and there aS a drastic reduction in visible mosquito larvae growth no affect with frogs of fish
2 #### The bamboo stakes bent easily when staking cosmos , four O'clock and gladiolus plants .
5 #### After six months of use it is still brand new . Easy to clean , does n't rust , and big enough to not fall into the sink . I like the product and will buy a smaller as well .
5 #### Worked very well on geese at the dock and deer in the yard .
5 #### I love this thing ! It attaches and un - attaches easily . It 's so light weight that it 's almost like using a ball point pen . It makes working on projects / hobbying so much easier than using my Black & Decker RTX-6 without it .
2 #### Arrived fully wrapped in clingy plastic wrap - no signs of damage from shipping , BUT ... one corner is not welded or soldered and is loose . I have to return it . If they welding is that sloppy , I would imagine the whole thing could n't last through one season of use .
5 #### I cook / bake all the time and love these measuring spoons . The " good grips " on them makes them easy to handle . I love the sizes , too , as I have such a hard time finding the in between sizes , so these were absolutely perfect for each cooking job that I do .
4 #### I mistakenly ordered this blade not noticing that it is full kerf . My saw is 13 amp , the advice is use a thin kerf blade . But I am very satisfied with the clean cuts . I 've found no problems ripping 2 inch fir , it is noisier . One big plus , no wobble , so flatter cuts . The great price on this quality blade make this an exceptional buy .
3 #### We wanted one of these because of the quiet and hassle - free nature of their operation , but these are really only for very flat lawns with no weeds . It does not do well on uneven ground , and dandilions pass through it unscathed , perhaps just getting a slight massage in the process . Also , a regular gas mower cuts almost to the very edge of the mowing deck and at least as wide as the wheels : not so with these mowers , so plan on doing more edge - work with a string trimmer and such . I am very happy with the construction , it is very solid , and assembly was easy ( basically just putting the two sections of the handle on ) .
5 #### My bugs are very fond of this zapper , and their carcasses are easily removed by poking a screwdriver inside the screen .
5 #### I use them for my black pepper gruyere popovers and they are FANTASTIC . The key is heating up the pan before you put the batter into it and they ' pop over ' quite nicely . Glad I bought them .
5 #### I recommend this to all readaholics ... its great for bed time reading with out disturbing others . Its light and VERY bright almost too bright but you have the option of using one light and best off all the batteries are your run of the mill AAA . So when they die no doubt you can easily find another set . I have no complaints you ca nt go wrong with trying this at this price .
4 #### worked great , had no issues with it . does what it 's supposed to do .
5 #### Worked extremely well to connect my Delta 14 " bandsaw dust port to a vacuum attachment . Had the typical problem where the port on my bandsaw was 5 " and could n't figure out how to hook it up . Went with one of these ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B6JE7DA?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00 ) and had to pop the outermost rivet to get it to fit over the 5 " output as they are the same size and then sealed it up with Foil Duct tape . Worked like a charm and used a 10 ' 4 " powertec dust collection hose ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VRVGUA?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s02 ) with a 4 " to 2.5 " reducer ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000223YJ?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s03 ) to connect it to my shop vac . Works great and helps keep the project dust down as I do n't have a central dust collection system setup .
3 #### It really works good . Except after two days both light bulbs stopped working and now I have no light . Would have to order replacement bulbs . Instructions are a little vague but other wise good company and good product !
5 #### I received the item on time . It was exactly what I expected .
4 #### For the price , these fans do the job . If kept clean and in good repair , they will last years . Have purchased them before and will again .
2 #### Worked twice , then made a loud screaming sound and stopped working . The plastic was pitted , and it was supposed to be new . This thing sucks .
5 #### After over 10 years of use , my Henckels shears look and function the same as the day I bought them . They have yet to need sharpening , and the semi - matte sheen of the handles is in pristine condition . Two points to remember : Do n't try to cut metal items with them , it will ruin their cutting edge , and dishwasher use is not recommended . The blades are great for everything from plant stems to raw fish and chicken , and the tips of the blades are very sharp and will get into tight places . For instance , it 's the perfect instrument for preparing artichokes , from neatly cutting the thorny tips , to getting inside to the fuzzy center . Being left - handed , I appreciate its balance , and ambidexterousness , and I think no matter what your hand size , your fingers will fit comfortably . A function I use a lot is the serrated inner grip for opening bottles and small jars ... it does the job better than anything else I 've used . For garden , kitchen , or workplace , they will cut just about anything non - metallic , they 're easy to clean , attractive to look at , and will serve you well for many years if used as intended .
3 #### Still not soft and flexible enough to clean celery , but good quality .
5 #### This is the best knife I 've come across in my 56 years of cooking . Highly recommended .
4 #### This is a necessary supplement to a chain file , and the jig is simple to use .
4 #### Not a luxurious purchase , but good enough to cut some drywall for overhead surround sound speakers . I do n't know how it would stand up to rigorous everyday use , but for the odd job here and there , now and then , it 's good enough .
5 #### Works as expected ... More comfortable for my old hands and easier to get into my Miniature House Projects
5 #### If I killed bugs as fast as this thing does , I 'd be exhausted in no time . Worth every penny - though one thing ... when you order a shepard 's hook to hang it on , make sure to get the right size . This thing needs to be as high off the ground as they say for maximum zappage .
5 #### I 've had this for 5 years now , and have been using it on average once a week . It 's easily the best salad spinner I 've ever had . Packs an amazing amount of rotational punch with just a few presses of the pump , which does require a little bit of strength . Very durable and easy to clean .
5 #### OXO has so many great products and this is one of them . Easy to use , quick and efficient . Getting another one for backup !
3 #### It 's quite small . It 's good for a small size tea pot .
5 #### Superb knife , excellent handle , superb quality blade . I would buy this knife again , but it 's so good , I will never have to .
3 #### did n't cut a carrot I had cut into strips , , , did n't cut the 1/2 onion I had put in nor the pieces of red sweet pepper did cut the lettuce which was already chopped a bit WELL I had it together wrong , I"ll give it 3 stars or maybe 3 Not that the directions , such as they were , on the box , helped much . I will probably use it more and hope I get better at it
5 #### My backyard birds love this so much , they snuck on to my laptop and re - ordered it themselves ! lol Really great for doves and songbird . My number one pick of birdseed .
5 #### This salad spinner is much easier to use than my other pull one . I just have to push and it does the work . Easier on my arthritic hands and shoulder . I have the green on and love the color . Would purchase again .
4 #### Well made , but black . Why is EVERYTHING black ? In low light it is difficult to make out the lettering .
1 #### It worked for 2 weeks . I was happy , but now it has stopped working . Now I am dissapointed that I spent that money with little results .
3 #### While these clamps are very nice , they are really expensive . If you are looking for pipe clamps like this , you can definitely find them cheaper . They are very handy though . PROS * * Ease of use * * You determine length of clamp by the length of pipe . * * Undoubtedly , a lifetime tool . CONS * * Expensive * * Longer clamps tend to get awkward due to the weight . * * Round pipe ca n't be held as securely as square pipe .
5 #### I like the refills better - they seem to be on a slightly more rigid base . I will continue use these pesticide free flea solutions .
5 #### I ordered this as a replacement bulb for my BK-80D bug buster .. installation was a breeze - only took about 2 minutes start to finish .
5 #### Works great , perfect for the thing 's I need to test .
5 #### I just purchased the Amco Nylon Slotted Spatula . I have been buying the Amco Nylon cooking utility collection one or two items at a time . I love each one , they seem to be perfect size , very durable , , and they look like a professional set , something you would see being used by a chef . They also look very classic in my brushed stainless utility holder . When I bought this slotted spatula I did n't say anything to my family just put it in the utility holder and watched . As various family members cooked when they reached for a spatula it was 100 % of the time the Amco spatula . There is another spatula in my utility holder that has not been used since this one was delivered . The plus that comes with this spatula is the slots , as you remove things from the skillet like morning pork sausage patties the grease drains when you use this spatula . Great buy , great product You will not be sorry to have purchased this spatula .
4 #### Pretty good setup ; seems to work well . Like the spacers , but could be marked a bit more clearly .
5 #### Perfect large size for mixing items for baking . and well made .
4 #### I like this garlic press 's heft , the curve and " good grip " of its handle , and its cleaning feature . It requires some force to press the garlic -- more than I expected , but it is n't difficult for able - handed people -- and the garlic shoots out of it more forcefully than I expected . I have had the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/OXO - SteeL - Garlic - Press - Stainless / dp / B0000CDVD7 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">OXO SteeL Garlic Press , Stainless</a>&nbsp;for several years , and like this product better . This product produces a finer mince , its handles are more ergonomic and do n't slip out of place , and it does n't send as much garlic out the sides .
3 #### Bought two , one DOA . The one that works is good .
5 #### My entire family loves this product . I consider myself a good cook and make sure my knives are sharp . Also , I 'm a gadget person and really did n't expect this to work as well as it did . But I have NO complaints and highly recommend the item !
3 #### This was purchased for an organization to which I belong , I have not used it myself . The guys seem to like it .
5 #### It 's important to remember that it 's almost impossible to sharpen the blade on any mandoline . That means that even the most expensive ones are essentially disposeable - when the blade gets dull , the mandoline is done . So any reasonably sturdy mounting of a very sharp blade will do most of the jobs that any cook would want done and there is very little reason to pay more for the sort of virtues that we might admire in other tools . I have stored somewhere a beautiful French - made mandoline that was given to me a dozen years ago . The blade is dull after a lot of hard use and there 's no hope for re - sharpening . It cost about $ 150 . I use my plastic Progressive all the time . It 's four years old and when it finally dulls out , I 'll throw it away . Economical and disposeable and highly recommended . Lynn Hoffman -- Author of The New Short Course in Wine and the eternally sharp novel bang BANG .
5 #### Finally got around to putting my 17 lb sledge on and have been whacking away with it . It will be used rough for years to come before needing replaced . Hard to beat that .
5 #### Recently I 've decided to store all the loose ends in my pickup in bags . It 's made the back of my truck much neater and a lot quieter . Nothing rolls around anymore and things are easy to get to when needed . I tucked this under my seat and it 's no longer in a tangled mess . The bag is made out of thick high quality material , zipper seems heavy duty . My jumper cables are 20 feet long and fit in perfectly . If anything I wish the bag was a few inches smaller in diameter just so it was more compact but that 's really not even a complaint .
5 #### Some say it is too big , but if you have more than one spoon or ladles , it fits the bill . Easy to clean and is durable . Would recommend this to anyone who does a lot of cooking .
4 #### This device scared the critter away . The problem I had was it was very leaky . Maybe we need to add an extra washer . We 'll have to experiment with it . But I am pleased how alarming to critters this device can be .
5 #### I bought this sharpener about 6 years ago . it is still going strong and i have not had the slightest bit of trouble with it . I recently sharpened several knifes for three people . in doing so , they have had me order them all one . I wish I could have made a commission from selling them ! if you love having a sharp knife that you can use , stop wasting your money on cheap pieces of crap and buy this one !
5 #### Totally love this worm poop ! It is a rich black / brown color , has a small amount of large pieces which break up easily and works well to feed plants . The bag in which it comes has directions for worm castings tea which say to just add water and let sit for 12 - 24 hours . I 've actually found that you have to add molasses to the water and aerate with an aquarium pump and aerating stone so the organisms in the castings do n't die . I found this info AFTER I made mine and was disappointed to think that I rendered my castings unusable . I would use this method if you were thinking to make casting tea . I hope this helps !
3 #### This bag is very mediocre at collecting wood saw dust . If you plan on switching blades and cutting cement board it is totally useless , If you plan on working with Azek , Trex , Versatex , or any other plastic , PVC , or similar , the bag causes problems . The bag causes the dust port to clog and what dust does n't pack itself into the arbor , riving knife locking mechanism , and bottom of the blade housing comes right out the top of the saw . It is like working in sticky blizzard of that nasty plastic dust .
5 #### This is a great wire stripper and cuter . Perfectly fits the size wires I am stripping and very sharp . The spring has enough tension in it so you are not having to also assist it in opening it . I 've never had a problem with Klein tools and this is no exception .
5 #### Bought as a replacement for my main air line . The old one was the same thing so they are very durable , the original lasted over 6 years . These are flexible and are rated for 300 PSI . I run it on a 175 PSI compressor and use it to connect to impact tools , sand blast cabinets and to spray coatings . Good value and made in the USA !
5 #### I bought this item for my wife thinking it would be a great little gift . Little did I know that it has become one of her most favorite gifts ever ... who would have ever thought ... ; > ) The light is easy to use , and the two brighteness settings makes it perfect for older books or books with darker pages . Battery operation is obviously not a problem as the original batteries are still going strong even after nightly use for weeks ! It really has become the ' perfect gift ' ! ! !
4 #### I only wish the " jet - spray " setting was a little more jet spray like .... other than that , it works great , and has n't leaked ...
5 #### An excellent blade . I did not believe the claims of " gluable " and " joiner " quality cuts , but it 's true . I think it 's a combination of the thin curf and the blade quality , but it feels like I 've added another horse or two to my saw motor . I also bought the stabilizer right off . The blade is obviously more expensive , but the quality of the cut is so good it 's hard to even compare the WWII with standard blades . By the way , I use a Uniguard blade guard with the separate splitter . I was a little concerned at first about whether the kerf of the 3/32 blade would be wide enough for the splitter , but it is . I did have to adjust the position of the splitter , and place the stabilizer on the inside of the blade to get the two to line up . But it works very well . I wish I could afford one for my miter saw !
5 #### Very handy Saw dust catcher . Minimizes a lot of Saw dust when cutting . I do not know why it is not included with the Saw in the first place . It is a must have .
5 #### Oh so much better than all the plastic crap nozzles that do n't work well in the first place and soon do n't work at all . This is the old fashioned spray pistol I like so much and it can easily water plants gently or wash the car or walkway or outside windows with good pressure ...
5 #### They have n't leaked but as previously stated they are hard to get the lids on . Which in my opinion is typical of Tupperware products
5 #### You know how some things look good in a picture and when you get it you are disappointed . This will not disappoint you .
4 #### Fit my Dewalt 7480 well , but the blade does n't drop far enough for this to sit flush before the first cut is made . I plan to install a smaller blade in my tablesaw to make the first part of the cut and then the full size to finish it off . Would also be nice if it had tabs in the back like the stock dewalt insert .
5 #### I got this one to replace one that a neighbor needed more than I did . It works great and I would recommend it . The product arrived on time and as advertised .
5 #### Fly magnet is the best name for this stuff . It really really works !
5 #### What more can I say ? Construction Master 5 fits in it . No more falling out of my pouch while I 'm running up or down stairs .
5 #### Birds love this ! I fill my feeder up and 24 hours later it 's gone ! The neighborhood cardinal is a big fan !
5 #### This is such a nice heavy cooking pot . I just love it and have made several large pots of homemade soup and chili . Will highly recommend this pot to anyone wanting a heavy duty cooking pot .
2 #### followed the instructions , it smells terrible but does not attract flys . We have lots of flys around the goat pens , Moved it around never caught a fly .
5 #### I ordered this because my son got me non - stick cookware and I did n't want to scratch it using a regular whisk . It works great ! It 's easy to clean , and does n't scratch my Calphalon Comtemporary Non - Stick Cookware .
5 #### This Universal Mobile Base is just another great way to move your machines around . In my case , my Powermatic bandsaw so I may clean behind it . For small wood shops like mine , you ca n't beat it . Actually I have one on all my machines and you just ca n't beat the price and the weight it will support . I am totally happy with it , do I need to say more ......
4 #### These are very nice for folks who have trouble gripping slick surfaces . The rubber grip on them helps but is not clumsy . Easy to read sizes but wish the size was more prominent in each spoon .
4 #### No noticeable issues . Should be a standard attachment for rotary tools , given the price and ease of use . Would recommend .
5 #### When we apply a wet paper towel , the sponge makes quick work of cleaning the desktop electric grill . Its a winner .
5 #### I have installed three units made by a big Fluidmaster competitor named Korky in the last year because they all started to fail quickly . I tried all the troubleshooting tips I could find . Yes , they had been installed correctly . No dice . Save yourself some time and money and get this Fluidmaster instead . The entire flush sound and refilling sound is a little louder than the Korky , but honestly I 'm just happy that this mechanism is more reliable and less prone to failure then the self - contained Korky unit that does not have a float ( this Fluidmaster functions by relying on a float in the water ) . I 'm so tired of replacing these things ! ! Just buy this one ! !
5 #### It 's silly for anyone to bash this light . Its a 7 dollar small AAA flashlight with a real bulb that 's smaller than a grain of rice . Its not a high performance utility light . Go into a pitch black room and turn it on . WOW , guess what ? You can see ! I find this light useful for walking around the house at night without compromising night vision , 2 lumens is great for that . Plus the yellowish tint is easier on the eyes than a bright white LED . It will run over 3 hours on a battery .
4 #### There has been a lot written on this vac so I wo n't repeat what I have already read . The main things I can add are that 1 ) to beware that the inlet where the hose attachment is has no one way valve . Most vacs have a flap valve between the hose and the bag so when the hose is removed , the bag contents do n't fall out the hole . ( the bag is right on the other side of the hose connection ) This has about a 2 " hole where you can see straight into the bag contents which means if you take off the hose there is nothing keeping the dirt in the bag from pouring back out , especially if you tip the vac nose down . If you stand it on it 's rear no problem . 2 ) the power switch is under a plastic bar which bends when you press it . That means that some day the bending will eventually break the plastic bar and the switch will be exposed . It is recessed and you would have to poke your finger into the hole once this breaks and it will . Plastic only bends so many times before breaking . Bad design , but for about $ 65 how can you complain . My last Mighty Mite lasted 20 years .
5 #### I like this hose for several reasons . it is very reasonably priced . it does nt bind , kink , or stiffen up in the cold . as a professional framer , an inexpensive hose that actually performs is a must . get this one and save the pvc hoses for some one else .
5 #### This axe makes splitting much easier than with the maul , which I never minded using . The handle is long ( 36 " ) , strong and light , and well integrated with the blade . The blade design works well too , and definitely reduces the number of swings needed . I heat with wood and really appreciate this tool .
5 #### It has already been said in most of the reviews on this product , but it bears repeating . Just pop in a bit and the spring mechanism locks in . pull back on the collar and it ejects . So simple it is genius . There are many other rapid load chucks available by other makers but for some reason they have all chosen to use a mechanism that usually requires two hands to operate and is not only more complicated in design , but not as efficient . I have several of these made by just as many manufacturers , mostly because they are often packaged with a set of 1/4 inch shank bit sets , but the DeWALT is the only one I use everyday most of the others I own are still in the original case and mostly unused .
5 #### Strong little light . I own half a dozen and carry one in my back pack and one in my front pocket
5 #### Estwing produces some of the highest quality tools that I have seen and at pretty much the same price as everyone else . All their products are made in the USA so it shows that we can still produce great products at a competitive price . For sure , I will put my name on all my new Estwing tools because they are sure to be something a neighbor will want to borrow .
3 #### As stated above , this reducer will not connect a 2 1/2 " hose to a 4 " outlet of a dust collector . Some other reviews said it did , so I ordered it anyway . I solved the problem by getting a rubber plumbing connector from the hardware store and attached the two together . The 4 " side needs a 3 " rubber connector . It is a very tight fit , and took some time to get it on , but it worked great and now I do not have to worry about stress on the hose at the machine end because the rubber pipe connector is flexible . All and all it worked out . I lowered the points because the company should have explained this in the place .
5 #### I purchased the wrong size . Too small for my toaster oven .
3 #### I like most of the OXO products , but this one is just ok . It 's hard to get started , or keep up any real rhythm , but it gets the job done .
2 #### When I received these I was disappointed to find out each cup is not one piece . The handle is separated from the cup part . I am concerned this may be hard to clean .
4 #### Nice little whisk . Works as it is supposed to and cleans up easily . It is very small , so look at the size before ordering ! Gets the job done , though for the more intense baker , you 'll probably want something larger . I rarely use a whisk , so works for me !
2 #### Purchased these in the past from Different Supplier , and the was great , these are way to big for the pond I needed them for . I should have read the dimensions first . Same packaging but a lot bigger than the others I ordered
5 #### Much cheaper here than at local stores . Heavy duty to withstand the weather
5 #### Been using this for about a month now . Works better then I was expecting and stayed clean . I 've tried other products that generally need to be cleaned themselves after each use . I would buy again , but I doubt I will need another one for awhile
5 #### I have used one so far as directed . I placed in a sunny spot near my chicken coop . I caught flies until it filled so full no more could get in . It did smell a bit , but that was expected .
4 #### I cut a few hundred feet of black poly pipe with a hacksaw before I discovered pipe cutters , and now I 'll tell everyone who makes hoops to get a pipe cutter with their first roll of tubing . WAY easier on your arms , hands , and hoop - making , in general . These models are cheap , practically throw - away , compared to the ones with replacement BLADES that start at $ 40.00 . So I think I got what I paid for . I put a notch in the cutting blade a while back , and now , some 200 hoops later , I sense the cutting edge of the blade has dulled and I just ordered a replacement blade . However , I still powered through 50 cuts of 160 psi tubing two weeks ago . If you only have to make one or two cuts , you probably have a tool at home that will do as well . Once you 're making more than 10 cuts , you 'll benefit from a cutter . Note : I am talking about cutting the soft , black rolls of water / irrigation pipe , NOT white PVC 10 ' straight pipe . I have no idea of how well these cutters work on PVC , which I think is harder .
5 #### I have had this hammock for a year , and there have been four ten year olds in it swinging , two medium to large adults lounging together , and a large hairy dog relaxing in it , and it looks good as new . I 'd definitely take it in during the winter months , though , as the rope may mold and fade .
4 #### My grandfather had one of these , so I am used to seeing the gentle blue glow of a bug zapper . However , the 1 1/2 acre model is 50 feet from the back of the house and from my family room it looks like I live on the Vegas strip some evenings because the light is so bright ! However , I live in the woods and the bug zapper is just what the doctor ordered . I have this set on timer and have throughly enjoyed bug - free , chemical free evenings on my patio .
5 #### Completely impressed with this blade . It mates up well with my Milwaukee 12 " sliding compound miter saw . An important performance feature is the 5 degree negative hook , which is in the range recommended by Milwaukee for sliding compound . Add the other features of this blade and you get a great performer .
4 #### Attractive and well made but I expected a little more from Onieda . The handles are terribly uncomfortable as are many stainless steel salad tongs . For an unknown brand , yeah okay . For Oneida - step up your game , guys , you 're a premium brand .
5 #### Works GREAT ! ! Saves a lot of time and hand pain !
4 #### Just what I ordered . Used to make drop cords from SO cable .
5 #### Superior coffee ! Only complaint is that you can burn yourself handling this and sometimes coffee overflows .
5 #### My fiance does n't like that this spatula is as flexible as it is but I love it , it makes it easy to get under pancakes because it is thin and you can use it to get brownies , pie , etc out of pans because it is thin and it bends to where you can get it out of the pan easily .
5 #### At first the bristles seemed a little too soft but after having actually used this brush for a good while now it has proven to be just about perfect for all but the thickest paints . The brush cleans up easy , the bristles retain their shape and the wood handle feels good in hand .
3 #### I keep this feeder in the tree in front of our front door , and have stopped keeping food in it - the large holes along the ledge ( where the food comes out ) meant that every time a crow or jay landed on the ledge , the food spilled out - and I wish I 'd known then that certain kinds of bird seed actually sprouts into weeds . Anyway , it 's really cute as a decorative piece more than anything - otherwise , if you 're a hard - core bird lover , I 'd stick with something a bit more realistic for actual bird feeding ( and not weed - growing ) .
5 #### This thing is awesome ! Just big enough to cook for a small get together , but small enough to fire up for just two . I currently have 8 different Weber Grill / Smokers - but I find I use this grill more than any of them . A handful of lump charcoal and this baby is good for at least 4 hours . Still learning different ways to cook with it , but this is much better than starting the range up in the hot summer . The < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Lodge - Logic-5 - Quart - Pre - Seasoned - Dutch - Oven / dp / B00006JSUF / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Lodge Logic 5 - Quart Pre - Seasoned Dutch Oven</a>&nbsp;fits perfectly on top , and you could probably get two of them to fit without issue . It 's also nice to place in the center of the table and everyone can cook their foods on it , then after cook marshmallows . Food , Friends & Drink ! Life is good ......
3 #### The sound and clarity of the chimes are outstanding .... beautiful . The price for that was fair . My disappointment comes in the ring at top that holds it to hang is plastic and only a thick , waxed typed string is used to connect the plastic ring at top and the base plate . I see both of these things wearing out in time with the breezes constantly moving them ( vs. using a metal ring and something stronger than string coming from the hanging ring ) . My reservations were confirmed when I saw in the box a small pamphlet to order a " repair kit " when needed . But the sound coming from them is great .
5 #### I have purchased two of these mobile base units in the past year or so . It is easy to assemble and very durable . The size is very expandable and you can get an expansion kit , as I did , if the dimensions of the unit are too small . It has made moving my drill press and 12 " compound miter saw around the shop a breeze .
4 #### This square is the same as my old one from 20 years ago . Still a great tool .
5 #### I got one of these at a trade show many years ago- lost it and finally found them in sets at the local store . Nice grips , as you can imagine the transfer of energy to your fingers when you hit a steel set . These isolate that , and those of us with overly sensitive hands can use with comfort .
5 #### Five , again , as always ! I have 14 Case stockman , and wanted this to fill out the collection . Nearly all of them get carried and used on a sort of rotating basis . This one , like all of the " working man 's " ones , does not have exotic , organic scales . What this model lacks in showoff elements it more than makes up in smooth , perfectly - fitted , classically - simple , elegant , and razor - sharp Case sxecution . This knife has the sleek , unadorned feel of a straight razor . It has a distinct , all - American , " plain - is - purdy " look and feel . The smooth , pale yellow scales and perfectly - fitted logo shield are absolutely lovely in their understatement . It 's a " user 's " knife . It 's hard to completely explain all of this . Put this next to the stag , butter - rum , buffalo , and bone handle models , and it 's got its own beauty . I 'm goofy on the topic of Case knives , in particular the medium stockman pattern . If you even remotely share the obsession , if you just plain love and appreciate and use these tools ... add this to your collection , and pocket ... and your grand - kids ' .
3 #### Does what it 's supposed to , but it has a poor feel to it . My primary complaint is that one of the two switches is harder to flip than the other - it feels like it 's binding a bit inside the switch mechanism . I 'm not sure how long the switch will last given that it feels like it 's about to break , but for now it seems to be working .
4 #### There 's really no reason to write a review these clamps have meet the test of time . The quality is great the design is unsurpast .
4 #### Corona Clipper Compound - Action Anvil Lopper # FL 3420 Of the half dozen large loppers we 've used and owned over the years , this one makes cutting tree limbs / branches the easiest . This is due to the compound action 's added leverage , and , its anvil cutter ( versus the scissors type ) , which does n't twist on the wood while cutting , like scissors loppers sometimes do . When there is serious trimming to do , this is the tool I reach for . To top it off , they are n't very expensive . The only downside to this tool is the foam handles are too soft , so they get chewed up with normal usage . In spite of Amazon 's sales blurb , this lopper ca n't cut 2 " wood , and I 'm 6/4 270 lbs . Maximum cut is maybe 1.5 " in softwood , and 1.25 " in hardwood , like oak or cherry . Anything larger than that , and I use a saw .
2 #### Before I bought it , I called Weber Customer Service in order to find out the difference between this model and the more expensive one , which has the lock - on handle at the top . I was told the lock - on type did not have ventilation - draft holes in the bottom whereas this model did . I 've had a couple of the large Weber charcoal grilles and I could n't imagine cooking without the lower vents , so I got this one . On this model , the bottom end , where the three ( flimsy ) legs fasten together under the ash pan , is badly designed and comes apart repeatedly . I eventually came up with a bunch of lock washers which , if tightened after every use will most times stay together , but its still flimsy . As for the top , I 've tried various combinations of bungee cords and belts , but so far I have n't found a system that holds the top on while its being transported in a car . So , the concept of a Junior charcoal Weber is great - a compact Weber you can tote around - but for me , it just has n't worked out at all well . In good faith , I ca n't return it to Amazon , as its been used several times , and if you do n't transport it , it functions for the intended purpose . Best use is as a stay at home product . But the flimsy bottom as it comes out of the box would aggravate any user .
5 #### These are good filters . You might as well buy these more than one at a time since you 'll need them eventually . Intex pool products have always worked well in my experience .
3 #### Easy to assemble and use . Handy for those patchy places where it isl not worth the time and effort to grab out the riding mower .
5 #### I use this all the time for small meat pies . Just use a little water to seal it tight . They are beautiful !
5 #### Irwins 6 Quick Grip clamp can be useful for a variety of construction and do it yourself tasks , particularly for holding together parts while glue dries . It is easy to use , position in place , and release when you are done . The clamp has a fixed jaw , and a movable jaw which slides along a rail . The maximum spread is about 6 . Depressing a plastic lever allows you to pump the jaws closer together , while pressing a metal trigger releases the clamp . The mechanism that holds the moveable jaw in position is very reliable , although it can occasionally slip . The yellow rubber pads at the end of the jaws have a smooth finish , so if traction is required , you might not always have a good grip . The depth of the clamp is about 2.4 , and you can usually increase the effective surface area , by placing a suitable flat object between the jaws , although there is a limit to what can be achieved . Within its limits , this tool does an excellent job . Irwins 6 clamp is a much larger more rugged version of their&nbsp ; , and is better suited to heavier duty tasks . Given that it can do so much more , the higher cost of the 6 clamp seems appropriate . If you need a simple slider type clamp , take a look at these two models and see which may best meet your needs .
1 #### clearly this is not a good chime . when the wind blows , you can BARELY HERE the tones , in fact almost no tones . do not waste your money on this one . it is junk . bill perreault
5 #### Excellent lights for the exterior- Bulb hangs upside down , easy to insert and replace . Gives full light effect with clear glass front and sides . Nice !
5 #### I have a Multimaster and since the patent expired on the blade holding method , other brands are now available Now I can afford to use it without fear of blade breakage . The Fein blades are still my favorite because the Multimaster is a industrial grade tool and the blades are too . Fein blades on sale makes it that much better .
5 #### I have been composting a long time but this stuff really helps with break down !
2 #### These were not the size that I expected . Amazon used to sell a size for my tiny feeders , but no more . I have several of the tiny size , and no source of replacement bee guards .
5 #### Seriously , everybody should own a pair of these . Pull hoses , cut wire , deal with electrical connections , you name it . Pull some nails even , I 'd wager they can take it . Made in America with quality nothing short of excellent ( FYI , the steel used for Channellock pliers is also made on American soil ) . I 've used lots of pliers , from SK to Snap - on to Kleins to Knipex to your run - of - the - mill Chinese stuff , and these have quality that is very close to the professional brands . Personally these are my go - to pliers for those tight , awkward spaces where my other tools just wo n't do the trick . They are very rugged and the grips are comfortable . For ten bucks , it 's a steal of a deal . Grab a pair .
4 #### Very handy attachment if you need to cut a precise hole in something . The cutting guide feels a little flimsy . You have to really check it when you are tightening it up because it can lock at a slight angle . The bits are good . They have no trouble cutting through wood . You just have to take your time and not force it to cut fast .
5 #### This S56 chain fits my Makita UC4030A electric chain saw . Price is cheaper than Home depot by about 6 dollars . At this price I will keep a few on hand and sharpen them later . Oregon 's web site lists what chains fit which saws .
5 #### I was able to set up a chicken ladder to get on my metal barn roof using these and a heavy - duty extension ladder ( the roof is about 22 feet from eave to ridge ) . I clamped a 2x6 to the bottom of the ladder for extra support -- I do n't think I would have felt comfortable using only the ladder hooks . The wheels enabled me to position the ladder on the roof by myself .
4 #### Good buy . We had one before but decided to get a higher model
5 #### This pressure cooker works great . The rubber gasket and stopper ca n't go in the dishwasher but the other parts can . I use this to make beans about twice a week and it produces a result much better than when I was boiling them before . This is also pretty big - would recommend looking at an equivalent sized vessel in person before purchasing . I also like that 's it 's stainless steel as opposed to aluminum .
5 #### We have used several of the FlowerHouse greenhouses over many years and have found that each of them are well made and great for each application that we want to use them for . The FarmHouse has a good amount of room and we are able to have home grown vegetables almost year round . With windows , screens and the small opening for electric cords or hoses it is easy to heat or have good ventilation . A great product - used much and contributes to a happy healthy and well feed family .
5 #### I was tired of unscrewing and rescrewing the four wing nuts on my old stabilizer every time I wanted to change height . This one is truly awesome . It 's so quick & easy to take on and off that I do n't ever leave it on when I pack up the ladder any more . This makes storing / transporting ladder much easier . Now I just put ladder up & see where I want the stand - off then bring it down and throw it on there in a few seconds . It really is as easy as they say , and I have yet to have any sign of weakness from it . Built very sturdy . The only thing is the rubber end caps come off with the abuse I give it , so I had to duct tape them on , but I do n't see that as a flaw since we are pretty ruff on the thing .
1 #### Pin fits sloppy in hole and strikes hole off center more often then not . I can do a better job freehand .
5 #### This is miracle dirt ! I started using this a couple of years ago and all my plants look great ! A little goes a long way !
5 #### I love this blade . I bought it primarily for it 's flat kerf , but it has become my main blade . Chip out rivals my finishing blade , but it cuts so quickly and effortlessly .
1 #### I bought from Amazon 2 years back or so . Performance is hit or miss . Sometimes it works and sometimes steam escapes here and there and the pot fails to build sufficient pressure . Not a reliable appliance . Will be trashing it and replace it with a better product
5 #### I bought these a year ago and only used them once because of the hulls being hard to get off so I threw a handful in soil to see if they 'd grow well and grow they did !
2 #### I 've used these Fiskars micro - tip snippers for over ten years . Back in the day , the handles were darker gray in color and they lasted a long time . Ever since they started making them with lighter gray handles with a more pronounced stipple grip , the quality has deteriorated . The spring in the middle is now a very flimsy plastic , which breaks after prolonged use . I 'm not positive if the older pruners had a metal spring instead of plastic , but I do know that the older version of these lasted 3 - 4x longer . The springs break on the newer types after a month or two of use . There are more heavy duty types of these snippers available , but I always preferred the Fiskars brand due to them being ultra light - weight .
5 #### Well finally , I must have been through ten nozzles that broke within a season then I found this one . It not only sprays water nicely from a gentle cone ( watering plants ) to a near torpedo - like stream ( cleaning house sidings ) but it has lasted me two years already so I ordered this second one for my second hose . The outside is made of rubber so when you drop it on the ground , it wo n't hurt the nozzle . Smart design . Love it .
5 #### I have a 12qt Mirro pressure canner / cooker M-0512 - 11 . This is the correct replacement gasket . I would recommend that users NOT oil the gasket as directed on the package . I did that as directed with my 0598 canner , added water and ran a ' test ' on the empty canner . The canner sealed and built pressure , however , gasket stuck to the canner so the lid would not open without MUCH aggravation and pounding . Thankfully it was EMPTY of food products for the test . After getting the lid to finally come off , I washed the gasket in soapy water , scrubbed the edges of the canner with steel wool where the gasket had stuck and 're - tested ' the gasket WITH OUT OIL / LUBRICANT . It sealed , built pressure and opened perfectly . Again , DO NOT LUBRICATE the gasket with vegetable oil ... in fact , I would n't lubricate it at all . Just soak , wash and use .
1 #### This is the cheapest made product I 've ever owned . To insert the 2 batteries , there is no flap that you open . You have to take the whole handle apart with a screwdriver , then the circuit board falls out and the 2 switches fall out to the floor . Insert the batteries , put circuit board and switches back in , insert each tiny tiny screw and the nut ( 3 each ) , hoping the screw does n't fall out while you 're holding the nut . Are you kidding ? I 'm returning this , because I do n't want to go through this each time i need to change the batteries . I just bought another one that uses 2 D size batteries , you just insert the batteries into the flip open compartment in the handle .
5 #### I have 2 of these , one for house and one for RV . I love it . Works like a dream , easy to clean . Have bought 2 for grands and one grand bought one for her aunt . So , our family really like this .
5 #### good price and fits my Heavy Duty 12 gauge cables well . Fits perfectly in the spare tire rim . Stitching and canvas is pretty heavy duty .
2 #### I picked through several tape measures in this price range . With little else to separate the competition I elected to purchase this one due to its being made in the USA . At least that is what the product description said . I discovered upon delivery that it was in fact made in Thailand . I have been an avid woodworker for 20 years and have worn out a few tape measures in that time . I wanted one made in USA because they are typically higher quality and will last longer . Upon inspection this item does not measure up to the quality of the Stanley models I have owned in the past .
5 #### Good quality , durable measuring tape . I have used these for decades and they work great . I highly recommend this quality product .
5 #### I was able to mash 7 large potatoes into creamy perfection within 10 seconds . I 've never been able to do that before . Better than even a food processor . The handle is shorter than most mashers , allowing superior leverage . Plus , the size and design of the mashing head allows the potatoes to freely squish through the masher , making it easier and not allowing overmashing . The potatoes are mashed perfectly .
4 #### Fit my barbecue just right and seems to be of decent workmanship and material . We 'll see what winter does to it .
1 #### I got this parchment paper to put pizza on before putting it all on the hot pizza stone . The parchment comes folded in 3 like a letter , and after the first ( very careful ) use , the paper began to spontaneously tear along one of the fold lines . I 've had similar products that have lasted for years . This one is inadequately flimsy , and not worth buying .
5 #### Excellent ! ! ! I love it!!!The quality very good and I need it for my job ! I like this items very much ! ! !
4 #### I 'm using this for a 14 " Jet Bandsaw . It 's a great value and it 's pretty sturdy . the levers are plastic but I 've had no problem with them and I 'm able to move my bandsaw easily around my shop . Once you open the box you will see the corners , the wheels , levers , and the steel sides . Assembly is pretty straightforward although the corners with the fixed wheels seem to have very little overlap for the sides . It might be possible to get more overlap by aligning the sides and then adding the bolt that goes through the wheels . Overall , I 'm pretty happy with this product and the price and I 'm planning to get a couple more for other tools .
5 #### Works Great ! ! Replaced original with same name . Hope to get another 20 years .
4 #### I like this tool . It would be nice if the blade was sharper , but in normal soil it works great .
1 #### In my experience , the Corona Clipper GS 6750 Grass Shear is an over - rated , work making tool . Tools should save work , not add work onto the job . It seems to me that these clippers require more energy than they are worth . As another reviewer said , they tend to get material stuck between the blades , perhaps requiring a strong spring to make the tool spring open , so that the jamming does not occur as often . So , any grassy material that requires energy to cut is added to the energy - taking spring back pressure . Also these shears open quite widely , making the [ un - padded ] handles difficult to grip around and impossible for smaller hands.to use . I returned them and started looking for an alternative . I found these shears , the Zenport Heavy Duty Landscaper 's Grass Shear [ Item # ZL119 ] . They work quite well so far . They require less energy and will pivot to a variety of blade positions . They are not yet on Amazon so I bought them from an alternate merchant , but since Amazon carries other models of Zenport clippers , they may begin to carry these .
5 #### I will be honest , I had a problem with the first cover I ordered but have since not had a single problem . I use the cover to extend my swimming season by using it in early spring to warm up the water and then again in the fall to keep it warm . This does exactly that . Take not , you have to reduce the amount of chemicals in your pool if you use this cover . Chlorine will eat it up if you do not lower your dosage .
5 #### appears to be a quality sprinkler head , have not used all the functions , hope it lasts
3 #### It 's no doubt only a " one season " cover , but for the price that will do .
5 #### Who does n't need a good whisk ? OXO makes good products , and I bought it at a good price . It 's well made , cleans easily , and is comfortable to grip .
3 #### If you are like me and rarely drink wine this should last a long time and I would recommend this . It seems sturdy enough for a plastic opener . If I went through a lot of wine I would buy one that was n't plastic .
5 #### Not sure what to evaluate . I have owned Stanley tools , and this blade , for many years . Stanley ALWAYS meets my expectations ; this item no exception . The blades are sharp and seem to last as long as I expected ! I do like the ease to " eject " the blades , from the holder ! !
5 #### and cleans well and looks fine . Fits my hands well and works great . Is this the British company Oxo in London ?
5 #### Doin' what they 're supposed to do . Would purchase again if the need arises .
5 #### I love my new vegetable brush . It not only looks good , it 's strong as well . It is the perfect fit too ... holding it in my hand to scrub cantaloupe , cucumbers , and potatoes seems so natural . There 's no stress trying to hold onto it while scrubbing . This is the best vegetable brush I 've ever owned ( and I 'm 65 so I 've had my share of brushes before ) .
5 #### a great product ! Got the units last year because for the first time ever our kitties(3 ) got fleas and between the advantage and this product got rid of them . I ordered refill in case we had a problem again . We have not had a problem with fleas , however did discover black carpet beetles . Took a few months to track down what they were . Put on the units with new refills in and have discovered that they like these units ! they are attracted to light so in they go and out they do not come . have also caught a spider and ant . These are great for Fleas and other insects . HIGHLY RECOMMEND ! ! !
5 #### Super good material , thick cast iron , cakes come out with crispy crust and moist insides every single time ! i love this pan , would buy it again .
3 #### Liquid Fence 113 Deer and Rabbit Repellent Does n't last long , especially if it rains or if its irrigated where applied . Got ta be applied at least once / week , at least where I live with ...
5 #### I bought this for my moms older weed eater . When searching for a replacement battery the cost exceeded the worth of the machine , however was very happy to find a replacement battery here on Amazon at a reasonable price . My mom reports that the battery is working well .
5 #### got this for my mom ... i have had the same one for several years and it is in top shape ! very easy to use , holds alot and does a great job ... easy to clean , too . great kitchen tool !
4 #### I have this model on my band saw so got another one for my new table saw . My new table saw weighs a little over 400 pounds and the mobile base says it 's good to 500 pounds but it seems a little flimsy for that much weight . I think maybe I should have gotten the HTC 3000 instead of the 2000 . Oh well it wo n't get moved very often .
5 #### Nicely designed and manufactured . Measuring up to industry tool by Starrett . Should have bought this from day one .
5 #### Nice grater and great design . It folds to a compact size or you can take it apart and store in 2 pieces . I really like that it is stainless steel - no worry about rust .
5 #### Works very well . I covered two ATV seats with it already . Staples can be hard to locate .
5 #### Well made valve . I keep a couple in my RV to add some flexibility to my water connections .
5 #### We have used this season after season and it keeps the deer from eating our flowers and shrubs ! This product arrived as described with fast service and good packaging . We are very satisfied ! We just could n't be happier !
5 #### Bought this for my work truck . Nice . Compact . Not much to say . It 's sitting in my toolbox . Hope to never have to use it .
5 #### Love this axe . Bought it for my brother in law after he got a fireplace and he loves it too . Really nice cover over the blade too
5 #### The title says it all . No more squirrels eating my bird food . I still feed the squirrels corn and a few nuts . THey finally gave up on the feeder .
5 #### Hands down this is amazing ! ! ! Great product at a great price . Purchased for dad for a replacement as his quit working . He loves it . Will probably buy one for me now .
5 #### I used this for the first time a couple of days ago , to make some pan sauce for prime rib . I do n't know how I ever got along without it ! The flat part is big , and covers vast areas of the pan at one time . It 's angled for more efficient use , and it can also be used as a spatula if necessary . What 's not to love ?
5 #### worked great we have 3 of them placed in the house .
5 #### If you do trim work for a living , you ca n't afford not to have one of these . I have installed stair treads with and without this guide and I will never do one without it again . It will pay for itself on the first job in saved time . I have never seen a perfectly square inside to inside stairwell , and this guide will let you cut perfect treads every time . Well made , and 5 stars rating .
5 #### Does the job its supposed to . Fits and looks clean . All screws were there .
3 #### Makes great popovers ! But I recommend hand washing and drying because the weld points have started to rust on mine just after the second run through the dishwasher .
5 #### Perfect fit for my Poulan chainsaw . Another bar that is very well manufactured with tight tolerances .
4 #### Easy to use , easy to follow directions and helped me adjust what fertilizer I was using on my lawn . I will buy this product again .
5 #### I ordered this for my aunt who loves to attract hummingbirds to her back patio . Thought it and a little hummingbird swing would combine for a great birthday gift for one of my favorite ladies . The nectar arrived in good shape and right on time .
5 #### These worked out pretty well for me . They served the purpose . The orange one is a bit tiny , but I do n't think that has anything to do with the brand .
5 #### Standby that does the job and holds up . I ve tried a half dozen brands and styles and I keep coming back to these . I own and use both the 16 and 25 foot , zero complaints with the product .
3 #### fair for the price the filter media is rather light but very easy to wash out
5 #### You no longer need to be a pro to do crown moulding . These stops are awesome .
4 #### excellent product . only thing i found that i did n't like was there was no lip over the entry hole to keep the rain out . i live in florida and it resins a lot here . i have two of them - just put them in the trees today and am waiting ............
5 #### This works great under my band saw . When it is time to use the saw , I wheel it out . When I am done , the saw gets wheeled out of the way . Assembly was easy , just look at the pictures and make sure you 've got everything right before tightening up the bolts . The product works great . If I had more equipment to move around , I 'd pick up another base for it .
5 #### These fit easily and snug on my old ladder . Appear to be very durable . Exactly as pictured and described on Amazon .
5 #### nice feeder ........ wasps & bees ca n't quite figure it out .... small capacity is only problem ... easy to fill & clean ......
4 #### They cut very smoothly . The difficulty in adjusting the blades for smooth cutting on all blades was probably because of the joiner rather than the blades . They do a beautiful job .
5 #### A nice little gadget but limited uses due to all the nonstick items .
4 #### Very happy with this purchase . Seems well made for the price . Not as wide a cut as my Corona 6481 but Fiskars is my tool of choice when using in the field .
2 #### Worked well but somewhat loud . It 's a manual timer so it 's spring driven so it sounds like it ... Loud ticking . Plus one you turn it you are stuck and have to wait until it goes off .
1 #### I did n't see the folded paper with the instructions fall out of the packaging onto the table at first , so I was looking at the cardboard packaging for them when what do I see but a warning that this thing contains dangerous chemicals , including lead , so make sure you wash your hands after handling it . I BEG YOUR PARDON ? ? The print is small enough to give a lawyer a stiffy and there is n't any way anyone would pay attention to the printing on the package if they found the instructions first . I do n't care if this thing could be programmed to rake my leaves and bring me tea and oranges in bed , if I had seen that warning before purchasing it , I would have just kept going . So consider yourself warned .
5 #### I used a multi - tool for many , many years to crimp wire connectors , sometimes crushing the connectors or not getting a sufficient crimp . With this tool , crimps are perfect every time . Very pleased with this purchase .
5 #### Easy to install . Looks great and lasts . Had one of these on my old house . Did n't even realize there was a storage compartment . Man is that convenient !
1 #### There is alot written about this grill 's problem with regulator flow etc . I have been to Weber 's site , read through the reviews of the problem , and ca n't get the grill above 200F because I use a regular size home propane tank . the woman on the phone from weber was nice , and walked me through the startup steps , but still a pathetic little flame was all we got . She suggested a new regulator , but since I 've already replaced it once , I think I 'll just junk this grill . I hear if you use the little disposables that this problem does n't exist , but that is n't exactly sustainable , is it ? there has to be a better way to engineer this grill . in the meantime , find another one if you intend to use a full size home tank .
5 #### I 'm not sure how this is an Amazon Prime item , but takes 4 - 5 days to arrive . Aside form that , it seems fine . $ 20 is n't bad for this size .
2 #### This blender replaced a Sunbeam I had for 30 years . The jar is oversized and supported by small blades placed in a small opening at the base of vessel , isolated from the mass inside . It takes forever to blend anything smooth . After operating the motor for more than a few moments it begins to emit a strong burning smell . The plastic drive assembly for the blades snapped off in the first week of use . Cuisinart replaced one free . The second one cost about twenty dollars . I would not recommend this blender , there are better choices .
5 #### I already had three of these units . When I saw this as a Black Friday Deal I could n't pass it up . It 's not the latest model , but it offers superior protection for my electronics and has plenty of outlets for all sizes of plugs . Highly recommend .
5 #### This paring knife is well made , like every Henckels I 've had . It is very well balanced with a large handle for ease of use . Stays sharp . Ca n't go wrong with this one .
5 #### Easy to read measurements and stainless steel are all good features that I wanted in this set , nice for the black and stainless theme most people have .
5 #### The battery works well , holds a charge well and powers the drill for a reasonable length of time when the drill is used . Seems as good as the original batteries when new . Prolongs the life of a great drill . I would buy a second except they are a bit pricey . Doing a big deck project , the first one has been great so bought the second . Update Still working just fine after all this time .
5 #### Nice little unit . Just what I needed for occasional use .
4 #### I bought this to control my indoor floor lamp . At first , the light would cycle on and off ( every 20 - 30 seconds ) after dusk . Well , of course the lamp 's light was telling the sensor to cut the power , then once the light had been off for a few seconds the sensor turned the power back on . My bad . So I used a small length of blue tape to form a cup around the photovoltaic eye ( so the lamp light would not directly hit it ) and now life is good . It would be nice if the company would include some sort of optional shield to perform the same function .
4 #### What can you say . Simply the best fertilizer and amazingly inexpensive . I 've even started rooting cuttings in a double strength soaking of this for about 12 hours , with terrific efficacy .
5 #### I have 4 different kinds of flooring in my house plus rugs .. I have a dog that sheds an unholy amount as well . THIS IS THE BEST . It cleans all floors / rug and gets ALL dog hair
5 #### These bags are as pictured and work perfectly . Older machine so finding bags are hard . Great fit and seem to have oder protection or a sweet smell all their own .
5 #### Best medium campers axe in existence . My first one was stolen on a Canadian camping trip . This is a replacement .
4 #### I believe this product is probably worth the money for the additional quality . This item is made in the U.S.A.
5 #### Worked great and fair price . Inserted very easily , then turned easy and pulling out the core was easy . Very happy .
3 #### I got this to use with my Dewalt DWE575SB circular saw . I slipped the rip fence through the hole in the saw 's base plate and tightened the included knob . However , the rip fence wiggles quite a bit and I have the knob as tight as I can get . But I cut an 8 inch wide by 8 foot long strip from a sheet of 3/4 inch plywood and the width of the cut was consistent . It appears that the wiggle does n't effect the cut but it still makes me nervous . I only have the one circular saw so I ca n't try the fence on another saw to see if it has the same wiggle .
5 #### I really like this item . It is easy to use , if a potato or similar vegetable gets stuck , just push it back and do it again . It does require you vegetables to fit into the cutter , but I did not find this a problem . Blades are sharp , easy to change and to clean . I really could not find anything to complain about , it is sturdy and I hope to pass it down to my daughter .
5 #### I am over - the - moon happy with this spoon rest . I love stainless steel . It looks great on my stove , and it cleans easily . I was very pleasantly surprised when I opened the box to find a spoon rest of this size and weight for the price I paid . I wo n't ever use another .
5 #### not much to say other than to say the product arrived and it worked funny thing is i actually did not need it it turned out to be faulty wiring and not the breaker
5 #### the best , and easy to clean sap off if you own 2 + . Just stick the tips of the most recently used in a shot glass filled w olive oil , take out the old pair in the glass ( well you do what order you prefer ) , wipe w paper towel annnnnd GO
5 #### This vacuum picks up well on the low pile carpet I use it on and the brush is great for dusting the walls . The hose is plenty long enough for me . It is loud and can get hot but I do n't know that that can be avoided with any vacuum . It 's only going to run for a little while so the noise should not be an issue . I ordered some bags along with it because I heard they can be hard to find . I would buy this again if I needed to . It is not too heavy to pick up and take from room to room one - handed . All - in - all I really like it for its size and suction power .
5 #### I left my other one out doors for two days and ruined it . But I had to buy another one . This is a great product
5 #### I bought this after ordering the Channellock 4 1/2 " adjustable wrench which I am very pleased with . Got the pliers today and they are very high quality plus American made . " Handier than a pocket on a shirt " as my friend Harvey Lacy would say .
5 #### I just got this to have as a spare . I should have purchased two for my Flowtron unit uses two separate BF-150 bulbs .
1 #### will easily bend in hard soil but for 3 dollars prime shipping included you get what you pay for .
5 #### Bought as a replacement when my wife snapped last one in half ... don't worry , it was n't the knife 's fault she was prying open a package . Needless to say she is banned from the knife block . Works really well for paring and peeling .
5 #### sturdy and gets the job done . I would buy again . Fits comfortably in my hand
5 #### I have eighteen in all . This one looks very well with the others . I am glad I took the time to select this house as part of the set .
5 #### oxo stuff is the best , so their cheese slicer ( kaasschaaf ) did not disappoint . nice and sharp , good thickness of cut . dishwasher safe .
5 #### I bought this to rinse quinoa and am pleased with it . The wet quinoa slides right out , which surprised me . I thought it would be a mess to get out .
4 #### Good strong rake . I really like the design where the handle has a rod going through it . Our last rake came out and was hard to clamp back in place . Thanks !
4 #### Birds loved and having bird seed delivered to my door wonderful .
5 #### We have three Kuhn Rikon pressure cookers that we use almost every time we cook - this is the main cookware we use . It 's fast , easy , and it saves energy becaue it takes less time to cook . And the food 's great - I like eating at home better than any restaurant .
3 #### I 've been using Stanley Fatmax tapes exclusively for about 10 years now , I lost one on a job site and bought this model as a replacement , This is the first FatMax i have had that explicitly states " Made In the USA " on the tape . Well , this thing is about 1/2 the tape measure of my old FatMax . It looks like the printer was half out of ink printing the numbers and lines on the tape . The spring also seems much weaker , and the tape itself just does n't seem as sturdy . The Plastic / Rubber body of the tape measure unit is still of high quality however . In my picture you can see my 10 + year old tape on the bottom , crisp clean lines and numbers , and the brand new never used tape on the top that i just received from Amazon .
5 #### It has been working great for mole tunnels . I think you need a bigger one if you are trying to level an older yard .
5 #### I have numerous Oregon chain saws - some in need of sharpening . I seen a video on U - Tube about sharpening and it clicked - I can do that and save money and time running back and forth to a shop . Oregon makes quality products and this is amongst them . I recommend it t anyone who want to keep that chain sharp and bringing out chunks and not sawdust .
5 #### I carried one of these for several years and the blades maintained their edge very well through daily use . After mine was stolen , I opted to get the exact same knife and I have not been disappointed .
5 #### They 're easy and comfortable to use . I use these bad boys to cut through vinyl and sheet metal . The long handles and straight cutting edges make easy work of both materials .
5 #### great power and silent while in use . It keeps my bathroom dry including towels .
4 #### I like it . I bought it to clean the cobwebs in my basement , but I also used it to clean my stairs too and other areas . It has a lot of power . The reason for the four stars is that it does not have a self - winding cord . I failed to notice this .
5 #### These bulbs are every bit as good as those from Home Depot . No , they are better . Their cost is eighty percent less .
5 #### These are the most clear sounding chimes I have ever owned . I can see how the creator , being a Grammy award winning musician , used his skill and expertise to create them . They are not just chimes , they are really a musical instrument . The tones have a long sustain and mellow sound . They are not harsh or " tinny " , they are so clear they ring like a bell . These were made with such quality workmanship . You can see how even the solid wood pieces that strike the tubes , are made from quality wood . I will definitely purchase more chimes , from Woodstock , for family and friends this Christmas .
5 #### Great value for such a fine product , as all the Amco mixing bowls are the highest quality . This " 2 - qt . " size is about the size of a large cereal bowl . It 's sturdy and has a half - inch lip which makes it easy to hold and can be used for anything . I doubled up on the 4- and 6 - qt . sizes . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ CAVEAT : However , if you 're measuring , this bowl comfortably holds 1.5 - quarts of liquid volume , which translates into 1.29 - quarts of dry volume . If you need accurate [ liquid ] volumes for mixing bowls , buy the Tovolo , Roscan , or Cook Pro brands . ( The kitchen industry is riddled with these measuring inaccuracies . ) Or just move up one size and get the Roscan or Cook Pro Stainless Steel 3 - qt . bowl -- they 're exactly the same . It 's accurate and a sufficient size that handles most any job short of the need for a 6 - qt . bowl .
5 #### got this for my 4 year old that likes to help in the kitchen -- it does n't slide around and the handle is perfect for little hands
5 #### This was the 2nd West Bend 82306 model we 've had and the 1st one lasted us for over 10 years ; and we make popcorn 3 + times a week ! It 's easy to use , pops quickly , and makes delicious healthy popcorn ! Clean up is a breeze - bonus . The only advice worth mentioning to existing or prospective buyers is : Do n't screw the stirring rod on too tightly as creates extra wear and tear on the hot popping surface , and makes a noise . Fear not , the stirring stick wo n't come off with a light to medium attachment to the base .
5 #### Really pulls the bugs to and then takes care of them .
5 #### I had a smaller chopper of a different brand but wanted one that had a little larger bowl . This one is perfect . Thanks to my Daughter for recommending it .
5 #### love it use it so often and this is the second one I have ordered as the first one blew a gasket or something but for the money I will order again when need be .
1 #### I ordered this product and the part that sprays out the water is not working and I had to contact Gilmour to be able to get a replacement part . Plus Gilmour is going out of business and will not be Bosch company I think . They said they will send me the replacement part . It was so disappointing to have a new sprayer and it would not spray the fine spray mist but it sprayed water .
1 #### These would be great if they were marked correctly . In my set , the 1 cup measuring cup is inscribed with the legend " 1/3 cup " . Nice quality control , guys . If you are looking for precision , look elsewhere .
5 #### What can I say , they are Ridgid brand and very good quality , never buy a cheap pipe wrench . I am just using these for home use , but have some of the same Ridgid pipe wrenches that I use at work . And if you are deciding between Aluminum and steel , no question go with the Aluminum .
1 #### Weak tines ..... spring action is great . Already have similar rake from many years past . The tines are sturdier and is an excellent thatch rake . This would suffice as a leaf rake . It is over priced . Found the same rake at the hardware s tore for $ 10 less .
5 #### Looks great works great it is great . I used this for many things and i really enjoyed it ; Great price too
5 #### This is Luis A 's wife : In love with OXO products . Sturdy whisk , works well
3 #### Not as easy to use as the trigger type when washing a car because you have to continually twist to the spray pattern you want over and over again every time you set it down and pick it back up . Perhaps it is better suited for the tasks that you do not have to continually set it down and pick it up again .
4 #### I purchased this lawn mower in 2003 and it 's worked well but finally died ( 2008)(I'm fairly sure the thermal circuit breaker finally went out ) . This lawn mower was stored in an unheated garage during bitter cold Minnesota winters , yet battery power remained reasonable until it just died . I 've always preferred electric lawn mowers over gas ones . It 's nice to use a maintenance free product . This mower did have difficulties in deep grass ( and I mean really deep - like two feet high ) and never really had enough battery power to cut a full 3/4 acre . I would say on average it can cut just about a half acre on a single charge . The wheels became a bit wobbly over the past year but still worked fine .
5 #### I love Nordic Ware . This is a pretty pink and heavy duty pan . I have already made several cakes with this pan . Easy to released once properly prepared . Easy to clean . Comes with a cute little protective cover .
5 #### Great pump . Got it for easy water changes with the python system .
5 #### OXO is so much better than the type with the string pull spinner . We use the large bowl when we make Big salads
3 #### The squirrels really only care for the peanuts . The sunflower seeds and the corn remain untouched for the most part . It does seem to attract the magpies , but they do n't seem too interested in eating any of the food .
5 #### Makes popcorn light and airy , then just add toppings if you wish !
1 #### I bought and returned two of these . The first was missing the plug at the end which contains an unnecessary plastic pin to clear the jets ( do n't people own pins anymore ? ) . The second had the missing part but that did n't help much . The tiny tabs which hold it in place were no match for the o - ring which relies on their strength to compress and seal it in place ! As soon as the water was turned on one tab broke off and it leaked as if it was n't there . In an attempt to add an unimportant feature the entire usefulness of the product was sacrificed ! Trying to hit a price point , not produce a useful product !
5 #### Perfect size for when I am building walls for our buildings at work .
5 #### My old double boiler was developing a rounded bottom and I wanted to replace it . It also was a Farberware . This one is a little smaller than the one I had but works well .
3 #### I only gave it a 3 star because the handle is very loose . It needs a screw that is at least 1/4 of an inch longer . It keeps coming loose . Other than that it would be a great pressure cooker . It could be very dangerous if the handle falls off .
5 #### Fit my Shop - Vac correctly . Terrific improvement in vacuum . Had purchased a reusable cartridge filter previously , but that was a mistake , as it did n't work as well and quickly got dented up while trying to knock the dust out . This filter is inexpensive and performs well .
3 #### This is an inexpensive plane that has limited adjustment , but it works great for the price .
5 #### I have used these on several remodel jobs and installed many cabinets . They make for a better job and almost necessary to hang cabinets without a second person .
5 #### I love this because of the markings of different measurements . The lid is also a plus in my estimation for storage
5 #### This I absolutely love ! ! ! ! Having two cats , this is just so handy and efficient . It 's so lightweight and has a lot of power . Use it everyday and one day down the road , I 'll be ordering another one .
5 #### As you can see , most of these reviews are very old . I have one and it is very sturdy and designed quite well . The lifting mechanism works great and is a great improvement over most of the more inexpensive systems that require moving each side separately . I would definitely recommend this system - its a nice dark forest green and the paint job is excellent - you could put it in the living room and it would look just fine . I ca n't comment on shipping and packing as I bought mine at a retail store but I would have to say the package itself seems pretty well packed so if anything breaks I would say the retailer you bought it from did not protect it well enough in the shipping box . It is , afterall , a lightbulb and should be shipped as such , with plenty of pellets .
5 #### This review will be short : if you own a Baby Q , you need this cover . It is ample in size and it seems to be fairly heavy duty . I have used this cover for about 8 months and I am completely satisfied with it . It is sturdy and it keeps the smells of the grill contained when the grill is being stored . Well worth the investment .
5 #### Am I really doing this ? Reviewing a pair of salad tongs ? What has my life become . Well anything to help you in your quest to choose from among the many and varied salad tongs out there . I like that these are stainless . Have a nice heft to them . Great for salad . Also works for scooping up soil , picking up dead flies , pinching the better half 's bottom , etc . Washes clean especially after the pinching .
5 #### When my husband first bought this ( wife writing review ) I thought why do I need this .... I have a vacuum . After using it once , I was hooked . For such a little thing it really does the job . So many times when I need to just spot vacuum , this is so handy to use instead of pulling out the big vacuum and unwinding the cord . Works great on our hardwood floors , easily goes way under dressers and shelves . Like that it has the extra battery . The battery life is only 15 mins or less so it is helpful to have your other battery charged and ready to use . We bought several for our church to vacuum the pews . I would repurchase this product again .
5 #### I bought some of Greg Horner 's products while on vacation in Alaska . I was so surprised to find a few pieces on amazon . I have a lot of his pins and zipper pulls . Beautiful . I love his work .
4 #### Saved me from leaving warps & gaps in my new hardwood deck . I managed to mangle a few 2 x 6 framing members , but no harm to the finished job . It would have been a bear without it .
1 #### I do n't usually leave such low reviews , but in this case , I ca n't let you buy this unit without warning you about the quality of it . First of all , the front knob is not a knob at all , but a stump , which makes it nearly impossible to use the plane safely , unless you have the hands of a 3 year old . Second , the blade adjustments are incredibly stiff and not accurate at all , no matter how much I tried , the blade would not match the pre - set adjustment . The unit is heavy enough , but that 's all it 's got going for itself . I suggest you look for a better quality unity , that will most likely cost a bit more . It 's true you get what you pay for , this plane is the poster child of that old saying .
5 #### Very good product . Highly recommend them . Noting bad to say about them . Amazing that I can still find bags for my 1960 's canister vacuum .
5 #### I am using this to automatically operate the lights on my roof deck . The unit works exactly as I 'd hoped . Note that there is no sensitivity adjustment : you must accept the default settings for the amount of light at which the switch operates . For me , this worked out well .
5 #### High quality tool . Perfectly made , functional , well balanced and feels solid just like all Channellock USA - made tools .
1 #### the one i received had no suction at all . very disappointed . was very lightweight though I must say
5 #### Works great ! I love the size of this cooker . Very good quality .
2 #### I purchased my first one just over 2 years ago . I got distracted and left it on for about1.5 hours and it never worked again . However , it had also been brewing an inconsistent volume for a few months , in spite of daily cleaning and recommended maintenance . So I thought I would try again since I had saved hundreds of dollars by avoiding Starbucks . Number two arrived and I was obviously excited . But alas , the coffee holder leaked . No problem - I used the one from my old machine . So a few weeks ago , again , the volume of coffee becomes inconsistent . But I figure after spending $ 300 on two units , I could work with it . Well would n't you know it , I left it on again today - close to 2 hours . And when I went to make coffee , it spewed steam everywhere . Argh ! Since I make at least 2 cups a day , I need to find a reliable machine and I 'm fairly certain this one is n't it .
3 #### I read the negative reviews and bought the trap anyway because I wanted a humane trap ; just could n't bring myself to kill the one mouse that seemed to have snuck into my house . I posted a picture ; the trap is smaller than a dollar bill . I found that I was " waiting up " and checking the mousetrap every half hour , because any mouse that it caught would certainly die rather quickly in there . A traditional mouse trap would be more humane if one could n't release the catch within minutes of a trap . I never did catch a mouse with it ; I grew tired of checking the thing too often ... I wish the trap were just a little bit bigger ... but as it is , it is too small for a mouse to live for more than a few minutes .
5 #### I have two other Farberware Stockpots . Both are 12 quart . I usually make chicken soup using 60 thighs in those two pots . I wanted to up my quantity so I can keep the kids ' families in chicken soup . A 16 quart pot added to my other two will be perfect for the job . The pot is beautifully made , as are my other pots . I 've been making this soup for over 40 years , so I know they last and last . These pots will probably be used by my grandkids till they are grandmoms .
4 #### I know , glass has some problems associated with it but the plastic is a bit too cheesy . Nice , heavy glass . It looks great otherwise . Something you might see in a movie involving a primitive lab . Except it would be made of glass . ( Can you tell that I like glass for this product ? ) . But the best part is not having to calculate all those measurements and conversions . This is now the measuring cup of choice in my house . It IS nearly perfect ( if it was made of glass it would definitely be perfect . )
5 #### I have a lot of wood working machines and they tend to rust as the weather changes cleaned them all up and sprayed all of them with this product seams to be a good fix for the rusting problem .
5 #### Bought this for back up - item appears to be just fine .
5 #### Perfect size for crevices of even the smallest hummingbird feeder . The handles may be plastic but are long lasting with strong bristles . Excellent product for anyone who cares to properly maintain hummingbird feeders free of the mold that hide and builds that will poison hummingbirds ! Doubt a better brush could be made except to cost far more . I have used these for many , many years now . They 're perfect !
5 #### Gave this as a Christmas gift and our friend loves it !
3 #### They arrived quickly and well packed , we followed the directions to the letter ( husband 's a - rentitive ) and chose the healthiest plants from the garden center . They 've been up 3 weeks and so far the ones in our deck planters are 4x the size with fruit on . The strawberry planters are terrific , we 'll be replacing these with them at the end of the season " clear out " sale .
4 #### These clamp pads have helped make a set of cheap pipe clamps more useable with that little bit of cushioning and face area , so very happy about that !
5 #### The fine adjustment works great . I use it with Dewalt 611 for doing everything from inlay work to installing hinges , the adjustments are precise and hold on well for repeated cuts .
5 #### Bought this , because I could not find a popover pan with more than 6 cups . But this is not bad , just about right the size I was looking for .
3 #### I 'm a long time fan of Oxo products , but this is n't one of my favorites . Based on an earlier review , I bought this to use with cookie dough as well as ice cream . The dough sticks so badly that I need to use a rubber scraper to get it out ( doesn'5 t matter if the dough is room temp or cold - I 've tried it both ways ) . Furthermore , after about 6 months of use , the handle seems to not be fitting tightly with the scoop , and feels " wobbly " . It 's also not all that easy to get clean . The lever portion is hard to get under and closes so tightly that just tossing it into the dishwasher does n't do the job . It 's going to be replaced - just do n't know if it 'll be replaced with another type of Oxo scoop or another brand . I
5 #### Fit great and screwed right in without any problems . Heavy duty and can take the abuse . Bought it for my DEWALT DWE575SB 7 - 1/4 - Inch Lightweight Circular Saw with Electric Brake .
2 #### The paint on these wears off in like 10 seconds ... onto your hands . there were also some very very thin ones that would snap trying to hold up some of my plants . I wish they were unpainted , or better quality paint , but preferably just unpainted . its unnecessary .
4 #### After reading numerous reviews , this seemed to be a good starting point . There are higher end pressure cookers out there , to be sure , but this fills the bill for my kitchen . I have never used a pressure cooker before but was intrigued . This is well - constructed and gave great results in a very short amount of time !
5 #### I have used these pruners for years now . They are very well made and do n't fall apart like some of the other brands . This one is my favorite . It is perfect for light pruning that you do frequently . I can go through my whole rose garden ( about 70 bushes ) without my hands getting tired . I bought 6 of these . I will keep 3 because I am always misplacing mine . The other three I am giving for as gifts to some of my fellow gardeners .
5 #### This is my second Incra measuring device . They are very accurate , but you must have a .5 mm mechanical lead pencil . Some other pens that say they are " ultra fine " are probably still too thick . Also they are quite thin metal so take care of it to prevent it from being damaged .
5 #### I checked about six different online retails for pricing on this product , as well as all the local home improvement stores . Amazon 's price was so much better than all of them that it made no sense to purchase this elsewhere . The price can change , of course , but at the time I purchased this product I was able to get two of them for just two dollars more than what a local store was charging for the price of one . Ca n't beat that !
5 #### Extinguisher arrived quickly , in great shape , fully charged . Hope I never need to use it but if I do I feel it will do the job .
5 #### Does a great job , my only quibble .. you determine the amount of product to put in it by the size of your tree . My trees are young , but they still need 6 fertilizer tabs .... there is only room for 5 . So , you have to add another after the others dissolve . Not a huge deal , but thought it was something to mention . EDIT : I realize , you are expected to move the location of the device to water around the tree , so maybe putting in more tabs THEN would work .
3 #### But will warn you line is thin and breaks easily against cement . Seem to use a lot of spool when using this Toro gadget . Guess you get what you paid for . I was looking for price .
5 #### As usual for this manufacturer , a solid piece of kitchenware .
5 #### I used this cutting wheel to make cuts on subway tile and floor tile . This wheel is incredible . The only thing that was confusing was attaching it to my angle grinder . I recommend putting the back flange under the wheel - that 's the conclusion I came to with trial and error . This wheel is excellent for grinding down rough cuts too , makes it smooth . I strongly recommend using a tile nipper for cleaning up small C cuts . Meaning if you are making a C shaped cut in tile that is smaller than 2 inches wide , you can not go through the tile completely with the wheel ; otherwise you will over do it with the cut . If you are doing L shaped cuts , you are good . Make sure to use a china pencil to make your marks , it is totally worth doing .
5 #### this worked great for me . It was just the amperage that i needed . i installed a new hot water heater .
5 #### Let me start with stating that I have used a lot of Loppers over the years . Some were good and some were just plainly cheaply made . Now as for the Fiskars 32 Inch PowerGear Bypass Loppers ! I will start with a ( whoot - whoot ) ! These are very well made and sharp as a razor . Due to the PowerGear design , you do n't need any real strength to use these fine loppers . These loppers have made the task of trimming limbs on my 6 acre property a real pleasure . They are so easy to use , light and powerful that I out ran my clean up crew and was done in no time at all . I have recommended these to friends and family , plus I recommend these to any all Amazon users and/or buyers . You wo n't be sorry either , in - fact you will be tickled at the easy of use and the quality of this product . I would give this product ( 6 ) stars if there was that option !
5 #### It 's a winner . As reviewed by ATK it is the one ! Nice handle , arm does not tire easily .
5 #### Love Fiskars Tools . Every gardener must have one of these in there their gardening bucket . I was happy with my purchase .
5 #### Larger than I expected , but its 4 inches . Quality product that is very nice . Would purchase again !
3 #### It 's ok . I have compacted , very hard clay soil with rocks in it . This tool made it easier to dig holes to plant some bushes and small trees . Every once in a while , I have to go in with a trowel to remove the dirt and rocks from the hole . So I alternate the Auger with the trowel while digging . It 's not a miracle hole digger , but it does make digging holes easier .
5 #### Arrvd on time & well pkd . This will be one of my favorite appliances .
5 #### This 8 gallon Action Packer is our third . We love the other two so much that when we needed another container for a similar use , we bought this one . What am I disappointed about ? Ok , men , turn your eyes off ! My other two are burgundy . This one just does n't match ( grin ) . Otherwise , perfect !
3 #### I wish it had a cool of funny design . Basically its boring but the most functional I have had . The mesh does n't let anything really really small come out and dirty the tea versus the cool ones that have too big of holes . Functionality gets A++++
5 #### Well constructed of good material . It serves my purpose and I am able to reel and unreel my hose without any hassles . Would recommend this product .
5 #### Very sturdy ... However , I am using it to hold a 20 oz CO2 tank for a mini portable keg system . For what I am using it for it could n't work better . I would definitely trust it to hold a fire extinguisher as well .
2 #### Stopped working within a month ! Did draw air really well . I might try another .
5 #### This is my favorite can opener that I have owned . I like that it is not electric , particularly living in hurricane - prone Florida . I also like that it never touches the food . It took me less than a minute to learn , and although it often takes a couple of tries to place it correctly , this is no different than the electric can openers that I have owned . I particularly like it for canned dog food . I unseal the can , use the pincers to discard the top , squeeze around the outside of the can , and the dog food comes out into the bowl in one piece without the need for utensils . I also have used it for tuna fish , canned vegetables , etc . I have never used it for a large can since my coffee comes in a large sealed plastic container . Highly recommended .
5 #### The extension covers for my 28 foot werner ladder fit like a glove . They are more than I expected . They are thicker than all the other covers and they are longer . This makes it great to put against my house sidding and gutters .
5 #### Works well for smaller areas . Definately get the larger size ( 5 " ) if you are doing a larger surface . Easy on and easy off my grinder .
5 #### We only use these Filters now . After trial and error when we moved to Texas . Our new house seemed to spew too much dust and small white particles all over . We tried different Filters , from the cheapest to the most expensive to see what would work . These are the best and we do n't have to change them monthly . They last up to 3 months and we have found we need to change them out around 2 1/2 months . It stopped the finer particles and smells . We recommend them .
4 #### This is a great learning tool for teaching children how to tell time . The numbers are printed clearly and easy to read , including the seconds . The hands are easy to move . There is a piece on the back that can be used to prop up the clock , and the piece can pop off easily . It is easy to put back on though . I also ordered the " Telling Time with the Judy Clock " workbook . The little booklet that comes with the Judy clock has a lot of the same pages as the workbook , but it 's a lot smaller . The " Telling Time " workbook gives children a lot more practice with learning to tell time .
3 #### I 'd say in this case , that I probably got what I paid for . I wish the handle was fatter More ergonomic . I love flat whisks for stirring sauces and making gravy . I use this , but I think I will probably look for a more substantial one . I know I will have to pay more money for it and I think I will want to hold it in my hand . That said .... If you want this in your starter kitchen , I think it would be a good buy .
5 #### These glass ones are the best and also like this size . My opinion is the large ones are a waste , because you are supposed to change the stuff every 3 days . so this size is perfect . I just have more of them around my back yard . I have 5 or 6 of these .
5 #### Pretty simple and straightforward review . Is what it says to be and does what it is supposed to do . Perfect .
5 #### Oxo has a winner with these . Small and convenient . There is a size or two up that I like the best from Oxo however . These work well for small bags and notes stuck to the fridge . The only beef I have with them is that the magnet strength is too weak . Bump this while walking past your fridge and they 'll fall to the floor . Otherwise , a good overall clip .
4 #### Great for what it does . My only complaint is that the plug is hard to fit in an exterior receptacle box . you can plug it on the top outlet but the cord covers the bottom outlet . It 's too tight to put it at the bottom outlet without modifying the receptacle box .
4 #### I wanted a measuring spoon set that was classic and had the sizes stamped ( last time I had plastic ones and the markings rubbed off - so frustrating ! ) . I 'm very happy with these . I baked some very complicated muffins the other day and it was my best batch ever .
5 #### Since I cleaned up my toaster oven prior to moving to a brand NRW home , I decided to buy new cooking pieces for it .. I purchased these before and they held up for 3 years before they got stained and crusty ... for the price , buying a new set is worth it .
1 #### The website and the box of the product both state that the capacity of the bowl is 21 ounces , but it is barely 16 ounces . In fact , when I put 16 ounces of liquid inside to measure it , the bowl was not only filled to the line but overflowed the middle section where the blade goes , and liquid was spilling out onto the base . While a solid , pulverized ingredient may or may not spill out through the center if overfilled , I can say that this will not hold 21 ounces by any stretch of the imagination .
5 #### I have bought many products similar to clean up limbs or small trees on my property . This is by far one of the best investments I have ever made . It works effortlessly and slices thru some huge stuff . I can not write a review good enough to describe how happy I am with this product . I hope I never break them but they say they have a lifetime warranty . I have not experienced that yet but I hope they back their warranty as good as their product is cause I 'm using it so much I 'm going to wear them out .
5 #### Truly love these for handy pill storage containers ..... they are the perfect size and the lids stay well sealed , but yet my mother and her arthritic hands find them easy enough to open . So glad to have found them ! !
5 #### Perfect on the inside of sink to hold my scrub brush out of the way and easy to reach .
4 #### Works much better than the one that came with the drill .
5 #### I love this product it really works ! As you can see in my pictures it will work until there is n't room for any more flies . When it gets to this point I dump it out and use one of the refills . I currently have the trap in my chicken coop and it works hard in there . I recommend this product to everyone !
2 #### Construction is ok , directions are crap because they do n't specify the hardware parts which would have made it quicker to assemble . Another thing that would have helped is if the stupid morons who put the hardware in the bag would put the right parts in there ! I ended up having to go out and buy a bolt because instead of two each of two different lengths , they included 3 of one length and 1 of the other . It takes high levels of brain power to put parts in a bag . These people do n't have it .
5 #### I 've owned one of these for over 20 years . I love the left sided blade , it 's light weight , very easy to handle and will perform about 90 % of what a bigger heavier circular saw will do . I 'm almost temped to buy a second one as a backup but my saw shows no signs of failing me .
4 #### I bought this for my boat . I tried it out at my house and it worked perfect . I made a chicken curry that came out great . My only concern is the pressure cap that sits on top and rocks with the steam . The reason I say I am concerned is because it could get lost on a boat easily . If I were to order a Nother one I might try to find one that does n't have a detachable piece .
5 #### Keeps my tea roses and other roses in tip - top shape with lots of blossoms and few bugs or diseases . Must add .... considerably cheaper at Home Depot ( Southern California ) .
5 #### Well made , packaged , and arrived on time exactly as ordered . One of the best prices for the item I have seen online . Would highly recommend . I got this as part of my new workshop I put together . It is fairly accurate and easy to use . Be aware some of the edges are very sharp , enough to cut or stab on the corners . A file took care of it easily . Matches my grandfathers that was handed down to me .
5 #### came smaller than I expected but I 've been using it for a number of things . Great soup pot . fit and finish were excellent .
5 #### The only way to go . I tried third party units ... they don ' fit . Spend the money and get the best .
1 #### I got this product based on the many positive reviews and was looking forward to using it , but for me it did not work . After only a few " pokes " the soil got stuck in the tubes and I had to clean them out with a screwdriver . I tried again with the same result . The soil was moist but not wet . Maybe it works with bone - dry soil , but in my region ( New England ) it rains more - or - less regularly year round so the soil rarely get that dry . I probably wo n't bother to return it , but I will definitely need to find another way to aerate my lawn .
4 #### Pros - You wo n't have to roll up the hose - no leaks - good volume Cons - do not get this if you need to go further out than 10 feet . I used it all summer for the vegetable garden . It worked great , and I look forward to using it next year .
4 #### Wish I had waited to order this at the current sale price of $ 8.79 instead of the $ 12 I paid . It is worth it if you need a lawn sprinkler . It is sturdily made ; Melnor typically produces acceptable products . You can use this in full rotation as well as only half , depending upon the ground you are covering . I expect this item to give several seasons of use .
5 #### Works as advertised . Easy to " install " and operate . No need of these fancy electronic timed power adapters , this is simple , cheap and rated to operate outdoors .
3 #### Works , but needs improvement . It does not have a perfect seal when is seated on the bucket ( I think is to much of the vacuum suction getting lost ) I used 1x 5/16 inch adhesive foam all around the bucket opening , and it is much better .
4 #### works like a champ , also works as a night light in patio off bedroom , and is zapping all night
3 #### Does n't keep the cat away but he does n't like the sprayer
5 #### This spray nozzle is pretty sturdy ... self explanatory , no need of directions , just turn the knob to whatever settings you want . All spray dials works just fine ... have been using this for a little while ( no complaints ) . I highly recommend , even for decent price .
5 #### Makes really good coffee , just takes a bit time to set it up
1 #### Great light poor amazon packaging ... My bulb cam damaged too ... The manufacturing box amazon decided to send me had a gouge on the side of the box ... placed inside a large amazon box without any packaging paper , peanuts , or air bags . so the box with in the box can thrash around in transit . but amazon customer service came through and gave me a credit for the bulb 32 dollars but then the price of the bulb jumped up to 35 dollars .. lol I say buy it but only through amazon as the seller so if your bulb is damaged in transit no hassles to complain ... But hydrofarm packaging of the bulb itself is to blame too , shame on them for not having the bulb more protected ! ! !
5 #### The Pet Lovers Mighty Mite is everything that s said about it . Wonderful . My JR terrier sheds terribly and I have to vacuum every day . Its a fast job with the pet attachment . In fact , I sometimes use the floor tool on the seats of the couch ... dont tell anyone . Its fast and works better than any expensive vacuum I ve owned .... Only one complaint . The hose keeps coming apart and has to be stuck together again . I wish they screwed on or something , but this issue is not even near the problem it could be if the vacuum was n't so great !
4 #### I purchased this item to use with an older Long Ranger II unit because I understood it to be programmable and perhaps identify itself with my old unit . I found out that it is not possible to use this with an older unit and so I had to buy a new reciever and remote . With the new unit it was easy to program this remote to recognize the receiver , so now I have two remotes . Rather than return the remote I elected to keep it and now I have the flexibility of placing a 2nd unit around the shop . Price was good for this function .
5 #### Runs my bug zapper , on at dusk , off at dawn . Sometimes I use during the day all day if skeeters are bad .
5 #### Great product ! Looks very official . Has a great stainless steel build quality .
4 #### Love this little vacuum . It 's lightweight and small with great power .
3 #### yes overpriced perhaps at amazon . off course its cheap but they work . i spend less money on flatware and it gives me more money to buy food and cram in my mouth . i like it
5 #### Great clock . Really like how it automatically sets the time and adjusts for DST . Thermometer and Humidity gauges a plus .
2 #### I think you should use these in a drill press . I 'm a huge DeWalt fan and these are weak . I bought several and they usually broke within an hour or two with my DeWalt 20v codless drill . I switched over to Snappy Tools counter sink and I ca n't imagine I 'll ever switch back to DeWalt .
4 #### For some reason , I thought I ordered a much bigger version of this ( b / c I broke my mum 's ancient one ) but this one it small enough for , like , one teaspoon of well - crushed tea leaves . I use it more as a filter at the end of my teapot 's spout than an infuser . :/ I mean , it 's lovely for the price , and useful , I just wanted a bigger one . I do n't think there were dimensions posted at the time I purchased this . Or , if there were , they were very discreet . Like , I do n't usually skip over that stuff . Otherwise , it 's great !
4 #### I bought both this replacement blade ( " standard cut " 21 - 293 ) and a similar related mode ( " fine cut " 21 - 393 ) because the descriptions and pictures on Amazon and Stanley 's sites are not consistent with themselves or each other . Both models ' plane teeth and spacing were identical . The only difference was at one edge of the blades . This model ( 21 - 293 ) was serrated along the full length of one edge , sort of like a 5.5 teeth - per - inch saw " for working into edges " . The other model ( 21 - 393 ) had two closed edges.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Stanley-21 - 393 - 10 - Inch - SurformFlat - Fine - Cut - Replacement - Blade / dp / B00002X1ZO / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Stanley 21 - 393 10 - Inch SurformFlat Fine Cut Replacement Blade</a > Neither model had the semicircular notch pictured on Amazon and Stanley . I do n't know if that 's considered an allowable defect , or possibly a feature that is on the way in or out . Who knows ?
4 #### Sleek storage for a brush I want to hide . Very good quality brush .
5 #### Fed - Ex just dropped it at my door a matter of minutes ago . Thought I would give it quick test on the kitchen floor . WOW ! Floor clean in seconds . Before I realized it , the entire 2 bedroom apartment was clean in a couple of minutes . It whizzed across the ceramic tile floors and short nap throw rugs . Who knew this kind of power could be had for 65 dollars ? Excellent value . How can such a light weight vacuum have so much power ? It took me longer to write this review then vacuum the entire apartment . I love it .
5 #### Bought this for my mother . Easy to use and makes her knives sharp as hell .
5 #### These are the best little containers ever - so perfect for salad dressing , toppings , earrings and jewelry when traveling . So many great uses ! ! ! and the quality of Tupperware .
5 #### After reading most of the reviews which are really posistive , I ordered this Grill , its a solid unit that looks like it will get the job done . It came packed very well and it easy to put together . I have a propane grill but the wife prefers the " Charcoal " flavor . This should more then do the job for the two of us .
5 #### This hammer works good , the way it 's supposed to . If you hire young girls to swing the hammer , it 's even fun to watch it work .
5 #### Great replacement bulbs . Fit perfectly in my under - counter lighting at 1/10 the price of the home improvement stores . Just got them so I do n't know how long they will last , but the expensive ones did n't last long , either . I would recommend .
1 #### Totally hate this thing ... going by the damn instructions killed the last living tomato plant my Grand mother had brought over from her old neighborhood in Italy .
5 #### Great brush for a fine finish used with minwax polyurethane semi- gloss would reccomond this brush easy to use and clean .
5 #### Works great for crepes .... at least my husband , the cook in the family says so . When our first one broke ( after years of use ) he requested another one . Super thin and flexible .
5 #### I love every Gardena Garden product I have purchased . They are wonderful ! ! !
5 #### Works great ! The one we had for 20 years developed a crack and had to be replaced . Hope we get as much use out of this one .
5 #### This is one of the MUST HAVE tools for the electrical trade . Klein tools makes an excellent product . Fits perfect in the pouch and the hand . Sharp durable knives .
4 #### It served my purpose well for using on an outdoor shower . Time will tell as to its durability .
5 #### Nice little plane for a small job ! I am happy with this little guy .
5 #### These chimes are outstanding . The music is beautiful & even the birds sing along !
3 #### Unit is plastic and seems to be well made . It easily fits on top of a 5gal bucket , but does not snap on or fit tightly . Only when the vac is running does it " snug " down for a tight fit . So , it easily comes off when not in use , which is aggravating . Also , when hoses are attached , you need to have the bucket anchored in some way or it will be falling over every time you move one of the hoses . Once the bucket gets to be about half full , then it becomes more stable . None of that is really the fault of the product though , but is a result of using the product . I am not overly impressed with it , but it works for the intended purpose . Plastic holes for hoses do n't look like they can take much abuse , so we will see how it lasts over time . For the money , it is a good buy .
4 #### The blade sharpened easily and appears to be good enough for my needs . Have n't had a chance to use it yet . Tried it on some old scrap wood . Seems OK .
5 #### I 've had this great little fan since 2000 and it still works great ! I do n't know if it 's still in production , but it was an excellent value ! December 2013 Update : This fan is still working great ! I mostly put it up against my window to draw in the cool air to cool off my kitchen . Still happy with my purchase !
1 #### used these to prune small branches from shrubs around house , had not completed task when jaws loosened up to the point where cutting jaw would roll over the intended stalk of branch making me reposition the shears again , VERY FRUSTRATING , SAVE YOUR MONEY , BUY A BETTER PAIR . THEY ARE NOT WORTH IT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
4 #### Works good for brewing loose leaf tea . I would like the hook to be bigger so it fit over the lip of a cup , that way when my tea is done brewing i can easily remove this from the cup . Other then that , it 's great . Good price and it gets the job done .
5 #### It works really well . Help you to do a better job cutting , and do it faster . I do n't do a lot of sheetrocking , but very glad I bought this .
2 #### We are used to excellent products from Fiskars , but this one is not well - designed . In its first use , cutting off small pencil - sized suckers from a fruit tree , the blade and guard did not line up , and the blade caught on and was nicked by the lower guard , ruining the sharp edge . From time to time they seem to misalign themselves ( even just opening and closing them without anything between ) , which causes the blade to catch on the guard and malfunction . The only positive is that the handles are easy to grip and not hard to close . We definitely wo n't be buying these again , they just are n't well - designed or well - made .
5 #### It 's REALLY SLOW , moving , perhaps , 10 - ft in an hour if I recall correctly . Having said this , it is effective in tracking my 3/4 - inch hose . I tried to use it in conjunction with the new Miracle Grow in - lin feeding system . The latter feeds much too fast to be used in conjunction with this sprinkler . Next spring , I will try to figure out a somewhat different approach to automatically feeding my gardens . This sprinkler appears to be really built to last a lifetime and well worth the money .
5 #### REALLY big bowl , wish it were a little smaller , hard to find a cabinet it fits in . Other wise the quality is there .
5 #### Great product . I 've used this for years in my 3000 gallon koi pond . Would highly recommend .
2 #### not so happy in second week with very little improvement . Yes I followed directions !
5 #### I purchased this for my wife for Christmas and we have used it several times to make sweet potato fries ... works terrifically . Very well made and easy to clean . I purchased two more for other family members ... a great buy !
5 #### For years I used the cheap blue fiberglass filters . Only my air conditioning is forced air and I try not to use it that often . Still , a few years ago I went up to the attic to inspect the air handler and noticed it was a bit dusty . I vacuumed it , cleaned the return air duct and then sprayed some duct cleaner that I found at a big box store . Since then I 've been using these Filtrete paper filters . They do such a good job that I 'll run the fan without the AC to help circulate and clean the air . The filters do a good job compared to the cheap filters I was previously using . After using these for a few years I went back up to the attic to look at the air handler and it was very clean . My AC system is very old but these filters have n't caused any issues with my system . At one point I even used filters with a higher MPR without an issue . Allergies are n't really an issue but cleaner air never hurts ! :) Ordering 6 at a time is nice because I always forget to change them before it gets hot enough to use the AC . The box they come in makes them easy to store in a closet and it helps protect the filters from damage .
5 #### It 's a great looking bag , but is only useful for a small tablet ( kindle ) , wallet , and phone . It 's super thin .
5 #### Works great ! My husband is as happy as can be with his new espresso maker . Quality made and works great .
5 #### Although they have changed the look of these since my first rapid load holders that came with my drill , this one works exactly the same way . And it was extremely quick getting to me . Well done Amazon !
3 #### There 's not much to judge on a device like this . It 's aluminum , so it should n't rust . The markings are clear and legible . It is indeed square ( 90 degree angle ) . But I 'm giving it 3 stars due to the obnoxious label on it . It 's 3 " long and runs edge to edge on the long side . When I tried to peel it off , I only got a little bit of label . I tried a few more times with the same result . The paper is peeling off in tiny pieces , and the adhesive is still stuck to the square . After a few minutes with a razor blade and goo - gone I 'll have it off , and can use it happily ever after . But really , Stanley , use a label that comes off cleanly and easily .
4 #### The last one I had was 40 watts and while it was pretty effective , this summer 's Louisiana mosquitos seemed a little more reluctant to die by uV. However , this 80 watt light has been a bit hit , attracting the little blood suckers by a pound , and virtually clearing my 1.75 acres .
5 #### This was a good , cost - effective purchase of a replacement drive belt for a Windtunnel vacuum . These belts will separate occasionally , especially when the agitator jams , and these belts are a good , easy - to - install replacement .
4 #### My son wanted the small version for hunting but we got him the large size so he could use it at work as well . He said it was nicer to turn this down then wish he had a warmer one . It works great when he 's under a semi in the cold .
5 #### This replaced a pet model at a better price . Wifey uses it everywhere .
4 #### Bought this to put in the gas grill and be able to use some flavored wood chips . It worked well but rapidly became rusty and unattractive .
5 #### Great nozzle . We have weak water pressure and this is much more effective than the ordinary nozzles we had before .
3 #### This is a good little whisk ... but is smaller than I expected . I thought the wire spindles were 9 " long , but the utensil is 9 " long from tip to tip . The small 9 " whisk is still good for limited applications like scrambling eggs and mixing salad dressings .
5 #### This is the largest kneeling cushion I have ever owned . Fiskars has always made quality yard tools and I ordered this based upon their reputation . It is more expensive than most of the others but considering my prior ones have lasted me 4 - 5 years , and beat to death , I figured my knees were worth it . The quality of the material is solid but soft and supportive . I admit that i did modify the pads considering that I got tired of of having mulch get embedded in the old ones . I lined one side with duct tape so as to be more resistant to puncture and to track which side consistently faces down . I will not have to worry about slipping off the edges of these or using 2 smaller pads side by side .
4 #### Great , strong measuring spoons . Look very nice hanging on the side of our Refrigerator . Easy to read labels . I thought the handle would be more of a silicone type material , but it was a less tactile smooth plastic feel .
5 #### Got ta agree with everyone else that this is a fantastic tool . Works really well . This was my first time using a powered caulk gun and I was able to immediately use it like a pro . Loaded a Liquid Nails sublfoor glue cartridge , dialed in about 25 psi , and laid a perfect 1/4 " bead , very quickly . Did n't have to wait on the gun , and did n't blow my fingers out squeezing . A quality machine and for a great price .
5 #### These work fine , but are easy to crack is fastening forces get higher .
5 #### No complaints fits tight in the table.guides well on the wood . Small rip cuts - it works well if you have a straight edge to run it down .
5 #### I sent out a review once , but I will again . These are great little things to have . You can make all kinds of things with them . I usually make pot pies , and fruit pies . They really turn out great and easy to use . Good price , product , and this is a great person to buy from
2 #### In doing research after my purchase , I have learned these just kill beneficial flying insects , and do very little to attract the mosquito . I wo n't be using it .
5 #### Beautiful to look at . Looks very nice hanging on patio . Works very well . Large numbers so that you can look out your home and see .
4 #### It 's a love / hate relationship . I love ... - The taste of the coffee - this is by far the most important thing to me . It certainly makes some delicious brew . Everyone has their own preference , but I highly recommend a light / blonde roast for this . I tried dark and medium roasts and they alway came out tasting horribly burnt . I hate ... - That I have to wait for it to cool in order to make a second cup for my husband ( or any visitor ) . I 've considered upgrading to a larger capacity one , but we have limited space and I really do n't want to have two in the house . - how hard it is to clean the gasket . I never seems to be able to get it clean and completely coffee ground free
1 #### This edger probably works find for light work in sandy soils . It does not work if you have an edge that has never been edged before in clay soil with tough sod . Mine overheated and the motor burnt out . The handle is cheap molded plastic that is held on to the metal ( amazing there is a metal part on this ) shaft by a screw . Not a bolt , not a sturdier arrangement that can be tightened . The handle , powerhead , and shaft all wobble in relation to each other . The housing is cheap plastic . The blade is not sharp and showed considerable abrasion and wear after just a few of minutes of use . This product is like everything else Black and Decker has made in the last decade or so ... junk .
5 #### I had a circuit in my house that kept tripping . I tried replacing the breaker first hoping that it was the breaker and not a short in the wiring . Got lucky and this fixed everything . The breaker itself snapped right in as designed . I 'm usually a Square D guy , but my house came with a Cutler Hammer panel and am pleased with it so far .
5 #### This hose has some weight to it so it lays flat & seldom kinks . I just drag this thing around on the ground to wherever it 's needed without having to worry if it 's getting hung up on something . And if it does , I give it a snap to free it . I would n't say that I abuse this hose but I 'm not nice to it either . I 'm so glad that I bought this .
5 #### Extra seat plus great outdoor dog storage.well made and very study . If using as a seat , add a cushion .
5 #### Pretty awesome peeler . Makes things very easy to peel .. never a struggle and the handle is made to provide good grip .
4 #### Seems fine , have other Stanley tapes that have lasted for years . Needed a longer version .
5 #### Works like a charm ! Have used pressure cookers in the past ; this is by far the best one I have ever used . Very safe if you follow the directions .
5 #### We use the 12 cup Bialetti Moka Express for 4 ( 8 + - ounce ) cups of coffee . It worked well right out of the box , although I do replace the included rubber gasket with a Cuisinox GAS - M 12 silicone gasket .
3 #### I wish I could say these sprinkler heads last as long as they look like they should - all that brass and metal - but they do n't . I have had these and bought replacements for many years . They will eventually ( within 2 years ) begin to leak at the connection points , or stop rotating , or something else . I do n't yet know of a better sprinkler so I keep buying these replacements .
5 #### They 're made by channellock , the company that invented these tools ! Quality in a cute tiny wrench . Pair this with a Victorinox Swiss Army Knife and you have more quality in you pocket than leather man ever dreamed of .
5 #### For my 50 - year old table saw I needed this bushing .... very precisely machine top - quality and fits perfectly ! !
5 #### I added one of these to the 32ETI sprinkler kit , along with an internal controller and rain sensor to fully automate the system . It works great ! Love that the valve can be manually operated to test and immediately water without going to the controller . Great valve and great value .
5 #### Every now and then a kernel will get trapped underneath the bar and drag it ... sounding like scratching , but it 's temporary . This is a fabulous unit ! Has n't missed a beat in a year and half . The kids LOVE it !
2 #### It 's killed 1 large rat , his entire torso filled the trap , oddly enough I had just changed . Battery 's , curiously or odd luck , the eat was DEAD , I 'm going to get a car for backup
5 #### Good product at a good price . 2 mil is what you want if you are hanging it on walls for reflection of light . Does not seem to want to tear , the cardboard tube it comes in is very sturdy and makes it very easy to store the roll when not in use .
5 #### All my previous purchases were the lower end of the OXO Can Opener . I decided to buy this more expensive model because the rubber handle portion is only towards the end of the handle . My other OXO can Opener broke at the joint of the rubber and the stainless steel although I used it for several years . I believe this model be the best choice . I would recommend it to my friends and other relatives
4 #### used it to made five 3x3 fabric panels and so far no jams or problems . Oil it before every use only cons i have is that it did n't have a hard case and yes , the trigger is sensitive which may lead to an accident if not careful . So far no accidents from me though .
1 #### We received the pruners today in the mail and they are clearly NOT Fiskars brand ! ! The brand is Gardners .
1 #### Really nice tool made like crap . The threads stripped out of the adjustable arm inside of three weeks .
5 #### I recently purchased this blade to use in my Delta miter saw . After making many test cuts I determined it was a worthy blade and proceeded to use it to cut some wide oak crown molding which I was installing . It worked beautifully ! ! There was no noticeable tearout on the red oak molding , and the edges of the cut appeared as though they had been planed ! I highly recommend this blade for use in your miter saw . I have said it before , and I 'll say it again - I am hooked on the quality and value of Freud blades .
5 #### This product does an excellent job killing the mosquito larvae that grow in standing water . You can put it into puddles that have nowhere to drain after rain . We have far fewer mosquitos on our property since we started using this product .
5 #### I have 30 plus years in the concrete trades and have always carried a line level . I own two rotary lasers , a visible light laser , just about every Stabila made including the electronic 4 footer and in certain situations I go for the line level . In certain situations they ca n't be beat for speed and they are accurate enough for eliminating puddles or just getting a quick read on the lay of the land . They also allow quick solo checks without having to set up an instrument . I would not use one for actually leveling anything or for figuring an important slope . In short runs , a regular level is more accurate and lasers are the better choice for making sure forms are level . But for a few bucks , I keep one of these in my apron and in every truck .
4 #### I have used this several times now and I do like it . Stays clipped pretty well to my hard - back book . Some downsides .light spread could be a little wider ... gets dim towards the edges of pages . .the adjustable wire stem part - kind of slowly straightens out a bit after time . I make it curved ... but it does n't stay exactly curved like I set it . So after a while I have to adjust it a bit . Not a really big deal .... but noticeable . Also be aware that reading late a night with LED - type of blue lights may stop you from getting sleepy . So if you are reading at night in preparation to help yourself go to bed easier ..... you might try instead using a light source with a more warm glow ... like with regular incandescent light bulbs .
5 #### I have had the motion sensor light for a couple of months now and it has worked great . I have no complaints .
5 #### Living in New England and splitting wood every winter this axe has been a game changer . Each winter we use about 4.5 cords of wood and I make sure we have 6 on hand . This axe is light , and splits fast . The handle is comfortable . In the longer length I feel safe enough that no one is going to take out their shin . The ability to split 24 " rounds without a wedge has inspired several of my neighbors and friends to purchase one of these . Well worth the money .
3 #### These measuring cups stack nicely , have grippy handles , and have six different sizes including the 3/4 cup size , which is nice to have . They are a nice scoop shape so they are easy to use . I use mine for dog food and cat food portioning . They are fine if you want cheap everyday set up cups that wo n't break like glass or cost you a fortune like stainless steel . While useful , I find them to be unremarkable , with no distinguishing features . I think they are clunky and ugly - looking and went back to using my Tupperware set with the sizes stamped into the cup bottom . These will make a great back up set in case my Tupperware are dirty .
1 #### Not what I expected . The material is more like hair net than tennis net or netting for fencing very thin material . Material is as thin as sewing thread .
5 #### works like it should and seemed to really cut down on the bugs hanging around the house . i put it out on the utility pole off the patio on a daylight sensor timer so it comes on for a few hours each evening and i love it . autopilot is the best
5 #### I rated it 5 stars because it is a great protector for the price . You have ample ways of hooking up all your pieces . Of course , this one is discontinued but I 'm sure they made the newer model even better . Do n't know if it actually works because we have n't been hit by lightening or anything . I have faith though .
5 #### Ordered this item cause my wife loves to lay outside and read . She wanted a hammock and so we ordered it . The hardest part of all of it is setting the post to install the hammock on . After the post are in this hangs great . It is very comfortable and all of it is pleasing to the eye when hanging in the yard . With the pillow that I ordered with it you can just about fall asleep when laying in it and just listening to nature . Great product and well worth the money
3 #### I think this is perfect for cutting vegetables as there are two cutting sizes included . But I mainly bought this for cutting potatoes for home made French fries . You need small potatoes or they are n't going to fit in the cutter .
5 #### Using this weekly for everything from spinich to strawberries . There is an occasional balance problem , to be expected . I would highly reccommend this spinner to anyone that 's serious about the world of salads ! ! Real easy cleanup and the strainer is a bonus too . Pop 's right apart , dries in the drainer back to together in no time and ready to go !
5 #### Exactly what we need for our double sink . We 've tried various sink caddies in the past which have failed , but this one is still holding up ( literally ) . The saddle design is smart , it has a small footprint , and it stays cleans with basic care .
2 #### just ok quality , not very precise to adjust , and does n't fit the hands well . OK , but would buy a better quality one if I used it much
5 #### have a compressor with 25 foot hose just could n't reach anything . this was a great value . quality product at a good price , fast shipment .
5 #### I remember when I was a kid , mom used to make popcorn in an old cast iron dutch oven we had . Then we moved and lost it and were stuck with microwave popcorn since anything else we tried did n't work too well . Now I found this and I know my memories of that popcorn as a kid are n't better than what really was . This Stir Crazy makes WONDERFUL popcorn . It is so much more fresh and tasty than microwave and not like styrofoam like air poppers make . I made it just by the directions , using a pretty good brand of seeds and only had a couple of old maids and none of it got overdone . The lid works great for the bowl too .
5 #### Found 3 foreign coins in first 15 minutes . Easy to use .
4 #### my critters and birds seem to enjoy free food from the local zoo keeper here . just wish it was bigger food for the squirrels in my yard .
5 #### I will recommend this one as it is heavy and very good bbq tray . I have found it easy to clean too ( ofcouse you need one of those metallic scrubs ) .
5 #### Just the best device to move your equipment . With out them I could not have the machines because there would not be enough room in my basement shop and I do not wish to heat another space . They are over priced for what they are but to some of us a necessity . Good quality and function .
4 #### I like this timer overall for the price . I 'd like it to trigger on at a lower light level . I use this for my Pentair pool light and it comes on 20 minutes too early .
5 #### I truly love the functionality of this ! It has worked great for the last few years , though my original one changed from the pretty white to a dingy beige yellow on the top , like so many plastics . So , I 'll try the green and hope the color does n't change noticeably ! edit 7/9/15 - I purchased this salad spinner in green 7/18/11 , no problems with discoloration and works just as well . Love it ! Original comment was left on white salad spinner .
5 #### This carving set is what I used for my first Thanksgiving with just my girlfriend and my pets . I 'd never carved a turkey before , but this did not make the knives an issue . For anyone remotely curious , I was able to execute a full deli carve and eat my Thanksgiving holiday into oblivion . Great set .
5 #### The post hole digger arrived yesterday ( a day earlier than promised ) and we dug 18 holes with it . I would rate the required effort as relatively low , which is good . Previous techniques resulted in backaches . None this time . Perhaps another post hole digger would have performed similarly , but this one had the lowest price . The construction is simple , almost primitive , but substantial . It is an excellent value .
5 #### This card game moves quickly as you try to get the right combination of plus and minus numbers to match a target number that changes every hand . It 's a simple game the kids will enjoy , but there 's enough action and thought to keep the adults interested too . I played with my adult children and we all had a good time . I can see where this will help younger children develop math skills and negative number concepts without realizing they are learning math .
5 #### Got it for my sister but now I want one ... Super quality and comfort ... love it
5 #### Worked great . Nice to be able to get these without having to driving to several stores
5 #### Does the job ! Works as it should , very useful for crafts or work !
3 #### Not nearly as sturdy as the old birdhouse we had for so many years . It was a rectangle .
5 #### The best thing about it , other than very good looking sheen and ease of operation , is it cooks just like -- as efficient as , with almost no complex settings like the electronic ones -- our 30 - year - old Presto we had to recycle because the rubber gasket finally gave out and it had a little leak . Thanks to Presto for keeping it simple and nonelectronic .
5 #### Nicely made self centering Jig , Easy to use to parts to lose ,
5 #### These are just wonderful for working families or a last minute meal . It 's east , fast and healthy . We love it .
5 #### I debated for a long time about spending this much money for a kick plate . There are much cheaper ones but they never last to long before they began to show aging , wear and discoloration . After seeing the quality and thickness of the plate , the beautiful polish , I will never buy a cheap one again . It looks fantastic !
5 #### Great blade ; exactly what I need to make precision cuts in all types of wood .
5 #### Very pleased . Bought as a replacement to go with the Drill Doctor 350X that I bought at the same time .
5 #### I was given two of these ladders over a year ago , and used them so much that I ordered two more ! Although a bit heavy / bulky for the taste of two of my people , the rest of the crew loves them . One of our more common uses for the stool is to set them up as indoor scaffolding when performing lengthly ceiling / overhead work . Sorry I did n't discover this item years sooner !
5 #### Great price for identical items in local hardware stores . High quality , fast shipping , been using this brand for 10 plus years in the front of the house . Needed to add additional wires to side of of the house .
2 #### Takes very small bites . Works best on thin material only . Thicker material bogs it down . Does not turn easily . But , for the price , it does the job . There are better one 's out there that costs more .
1 #### I purchased this because I LOVE air popcorn and quit eating microwave a few years ago . I read many of the reviews about how to make great popcorn and adjustments in the arm . First , you may need to adjust the arm . The whole thing is cheaply made . Even after reading all these great reviews and strategies for using this . I liked the idea of having popcorn made and just flipping it and using the lid as the bowl . I have two types of popcorn and tried both with recommended oil . Both left many kernels in the bottom . I went and bought premium popcorn , which did better . But this take awhile to make and you have to watch it carefully . There are still a few kernels in the bottom even with premium popcorn . I have an air popper that shoot it out and I think that one is so much better than this . It makes it quickly ( faster ) and I am not as afraid of fires and with this one . Final analysis : Does not pop as fast as air poppers such as presto poplite . Most generic or store popcorn does n't pop well ( you have to buy premium ) . Having oil in it and having the popcorn directly on the base makes it dangerous . Popcorn does not taste as good ( even the good stuff ) . I should not have to read through a pile of reviewer comments to figure out how to use an air popper . What a waste of time !
3 #### I really ca n't review this yet . Just got the vacuum to use it on .
5 #### Very solid and quite well made . It 's very handy and does n't take up much room . I 've used it as a mixing bowl , to boil water and to fill my water filter pitcher / dispenser . Did n't need a pot holder ( but I wo n't guarantee it as I made sure the handle was n't near the heat and stopped it as soon as it boiled , so be SURE to test it yourself ! )
5 #### This is one of the few things I 've ever bought that actually does exactly what it 's advertised to do , and which actually deserves all the glowing reviews at Amazon.com ( good to see they 're NOT just Weber employees ) ! Yep , 2 sheets of newspaper and in less than 10 minutes my charcoal was glowing pink . Unbelievable ? Believe it ! This baby is worth every penny , and more . Footnote : disregard all the hype about using mesquite or hickory instead of normal charcoal . I tried it the first time and the wood got so overheated it literally started popping apart , unleashing clouds of hot embers ... luckily I do n't live in a dry climate like southern California or it could 've easily had some very nasty consequences .
1 #### Just to confirm ; If you have a nice stainless steel kitchen and a good stove with a big flame , avoid this kettle . If you put the flame on high , so you can boil water quickly ( duh ) it licks around the bottom and melts the edge of the whistle , killing it . The handle gets too hot after water is boiling more than a couple of minutes . ( maybe if the whistle still worked ... ) Also if you reheat to bring water back to the boil . In all fairness , my mother has the same kettle in porcelain , on a stove with 3 - 4 inch burners . In that setting , it 's fine . PS Do n't go for the Kitchen Aid Kettle . It 's even worse .
3 #### This is useful for about 40 percent of the garlic cloves in varieties I tend to grow . That is , it works best on medium sized cloves that are rounder and squatter . Find another way to peel flat cloves or those that are long and tapered .
5 #### So far the cleanest cutting dado I have used . I regret wasting money on the wobble or the El cheapo imports . Although I have not used the Forrest dado , for the money you really ca n't beat it . The best $ 160 I 've spent this year . I believe I got the " blinged " out version , it says ICE coating on the outside and looks to be chrome dipped . Did not come studded with diamonds though .
5 #### Much better than waiting on a cheaper gun to heat up and being stuck with limited tip options . The gun is heavy , but still easy to use .
5 #### Typical MAGLITE High Quality . Very happy with it . Rugged , well built , easy to use etc . I always liked the MAGLITEs I have purchased in the past and like this version 's size for the car etc . I recommend it .
5 #### Loved it after another poster recommended petroleum jelly for the suction cups .
5 #### Works great ! Turns our fountain on and off as needed .
5 #### Great knife roll for the price . I also bought blade guards . they work well together
5 #### Best bird feeder I 've bought so far ! I 've had it for several months now , and the squirrels have had zero success in getting into the feed . I love cardinals , and now have up to 8 in my tree every afternoon . I fill it with sunflower and safflower seeds , with the occasional dried berries . It 's hanging from a tree branch , with an 18 inch extender so I can reach it to refill . I keep it turned away from the tree , and the squirrels ca n't figure out how to get in . At least once a week I see a squirrel sliding off the back onto the ground as it fails to get the feed . Very satisfied ! ! !
5 #### A review about a can opener ? Yes ! I once had very strong hands , but alas , age has affected them . I found it hard to turn the " crank " on most can openers and my hand would slip off the handle . This easily cuts into the can , knob turns easily and it is comfortable to hold while turning the crank . Other reviews said it held up well .
2 #### It leaks . I called and they promised to send a new adapter . it never came . My mom got one and it leaked . she returned hers . It did scare away the coon once , but then it figured out how to get around it . bummer . really had high hopes . would probably be great for deer .
1 #### Two in a row failed after one cycle . This timer is being used to turn on / off a very simple window fan that draws only 20 watts on high . The first one worked one cycle then the outlet would no longer switch on - whether timer or manual function . So in typical Amazon customer service style , Amazon sent a prepaid return label and immediately shipped another one . Same thing . Worked one cycle then failed . I 've tried all manner of trouble shooting to no avail . I 'm going to see if Amazon will take this one back and try something else !
5 #### Pros -Two pack of belts , good value -Useful to have a pack around if belt breaks -Normally your belt only breaks if your vacuum gets stuck on some rug or sofa cloth Nothing else to say really , two pack of a vacuum belt at a good price !
5 #### This is hands down the best tape measure I 've ever owned or used . Not that it takes much to be a great tape measure , but the quality of its construction leaves me confident I bought the right product .
5 #### Given as gift to hubby and Dad . Both love it !
5 #### I purchased two packages of bags and the price was the best I could find for the ones I needed for my Hoover . The bags look Hoover OEM and with the allergen filtrate which is great .
5 #### I love this can opener . It is so much easier to use than my old one . I have trouble using my hands sometimes , but am able to open cans very easily with this opener .
5 #### I love this product . Funny thing . When my dog sees it come out he gets excited because he gets a treat . Gross but funny . He did it on his own .
4 #### I bought these to make a bathroom door of CVG Douglas Fir . My only complaint is that the instructions do n't make it clear where the shims go when you change the bits from exterior door ( 1 3/4")mode to interior door ( 1 3/8 " ) mode . Building a door is quite a project and this bit set handles the task very well . Freud gives you a large flow chart and a DVD video of a couple of good ol' boys building a door , which except for the shim problem really helps to understand the process .
3 #### I have to say I am a little disappointed . I remember this style popper from my youth , but it is not living up to my memories . Yes it works , but at first it did n't seem to get hot enough to pop the kernals . Third use seemed to go much better . Have to be sure that the arm is on properly after cleaning - otherwise it does n't stir .
5 #### I was pleasantly surprised at how well this outlet holds the plug . Now i need to change all my old outlets as they do not hold the adapter prongs well and expose the prongs due to the weight of the adapter . This is a potentially dangerous situation that could cause a fire or electrocution .
5 #### I have n't had to use this wheel yet , but if it works like the one that came in the machine , all is going to be ok . The wheel in the machine sharpens drill bits really well !
3 #### Well , this item is rated for 500 lbs . , but I doubt you 'll be doing much rolling action with a 500 lb . machine resting on it . I use mine to provide mobility for a band saw weighing about 250 lbs . I move it a couple feet out and back from a wall and I can tell you it 's a beast to maneuver . Certainly not something I 'd use to move a large 400 lb . tool across the shop .
2 #### Its an OK dremel tool , but its not very powerful and the battery does not hold much of a charge . I have also had some issues with the on off switch . It is a three position switch and it will sometimes not work well . I need to move it back and forth between high and low to get it to go on . There are probably better units available .
5 #### With a new , larger goldfish pond ( 1500 gallons ) and a looming algae problem , I purchased this gallon - size container to last the entire year . Compute the number of gallons of water in your pond . Pour into your pond near your water fall or fountain the appropriate amount of Algaefix . Do n't overdo it ! I started with two treatments a week as per the instructions . In a week or two my pond was crystal clear . I have since gone into a maintenance mode , only one treatment a week My pond gets lots of sun , but Algaefix does the trick . Highly recommend .
5 #### These are great . Excellent grip . Awesome lock and unlock function ( probably my favorite thing about them ) . Perfect size and weight . Easy to clean . Precise enough to pick up little items and strong enough to pick up larger ( maximum open width is 7 inches ) or heavy things .
5 #### This organizer is about the perfect size for a box or two of screws or nails . If you need a large variety of fasteners you need the four compartments and the shorter depth of this organizer . The three compartment dividers(of the same depth ) leave to much wasted space , unless you just need a lot of fasteners . The deeper red organizers ( 4 compartment ) are only needed for the biggest nails & screws . I could not find this item at any local retailer .
5 #### This works perfectly for it , s purpose . The price was really good . I added a charm for a little bling and am quite satisfied with my purchase .
4 #### For aging folks like me , or for younger but farsighted folks : this thing is SMALL . Get out the granny glasses & be careful about the twitchy old fingers , lolol . ... Just as with wireless phones & many many other gadgets , I do wish manufacturers would consider us aging baby - boomers -- quite a significant percent of the population , y'know ! -- and offer at least a few larger models of everything , not JUST the continually smaller to impossibly teensy versions . ... In spite of all that , I 'm ordering another one of these very handy timers . Had one but accidentally broke it . Would n't recommend ( nor would the manufacturer recommend , I 'm sure ) dropping this gadget on a concrete floor then stepping on it ... but as I said , it really IS a bit too small .
5 #### They were what they were supposed to be . All is good .
4 #### Good good good . Just be very very careful with it . It can be dangerous to humans .
5 #### Got these knives to be able to put them in the dishwasher . They cut steak better then any knives we have . Fell adequately heavy and substantial in hand . Came out of dishwasher without any rust spots so far . Just ordered 12 more .
1 #### The threads on the connector on this hose were poorly made and I could not get it to screw onto my other hose so it leaked . Plus if I pulled the hose taunt it would actually slip off because I could not get it to screw on very far . Believe me , I tried and tried and so did others . I finally threw it away . Junk !
5 #### A nice sharp paring knife . I use it almost daily and it has maintained sharpness . I would buy again . Word
5 #### Genuine Case product . The Kirinite scales are really attractive and the blades are sharpened for immediate use . This is no knock - off , it 's the real deal !
4 #### Product works well .. Will clear a pond of floating debris ( NOT algae ) quickly ( within 24 hours ) Do over - dose and to keep your pond water oxygenated .
5 #### works for a while then sinks , take it out then start over . Pond still mucks up in South Carolina heat .
5 #### Beautiful sound . Not the tinny sound you often hear in wind chimes . These have a very pleasing musical sound . We have had breezy weather and I love to hear them chime .
5 #### Very solid . Due to an apples somewhat irregular shape , some seeds remain . I core each apple twice , to get all the seeds out .
2 #### Cheap they all broke after and during a dinner party . Very thin glasses .
5 #### I put one outside and the number of flies it attracted was unbelievable . I had no idea that there were so many in the area . I have never seen anything like it . For the first time I feel I have a handle on getting the nasty things out of my yard . I bought two and they are jam packed of dead flies , I 'm going to buy 6 more . I highly recommend this product .
5 #### Plunges well , and the case does a good job of hiding the plunger head and keeping it off your floor .
5 #### Great spinner . Heavy duty , does not slide on counter , and gets the greens dry . I use it so much it never gets put away !
5 #### I have few different brands of clamps , these are n't my favorite but they are high quality for the price and function well .
5 #### great replacement skimmer . a must have when your current skimmer starts sticking or breaking down .
3 #### When I compare what my phone says the temperature is to what this product says , there is usually like a 5 - 8 degree difference .
5 #### This is a great unit . Use if for our pond fountain . I love that you can turn on / off every hour if you want .
5 #### We have used this many times , and it is perfect !
4 #### Works well . The center ' button ' locks in the down position for easier storage ... but this spinner is VERY large . Great for washing / drying a lot of lettuce at one , but making it hard to find a place to store it .
5 #### They are gross , but that 's because they work ! We live on the edge of town near farms so the flies in the summer are out of control in our area . Place one of these away from the house where they remain down wind and they fill up very quickly . Changing them out stinks ( literally nasty ) but they do the job !
5 #### Tongs . Yes , I know , you can get tongs anywhere . Well , let me tell you , I have used countless pairs of " nice " and " professional " grill tongs through the years and nothing has held up like my Oxo tongs . This is by far one of the most important tools in your grilling arsenal ... at least outside of your grill and maybe the beer you should be drinking while using your grill . The 16 inch tongs are long enough so that you do n't burn your hands on the grill and sturdy enough so that you can lift an entire turkey from grate to platter . I will use nothing else !
5 #### I have 10 acres . Basically about 3 acres are used for entertainer . I bought 3 of these and established a triangular perimeter around the house . It 's July , really wet , and I have n't seen a live mosquito yet , let alone a bite !
3 #### The reason for the 3 stars is the metal flap that the belt slides over and contacts the wood was n't flat . It left dish marks all over the wood I was sanding . I remedied it with a 4 " wide piece of cloth back granite over the metal flap . It smoothed it nicely .
1 #### As others have stated , the light cover ( not the fan / motor ) vibrates in a way that changes every 5 minutes ! The cover vibrations are much louder than the fan noise . Will try rubber dampers as others have done to help . I own two of these , both vibrate . One of them the light no longer works ( even with a working light globe ) .
4 #### I sprayed my porch and sidewalk one time with sealer and cleaned my Chapin sprayer . Sprayed nice and cleaned up easy . We will see if it holds up in the long run .
5 #### makes great uniform French fries . I bake them and save on calories
4 #### These blades are easy enough to change . I usually get most of a summer season out of one blade . I 'm pretty careful in how I use them . I really try to avoid nicking the concrete and I pick out any rocks to minimize wear on the blade . I usually change them before I get to the wear hole because I prefer a deeper trench .
5 #### Best flappers in the business . Great savings on buying 3 at a time and you always have an extra available .
3 #### Just received this wrench yesterday , it is OK however , it clearly is not made in the USA , package states made in China !
5 #### This stuff is IT .. All of FOX FARMS products really kick up the flowers ! Great stuff ! It woke up my veg stage !
5 #### I 've tried two types of microwave cornpoppers that would leave a lot of cornels uppopped . Last week I sent for this and to my suprise it came a day early . But that is only the tip of the iceburg . This cornpopper popped all of the cornels . The only bad part is my dogs give me the stare down and I have to share the popcorn with them . And yes , I do hand feed the popcorn to my dogs . But th en again I toss it to them .
5 #### Mark your holes and start cutting ... it 's that simple . A great addition for my dremel . I was a little skeptical of how it mounts ( connects ) to the dremel but so far so good . Delivery was on time and packaged well .
3 #### works as needed . push the button and it works ... no batteries are needed because it comes with a lithium battery . programing is fast .
3 #### works okay , needs a wider base and needs to be sharper , it does not cut spuds very well . .
3 #### Hard to balance tortillas on the racks . Sometimes the tortillas slip off the rack . Still a good buy .
5 #### Super Zapper ! Got this and put it up the same day , around 7:30 pm , when the mosquitoes really start coming out in hordes . I stepped outside a couple of hours later , and it was zapping constantly ! I mean it literally was killing 100 a minute . The next morning I checked it out , and I can say this to all the bugs cruising around my backyard : If you fly , you DIE ! ! " I just ordered a timer for it , so I will probably run it from about 5:00 pm until 8:00 am , although I am sure it would still be zapping a few more during the day , Great product so far !
4 #### These inserts are great , but after dropping 300 on a lift these inserts should be free ! JMHO . The inserts work great I just wish there were 6 instead of 4 because there are other sizes that would be handy to have for 0 clearance inserts that would have saved me 30.00 from buying the JessEm blanks to make my own inserts .
5 #### I use the mosquito dunks in my bird bath but needed something for the mulched shady area bordering my house . Mosquitos would swarm especially at dawn and dusk . I thought this was worth a try as I did not want to use a product that would kill the beneficial critters . I sprinkled the product per the instructions for water and viola - it worked almost immediately . It got watered in by the sprinklers and a nice rain shower . Still working two weeks out .
4 #### Other reviewers are correct , this is a terrific little sander with one problem , the switch is tricky to operate . The switch is too small and the rubber dust cover over it makes the action of the switch awkward at best . Getting it to turn on or off can be a two or three attempt task , this should be a no - brainer for DeWalt to fix in future production . Other than that the quality of the finish it produces is excellent , noise level acceptable and the dust collection is a major improvement over the old 1/4 sheet sanders . I typically use this sander immediately after my 1/2 sheet Porter Cable ( with no dust collection ) and the DeWalt sucks up all the dust left behind by the PC . Highly recommended .
5 #### Just the right tool for my husband who has everything
5 #### I use this product every day to wash my potatoes , carrots etc . This is a quality well made brush . I recommend this product .
5 #### I 'm 71 , and so is my back ! Spending time bent over , supported by my cane , using a hand weeder left me in pain . Now I can stand and get the job done . You do n't have to be an old coot to hurt your back killing dandelions , so do n't !
5 #### This brings back the nostalgia of the popcorn popper my grandparents had when I was growing up . Now I get to involve my children in the same popcorn fun , and they love it too . Makes a lot more than I expected , which has resulted in a few bowls of stale popcorn from everyone being popcorn - ed out from one batch , which is great news for someone who needs to make a huge batch ! I learned my lesson after that and simply make smaller batches !
1 #### Shame on B&D for selling a piece of junk mechanical bench . AND shame on me for not looking at all of the reviews to understand the difference from the original workmate . I own an original and expected good quality . Why would a company change from a WINNER to such a POOR LOSER ? Cheap metal , rough cut in places , thin cheap wood compared to the originals , an adjustment system that is based on a PLASTIC belt ( wow ! ) and handles that adjust as one . I have read that if you crank the handle that would tighten on the smaller end of an angled piece of wood , the wider side slips off of the plastic crank and when the board is almost tightened you use both handles to tighten securely . Does n't sound good to me . I would have rather spend a little more for the old original workmate than this piece of junk . I will be buying a " jawhorse " and sell this new workmate on craigslist .
4 #### It 's always best to use the mfr 's bit with their product . That s the design and it allows the best use of the tool . I 'm happy .
5 #### My old Craftsman finally gave so I needed to buy something ideal for my wife and I to use at home . The drill is awesome , it runs smoothly , provide light with you 're using it , small & compact and easy to understand ( perfect for my wife to use - she gets intimidated with power tools except this one ) , and the charge lasts for a very long time . It 'll even tell you when you need to recharge it through its battery gauge . So far , I 've used it to screw sheet rock , install basic lighting and wall outlets , drill and screw a couple of 2x4s and sx12s , even a 4x6 . I ca n't wait to use it on building a bookcase . If you 're needing a great all around drill for your home , do n't look any further .
5 #### It 's green . It 's nylon . It works great in my weed whacker . Yea ! The stuff of history .
5 #### I have had this style paint bucket hook for more than twenty years and love it . Will work on either side of an extension ladder . Need and extra one and have not seen this hook at the home stores , so I shopped for it here and found it .
5 #### Really like this square . Watch it does n't mar your wood project though . But a great quick reference tool
3 #### Works well . Chain broke after 6 months but still did what it needed to do
5 #### I inherited my son 's old shop vac was delighted to find this replacement filter . It fits in easily and do a great job keeping the stray debris out of the air .
5 #### I have had this filter for a year now and it has done great . I was worried as some of the post state it wil not last through the winter , but this year in TX it was below freezing most of the winter and the unit did great and maintained flow all winter long .
5 #### I have to admit that while I 'm a huge fan of Channellock in general , I probably would have never bought these at the regular price . Why ? They 're ridiculously huge , to the point where you could easily fit them around a coffee can with room to spare . Almost nobody needs pliers this big , and they 're bordering on being a gag for the vast majority of home owners and shade three mechanics , tinkerers and the like . I 'm sure some folks have a perfectly legit need for these , and I 've seen other reviews state as much , so do n't misunderstand , I 'm simply stating that the vast majority will find these far too big to be of any real use ( unless , of course , you want to break something , at which they surely excel ) . That said , when the price dropped into silly cheap range , I had to have them . They are an awesome showpiece on any pegboard and who knows , one day I might need them to really reef on something . If you 're a true Channelllock fan , I highly encourage you to pick these up when the price is right , as they 're not typically sold in brick and mortar locations . Besides , when the day comes that you actually need these babies , you 'll have them at the ready .
5 #### I hate flimsy spatchulas . This is slightly pricey , but rock solid . It should last me years and years . There 's pretty much no flex through the whole spatula which is exactly what I was looking for .
4 #### It is big enough for my 30 ' garden hose . Had to place a concrete block in front to keep it from moving when I wind the hose to retract it .
2 #### To me this is a mediocre axe . Not very heavy , not very sharp , not very balanced , not all that easy to use . A sort of weak compromise among various qualities you want in an axe . It may be good for camping , but for general purposes , I ca n't recommend it .
5 #### Works great . Design is better than the previous OXO spinners we have owned . The lid / spinner mechanism comes apart for easy cleaning .
4 #### It fits my little red 5 gallon wet / dry shopvac , bang out the dust every few weeks and it will last a while . They should make a name brand washable filter
5 #### I give it a five star since it looks good in a nice packet but I had to return it since the manufacture 's description is a little deviated from the actual product . I thought it would fit my soldering gun but it is larger and thicker than I expected . I have a 180 Watt Industrial Soldering Gun from " Chicago Electric Welding " .
4 #### This would take 2 people with the right tools about 10 minutes . It took me 1 hour ... mainly because I do n't have a 15/16 " wrench and my adjustable pliers would barely fit . Furthermore , my attmpt at hanging the upper arm from the rafters while tigtening the bolt 1/4 " turn at a time was ... uhh ... nearly very dangerous . I am glad I made the purchase , but in the future would love to have known that I needed allen keys , and a crescent wrench set and someone to hold the upper arm while I tightened the nut . This thing is rock - solid , and makes resawing 12 " quite the pleasure .
5 #### I am really happy with mixing bowl . I can use it for almost everything and thank you for your business .
1 #### wiggly , plastic , not that accurate . This tool is very wonky and you end up sawing plastic if you are not careful .
5 #### this bird house is sturdy , nice looking and the birds liked it , looks nice in the back yard and you can see it from the road ... i think its more decorative than gourds ... my opinion ... I'm happy
4 #### Much better than Weller 's lower - powered guns , this heats up quickly and delivers a lot of continuous heat to the joint being soldered .
5 #### should have bought this years ago , Love it , works great .
2 #### Its not very sturdy and the bag falls off at times . I attempted to use this for a plastic pond that admittedly had quite a bit of dirt and leaves at the bottom . The bag filled up after 5 seconds .
5 #### worked great , was a huge improvement over the original . Liked it so much I bought a spare !
5 #### I purchased this masher after my potato masher that had a similar head design but a typical longer handle failed at one side of the welds . It is great . I really like this style of masher head because it sort of rices potatoes rather than mashes them . The plastic rubbery handle is wide and the short handle design allows for more leverage when mashing . It does sink into the potatoes a lot for a very big pot of potatoes - I prefer to use an 8 - qt stockpot for mashing for less depth of potatoes and easier mashing . This masher also works great for bananas and even crushing graham crackers for a pie crust .
5 #### Literally the BEST cheese grater ever ! SO easy to clean and store - I use it all the time . Comes apart easily to clean , but is very sturdy when together . Holes are good size and sharp , and grippers on the bottom and the top handle are perfect for keeping it in place . Folds flat for storage - no more wasted space ! Will never go back to another grater again !
5 #### I first purchased the Black and Decker cordless power trimmer to replace my old ' rope pull ' trimmer . The black and decker is Only good for larger branches , and will not cut small branches less than 2 " . Ordered this Fiskar telescoping pruning stick , and does a wonderful job . The pull handle is much easier to use than the old rope pull type , and is less tiring to use .
5 #### These are a pair of authentic Eureka ! in - the - bag belts with absolutely zero signs of age or dry rot . The price had me concerned that these may have been stale goods , but that was n't the case , so , here is that information from my purchase experience to waylay anyone else 's concerns regarding the quality of these belts purchased Spring 2013 .
4 #### I use this for a garden fountain to run it only in the daytime . I have experienced no problems so far .
5 #### This grill is great for hamburgers , chicken , hot dogs , etc . It cooks fairly quickly and the fat that drains out is really gross .. Just think about other cooking methods - you 'd be eating that [ fat ] normally . I have also done veggies ( onions , zuccini , summer squash ) on the grill and they come out fabulous . Just be sure to cut the veggies the same thickness or they wo n't cook evenly . Great buy for a small price . If you 're cooking for more than 2 people , you 'd probably want the larger version , but this is great for 1 or 2 people .
5 #### Using this to cut Maple & Cherry on a Rigid R4512 saw . Unbelievably different than the higher tooth Freud on the hard woods . Get this if you need to accurately and safely cut hard woods . You wo n't be disappointed !
2 #### I guess I expected more . I developed a problem ina new installations that got a little more sun than usual . I wanted to get rid of the black slime and this product only partially worked .
5 #### There 's not much to say here . I just purchased this double pack and I rarely use the vacuum , as there 's only a single rug in the house . The belt fit perfectly and the brush spins as it 's supposed to . I suppose I could wait a few months to see how long they keep up , but even then I 'm not sure I 'll have used it more than a handful of times . All in all this product does what it 's supposed to .
5 #### I just finished setting up a dust collection system with the 2hp motor from Harbor Freight . This separator fits on top of a $ 15 silver trash can from any big box home improvement store . The openings fit 4 in tubing perfectly and do a great job . I 've filled a trash can twice now and I have no more than a gallon of dust in the bottom of my collection bags . Less chips and stuff that go through your impeller the better . I know building a thein baffle would be even better , but for the effort and low cost of this unit - it 's all I 'll ever need .
2 #### I 've bought one of these before without issue , and normally like them a lot . But this particular time , the little clasp which holds it shut is somewhat defective ( we found out after a few uses ) and keeps popping off . It 's possible to put it back on , but it does n't stay . Such a nuisance with such a simple little device . Probably this is just a defect with our specific one , though it 's possible the quality has declined .
4 #### Tthese little gems are O.K. and do work well to keep bees of most kinds out of the nectar ; however , there is just no humane way to rid one 's yard of bees . Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay . Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar . Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds . One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise . When cleaning the mesh of the guards be sure to clean the inside as well .
5 #### I initially bought this to cut backerboard for some custom tile work that required a lot of odd cement board cuts . It works great for that and makes quick work of it . I also use it for making rough cuts in tile for toilet holes ( that wo n't be seen ) and other masonry applications . It will cut metal , plastic , wood and all sorts of stuff . I use it in a Dewalt 4 - 1/2 grinder and it is my do - all blade . I have all sorts of grinding / cutoff blades but if this is on the grinder and I need to do a quick cut on a piece of metal , it will do . I recommend this product to many people .
3 #### This seemed to test the pH okay , but the tube is difficult to use and fill properly . I found the design to be lacking . However , it got the job done , and was very well priced .
5 #### This works great for lighting up my chicken coop for the winter to help keep up egg production ! Seems to be wether proof !
5 #### Like pretty much any Freud bit , this one cuts amazingly smoothly ( " like buttah " ) . It chomped right through some 3/4 " Baltic Birch plywood with no problem and left a nice smooth rounded edge on it which required minimal sanding ( just a quick pass with 150 grit ) . I have three or four Freud bits now and they have all been excellent . I would n't hesitate to get another one .
3 #### Good product . I 'm happy with it 's quality and proformance . It 's not as pictured though . The company name and logo " is " embossed on it . . . but , very small and descretly . No colour logo . If they 'd used a picture of the actual product , I still would have ordered it but would have been happier receiving it . Needless " bait and switch " tactic demands a loss of at least two stars .
5 #### The leverage you get from this looper is insane ! The gear pivot gives you a lot of leverage to cut through anything that 'll fit in the blade when opened . The only trick is making sure you open the handles WIDE in order to fit branches .
5 #### Excellent corer , and it 's great also for making a hole to prepare your cupcakes for filling . I do n't like unitaskers and most of the cupcake plungers are made of plastic ; some leave too big a whole , some not a big enough hole . This one is just perfect .
5 #### Sturdy and well made . I bought two for Christmas presents but liked them so much that I kept one of them .
5 #### Works Great and puts out serious heat . Uses the lil bottles up fast tho , buy a hose for a large tank .
5 #### We have several of these . We have goats , cows , pigs , chickens and more . We use double line electric fence as well as electric net fence for rotational grazing and containment . These work great . Just wish they would make them in a weather proof enclosure .
5 #### This was the gift I gave to my mother for her birthday . She loves how she can use the bowl to give the leaves a cold water bath , dump out the water , and spin off the excess . I also gave her the " store " set with the lid . Then she can just snap the lid on and keep her lettus in the fridge and keep it crisp .
5 #### For some reason the plastic knob on our living room lamp keeps breaking off . After going through a package of plastic knobs purchased at our local hardware store I discovered these brass key knobs on Amazon . They are perfect . Being made of brass they are going to last forever , and the wide key on the end makes it so much easier to turn our lamp on and off . There is even an extension provided if the stem is not long enough to fit your lamp . It is perfect . I bought three packages so I could replace the plastic knobs on all of our lamps . Buy them . You wo n't regret it .
5 #### This pot measures 12 " across by 8 - 3/4 tall without lid .. it 's an aluminum clad encapsulated thick bottom .. this more suited for a gas burner since the base is so big .. I have electric stove at winter home n gas at summer home .. my other stockpot are taller than they are wide but this bad boy is short and wide pot .. giving you more bottom real estate to cook on .. the lid does not nestle completely down on the rim .. it 's a manufacture flaw but still good .. double boxed packed for protection .. cook chili with confidence you wo n't burn the bottom ..
5 #### Works great . We used it to water our newly seeded section in our lawn .
4 #### Today Philthy Reviews ....... the pretty blue light that done zap all them bugs Long story short it works well but I have to ask if all of those bugs were really mosquitos . I saw lots of others in there in addition . We used the bait but who knows what flew in there . I suppose it worked since when we were outside we did n't get bites like before . So if you do n't mind killing everything with wings then you found your killer .
5 #### This is a great tape measure , what can I say ? It is sturdy and does it 's job really well .
5 #### I am going off what my friend has told me as I bought this as a wedding present and they said it works great .
5 #### This little step ladder is very sturdy . Is comes in handy for many small projects like washing windows and small cleaning jobs .
4 #### I would give it 5 stars , but I 've had issues with these bags tearing right near the cardboard mount . And once these bags get any type of dust / use , they do n't like to tape back up ( even with duct tape ) . Once a bag tears , it 's practically useless . Overall , they 're awesome to use with an upgraded filter to keep dust from being reblown back around the area . I highly recommend having dust bags to reduce dust and filter clogging .
5 #### I used to use a $ 1000 Lamello biscuit joiner when I worked in a cabinet shop . The dealt works amazingly well for how much it costs . I 'm not saying it 's as good as the Lamello , but its hard to tell the difference . This thing is accurate , easy to use , and I love the rack and pinion adjustment .
5 #### ... and I 'm still awfully happy with this little gem . I bought it in May 2012 after first purchasing a fancy Fiskars reel mower for my small , just - established sod lawn , which I wanted to maintain at 3 " -4 " in the face of perpetual drought . ( Useful fact : Grass root depth is positively correlated with above - ground height : The taller the grass , the deeper the roots , and that means more efficient water and nutrient absorption . ) Well , the Fiskars pushed down and over the taller graas , instead of cutting it . So I got this much less expensive Black and Decker , and it does just what I want in no time at all . The height settings permit a tall but tidy cut , and the mower is quiet and light , easy to carry up the few steps from my driveway . ( I 'm a fit 54 - year - old woman . ) Pretty nice not to have to deal with gas , sparkplugs , odor and engine heat , too . Highly recommended for folks with a small lawn who value the attributes I 've described .
5 #### This big bowl allows one to whist away the water from lots of greens at one time . Great product
5 #### Fits perfectly and works as it should . I found no reason to give anything less than five starts .
2 #### I just want to say the handle on this item is too short . As a result , when you have steaming hot potatoes to mash your hands get burned .
1 #### I thought this inflatable would work for my garden but it would not stay inflated and looks more like a toy . Gave it away .
5 #### If you have unlevel surfaces you need to work with a ladder this is a must have . I must use a ladder to trim my hedges with alot of uneven surfaces and I would n't do it without these stabilizers .
5 #### Have it now , going on two years ..... my first purchase from amazon . Best hose nozzle ever .... considering buying two additional more ! ! Worth every dollar spent , and then some ! ! ! ! !
5 #### If you cut about three inches off one of the tubes at thick end , it 'll fit perfectly into a dyson handheld ! ! ! Ca n't get a tube replacement otherwise . This us cheap too !
5 #### Tried many hacksaws and this is the one I kept . fast blade changes and spartan comfort make this Stanley a great value . One piece of advice , when you close the blade tension lever , hold up the locking trigger and release it once you 've got the tension lever in place instead of " snapping " into the locked position . That saves wear and tear . As for blades , I recommend Starrett Bi - Metal blades , cheap enough and long lasting . Lastly , do n't loan it out or you might be back to buy a new one , lol !
5 #### Arrive quickly and extremely well protected . Clock set overnight and with some minor , easy adjustments to temp and humidity all 's working perfectly . It very good looking and VERY cool ( despite the relentless Florida summer heat )
3 #### Very study aluminum frame , but flimsy plastic joining posts . Need a rubber mallet to put it together . One plastic joining peg broke , so we glued it and strapped on a popcycle stick for support . Light is very bright .
4 #### Killed Algae . But to many warnings . Worried about it being truly a safe product for wildlife .
5 #### These Henckel knives are really wonderful . Great price on this one too !
2 #### Update : after a couple years of use , the non - stick coating on the collar has started to flake and peel off in large pieces , even though the sides of the pan are n't actually subjected to the kinds of scratching that a pan bottom might be , because you 're not cutting anything on them ! It 's coming off just from having things baked in it , plus normal gentle hand - washing with a soapy sponge . I have used one of these for a long time-- I like the glass bottom , though it was never a particularly tight seal . After living for a while with a cheapo IKEA pan in my other kitchen ( I commute 1100 miles and unfortunately have two of many things ) , I finally decided to " spring " for a nicer pan , so to speak . The first one arrived and was all scratched up , so I returned it and got a second one . Filled that one up with water , and indeed , drip drip drip drip . It 's from where the collar joins , since indeed , the outer side of the ring has to be looser than the inner side . Batter wo n't drip through it or anything , but butter in a crust , or juice from baking fruit might . It 's not actually worse than the cheaper pan , so I decided not to return yet another one . Overall , I 'm quite disappointed , since I was hoping that by shelling out the cash for a fancier pan , I might get a relatively drip - proof one ...
5 #### We have a B&B and a farm . We did n't want bugs on the deck while guests were out nor did we like all the flies that were in our barn this year . We placed the unit , as directed , 25 feet from the deck and also in line with the barn door so it would pull the bugs out of it at night . The first day we saw a lot of dead bugs . Still , we had flies in the barn . The next day , the unit was so full of bugs we thought it had burnt out ! It had n't . The barn was almost cleared of flies ! By day three , we can actually stand in the yard and on our deck without being chased into the house ! Twilight is bug time , as we have ours on a dawn to dusk timer . Once it goes on and is dark enough , the deck is virtually bug free . Several people cut out the grate to let moths in . We did n't . We have had several species gathered around the unit in the morning , including several luna moths . My garden in now filled with colorful moths that come at night to the light and stay for the flowers in the day !
5 #### Sometimes these go on sale and the price is unbeatable shipped to your doorstep . Lysol has always been a staple in my house , kills germs and smells nice . The original wipes I was not a big fan of because they were just wet wipes but now it 's dual action with one side that scrubs , I guess they took it out of the Kirkland wipes playbook because it 's extremely useful to have some rough edges to scrub out the tough stains . Watch out for shipping though , I bought 6 packs and 3 of them leaked . Luckily they shipped fast so minimal liquid was lost , otherwise totally worth it when they 're on sale .
5 #### I used this to repair an older Gilmour 2000 PPW , two gallon sprayer and it fit and worked just fine .
5 #### it is very good for the quality but it is changing color gradually :(
5 #### A very nice pressure cooker . The screws that attach the handles to the main body get rusty after a bit , but you can get replacements somewhere .
5 #### very sharp and if it lasts as long as my last one is a good buy .
4 #### The only reason I gave this item 4 stars was that I bought them for a shower gift and did n't try them . The bride requested them , however , and was thrilled to have them . ( She loved the grips and the colors ) .
5 #### I was replacing my Presto pressure cooker I had for thirty years ! Recycled it to my daughter . Love it ! !
5 #### I 've been using this cooker for about four years now and it has exceeded every expectation . Prior cookers had rocker valves that used to drive me nuts with rattling , and they released a lot of steam . This cooker is very easy to control pressure . It does so quietly , accurately , with smooth distribution of heat due to copper being sandwiched into the bottom . All around a true 5 star performer . We 've used it hundreds of times with excellent results . Easy to clean , this is a cooks dreamware . Worth every penny .
5 #### A watering can that has a GENTLE sprinkle attachment that actually works ? ? ? Is such a thing even possible ? ! ? ! Yes , thanks to Haws and this absolutely fantastic product ! It is ridiculous how many watering cans I have gone through , somehow thinking that I would finally find one that only sprinkles and does n't have to be at just the right angle with just the right amount of water to prevent it from just gushing out in a violent and harmful stream . This can waters everything from the biggest tree to the smallest little seedlings with utmost care . I have literally destroyed entire plants just trying to water them with those other cheap pieces of crap I have had over the years . In the end though , this is still just a watering can , so believe me I know that it is insanely expensive , but I have gone through soooo many cheap ones over the years , just to end up throwing them out like the garbage that they truly were , that I would have actually saved money if I had just got this to start .... I recommend this to any and every gardener for sure !
4 #### A nice little spoke shave plane , not quite the quality of the old nice ones from a time long gone but adequate for the task . Not a plane I use a whole lot but invaluable when the occasion presents itself . I am still looking for the guy what made off with grandpa 's early 1900 's planes and other tools , oh well , I will make do with the modern replacements even if they do take a bit of tuning up to get them up to snuff but once you get things flat and polished and honed you are good to go .
3 #### It fit on my Dewalt table saw , but the neck of the bag seems to close up and not stay open . Therefore dust collects in the chute and does n't get into the bag after a few boards . If there was a plastic neck inside the bag to keep it open , it would probably work much better . I ended up buying " 2 - 1/2 " x 10 ' Ultra - Flex Clear Vue PVC Hose " , cut a section off and put the it in a 5gal bucket with a 2 3/4 - 3 " hole cut in the lid . So far I have n't had to clamp the hose on the neck and most of the sawdust ends up inside the bucket and a little bit ends up on the lid .
5 #### This pan worked like a charm with the Martha Steward popover recipe . I have tried to make popovers on a few earlier occasions and failed miserably - using muffin tins , ramekins ... no go . This pan is perfect . Pre heat it , add the batter , bake and DONE . They are truly non - stick so I do n't even spray them before adding the batter . The pan is super easy to clean with hot , soapy water . Glad I made the investment . I love popovers , and now they actually turn out . :)
4 #### Whoever wrote the instructions for this grill should live in China .... Ah maybe that 's my problem ! I already owned one of these grills and I was so confuscioused I almost had a mental breakdown putting the second one together .... Product is great ... Instructions horrible ! .... I would like 10 minutes alone with instruction writer !
4 #### I bought two of these in Spring 2011 . They are " tough " , work great , and are easy to control with one hand . Within a few months , both were leaking a little but not bad enough to warrant a return . By summer 2012 ( and now out of warranty ) , both were leaking badly . I wrote the company and even though I was out of warranty , they sent replacement o - rings at no charge . It takes less than 5 minutes to take the nozzle apart , take out the old o - rings , put in the new ones , and re - assemble . After replacing the o - rings , both nozzles work like new again . I do wish Bionaire would spend a few cents more on materials , and perhaps use silicon or teflon - encapsulated o - rings that would last longer than a year . But kudos for the overall design , and for standing behind the product even after the warranty is up . Taking one star away because it requires o - ring replacement every year or two , but otherwise a good product .
5 #### Great electrical plug replacement . My extension cord had a disagreement with the hedge trimmer ... This was an easy and inexpensive fix to get the extension cord back in the game . The three wire attachment points are color coded and the cord is well secured into the housing once you screw everything back together . I was up and running again in under 5 min .
3 #### It may be because the fire pit is made in China but it 's the fittings were the wrong size . Seems well made .
5 #### Along with Titebond premium wood glue this easy to use tool made short work of my broken cabinet drawer face .
5 #### Great product in a great package making it easy to apply . My use is in standing water areas on our property : rain barrel , landscaping drainage , and in the hole where our water meter is located . After applying these BTI granules I have not seen a single mosquito in any of these areas . We re - apply it after rain storms or in the case of the rain barrel ; about once a month .
5 #### Have bought 3 of these over the past dozen years . The batteries give up eventually and cost more than buying a new whole unit . The wife claims it is the best among a half dozen she has owned in the ability to pick up stuff off carpet and linoleum . The only device where " it sucks " is a compliment
5 #### I 've had my salad spinner for over a month now and use it all the time . Love that I have an easy way to wash my greens without having to dry it with a paper towel anymore .
3 #### It is OK . But one thing is too light . when winding hose reel cart is easily move . There is one footing plate but it is too small to bear winding force . If you make four place anchor hole then much better like tent .
5 #### It 's cute and portable so I do n't need to drag a wooden yard stick with me . It gives me about 3 feet , but most of what I measure is below that . I can have it hang on my work apron along with the other portable tools I need for my job .
5 #### The new four wing technology incorporated in this router makes for excellent burn - free performance . Cutting is fast and without those annoying tear - outs that often appear on end grain and when working against the grain .
3 #### If you really are trying to get the best out of your lawn , just spend the $ 20 to get a soil sample tested at your extension office . If you just want a ballpark figure of how acidic your soul is ( " Do I need to just add a bit of lime , or a whole bunch of lime ? " ) this more - or - less works .
5 #### use it every week . it keeps my lettuce green and fresh longer
5 #### Love this hose it is all I use to water my lawn with . We have a well and so do n't want to over water anything or I will have gravel in my washer or o water pressure . These work great and the company stands behind the product too .. Great price too ..
5 #### This 14 " Aluminum Pipe Wrench arrived quickly ( I ordered a Wednesday afternoon & it arrived by the following Monday afternoon ) and in great condition . It was packaged fairly well and recieved no damage in transit . This was one of the best deals for this tool that I found in my online searching . Very happy it arrived quickly as we 're in a production environment & have a constant need for these types of tools , but are always looking to save some money . The wrench is in great working order - works as expected & described !
5 #### Very durable , comfortable to hold with the OXO grips . Blades are nice and sharp and always deliver , slicing up my apples perfectly . Highly recommend .
5 #### This salad spinner works quite well . This is what I call a required tool for home cooks .
5 #### Hey , its a fire extinguisher ... what did you expect ? Have a 50 yr old wood house ... this is crucial for the kitchen . If i need it I know where it is . Packaged well ... no shipping explosions ... and ?
4 #### These are still the best mice and rat controls available .
5 #### and in this case it worked as expected , and was delivered as promised . Whne the price is right I will buy again .
5 #### We have not been disappointed with any of the OXO Good Grips items we have purchased . The grip is perfect for stable working with foods of all kinds . We will buy from this company again ( if the ones we got ever wear out ) . Solid products and a good buy compared to the cheap ones also on the market for non - stick cookware .
5 #### I bought this to make a connection from my 4 inch hose and reduce down to 2 1/2 shop vac hose it works good tight fit does not come loose made of good material I am very pleased with my purchase .
5 #### Great Dado set . I 'm really an amateur with wood working , but this set really seems to perform . Nice clean cuts , comes with spacers and shims ( thought the instructions said they had to be ordered separate ? ? ? ) . I 'd highly recommend this set , and the price is very reasonable vs what you would find similar for at one of the big box stores .
5 #### I 've bought several different ones and this one is the best . Works like a champ .
5 #### The schematic is way to small to allow its use in guiding you through assembly . The instructions tell you INcorrectly which wrenches / sockets to use . They give the wrong size which you will quickly know so that is not bad but certainly careless . It scared me that with that blunder what other surprises lurked . Basically , it is easy to assemble but you might need to look at the pictures on the box to know what to do as I mentioned the illustration in the instruction manual is to small to be seen clearly . Also , in the illustration shown above the orange devices are used to elevate the stand for mobility . As shown , they add width to the stand and you may not have width to spare . The good news is that they can be mounted 180 degrees opposite that shown . Though this may make it a little harder to step on which is how they are activated . Another thing , the poor instructions tell you to look for " silver " screws that were not in my parts . Turns out that they were just not " silver " but were included . The metal is heavy duty and should perform as indicated . I would recommend .
5 #### Just what I needed for my roses ! ! Love these pruners ! !
4 #### Great products , should include a fork . If it did , it would be five stars .
5 #### Living in a gated community carved from wild growth acreage , it was n't long before squirrels gnawed holes in the screened lanai to get to the bird feeder that I use for the finches that fly free in the enclosure . I purchase a couple of these traps to catch and release the little buggers . I put unsalted peanuts atop the trap lever , engaged the mechanism and placed both traps near where I had just paid $ 100 to replace the ruined screen . While enjoying a cocktail on the lanai , I saw a squirrel approach . It cautiously smelled the peanuts and inched into the trap . Goody , I thought , a victim . That bugger tiptoed to the peanuts , grabbed one and darted out , causing the doors to slam shut moments after the squirrel was long gone . Being , hopefully , slightly more intelligent that the rodent . I devised a way to put the lure underneath the trap mechanism . I put peanut butter on a small piece of aluminum foil and folded the foil . I slid that under the trap center , making it necessary for squirrels to reach under the trap lever to get the goodies . Success ! That afternoon , I made three trips to the lake a few miles away to release captured squirrels . To help the adapt to their new neighborhood , I put a handful of peanuts on the ground . I highly recommend the Havahart trap .
2 #### I 'm a nut about popcorn ... love the stuff . My old popper finally gave up so I got this one . Boy does it get HOT . Not dangerous hot , but if you like your popcorn to " roast " a little before popping , this " ai n't it " . The ' stir ' function is a joke too , more of a hinderance that anything . Kernals get stuck underneath it ... even after tweaking ( ok , bending ) them a bit . Personally , I wish I had n't bought this thing . I could do better with a big pan on the stove , and it would be easier to clean ! I wish I could find another one like my old one .. I'd buy one used ! ( I used to use a spoon to stir the seeds in my old one , plugging it in , and unplugging , till it was just right .. THEN I let it pop! .. it made great tasting corn . Think I 'm nuts ? You have n't tasted it ! It roasts slowly before popping and has a GREAT " movie theater style " flavor ) Just my 2 cents from a popcorn fanatic . ( btw , air poppers should be outlawed ! That 's not popcorn , it 's packing foam ! )
5 #### Hoover vacuums are the best when used with their filters . Great price for these ! No need to buy expensive vacuums when these do the job .
5 #### This is the best food for any garden . Easy to use and my organic vegetable garden loved it ! I will be using it again this summer .
1 #### Tossed it into the garbage ! Do NOT purchase any hummingbird mix that has red dye in it as it is harmful to the hummingbirds ' eggs
3 #### works well . ez to set up and clean . no mess . Now if they can find a sure way to lure more mice into it . LOL
5 #### Love this fly trap . We have many around our garbage and we have a very small yard . The flies that are around the garbage pail usually land in our home when we open the slider to go out . I found by putting this away from the slider and near the garbage on a shepherds hook , it keeps them away from our doors . Do not put where you plan on eating , after a few days of warm weather it will stink , I mean really what do you want , use common sense where you put them . I think they are GREAT .
5 #### What a lovely high quality pan ! You can use anything from a small amount to a large amount in it . It 's really top notch !
5 #### Great tool to have around any kitchen . This is my 2nd one as the 1st one walked off during a party !
5 #### Original Hoover to replace belts that were seemingly difficult to find in retail stores . Two pack should hopefully last for awhile . Now I know where to get them again !
1 #### This fire extinguisher had a recall . it has never been used .
5 #### The best pizza cutter we 've seen , and we 've owned and looked at quite a few . Do n't mistake this one with the cheaper OXO cutter , make sure it is this model with the metal thumb piece . Works great , is super solid , cuts great with little pressure . The other one does nt compare , it is much flimsier , mostly platic , does n't cut nearly as well .
4 #### Bit 's cut well . The larger one of my set is slightly off balance ( excessive vibration and noise ) , but seems to work fine using a sturdy router table . Set was shipped in a thin , plastic , retail - type display package that kept them from getting damaged during transit but is n't made to keep . Both 1/2 " shanks / mandrels come with two cutters to adjust tongue / groove widths , each has multiple spacers / washers , a bearing , and locking nut .
5 #### WORK VERY WELL , AND A CLEAN CUT ... WHAT ELSE CAN YOU ASK FOR ..
5 #### I have only needed to use this once , so far , but it pops right out of its shell - like container by simply pulling up on the handle . It did an excellent job and as the " shell " stays open while you 're using the plunger , there is never any need to touch anything but the handle ! The shell automatically closes when the plunger is replaced . Genius !
4 #### This Sonic Mole Chaser seems to be a successful garden tool . Bought one a year ago for a flower bed my wife was having a mole problem with . She says it worked and wanted another for the garden . So , I bought 2 ... 1 for the garden and 1 for another flower bed across the yard . If she is happy , I am happy ! ! !
5 #### Great little spinner - highly recomend this product . It is a tad bulky and does not fold up , so be prepared to store this somewhere that takes up allot of space . As for the spinning feature and price , this is top notch and the best I have used . Easy to clean , durable and worth it
5 #### this I love ! well built , easy to use . I 've only used one other plate joiner in the past and from what I remember , this blows the other one away ! I 'm sure there are nicer ones out there , but , after my reviewing which one to buy ( for the money I had budgeted ) I went with the dewaly and I have n't been sorry for my pick . thanks dewalt
5 #### Nice large letters and can see both F and C readings from my breakfast table
1 #### Maybe you people just do n't order out enough . You can get the same functionality from chinese food carry - out lids or some deli containers . They 're sturdier and already paid for , and there 's also no shipping fee or shipping trash to deal with . I 'm willing to bet you 're probably creative enough to come up with something to elevate your pot inside the re - purposed lid just a little , too , to facilitate drainage .
2 #### I bake a lot of bread -- 20 to 25 loaves a week and I also make pizza several times a week . I 've owned four different Breadman machines over the past several years and generally , was quite pleased . However , I do n't quite know what 's happened . Late last year I ordered a new machine and after about a week of use , ended up being pretty unhappy . The paddles simply would not stir up the dough for a whole wheat pizza ( I used 3 cups white , 2 cups wheat each time ) and I had to keep re - starting the machine . Anyways , to make a long story short , the same thing happened with my bread dough . I did make a couple of one pound loaves that turned out well , but I had to stay in the kitchen and make sure the paddles were turning during the kneading process . Somewhere along the line , the Breadman has lost a little ' oomph ' . I sent that machine back , got a new one , and unfortunately , had the same problem . I do n't give negative product reviews unless I really have reason to . After all , there are people behind the product , there are jobs that depend on good consumer feedback , etc . So I try very hard to be fair and impartial . I 'm genuinely sorry that this product does not seem to be what it once was . But I ca n't honestly recommend it either .
3 #### This has got to be the smallest plane I 've ever used . It does a good job on cabinet door edges , which is why I bought it , and I 'm sure it would be just right for fine shaping of woodcrafts and such . Just do n't expect to do any heavy work with it . And unless you have small hands it 'll become uncomfortable to hold onto for very long . It 's good to have around , though , for those quick , small jobs .
5 #### I have wanted a stainless steel pressure cooker for ages ! This one was not only affordable , but it also cooks dried beans and , tough meat in a fraction of the time ! Would recomend .
5 #### This is a great popper . I have not had any issues with the metal rod scraping off the non - stick coating . I like this item so much I bought another one to give as an apartment warming gift .
5 #### These wood chips were the right consistency in moisture . They were n't too dry so I did n't bother soaking them . There are discussions on soaking or not soaking your wood chips prior to smoking . I got a good smoke from these with a moderate amount of time in which they burned for . They are a buy .
4 #### I have bought five of these , had to replace one after about one year . Great price , easy to set up , these work outside in a salty inviroment , three of work every day .
4 #### Well named , the best attribute of the Oxo Good Grips Vegetable brush is its rubber grip , which is oval shaped with a rounded top , and fits near perfectly in the palm of your hand , allowing you to get a rock solid grip , and effectively apply cleaning force . The bristles are short , ( 0.6 inches ) , and of moderate stiffness , so when you scrub , there is some give , but not a lot , and with a palm sized brush , you know exactly where the bristles are . The rubber grip remains easy to hold , even when wet . The brush is a little pricey , but it is very well designed , and feels great in your hand . It does a very good job of cleaning vegetables , and at other general cleaning tasks . Unless the product has been redesigned , the brush pictured does not appear to be current version of the Good Grips Vegetable brush . The brush in the photo looks more circular rather than oval , and rather than having ridges that circle around the edges , the sides of the Good Grips brush are smooth .
4 #### Should have had one for years but did not but now I am glad I do now and I wonder what took me so long .
5 #### Impressive , out of site , matches bathroom well and is a simple but necessary product .
4 #### This makes great popcorn with a small amount of oil . The only down side is that it 's a large unit to store .
5 #### Just as I expected from OXO- great product at a great price . Easy to separate and clean .
5 #### I bought this as a placeholder item to get my order up to 100 bucks . It came in plastic packaging , looks durable , and definitely in new condition .
3 #### It sprays water but the cats just walk beyond the area that gets sprayed . They do n't seem to care . They ( I have two ) have a tendency to break . The settings dial never worked properly , and even when turned off for four weeks somehow ate the battery . Animals must be large , probably raccoon or bigger . Definitely does n't go off for birds or squirrels ( though butterflies immediately in front of the sensor sometimes did . ) For me it is a source of aggravation and would probably serve me better used as a projectile .
4 #### Here on the High Plains of Colorado , we get infested with these damnable Miller Moths that can really mess up the house and are a great nuisance . I bought this to try and clear the inside of the house at night , and it pretty well does . Some moths are only stunned , but that makes squishing them a lot easier . It is a bit loud , but that 's not an issue for me and where I set it up . I have n't notice any files yer .. there was one or two in the house , but I do not want to load up any smelly attractant to see , as flies are n't the problem I bought it for . Same for mosquitoes . If the attractant does n't smell , I may give it a shot too .
5 #### Tommy the Carpenter says : You need a Utility Knife , then this is the knife for you . Tommy calls this his Banana Knife cause it is shaped like a Banana
4 #### I like it . Would give it 5 stars but setup can be a little tricky for a novice like me . The iron came with a shellac like coating that I felt like I needed to remove before use . I do n't have to proper sharpening stones to do a proper finish on the blade . I did the best I could . When I initially set up the tool I had the blade set too deep . But with a little trial and error I found the proper depth for the cut . I have n't measured but I feel I 'm getting shavings that are no more than .002 " . I 'm getting nice translucent shaving . I think that with practice and proper sharpening I will learn to love this tool . Update - 09/17/2015 : I have sharpened the blade to a mirror shine . It is razor sharp . What a joy to use . To all you one and two star reviewers ; I recommend you give this tool another chance .
3 #### I have had 2 of these in 6 years . Work like a charm . Problem is that the white plastic ring cracks and eventually breaks . I would gladly pay 50 % more for the same design if it would last longer .
5 #### I gave it a five because it works perfectly for my Mitre Saw DW713 Type 1 . I would recommend it to anyone .
5 #### These are terrific ! Price was a bit higher but they sure are pretty like the picture . Everyone at the wedding loved them .
5 #### From what i ve seen so far .. this is a great set .. ! ! ! Very slippery so not much sticks to it .. but easly to drop so be careful .. One thing .. When you use for the first time .. Lower your temp in the stove .. because in my stove my first cooked set were to dark so i would take 3 or 4 minuts off it .. Other than that a fun way to cook make salids serving trays out of them can eat as you go to the bottom .. thanks again Chicago Metallic ! ! !
3 #### I used a cheap plastic mandoline for years . It finally broke on me and I replaced it with this . I used to use my first one all the time , but I actually avoid using this one . The top does n't fit that snugly on the bowl and it flops up and down when you 're slicing . Food seems to get jammed in the blades and there are only two slicing thicknesses - kind of thin and kind of thick . The food holder has these annoying metal pins that are supposed to move up as you slice , but I end up scraping metal to metal most of the time . There are two other blade types - julienne , which made a mess and french fry , which was pretty good . Overall , I 'd have to say it was just okay - but certainly cheaper than my other options which frankly , look a little scary .
5 #### I purchased this for my half sheet Porter - Cable 505 sander . The sander is 15 years old and the pad was starting to fall apart . Once I removed the old pad the new pad was a perfect fit , and easy to attach . I would purchase this product again .
5 #### Will be using these for my polymer clay jewelry making . Great quality .
5 #### This is my second ( I dropped the first one from 30 feet ) N62 . I loved my first one . It performed well for the 4 months I owned it . I purchased the Bostich to replace a Senco that I had many problems with . I especially appreciate the light weight and durability .... yes , durability ! ! The magnesium case and plastic magazine performed without a flaw ( although I was a bit skeptical at first).The nails sold here on Amazon have worked quite well . I have used 1.5 " , 2.0 " & 2.5 " and they are less expensive that the lumber yard and the home stores . I would recommend this unit to anyone interested in a 15 GA nailer .
5 #### this is actually our 3rd PC Belt sander - great product
5 #### I did n't realize how bad my old bread knife really was till I got this one . It 's awesome ! Worth every penny .
5 #### lots of power here , i used this to cut up my controller bought on amazon so i could install a super booster . upgraded from a cordless and this thing is great for cutting up stuff like computer cases , thick plastics , other peoples cars . good stuff .
5 #### My wife and I saw this salad spinner on the Ellen DeGeneres show . Her guest gave it to her as a gift and my wife said , " I 'd love one of those " . So I bought her one for a birthday gift . All I know is she says it 's GREAT !
1 #### Puchased 2 clamps .. The ends keep falling off . imported product .. Threw them in the trash . Got me a set of Craftsman clamps ..
5 #### This shovel lifts my dirt better than my hand does . :)
4 #### This seems to work although my son 's cheaper non fancy detector seems to work as good .

Until I received these as a gift , I only had smaller chimes ( Woodstock + others ) and now I understand the power of larger , more expensive chimes . These chimes are silver with light wood accents and are generous at 58 " long , but quite narrow in diameter . We have these Westminster Chimes on our lanai , as well as a set of Chimes of Neptune , and the two are a lovely pair . The Westminster chimes are loud , clear , and very much like a church - bell . I would n't say they are low ( the Neptune Chimes are much lower ) , but they have a full rich sound . They also chime liberally- not enough to make your neighbors hate you , but enough that the smallest of breezes will move them so soft chimes become the background music to your day . They ring often and beautifully . I 've uploaded a short video of my chimes ringing , so you can get a sense of the sound . I apologize for video quality- I used my iPhone for capture . You can also visit Woodstock 's website at woodstock DOT com to hear clear samples of all their chimes , so you can choose the best chime for you and your home . Enjoy ! < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Woodstock - Percussion - DCB54 - Chimes - of - Neptune - Bronze / dp / B00012NFWC / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Woodstock Percussion DCB54 Chimes of Neptune - Bronze</a >
5 #### Really good flavor ! Great to use 1/4 this with 3/4 hickory chips .
5 #### works as expected . no issues with the craftmanship thus far .
5 #### I am very happy with this sun catcher . It produces vivid colors .
5 #### Great suction , not as small as I was lead to believe based upon the other reviews , in fact a perfect size . Nice long cord .
5 #### I wanted this one because it is not very bright . The bulb burns out eventually .
3 #### I wanted a small tray to bake skinless chicken breasts at 450 degrees for fifteen minutes . I do not know if this will work because it is safe to only 450 degrees and the oven could go higher than my setting . I may have to order a stainless one instead .
5 #### How can anyone even write twenty words about a flywheel key ? It 's an oem rectangular slab of metal designed to break at a certain amount of stress , and hopefully not smear up the works too much in the process . It came quickly , it fit , and the mower still does n't work . The great thing is , if you have prime , you do n't have to waste time ( finding and ) traveling down to a well stocked enough store , so if you 're not going to get around to it until next weekend anyway , its ' a no - brainer .
5 #### Great fan ! It 's funny ... we decided to purchase another for a different room in the house ( used nightly as white noise maker ) , and then our other one broke on the day this one was about to arrive . Good thing we bought it ! It 's a great fan , the 1st setting is perfect and the 3rd setting is a hurricane sound for if we need lots of sound to block out a party or whatever .
5 #### I HAVENT USED THESE YET BECAUSE MY VACUUM IS NEW . I LOVE THE HOOVER WIND TUNNEL VACUUM . IT HAS GREAT SUCTION .
5 #### I grew up with electric can openers that inevitably broke or had a hard time attaching to the can , then the contents often spilled as I removed it from the magnetic holder . Back then the alternative was a hand - held manual one that was actually painful to use . After marrying we bought an electric can opener which broke soon thereafter . While waiting for the day when it was to be repaired ( which ended up being never ) , I bought this OXO manual can opener thinking it would be a temporary and inexpensive solution . It is awesome . We have been using ours for about 5 years and it is still going strong . It is fast , easy to use , and comfortable . There is no pain or discomfort when holding it . It cuts the can cleanly and is just plain easier to use than electric can openers . We are sticking with the OXO can opener and not going back to electric openers . I highly recommend this can opener , ditch your electric can opener and make things easier on yourself !
5 #### Jobs that require a pipe wrench tend to require some oomf . This wrench brings plenty of it . Built to last a lifetime and get passed down .
5 #### After moving I could not find my old sharpener so I went out looking for a steel . I figured my knives did n't need real sharpening so I purchased one of these . They are back to their old clean slice . Works well , nice price , nothing more to say that has n't been said by others .
4 #### follow the directions on dosage and success on your grow will be evident ... I have been using for a number of seasons and found it to be as advertized .. !
4 #### These are made of a nice quality plastic ( not cheap ) and hold up well . Easy to use and even if the threading is n't perfect , minimal leakage .
5 #### Have been looking for a really sharp parer . This is one . It makes a huge difference , glides through the work .
4 #### Nice product , I tried to use it indoors to get rid of some ladybugs , it only got 1 in 3 days . But I have had this product before and I know it will work outside for other flying insects . Only drawback is bottom part of item is a grate so it does not hold anything zapped . But I hooked up a metal tray with wires holding it underneath the unit for the time being . It has run for 5 days 24 hrs . and cord is cool to the touch .
3 #### My soil is always depleted of n no matter how much blood meal I add . I feel better that I test my soil but no idea of the accuracy of this test . Will wait and see how fall harvest goes .
5 #### I 've had many coffee cups . They all leaked , I do n't care but they leak from the drink flipping part . Well this one solves that problem . It closes tightly and keeps your drink hot and by hot I mean , really hot . Sometimes I forget that take a swig and end up burning my mouth . So when I make tea , I leave a about 1/2 inch of space to put some cold water . In the morning , it make coffee with my Keurig , but I have to take off the grill because this is a bit too tall to fix under the spout . It 's a great cup especially when I can throw it in my bag and not worry about having my drink spill .
5 #### Loved it . It covered a huge section of our yard .
5 #### The best thing about buying a ladder online is not trying to fit it into the car . This is a pretty basic ladder . You stand on it and reach stuff . It 's lightweight and easy to move around . I have n't tested its 225 pound limit , but it holds a 180 pound person without feeling like it 's about to collapse or anything ....
5 #### Good value , still have n't ran out . It 's very hard and tightly woven . I thought it would be softer but it 's very stiff .
5 #### Of course the squirrels eventually figured out how to get to it before it was the last one out of all my other feeders . Solid piece
4 #### We are on two wooded acres in Central Texas . I hung this outside about 80 ' from the back patio and had a fun time watching the bugs zip and zap for many months . Then the music ended . I emailed their support folks ( 3 year warranty ! ) and they said the main coil from China was faulty and they were experiencing many failures . They notified me when the good parts were available , they repaired it , and I 'm once again listening to the joyful sounds of dead bugs . I recommend this zapper but you may want to call their QA people and ask them if the faulty coil problem has been resolved before ordering .
5 #### This stuff workes great ! Keeps the flies away while eating outside .
2 #### The leather on these gloves is thin and soft . They show significant wear after stacking only half a cord of wood . They are quite comfortable and might be good for riding or driving but are not sturdy enough for actual labor .
4 #### Needs too much sandpaper to use . I suppose is best used with adhesive sand paper . It has a nice weight to it though . I 've tossed it a few times at Chip&Dale with a nice effect .
3 #### I love these connectors . But they are plastic . They break . The metal ones are very expensive for what you get . Best part about plastic is you do n't get bimetallic corrosion . You just need to be more careful with them
2 #### I ordered both this and the Victor Magnet fly trap the same time but received the Victor one day earlier . It works great . This one does n't come close to the Victor . This is disposable and the Victor one is reusable but they are both the same price . This one after more than 24 hours up has maybe a half dozen flies in it whereas the Victor has tons in it and the flies fly around it until they can get into it . This one just is very underwhelming . One note about the Victor VS this one is that the bait smells more and is stinky . Definitely use outdoors . One note is that they are both hanging from the same hanger on my back patio and this one is about 2 feet lower , not is some different location .
5 #### When I lose one , I buy another Stanley - I use Stanley products for my home - base projects . They are always dependable .
3 #### Not very sturdy & your potatoes have to be the correct size ( not to big ) . You really need to use your muscles to push veggies through . It 's okay .
5 #### My previous canister vac was a Miele that cost over $ 1000 , and never worked well , not even after another $ 400 in repairs . For a fraction of that price , this unit sucks up dirt and dust like a champion on hardwood floors , and does a good job on low - pile carpets . It gets into corners and is maneuverable under low furniture . It 's almost ridiculously light in weight , and the cord is decently long . Even if I threw one away every year for the next ten years , I 'd still have a better deal than with the Miele .
5 #### This turned out to be darn near awesome ! My old peeler was about 10 years or more old . Although it still worked , there was a definite issue with it being sharp enough to get the job done . I also hand washed it every time which may be why it lasted so long but was still more of an inconvenience . I bought this one after doing a little research and reading reviews . Super glad I made the decision because it works perfectly ! Testing it out , I peeled 2 cucumbers in about 2 minutes or less . Huge difference from my old one which took longer and was not as easy . This OXO peeler is smooth as silk with the peels long and even . I also tested the dish washer safe claim when I first received it which was accurate . A good peeler is especially important nowadays since I tend to cook healthier meals . A good peeler also makes for good cucumber tzatziki or sweet potato fries ( baked of course ) . If you need a new peeler , this is a good choice !
5 #### OMG ..... everyone should own this Oxo spatula . I 'm a lefty & always challenged trying to flip food on stove top . Cookies / biscuits , everything slides right off w / this . Gave one to everyone in my family . Such a simple design , genius ! Plus it 's least expensive piece of Oco products out there @ $ 8.99 .
5 #### I love the way this mixes batter without the batter getting caught in the middle of the spokes . Scrapes the side of the bowl easily too .
5 #### Yes , you can use this to core apples . You can also use it to hollow out baking potatoes to make " stuffed potato bombs " . And it works like a charm for that too . See the bbq pit boys recipe on youtube ... [ ... ]
1 #### Worse than a 99 cent wrench . Wo nt even open up or close up without a lot of work . Returning this ! WOW what a piece of junk .
5 #### to supply rakes to all the lawn service companies that come around with their jet - propelled leaf - blowers , kicking up dust clouds of cancerous toxins , deafening even the deaf . Another thought - these rakes are like a cool person - gentle in its strokes , tough when it needs to be .
5 #### I love it ! I have been making my own espresso for years now and used a variety of " caffettiere " . This has to be one of the best . Not sure about how to move the pin , though . It is set firmly in place .
5 #### Replaced the old cord in my antique lamps and these worked great for that !
5 #### if your a woodworker you use Titebond . If you 're not using it , shame on you !
4 #### Overall this is a pretty good spatula . It 's a little on the small side so you may need to invest in a larger one for anything large . For smaller work it performs well . The handle feels good and does not slip even with wet hands . Personally , its slightly overpriced but not enough for you to not at least consider it . Happy Frosting !
4 #### I live in a 1400 sq ft 3 bedroom condo in San Diego . Our HOA prohibits window fans , so instead of mounting this fan in the window , I 've mounted it in the access opening to the attic . This fan fits perfectly in the standard sized ceiling panel ( 16x22 ) opening leading up to the vented attic above my condo . This fan pulls a lot of air through all of the rooms , creating a nice breeze and keeps my electric bill low by reducing my use of AC . It is relatively quiet considering the amount of air it moves . I 'm rating this a 4 instead of a 5 because the control dial works well enough but it feels flimsy , is made of cheap plastic and comes off too easily .
5 #### Could nt find in ANY local hardware stores . Great price and a good product to have on hand . Hit a stump and thought I screwed the engine up , nope just sheared the flywheel key . Super easy to replace using a couple youtube videos and mower was up and running great . Have spares for when / if I hit that stupid stump again !
1 #### The female connector on the first one detached from the hose even before it was filled with water ! Apparently it was not glued . Second hose just burst open and not excessive water pressure . The third one is still working amazingly enough
5 #### Love these ! Best I have used . Blades stay sharp and even my hubby can use them !
4 #### Does a great job of getting water off veggies , but has a big cupboard footprint . The lid seems rather cheesy , construction - wise . It 's good that a rinse in hot water will clean it , because if I had to take it apart every time , I would have been very unhappy with it !
5 #### Very easy to use and durable even with my heater . I tested it for two weeks during the day and the power surge was still cool to touch .
5 #### Really nice . Better than the chuck for lateral forces , perfect replacement for the original collet
5 #### Great product and fast service , so we are very happy with our purchase !
1 #### Fast delivery but the item does n't work properly it burns half of Corn kernels before they pop . I would return it but I through away the original packaging , I 'm stuck with something I ca n't use ! !
2 #### The stand out on this tape stinks . It is otherwise perfect , but the way I work makes standout important , so this is n't the tape for me . for a pocket 16 ' tape I prefer the Komelon SL29116 .
4 #### Given the price and the length of time these each work .... you have a 2 - 3 year supply . Store them in the same box used to store the zapper " off - season " - BUT KEEP THEM IN A LOCATION SAFE FROM CHILDREN .
1 #### Purchased this back in 2014 and I have had two issues with it . First of all , it recently broke where the female coupling that attaches to the hose attaches to the nozzle body , for some reason it just separated . There are some threads on the piece right there where it somehow joins the two parts together and they just came apart . Impossible to put this back together correctly so it is junk at this point . Secondly , the spray pattern is weird when you turn it on . Rather than going from a nice spray to a more forceful one , it first goes into a pinpoint , hard spray pattern first , then to a nice open spray , and then to the full spray . I 've never had a nozzle that did that and I really never liked that . Giving it one start since it lasted all of 2 years . Not sure what their warranty is but I am checking that out now .
5 #### It 's hard to say anything that has n't already been said , except that the author of the single negative comment obviously never used the MS-2000 stand . It rolls easily over rough ground , sets up in seconds , knocks down almost as fast , provides solid support for lumber and cutoffs . Mounting bolts for the DeWalt miter saw are a wee bit tight between the frame members . I liked the suggestion here to cut a new , deeper MDF top to allow the saw to straddle the rear frame member and provide more wing support in front of the saw 's fence for wider material .
5 #### thanks to amazon my wife got her stockpot at a decent price , and it was Farberware . this made her happy so now i am happy
5 #### Nice find to replace only Carving Knife and NOT have to purchase set ! !
4 #### Love it as it works like a charm . Good quality too .
5 #### Tape measures can be awkward . I like the folding rule for its ability to fold into a compact shape that tits easily in back pockets . The most helpful feature is the brass slide which allows for accurate measurements . A tape bents when taking inside dimensions , so we have to take our best guess at the dimension . The accuracy using the slide is about 1/32 - inch .
4 #### I bought this item in the middle of leaf season after the ancient sweeper I had broke down . I was a little dubious about buying it because of the complaints in the reviews about missing parts and difficult assembly , but went ahead anyway . When it arrive a critical part was missing ( side connector tube ) which made completing assembly impossible . I called customer service and they sent the part right out , but it still took UPS 5 days to deliver it . On a tip from another reviewer I went to the Agr - Fab 's website and watched the assembly videos . That was a big help . While the assembly is not hard , the written instructions are just diagrams , no verbiage , so unless you can figure it out it could prove a challenge . Now for the bottom line . It worked very well . I used it several times to sweep my 3/4 acre lot and it did a great job . With the leaves all gone , the sweeper is now folded for storage and in my shed . My only complaint is the some - what clumsy universal hitch set - up .
5 #### This is a very handy seeder for small seeds , especially carrots . Dramatically reduces the waste of thinning 10 seedlings per inch . The thumb wheel vibrator works OK . When I plant a large row , it 's quicker to just tap the side with my index finger .
4 #### much better than the crappy other Stanley screw drivers sets that are hard to grip and slip off the screws they are slightly lower quality than klein , the tip is not as good , or is the grip , but klein screwdrivers quality is dropping and the tip wears down , and klein costs a lot more they are good to use all day , they will last for years , nice grip , nice tip , great price $ 16 I bought them years ago for $ 12 on sale , good for pros or diy other than knives , tape measures and these screwdrivers maybe hammers , stanley tool quality has dropped a lot , i go into target and all they have is Stanley cheap crap tools , which are not even good enough for diy ,
5 #### So easy to use . Less strain on your hands , no sharp edges , works beautifully ! ! ! only down side is if you need to drain something , you need to use a collinder , but other than that it is wonderful .
5 #### As an " old timer " , I remember when my mom used a pressure cooker a lot for making meals . I had no idea how they worked , but once I decided to get one , and did my homework on different brands , I found that this brand was rated quite highly . I 've used it several times and it 's amazing how fast they cook food . This has several safety features and it quite easy to use . Looks good , too . Would recommend it . A great way to cook food . and a very nice cooker to do it in .
4 #### I bought this to use on our willow tree after reading the active ingredient will work on the willow blight - I hope it works ! The granules make it very easy to use .
4 #### I gave it a 4 star instead of 5 because a part was missing that collapses the table , but we do n't need to collapse it , so we did n't contact seller . Besides that it 's very heavy , sturdy and we love it especially the color . It will never wear out . And to collapse it would take two men due to the fact of weight .
5 #### This helps out quite a bit if your in direct line of site of it . Stay some distance away as well because it does attract the mosquito 's and if they see you on the way to they trap they still like people better than the light . It also gives a source of entertainment . We have found that a couple of toads around the house prefer their meals cooked and hang out under the zapper for a meal .
5 #### This is the original . I 've bought cheap copies in the past & not been happy . Happy I spent a little extra money this time & got quality . My only negative is that this size is a little big for one or two people . You might want to have the smaller pot on hand as well if it 's just two of you . For those of you looking for dimensions I added a photo .
4 #### This was a gift for my son , he loves it , I ca nt wait to try it out myself .
4 #### Have n't had to replace the belts on our Hoover vacuum yet as we only recently purchased it . If the need arises to change the belts I will update this review with useful information .
5 #### First one I bought finally wore out -- esp . on the bottom . ( Careful dragging over concrete ! ) I use it to put paper yard trash bags in so that they will stand up . Very helpful .
5 #### My wife was a air - popped popcorn zealot . I grew up with one of these and was finally able to convince her to get one . She has n't had air popped since . It is simple to prepare : 2 Tbs of any oil ( corn , olive , butter , whatever ) to 1 cup popcorn . It pops popcorn quickly and we have never once had a batch that was even a little burned . If you like butter on your popcorn then it has a section on the top of the bowl where you can put solid butter . The steam will melt it evenly onto the popcorn as it pops . To clean up bottom just wipe the oil out . The top can go in the dishwasher . One thing to keep in mind , the bowl top is plastic and it will not last forever . We have had our 3 years now and are still using the original top , but it has several cracks in it . Conclusion : It will change your popcorn life for the better , but be prepared to replace the bowl every couple of years .
5 #### Well engineered and easy to use , makes various measuring task easy
5 #### Very happy ! May be a little more than I wanted to spend , but a nice fan .
5 #### This is pretty cool . We 've downsized and did n't want another rusting grill marring the backyard view . This came quickly . Assembly as easy . Works great and I can easily carry it to wherever I want . Will be great to take on camping trips and picnics . I saved the box just for that . I have several Lodge products , what a great company and made in America ! Oh , and two really nice ribeyes fit easy .
4 #### This works okay , but I found that I much prefer a manual file , or better still , a manual file with a bar - mount filing guide . The Dremel tool files quickly , and I found it much too easy to be a little off in my angle when the stone started shaving metal . I bought one of the Oregon bar - mount guides , and I have been very pleased with the result . I still plan to take chains in for professional attention about every fifth sharpening .
4 #### I bought this for my lanai so I can see the time from the pool and also from looking out from my glass slider . It is accurate for both the weather and time part . It is protected from the sun and water so durability should n't be an issue for me .
3 #### I like mine , the color is a bonus . I do n't use this type in cold weather as it gets too stiff . In the cold I use rubber . This is why I rated 3 stars .
5 #### This is an amazing and easy to use pressure cooker for a beginner like me . It is of a substantial size for a family of 4 and will easily fit a whole chicken .
5 #### We have a small farm . These take care of the vermin in a snap ! Nobody gets away .
4 #### I decided to buy a more economical friendly grass cutter and since I live in a townhouse , I thought it would be perfect . It cuts the grass very well and you can adjust the blade . My only gripe is that it works wonderfully if your yard is completely flat . I have a few dips and small slope and I definitively had to go back and forth over several sections which was time consuming and a little frustrating . Make sure to cut your grass weekly because it is more labor intensive if the grass is higher . On the plus side , it gives me a great workout and my grass is cut low !
5 #### Bakes a beautiful loaf of bread . A little bit small , but does a good job
5 #### This scoop is well - made and does not corrode . It works great for garden soil and for bulk fertilizer , which would corrode metal scoops .
5 #### Thesework fine and do trap fleas and other little bugs . Also double as a night light !
3 #### This tube feeder has the same problem almost all tube feeders I have found have . The tube is made out of clear plastic that turns yellow and becomes brittle over time and then breaks . The finish on the metal also deteriorates fairly quickly . It looked great the first season , but only so , so the second season . I was hoping to get a third season out of it even though it was looking in pretty rough shape , unfortunately plastic tube broke when I was trying to clean it for the new season . I 'm giving it three stars because the durability of this feeder is on par with other finch feeders I 've purchased over time . None hold up because they are so cheaply made . If it were n't for the fact that this is the standard quality one has to expect from bird feeders like this , I would have given it two stars . I 'd happily pay twice as much for a feeder with a glass tube of the same quality as canning jars , and better quality metal / finish that would n't need to be replace for several years .
5 #### This Spinner is Simply Awesome ... We use it everyday .... you ca n't go wrong !
4 #### I 've been using mine once or twice a week since I bought it some weeks back . Never for from - scratch baking or thaw - and - bake operations ; always to reheat pizza or biscuits , or to make melted cheese open - face sandwiches , so the temp is generally 350F at the max . And I love it . Especially for those sandwiches - cover a slice of bread with cheese ( sliced or shredded ) , add a tomato slice or some sun - dried tomatoes , plus whatever else strikes your fancy . To reduce spillover , I usually assemble sandwiches first , then transfer carefully to the baking sheet , and feel virtuous about this tasty lower - cal substitute for a stove - top grilled cheese . ( Makes up for those reheated pizza slices . ) Also good for crisping pieces of tortillas - a light coat of olive oil on the tortilla , sprinkle on the seasonings you want , and give your home - made chips ten or fifteen minutes in the oven . Other non - stick pans I 've bought for the toaster oven quickly turned so grungy I generally have to cover their surfaces with a layer of foil . This has n't , perhaps because it 's been treated so gently . Anyway , here 's five stars for this one . UPDATE : Forget the foregoing . It 's achieved grunginess in the past ten months . Still works , but I 'm dropping my rating to 4 stars .
5 #### The Checkpoint 300 Ultra - Mag G3 8 - 1/2 " 4 - vial magnetic torpedo level is an excellent tool for the work that I do ; I am an electrician . My only complaint is that the wrong tool was initially sent . Amazon , when told of the error , fixed the situation very quickly .
5 #### I love J.A. Henckels knives . I 've had a set for ten years and it is still going great ! This was my next " must have " from them . I would recommend this manufacturer and this line to everyone .
4 #### very good at killing bugs , too bad they 're not zapped in oblivion- no mess
4 #### I rebuilt an old gas grill someone gave me ... it was rusted to pieces , but with this ( and a few other parts ) I am burning meat with the best of them .
2 #### Used it twice and it does n't work very well . We have matted grass / weeds and it did n't get more than 2 - 3 " down with lots of pressure . Our post - hole digger works MUCH better than this ! I 'll probably give it another shot , but am not happy with it at this point .
5 #### Used this to apply sealant to my driveay and it workd really well in terms of pressure and ease of use . If you plan on sealing a surface , make sure you get a fan nozzle to go along with this . This comes with a cone nozzle and it made the job a little more difficult and did not allow me to spread the sealant evenly .
4 #### we use it quite frequent and it seem to work great
5 #### At first , I grumbled a bit while putting bolt after bolt on the stand ( or base ) . As I got it together , I realized there were none that could have been ahead of time , unless you want to first remove them , then put them back in . No thank you . Also seemed a little thin ( as far as the framework was concerned ) , especially after having just put together a Rockler router table stand , that sets the bar pretty high ) but as it turns out , one all of those pesky bolts are tight , it 's pretty darn solid . Every item that I initially complained about silently turned out to be a strength . Except the little nylon bushings for the wheels . But they were easy to deal with once I gave it a little thought . Strong and easy to move . Rolls easy and finally makes my table saw mobile . Already ordered another .
4 #### As others have noted , the little plastic tabs that keep the two pieces together will break over time . I have one that still works with just one of the tabs intact . It 's in its second year of use so that 's not bad for a $ 13 item . There 's no leakage at all out of the one I have . I have several kinds of feeders and the birds seem to like these the best . If you have indoor cats they will get as much or more use out of these than you will .
5 #### I have had this set for several months now and have come to appreciate what others call " duplicates " as well as the perceived poor quality of the case . First off the duplicates in the case are the pieces you use the most , phillips bits . Because the tolerances of screws are not as tight as they should be I consistently round out either the head of the screw or the bit . The fact that this kit comes with several allows you to fit the bit tip to the screw . Second the longer bits are great for areas where a little extra length is required . I recently installed a hi - loft in my garage and the longer bits came in very handy and these bits do n't normally come in a set this inexpensive . Lastly the case , the size of the case is perfect when I have a small job to do around the house and do n't want to carry my 100 piece case around . The bits do n't fall out of their holders like many bits in other cases . Yes they are a little snug and I have large hands so it can be difficult to get them out but I would prefer that to all of them falling out every time I open the case .
5 #### Love this spitting axe ! Much easier to split for long periods . I still reach for the maul occasionally when dealing with a tough round but most of the time the X27 does the trick .
3 #### Few can afford a large shop with wide open areas for each and every tool . This lets me move otherwise fixed base tools to a position where there is workspace when I 've got a large piece that needs to be cut , drilled , planed , etc .
4 #### Long and heavy . Great for dense brush and tree limbs . Needs to be sharpened before use .
5 #### I already knew that the donut - shaped dunks worked for water in ditches , when it rained that much , but I was convinced they were still breeding in the mud and shallow water in depressions in the yard . So I bought these to sprinkle in such areas . After having time to work , it did cut down on the mosquito population . I 'm going to be sure and get it out at the start of breeding season next year , as another reviewer suggested .
5 #### Cuts like butta ! I have used this on steel and aluminum , and I am not disappointed . I am no professional and I have n't used it much , so my experience does not reflect longevity .
5 #### A set of these is included with the Weber Performer grill . They do a great job of holding the coals at just the right depth . They allow starting all the coals together , then separating them for indirect cooking in the center of the grill . Usually I put my two together in the center and leave them there , using the edges of the grill for items that I do n't want to put over the direct heat of the coals . One thing to look out for is excessive build - up of little charcoal bits ( like those found on the bottom of the charcoal bag ) and old ash . Too much of that and the airflow will be reduced to the point where the charcoal may not light . It is pretty easy to grab them with the tongs before starting and shake them . This makes any loose ash fall out of them and will help keep the air channels clear for the fire .
5 #### These traps are fantastic ! The best I have ever used for serious fly problems .
4 #### We have used these before . They are pretty effective to help keep the pond clean , but only as and additional maintenance tool .
5 #### The Weber Q was like my 7th grill purchased . I have a Genesis Gold B , a 22 " Gold Kettle , and both the charcoal and gas table top Weber Go Anywhere grills . One requirement I have of any grill I own is grilling power ( i.e. the ability to sear steaks ) . I was somewhat cautious about the Q 's ability as their tabletop gas model did not work well in windy areas ( like tail gaiting or picnicing ) . I 've used the grill twice so far . Once at a very windy stadium tail gaiting party and another time in my backyard . On both occasions , the Q worked very well . It cooked my steaks as well as my Genesis Gold B and tasted the same as my charcoal tabletop . It was very easy to use . It cooked evenly with no hotspots . Also purchased the cargo bag with wheels and all my friends where impressed when I took it out at the stadium tail gate party . The one negative is the propane tank support ring can only accomadate the long cylindral tanks not the more available and economical stubby tanks . I plan to go back and purchase the stand to make grilling easier . Also plan to purchase the 20 lb tank adapter . Overall , excellent grill .
5 #### these clamps work well ! and in the long run make it faster to get awesome consistent flush faceframe cabinets
5 #### All Perky - Pet . I have eight - eight oz . and three sixteen oz . Even though the birds come and go all day they all show up at seven PM . It 's quite entertaining watching fifteen to twenty birds visible at one time . I get about four days before having to refill .
5 #### Excellent ! ! ! I love it!!!The quality very good and I need it for my job ! I like this items very much ! ! !
5 #### My nephew is an avid hunter and swears by this device in the mosquito - infested Mississippi backwoods . I have used it a couple of times and find it is keeping the bugs away so far !
3 #### These are ok , but both ends are blunt , making it difficult to insert into soil ; also the green paint transfers to your hands if you are not careful .
5 #### I was sick and tired of having to wash my whisk when making more than one item that required the use of one - so I bought another one ! This whisk is sturdy enough that you can hold onto it well and the wires are delicate enough so as not to crush your eggwhites or whipping cream .
5 #### Best salad spinner ever ! Must have it set flat on the counter , and do n't pack it too full of fresh veg . Love the green color and the fact that the handle pushes down and locks in place .
5 #### I have owned several pizza wheels over the last few years , and I wish we bought this one first . Normally the others have a wobble to the wheels and some tend to rust a bit . Although I have only have this for a month , it it very sturdy and does n't wobble . It has a fatter comfortable grip too .
4 #### Meh , bought these for work . I searched metal tape measure . It looks metal . It 's not . Cheap plastic but the tape itself works nicely . I got these because of their price and the more expensive FATMAXes do not last long . They get crap built up inside the housing and keeps them from sliding in and out . > < I can buy of few of these for the same price and last just as long .
5 #### Amazing . I put this out last night and already there 's a 1 - inch layer of dead yellow jackets in the water . The pheromone really works , and the wasps fly around the trap in a frenzy . ( Once you hang this you wo n't be able to move it for a few days due to all the swarming it causes ) . I put the reusable trap by Rescue out at the same time to see which would work better for me . The reusable trap has caught maybe 50 in the same time - frame ( less than 24 hours ) that this one caught many hundreds .
5 #### These tongs are good and they are very easy to lock and unlock . We have four pairs and love them all .
1 #### I have a large piece of property in Arizona that requires the removal of bushes from time to time and I figured this looked like the perfect tool to cut the main trunk / branches of a dessert bush ; NOT ! ! ! ! ! It was worth a try , but it is clumsy and will not cut through most of the fibrous shoots of a typical desert bush . I am back to the pick and spade . I have many tools for tree limbs that do a much better job than this . I 'll give it to my brother . :> ) Note : My rating is strictly for the said application .
4 #### I bought this popper about 3 weeks ago . I 've made several batches since buying it . I must admit that this popper works great . It pops every kernel . Since you only use a small amount of oil , it is not oily at all . Also , it 's not as dry as those air poppers . But if you want tons of butter on your popcorn , this machine is not set up to do this . Although you can put real butter in a vent at the top of the popper , it 's not enough for a real butter lover ( you can always melt butter and add it on top after popping ) . However , if you want a slight buttery taste , with great tasting popcorn , then this is the popper for you . I 've read reviews where they say that the non - stick surface breaks apart . I have n't had that yet , but I will update this review later if it does ( check the date to see how much time has elapsed since I wrote this ... if no update , then it still works fine ) .
5 #### This is designed for mounting to a traditional round electric box . Mine old existing motion sensing light had stopped working and was on a rectangular electric box . I was still able to make it work but took a little extra work . BTW - I do n't recall the description station that it has a photo sensor . I assumed it would and guess what ... It has one , so no waste of electricity by it tripping on during the day . Works perfectly for my application and I 'll probably buy another one for the " dark " side of my home .
3 #### I glued these strips to the top of a horizontal section of downspout using silicone caulk . Most birds seemed to be deterred by the spikes , but one persistent robin built a nest between the spikes . I removed the nest prior to any eggs , and it did n't return .
5 #### Love it ! It has a satisfying heft an is large - between blade and handle , it 's about a foot long . Bought it during a promo sale and it was a steal ; I wish I had bought a few more , to give to friends .
4 #### Excellent product . I have used it a few times now . Just becareful to use maybe a 1/4 to 1/2 the recommended dose .
5 #### I use this on my grinder to rough out carvings . It works great but be careful it is a cutting machine !
2 #### This tarp is very thin material . I have bought many of these type tarps before . None come close to this poor , cheap , thin material . This is being used to cover our tent trailer in Southern Calif. Heat . It will only last a few months in heat and Santa Ana high winds . Wish I had known th poor quality . It will tear at grommets and stress points easily . Will look for better investment quality next time .
5 #### Its an angle square ... not a whole lot more you can say about it ... So , it works and does what s expected .
5 #### Did n't know how much I needed these . They 're so handy in the garden and very sturdy . Very happy with the purchase .
3 #### not sure these work right with my tester vial . Not sure if these are too strong or not ? Would be good for a HTH tester ?
5 #### Absolutely beautiful design . I have been buying all of the pieces to this design and everything is beautiful and such great quality . They are pretty heavy , but I like that about them because they feel so sturdy . You do n't have to be gentle with them . They can go in the dishwasher and microwave and be used as everyday dishes , but have the look of something you 'd keep on display and use for special occasions . I love the very creamy ivory color . The distressing on it gives it a Tuscan look which fits with the theme of my kitchen and dining room very well . The color and design with match any type of decor though . These are excellent quality pieces . I just need another set of the mugs yet , and then I will have every piece in this design . No complaints at all with any of them .
5 #### I ca n't rave enough about the Stir Crazy Popcorn Popper . I think we 're on our third one in 20 years . They last a long time , they make the best popcorn and a lot of it and its so easy and makes almost every kernal pop .
4 #### Reviews indicated it would take quite a breeze to make this chime but I do n't find that to be the case . Slight breeze sets it off . Stronger breeze & I 've had to take it down . Not quite as resonate as hoped , more tinkly . Love the tone with just barely a breeze , but quickly becomes annoying in any breeze you can see the leaves blowing . Wish there was some kind of damper that could be attached rather than having to take it town .
5 #### This is a great tool to connect into your electric drill or battery drill . You can use your Hex Drill bits or Hex screw driver bits . It makes it quick and easy .
5 #### The " bug light " that these are for is fabulous . I own two ; one for the upstairs , one for the downstairs . I do n't have to replace these sticky cards very often because my main problem is those tiny annoying fruit flies . It occasionally catches a moth or fly , but those rarely get into my house . UPDATE : 1 ) After I had these for a few months , the cards did n't fill up as fast . 2 ) After almost three years the bulb burned out . But so much of the glue has " melted " and run down off these glue card inserts that the bulb socket is full of the glue ( and clumps of dead bugs that were stuck to that glue ) . I do n't feel it 's safe to put a replacement bulb in . I 'm debating about replacing the entire unit . That 's pretty costly . I also thought about hooking it to a timer so that it 's off during the day ( when the bulb does n't attract as many fruit flies ) so it can cool off and not melt the glue as much ... but I 've not seen a timer yet with the outlet in the right position for this to work .
5 #### This can opener is THE smoothest manual can opener I have ever used . It does n't take up space on my counter top , it 's easy to clean , and it 's silent . Yes , you still have to turn the handle or whatever , but it is nearly effortless , and I 'm a tiny female with tiny hands . Proportionate tiny hands . Why waste electricity ? I never thought I 'd say this , but I wo n't be using electric any more .
5 #### Wow ... wish I had gotten this product years ago ... i have a table saw that I roll out to my driveway to use ... but the wheels under it stuck in place long ago and it became an exercise in dragging it out and back when done ... well , with this new bad boy ... my life has become a little bit easier and moving that table saw is now not an issue anymore ... I have found that I use it more frequently for small jobs because it has become so easy to use ... and I love that it locks in place when I position it in the correct location for use ... this product is tops in my book ! Assembly was a bit painful ... it takes a little bit to get it together .... but was worth the effort !
3 #### Takes a lot of time to do these tests and you need to be sure to do them when you have " daylight " to compare the colors . It seems like you can have a huge degree of discrepancy depending on the color and brightness of the background when you are looking at the tests to compare the colors . It was not easy to discern the correct test levels since the printed colors do not correspond well to the sample colors when doing the tests .
5 #### I have a 5 gallon red / black Shop Vac I use in the garage . The original box has part number 901 - 07 on it for replacement dry filters so I assumed this was it . Turns out it was , fits well over the foam sleeve , no issues . Have yet to clean one and see how long they last .
2 #### The description says " Leak Resist " which really means that this thing will leak . First time I used it , I put water in and turned it upside down . It leaked from the spout and the top where the lid screws on . I reattached the top which stopped the leak from there but the threads are minimal so you have to put it on perfectly . As for the spout plug , it does not make a tight enough sea so the best I could do was slow down the leak . On the positive side , the tumbler is easy to hold and to push the lever . It also kept my coffee hot for a good period of time . I will be returning as I feel that a thermos should not leak at the top seal and the spout is just a gimmick .
5 #### It works great for large cans that wo n't open with electric can openers ..
5 #### Tried everything . These work the best ! Smells like butt so keep it for away from living areas . Can fill these up in two weeks easily buy extras !
5 #### It does what it 's suppose to do and it was much cheaper on amazon then in the store pulse no tax . I would recommend it . We will see how it holds up over time but for now it works great
5 #### It 's an awesome little gadget . I do n't know if there 's a better design that would prevent it from wiggling but it was n't really a problem . I 'm really glad I bought it . Very helpful . :)
5 #### This is an excellent filter . Does just what it was advertised to do . Excels the original filter . Quality above expections .
5 #### Best price I could find on the internet , delivered in days . I would deffinately recommend to anyone Amazon usually has the best price and I love the free shipping that Amazon offers .
5 #### I worked for 40 years as a Millwright in heavy industry and carried a Lufkin inside rule in my back pocket each and every day . I felt naked if I left it somewhere . Yea , I 've worn out my share of rulers and busted a few doing stupid ruler tricks , but overall , you ca n't find anything better . Period . They are very well made and maintain their measuring accuracy over the life of the product . Wood butchers probably wo n't like this ruler , but if you do the kind of work that I did , you will be very pleased .
5 #### Hi . I really love this product because I can create different drawing / precision marking for just about anything my mind can get into . I was surprised to see that it was made in USA , so I was extremely proud of that ! Everything 's a bonus ! And , the T - bar can be taken off if need be , but can be stored for future use . I HIGHLY recommend this product for anyone who needs precise measurements ( in 1/2 increments ; also , a 0.5 - mm pencil is recommended . Anything larger than that will not work ! ) . GREAT PRODUCT ! SPEEDY AND PROMPT DELIVERY ! A++++++++++ ! ! ! :D
4 #### It 's the ones I need to use for my little vacuum . That 's it . No choice .
5 #### We string a few of these along the roofline of our single - story house , one over the garage door , two others over windows along the front of the house . They look festive , are easy to store , and can be machine - washed if disrespectful birds happen to soil them . Appear to be made of poly - cotton , I launder them in cold water and dry on low heat . Sturdy grommets allow for quick hanging .
1 #### It 's super thin and flimsy . I love our existing collection of OXO products , but this one is a complete fail . If you try to flip something heavier than 1 small egg it will give out and slide off .
3 #### I needed these out of season , so they were expensive .
1 #### I wanted to love this so bad ! The water reservoir had rust and calcification spots . I followed the instructions to " make a pot and waste " to see if it would go away . It did not . Returned .
5 #### Stick a Frued blade on this sucker and game - over , pal . This is one powerful saw , and as accurate as my table saw . Buy this one with 100 % confidence , friends . Highly recommended .
5 #### I am a happy camper ! I had broken the tape on my 16 footer and search till I found this size and style . It is just a really good fit and weight for me . I love having my Stanley 16 x 3/4 foot tape again . I have other style 16 's and plenty of 25 's laying around,10 footer too small and the 25 ones are to heavy and big to do small projects . Product is made in Thailand for those that are concern .
4 #### I love the baked shells . The only problem that I have is that the raw shells sometimes want to slide off the rack , but once in the oven , they soften and fold into shape . I just have to learn not to move too fast with the loaded rack .
1 #### The first one ( our of 10 ) bursted ( more like exploded ) . Luckily it happened while behind the glass plate in the lamp casing , which is very solid . Now all these bulb plus the 2 lamps are decommissioned . Time to upgrade to LED .
5 #### Used it as soon as it arrived . Zippered bottom empties as expected . I get about 60 percent containment but that 's not a neg since it all depends on your equipment . I 'm using it on a Dewalt table saw .
5 #### I look at the craft stores at paint brushes and they can be so expensive . But they do n't always look like quality . I paint signs just for a hobby , and I hate when you get a piece of brush in the paint . I have not had that problem with these brushes . I 'm very happy with them . I am just a hobbyist , so I only use them occasionally . But they have worked great for my signs .
5 #### We just bought this at Home Depot on sale this week . It cuts like butter on this bush in front of my place . You can open them wide to trim any small - medium size bushes . The size width says only 1 - 1/4 " is 3.2 cm up to 3X more cutting power the titanium is superior rust resistance , ultra - smooth cutting action it reads on the cardboard . Model number is 7972 , it feels light when you hold them , I really wanted another model . The price was the same but a wee longer .
4 #### Product arrived as advertised , but packaging was ... noticeably deformed . Must have been good enough , as the product was not damaged ( packaging , yes ) .
2 #### The pan I received was okay but was not what I wanted . The pan pictured has smooth handles and the one I received has the " braided " texture handles and the edges of the pan are really sharp as another review noted . It is a lighter weight than the one with the smooth handles . I already had an original platinum bundt pan and this was not the same . Mine is the heavier one with smooth handles . I will wait and order what I want later . I gave the one I received as a gift to someone . Since the price was good and it could serve as a gift , I did n't go to the trouble of returning it . It is troubling that the product is misrepresented in the picture .
5 #### LOVE my Stir Crazy . My old one is strictly set aside for use in making Kettle Corn , and I bought a second one to keep nice for regular popcorn . ( and I 'm always afraid they 'll stop making it , so I have a spare ! ) And the easiest Kettle Corn ever - 1/2 cup popcorn , 1/2 cup oil , 1/2 cup sugar . Unplug it immediately after last pop or it will burn . Shake it all up , add some salt . So good .
5 #### Not much to say , it fits perfectly for my 3 gallon shop vac .
5 #### We appreciate how safe this is around our dog and that it actually melts ice ! Sometimes you have to spread more if the area was not treated for a few days .
5 #### A must have for all terrain scaffolding . I will always prefer a pump jack system to a traditional scaffold when conditions permit .
5 #### According to Amazon , I purchased these knifes in May 2003 . It is still the knife set I use today . The paring knife has a very small nick in it , but it has n't affected use enough for me to be concerned . I 've hand sharpened these knives about twice a year , and nine years later , I could n't possibly justify replacing them . They are serving me very well ! I 've probably used the paring and chef 's at least 1000 times each . Great long term investment in a quality knife set . I 'd buy this same set again , even though now , 9 year later , I could afford a more expensive set . No need .
5 #### This is easy to use . Really do like the back - up battery . Much better than the previous cordless vac I had .
5 #### This is a great hose for gardening , I am very happy with my purchase and glad I read the reviews .
5 #### three cats and three dogs so we love these and the traps solved a major Florida flea infestation for us . Traps work for ants tooo
4 #### works good to keep the tubs of water ice free
5 #### Very nice grip on various , potatoes , zucchini .. Anything you wanna peel quick and yet do n't want half a pound go in waste . Love it !
4 #### Not the most sturdy thing ever made , but definitely needed for supporting stock . It does the job . If you have a Bosch contractor saw you really need to get this for safety purposes .
5 #### You can spend a little less or A LOT more , but for the price , this Johnson 48 " box beam level is Well Built , Lightweight , Solid and Accurate ... competing with levels costing 5X its asking price . For the past 35 years , I 've never missed magnetic I - beam levels , so the excellent features this unit has should meet my needs for another 35 + years !
5 #### I have used a couple times to make short bread cookies . They are definitely too sharp to use with a silpat but work good with dough rolled between parchment . I have run them through the dishwasher with no rust and the can of them tucks away nicely in the utensil drawer .
5 #### I used these to make a different shaped cutter . They held up .
5 #### Got two of these to replace the switches on my gas fireplaces . Wow what a diffrence ! no more waste from the kids and my youngest ( 2 yr old ) who loves to flip switches ca n't quite turn this while the older two ( 4 & 7 ) can leave it on in the TV room all day . Great little switch wish I 'd done the swap a year ago . Simple job to change them out everything you need is there and it takes all of 3 - 5 minutes .
5 #### Best clippers you can buy . A little expensive but worth it .
2 #### This is a top notch product , well made out of good material but when you toss a steak or burger on the grill you will not get those nice grill marks on your meat that you expect to see . The SS racks do n't have the mass of the porcelain on steel racks my grill came with and consequently do n't have the same browning effect . I will be replacing these SS racks with the porcelain on steel racks . The cast iron racks are just too much trouble to bother with .
2 #### Fortunately the unit I purchased was not in as bad a shape as units others received . The wooden slats were splintering in places but not warped . The unit is minimalist , not in terms of design but of quality . If it were made properly - heavier metal , vise mechanism more robust , better wooden slats , it could probably command twice the price at Amazon and be worth it . Unfortunately , it is made as a semi - disposable unit probably not the result of being made in China but of what B & D dictated as cost . The instructions for assembly are close to useless - figures misnumbered and not very informative . Made instructions from IKEA look like a Mercedes service manual .
5 #### Like all OXO Good grips products , this one performs well without creating hand fatigue . Makes great zest for recipes and drinks .
5 #### Over the years I have been quite happy with Stanley tools . I am not a professional carpenter , contractor or anything like that ... simply a guy who likes to dabble in woodworking from time to time , building birdhouses and such as a hobby . I am a " tool freak " though and after 50 some odd years of collecting ... well , I have quite a collection . Of the carpenters squares I do have , and there are several , this is fast becoming my favorite . It is build quite sturdy and can take a pretty good beating . The finish on it does discourage rust ( This is one of the biggest problems I have had over the years ) , and if I keep it clean and dry it should last for quite a few years . Measurements are easy to read and if you flip it over there is a conversion on the back ... this saves much time and aggravation as I am not a wiz at math and such things . It is made from a heavy metal and unlike many of the aluminum models you can purchase , this one is not prone to bend and not prone to get little nicks along the edges and corners which will swiftly ruin a square such as this making it almost useless . The price here , when you consider what you are getting , is great and I find the Amazon price quite competitive and wish I had looked here before I bought locally . Don Blankenship The Ozarks
3 #### I 'm generally satisfied with this purchase - I mean , the hummingbirds use it , so what 's to complain about ? The actual materials and construction do feel a little chintzy , and after filling and flipping over for hanging , I always end up with a hand streaked with sugar water . Acceptable , but nothing special .
5 #### I absolutely love this item . I does a great job and can handle the hard potatoes with no problem . I would have liked it to be a little bigger in size because it really only cuts the smaller potatoes . I have to cut larger potatoes in half in order to get them into the opening . Still it 's great and I am glad I bought it .
2 #### I initially really likes this cooker , but that all changed when I tried to used it to make rice . I followed the enclosed directions , and while the rice came out mostly good , some of it burned ! If that was all , then i would n't be writing this review , but not only did some of the rice burn , but the bottom of the cooker BOWED OUT ! PErhaps it is the nature of the very dry climate I live in , but there directions did n't call for enough water , which allowed for the potentially dangerous situation that occurred . I have not felt that it was safe to use for pressure cooking since , so it has just become a regular pot . As for the people that are complaining about the handle , I recommend getting a screw driver and tightening it . It 's not that big of a deal .
4 #### Should come with screws . Sturdy holder , just put it up a few days ago and so far - so good .
5 #### I love this pressure cooker . You ca n't go wrong with the name Presto . It 's the perfect size for me .
5 #### It 's OMRI listed which I look for . It may be the number one thing besides water that my plants do well from the most . Wo n't grow plants without it , because otherwise they seem to just keep dying without it .
5 #### This is just what I remember from my childhood . I was able to set it up in five minutes and BBQ'd over the weekend . Easily fit a steak ( 1 lb ) and several hot dogs .
5 #### I bought this one to replace the one I bought at Lowe 's and lost after nearly 5 years of use in my 18v cordless . Apparently the old adage it true ... if you want to find something , buy the replacement . I found my lost one and put it in my new compact drill and will continue to use it until it is worn out , which apparently wo n't be for a long time . I 'm not sure why Lowe 's and Home Depot stopped selling these , but it 's their loss since it 's available at Amazon . Easy , one - handed bit insertion and removal make this a convenient addition to any drill .
5 #### great value great quality this goes with my saw that i also purchased and I 'm very pleased with both saw and blades
2 #### Ca n't beat Lithium Ion . Got rid of the drill and battery . Replaced it with Rigid ( life - time warranty , even on the batteries ... WOW )
5 #### I am glad I decided to invest in a set of dishes / pot / pans specifcaly for my toaster oven . I was not totally certain all my previously owned materials would be acceptable . I love the beige / gold color , now everyone in my house knows these colored pots / pans are for the toaster oven .
4 #### I had to contact Camp Chef for a replacement . The original was pitted and dings on the threads perhaps it was used . I did n't want to take a chance of any propane leak from damaged threads and needing pipe dope or tape to fill any gaps .
5 #### Seems of good quality and has not presented any problems . I am happy with this purchase .
3 #### functional , but could be better . It needs a hilt so your hand does n't slide down when you press , blade could also be a little sharper . OXO is a good brand , this works , but could be better .
5 #### We only needed one light - bulb , but ordered this bulk - pack since the Ikea - light - bulb only lasted for 9 months . The light - bulb works just perfect . We need those light - bulbs for our IKEA KRYSSBO Pendant lamp . Saved us a one - hour trip to IKEA and lots of money by buying those in bulk . The color is exactly the same shade as the Ikea - light - bulb . Very satisfied with the quality . Thank you !
2 #### The Lasko fans I 've used in past were good products ... not so with this one . While its reasonably constructed and moves air as you would expect , the speed range is seriously flawed . The slow speed is about the same as medium or high for other fans . The slowest speed makes a quite noticeable ( and objectionable to me ) amount of noise , and moves more air than needed for that speed IMO . Medium and high are a little faster and noisier , and somewhat redundant . Noise is very subjective so the best I can think of to get my point across is that if you were in a room talking to someone , and this fan was then turned on and set to slow speed , you would need to raise your voice to be heard . My Lasko Wind Machine 20 " has a relatively silent slow speed compared to this one . I had bought a stack of them , one for each house occupant 's bedroom window . As it turns out I will return them all except for the one I opened which will be used downstairs . I 'll be searching for another brand of fan that lets you choose quietness when you want it over maximum airflow . Frankly I ca n't believe they sent this product to market . Apparently Lasko DOES make a bad product sometimes . If you want a quiet fan , this is n't it . Do n't buy it .
3 #### Let me say that this appears to be a great product , but for smaller yards . I have a large yard with culverts and the long hose hook - ups were just impractical , so I bought signs .
5 #### These are an absolute must have ! Great for working alone , or just when you do n't want to bother a coworker to help you . Saves a lot of time with the great standout . Better than the Bostitch tapes due to Bostitch 's heavy end clips making the tapes buckle when measuring with the tape on its side ( like when measuring siding , etc . ) . These tapes will wear out , just like any other tape . You should buy at least a couple , and just accept the cost . I promise you 'll find a use for them . If you want them to last , just do n't let it retract to the end at full speed . That 's very important . The tape is heavy metal , and puts a lot of stress on the inner coil when retracted to a stop at full speed .
5 #### How did I do without you with of all these years of cooking , dear tongs , until I recently found you ? Love you . And it 's nice that you go into the dishwasher and into the drawer folded and wait patiently for the next meal . These are a kitchen - must !
5 #### Great quality for the price ! Lightweight , but sturdy construction with two light settings . I 'm also happy with the fact that it uses AAA batteries . You think that would make it too heavy or awkward but it does n't . Its also much easier to find AAA batteries than a lot of book lights that use " watch - like " batteries . This is one of the best book lights I have ever purchased , I 've had it now for 7 months and no signs of early wear or tear .
5 #### Makes good popcorn . I 'd skip the whole butter thing , just makes it a mess to clean up and does n't work particularly good , just melt in the microwave and top when it 's done .
4 #### Good brush , but it loses a star for the fact that it requires a 1 " wrench to take on and off which is bigger than most sets have and thus is kind of a pain .
4 #### As far as the product quality is concerned it 's truly a 5 STAR ... As is with most Nordic Ware ... HOWEVER--- I give it 4 Stars because we have a Countertop Breville Convection / Toaster Oven ( Great Product ) and these items look like they 're from a " Child 's Playset " in comparison . So , if you have a small Toaster Oven this set is going to be PERFECT for that . The servings that can be achieved from the individual wares in this set will most likely be 1 to 2 . It seems unfair to give them a rating of less than 5 , in particular when it 's mostly my fault for not totally understanding my purchase . However , I gave it a four star so as to not damage it 's rating scale , but to gain your attention so that you have a clear idea of where this product fits very well .
5 #### Great axe . I 've never split wood before and I was able to split huge rounds without issue . It really is an amazing axe that I will be recommending to everyone .
5 #### I really wish the vacuum would have come with more than one of these belts . These seem to break when I vacuum over something that gets wrapped around the agitator and then causes the belt to part . This product was perfect for my Hoover vacuum though . Thanks .
5 #### This is a great little strainer , its serves many purposes . Its especially great for rinsing berries and quinua ( sp )
5 #### Really handy little device . Functions flawlessly and seems like it will last many years . Kind of superfluous to have two of them , but for the price I 'm not complaining !
2 #### I thought it would work a little faster . I followed the directions , but it did n't speed the decomposition up any faster than Mother Nature
5 #### This light is a nice entry level light , that allows for starting one or two flats of seeds . The stand is a little bit flimsy , but overall good quality . The fixture and bulb are good quality , HydroFarm is a company that has been around awhile . The only issue for me was the fact that since I was using 72 cell seed starting indoor greenhouse flats , is that the light itself is n't quite wide enough for those flats . The seedlings on the outer rows lean in toward the light , and become leggy . Very minor complaint , if you used narrower flats the single bulb would be perfect . It fixturte is very easy to adjust in height as well . Just be careful , this product opens the door to indoor plant growing , and I 'm already hooked , and I will be buying Hydrofarms 4 foot 4 bulb ballest soon , that will fix the wide seed flat issue . Overall good product .
5 #### very durable , well made . Has lasted 3 seasons and going strong .
5 #### I needed a peeler and read really good reviews . Did not disappoint ! I love the thick handle . Growing up , my parents owned the cheap ones with a skinny handle and I remember my hands would feel raw after using it for too long ( peeling raw potatoes are the worst ) . I do n't feel any discomfort .
5 #### This is a great Pressure cooker , I have worn out one . I used it for about 27 years and it would still be going if we had not burnt something in it and caused the pan to get pits inside . This one is littler weight then the old one but does a great job . Hope I can use it another 27 years .
5 #### Really good blades . Admittedly , I have broken 4 of the 6 blades but I was running the blades to the ground with heavy use . Overall , best blades I 've used and would recommend it . That is why I am buying by next set of blades .
4 #### I like a light knife with a thin blade so I look for inexpensive ones that look to have decent steel and a nicely tapered grind . This does , but the factory sharpening job is bad . If you do n't know your way around a sharpening stone , you might be disappointed .
5 #### Mighty Bright XtraFlex2 Light - ( Blue ) is a cool quality light . Nice , attractive blue color too . Lightweight . Buy the cradle available for it . You wo n't regret it . It attaches to anything metal.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/B003B0JPKW / dp / B003B0JPKW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">B003B0JPKW</a>&nbsp ; . I use the wall outlet 's electricity ; never used batteries with it yet . Strong LED bulbs with 2 light settings . Quiet clicks when changing light settings , so you wo n't wake your wife / husband .
5 #### I could n't imagine I 'd be so impressed by a hose , but I am . This one is supple , light , coils easily into my hose container . The only drawback is that the color ( white with a blue stripe ) does stick out in the garden . But it takes a lot of work to kink this one , and I 'm glad I bought it .
5 #### Spend the money and by the leather handle version of this hammer . Very nice , very substantial , quality built .
5 #### Been buying these since they came to market over 15 yrs ago . Remains a terrific product to add to your suite of pruners , loppers , saws , etc . Makes sure - fingered dead - heading and snipping out die - back ( all on small plants , perennials , etc ) It 's Not a pruner , you keep these on you when your in the garden and come across a dead - heading job . Only trouble with these is that all your pockets will get holes in them from the points sticking through the fabric . lol Best to hang onto the orange tip cover , if you can . My best wishes in your garden this year .
5 #### This hose came as expected and on time . Have bought hoses from different vendors and they would leak at the crimp fitting in about a week . I have had these for around 4 months and the seal is still good . Should have bought these to start with would have save money . I recommend this product .
5 #### Excellent for upholstery ! There is no safety feature which made me a bit nervous being I am a novice . After the first chair I was using it like a pro .
5 #### Went with the 4 " size to varnish an antique table I am restoring . Probably should have gotten the 3 " for the job but the bristles leave a smooth finish anyway and I believe it has saved me a lot of time where other 4 " brushes may have required additional work smoothing out the strokes . After a few uses and liberal cleaning as instructed , the bristles seemed to improve with use , softening the brush strokes . A great product . * * edit * * not sure why this review is saying verified purchase of the 3 - inch brush , but I bought the 4 - inch brush for sure .
4 #### Perfect replacement . Just be warned , you need a 2x4 or other long block to wedge the blade up against so that you can torque on the nut to get it off . I shoved a sledge hammer handle into the grass chute and wedged the blade up against that while I used a socket wrench on the nut . Easy .
5 #### Best reading light I ever had ! ! ! ! Very bright and flexible .
5 #### Typical Dewalt just staying in touch with the user 's needs . Really nice quality .
5 #### Absolutely the nicest thing I purchased for my yard . Took about 20 mins to put together . Overall sturdy and will last for many years to come . You wo n't be dissatisfied !
5 #### These pans fit the big flour tortillas and make a bowl that holds a big taco salad . We have enjoyed doing a taco bar buffet for informal entertaining They come out very attractive and crisp when bake according to the instructions that come with the pans . Two pans might be enough if you have the time since it takes only about 8 minutes , and you can be doing something else while the bowls are baking . Buy extra tortillas since some of the tortillas are far from perfectly round and the results can be lop sided ( or maybe that does n't matter ) . Baked bowls are healthier and the pans are high quality . I 'm glad I own them .
3 #### This wind chime is very cute and nice to look at but I have never heard it chime . For sound , it 's a dud .
2 #### Disappointed , did not work very well with 2x6 treated lumber . The drilling is slow and the countersink slips . Do n't buy !
5 #### We 've tried a few feeders . This one is our favorite and we get a lot of hummingbirds . Make your own filler with water and plain white sugar ( about 3 or 4 parts water to one part sugar ) . Do n't waste money on the red hummingbird food .
3 #### Very light duty . 1 big potato and a strong arm will cause it to fold up and turn it into a bent up mess . It 's like a door , it closes tight only if you slam it . When I get my new heavy duty french fry cutter , this thing will have a date with the garbage man .
5 #### It worked so well we had to open a window in a pop - up trailer . It does suck down propane . We used a 12 ' hose to keep the propane tank outside the pop - up and it used about 1/2 the tank ( was full ) per night . Did not work so well as the tank got low but that could have been due to the 12 ' hose ( less pressure from the longer hose ) . High was way to hot and low worked best for a 500sqft pop - up trailer .
5 #### Delivered quickly . Perfect . Had missed having these in my kitchen arsenal .
4 #### OXO Good Grips 9 - Inch Whisk seems to be about half the size ( volume ) of its 11 - inch counterpart which can seem a bit unwieldy . Easy to hold with the thick handle , seemingly well - built , and quite efficient . Due to its smaller size , it can not dip very far into my ingredients , so it remains the primary whisk for small batches .
5 #### Awesome they loved it ! easy to put together - easy clean up - lightweight
5 #### I 'm a beginner / learning woodworker and I needed this bit to build a workbench . I decided to buy this bit based on online reviews and other Amazon reviews and a preference to buy quality bits when I need them ( rather than an inexpensive set ) . I have not used a router since grade school , but the bit cut through kiln - dried lumber like butter . The bit itself was heavier than I expected , and seemed to be machined well , which was reassuring . There were some occasions when the router started to catch on the knots or other imperfections in the wood , but I think that has more to do with the grade of lumber and my inexperience than the tools I used . Regardless , the bit left a clean , sharp cut with absolutely no burn marks or raggedness . I look forward to using this bit on other projects and gain more experience in woodworking .
5 #### I just used this 3 days ago , and used the ' heavy feed ' option to apply to newly planted begonias and some already potted plants . Well , my begonias are already perky , and my petunias look like they are on steriods ! I got a little disgusted when I discovered that there was ' bat guano ' in the ingredients and thought I would not purchase it again , but after seeing the effect its had on my flowers , I 've changed my mind . I just do n't think I will use them on my vegetables , but I will use it on flowers !
3 #### I 'm disappointed at how this shows watermarks . It does n't remain clear and attractive after it 's used for a while . I thought for the price it should be better .
5 #### This little GEM not only trims all the edges in places the mower misses , it 's a two second WEEDER also ! If you insert below ground , it will slice through anything , and take out all the weeds in no time flat ! Goes like mad for about 30 minutes . But by then , you 're tired , and want to stop anyway !
3 #### difficult to install and actually takes longer than I expected to clear the water .
5 #### Great value . I have flags now that will last for 20 years too .
5 #### After tossing two of these bales into my 3000 gallon pond , I 've only had minimal algae . I would buy these again .
5 #### Very useful , watch out as they can bend if they hit a hard surface while working .
5 #### All the other watering devices that use a glass or plastic bulb inserted into the dirt or that use a soft drink bottle attached to a probe just do n't work well . I found these searching the internet and after reading reviews bought 5 . They were great - they do just what you want them to do . I then bought 20 more and am very happy with the purchase . I would recommend them to anyone , just be sure to follow the instructions to prep them for use .
4 #### Love the high pressure rating but the connections are n't rated so high , perhaps 50psi ... if lucky Love it 's rubber , the ONLY hose worth any investment at all , the rest are pick pockets Quality brass connectors
4 #### I received the item , but the gauge needle was on the line for EMPTY / FULL . I called Amazon and they were able to replace it with one that the needle was clearly in the green . On the bottom of the first can , it had a manufacturing year of 2013 . Seeing that it 's still December 2012 , I was skeptical . The new one is from 2012 , so we 're good . I 've seen cheaper on sale at Menards ( of course , just after I bought this ) , but those sales are few and far between . Whatever . This unit is a basic disposable fire extinguisher . It 's going to be made of materials that are not built like old Volvos . It 's made for one purpose - USE ONCE . Okay . I just got it so I had about 12 seconds to get my family out of the house if fire is in our way . That or a small fire in the kitchen . You 're not going to put out a 5 - alarm with this thing . But then again , that 's not the point of this item .
5 #### It looks well made . I have not used it yet as I have not installed my wood burning stove yet . With this wild weather we been having , I have plenty of large limbs down in the yard to try it out .
2 #### I put 2 of these in a running creek . I was hoping to avoid putting in chemicals and decided to try these since they are natural and I have animals drinking out of the creek . These helped a little bit but not enough to prevent algae from growing every week . The creek does refill itself after the level goes down because of usage , so maybe that is why these do n't work . They may do better with a pond that does not replenish itself and is stagnant .
5 #### Stanley and the other companies can keep trying to build a better mousetrap , but this knife is still the best around . The blades stay in , there is blade storage in the handle , and it comes apart easily to clean if you get it all gunked up with roof tar or adhesive . You will need a screwdriver to change the blade , or a coin or the head of a 10 penny nail or your laborers nose ring , but it 's fast and simple and you can be cutting again in 30 seconds . This knife is all you need .
5 #### wow this really worked great first time using it , very high quality
4 #### Worked great for clamping the my cabinets together while I screwed the faces together . I did have issues when I used them to attach 3 " filler pieces to the end cabinets . The clamps would n't hold the filler pieces flush .
5 #### I get wireless temperature readings from three places , , one from my outdoor garage , for outdoor temperature reading , 2nd from a shady area outside to get its reading , and third sensor a reading from attic . Hold the channel button down for 10 seconds and the unit will cycle thru all three sensors , giving you readings at a glance this unit works very well , picks up signals with no problem
5 #### This has what I was looking for a slider on one end and hook on the other end for convient use when measuring .
4 #### Love it but mine did n't last as long as it states .
5 #### it is unfortunate that some of the want to be hardware stores , do n't want to carry the accessories for the items they carry , just the fast selling stuff . But then , if they did , there would be no need for Amazon . It is good to be able to go there and buy what you want . And if you do n't have it in stock , you will order it for me . Now I need to place another order .
3 #### Been in a while and have noticed no increase in the breakdown speed of the bin
5 #### My husband and I strung this roll out ( all 100 feet ) and cut it in half to make two strips of 3 1/2 feet by 100 feet . We put it up in February and it is still up ( it is July ) . We have had a raccoon climb over it and not rip it . We have had our cats run into it and not rip it . We have also had our chickens run and fly into it and not rip it . Those other people who gave this crappy reviews are wrong or they strung it too tight .
3 #### Not sure if it 's the unit or the quality of popcorn , but it has n't lived up to my expectations of great popcorn .
1 #### I wanted a good cyclone for my 4 " dust collection system . By the time I wasted money on weatherstripping and figured out an sealed way to connect the hoses I spent much more money than the slightly more expensive options available on Amazon . I have wasted time and money . I made a poor choice .
5 #### Sharp , easy install , cuts smooth , fast shipping , great price . Fit great on my old cast iron 6 " delta jointer .
5 #### This is an excellent small tool that works as it should , and with a very reasonable ( low ) price . I have found it to be very handy tool , light weight and of course cordless .
5 #### I 've been using square D breakers for 40 years without a problem .
5 #### This saw is extremely sharp , about the sharpest I have ever used . Makes excellent clean cuts . One word of warning , the blade is very flexible , cutting a straight line on thick sections is not easy .
5 #### Love these chips . Use them in our gas grill and the family and guest have commented on the additional smokey flavor produced . Will buy again .
5 #### I saw this whisk reviewed on America 's Test Kitchen and just had to add it to my utensil collection . OXO is always a good choice .
1 #### This metal is thin and cheap . It broke within just a few uses .
1 #### Very bad sprinkler head . Would not rotate no matter what .
5 #### Excellent ! No need to waste money on anything more expensive .
5 #### I love my West Bend popcorn popper . It pops all the popcorn . Easy clean up . Just wipe out with paper towel . What I do is make a few batches and put them in plastic bags . This way I make popcorn every three days instead of every night . I would buy this pop corn maker again . My sister bought her Stir Crazy 6 -quart electric popcorn maker at QVC and she paid almost $ 50.00 with shipping . The price for this is such a great deal . If you love pop corn this is the one to buy
5 #### excellent . I could not have dug the post holes with the conventional post hole digger in my sloped area with roots and rocks . I did use my hand saw to clear out the larger roots . & I did revert to the old hole digger when I wanted to jam out some rocks . I also used a trench shovel to break lose some rocks out of reach and then pulled out the rocks with the old hole digger . It worked for this little old gray haired lady . What was particularly nice is that you can slow down or work a bit easier with this auger when you get tired . The old way is either a constant strain or not getting the job done .
5 #### Sure , I like this grinding wheel , but I LOVE the drill doctor , it 's a must have tool that I lived too long without . If you 're looking at this wheel though , perhaps you to share my love of the doctor . Anyway , I use this wheel for large bits ( I did one 3/4 " bit ) , it does an amazing job .
5 #### Fast service on all my orders from Amazon Prime & the hummingbirds seem to love the mix & the six feeders bought from Amazon .
5 #### I bought these using an Amazon gift card from my son and just love them . First of all , I love copper color , and second they have a nice pleasant sound without constant clang . They are just the right size for my mobile home patio !
2 #### If you put a large clove in this one , you will be hard pressed ( ha , ha ) to squeeze it through unless you have large , strong hands . Mine ended up in the trash after one of the handles snapped clean off .
5 #### After enough no - name wrenches , I 've gone back to Crescent . There 's no comparison to the slide , the fit , and the handle
5 #### Works perfectly on Makita BO5010 . The metal backing appears more durable than the OEM pad on the Makita . Opted for this one after reading negative reviews on the Makita pad .
5 #### I am far from a pro but I do demand performance and quality . The store salesperson had not opened the new 7518 box yet and when I asked why not his reply was " I 'm afraid to look as I would have to take one home for myself " . This is a quality machine and it shows . Please do n't go try a craftsman ... UG ! I 've done that which is why I went top drawer this time . Tools are meant to last a lifetime and this is a proud machine to own . What a beautiful soft start to this powerhouse ! Nice Job Porter - Cable
1 #### Poorly constructed out of bad wood . The surface of the wood is all rough , and little shavings coming up out of it that get in the food . I tried to sand it smooth , and treat it with oil , but it still keeps happening . Too bad , because supporting local companies is a good thing , but this place just let crap walk out of their door .
5 #### Actually purchased to grate my glycerin soap into curls . Makes nice thick curls . Works great !
5 #### I 'm a private chef so I use this ALL THE TIME ! Works great for protecting and transporting my knives ( which are actually investments and key to my trade ) . It holds enough knives to be effective and it 's long enough to hold my really long chef 's knife ( WITH the tip - guard on ) . I 'm planning to buy another one for backup when the one I have eventually wears out .
5 #### If you are a new electrician , do n't show up on the jobsite without this tool in your pouch . I have tried other brands more expensive and less and this is the sidecutter that I have found to be of the highest quality . The way to determine how good a pair of sidecutters are going to be is the distance measurement from the hinge to the start of the cutting blade . Klein has managed to cut this distance down to a minimum , while still maintaining the tool 's strength . The closer that distance , the less force needed to cut thicker wire . The blade stays sharp for a long time , and once your set of Kleins are broken in , you will not be able to live without them . Consider moving up to the next level of Kleins with the fishtape pulling grip located at the top , inside of the handles . You will use it often .
5 #### Easy removal and replacement , cup forces pressure all down the drain , not up and out of the toilet as other cheaper , flimsy models do .
5 #### its TLO friendly and works very very well to make Tea concentrates.works well as a Tea additive as well or a stand alone organic fert too . I highly recommend it for any organic gardner .
5 #### I am very happy with the cutting action on this whip . It cuts through nettles like paper , dropping them straight down in the process while the nice long handle keeps you from getting nailed . Worked just as well on other assorted weeds and grass around the yard .
5 #### Purchased these to replace old soft white rope lights in my closet . Really bright and glad I got these .
5 #### This is very similar to the more expensive Pampered Chef apple peeler . You can peel and slice apples in no time with this handy device . It is simple to put together , and easy to clean . In a manner of minutes you can slice enough apples for a pie , cobbler , or your favorite fried apple dish . This is so much easier than slicing and then peeling the apples . Its great for making snacks for those who hate apple peels . This will help you make uniform cuts so everything looks nice as well as it tasting great .
5 #### Is space saving and sharp . Stands firm on counter . If there was a way to include a slicer on it , it would be nice , but would lose the two sided effect .
4 #### Make sure you have the Original Magnetic Poetry Kit if you 're buying this because this is more like an " expansion kit " . Serves it 's purpose and makes our fridge pretty obscene paired with the " Romance Novel Kit " & " Smut Words Kit " . Nice box to keep words in , arrived quickly .
5 #### Sometimes I think it 's going to break , but it 's fairly sturdy , I 'm just heavy handed . I make french fries often so his is a godsend . Easy clean and store .
4 #### A bit disappointed . This one is lighter weight than my old one . I guess maybe it was stainless steel where this one is only aluminum . Have n't used it yet - will soon . Hopefully it cooks as well as my old one .
5 #### Does the trick on fastening things together . I love mine .
4 #### I would have given this 5 stars except that it is n't made to withstand typical yard tool abuse . If you do n't abuse it , it will serve you well . It 's not junk , but it is n't made nearly as robustly as a Silky telescoping pole saw , which unfortunately does n't offer the pruning clipper . The extension length is the best part . On the other hand , I could n't find a better one , so there you are ! - )
5 #### loved it . all my clones got really nice roots with it . great product . it really does its job
5 #### It was simple to install and the materials appear to be made well . The price was a plus , too ...
5 #### Great gadget . I have one and just bought another as a gift . It fits a lot of lettuce / greens and it 's easy to use . I love the button that allows you to depress the top part so it stays flat and makes it easier to store in a cupboard . OXO makes good , long - lasting products , and we 've had ours for quite some time .
1 #### It 's a great idea , but it did n't work for me . I used as directed , but the corn tortillas kept sliding off the tray .
5 #### This hammer is fantastic ! I ve been a carpenter fir over 20 years and this is the best trim hammer I have ever owned . Its a little shorter than the 16 oz hammer I believe which makes it nice because it does nt bang on you 're legs as much when its hanging from tool bag .
5 #### I love this thing , its sturdy yet made of silicone so it wo n't scratch your pots and pans when making sauces , gravy and eggs . Love it ! ! !
3 #### HOLY MOLY this has to be the WORST smelling repellent I have ever tried . Seriously , if you do n't puke than your senses are broke . Me and my husband gagged and dry heaved when trying to use it . I had to toss it . Also , it did n't seem to deter much of anything , although with a herd of 21 deer in my suburban neighborhood , I think I am just out of luck trying to keep anything out of my yard .
4 #### I had gone through 2 " cheapie " scroll saws over the past several years . I do a fair amount of fret work and intarsia . I finally have a machine that holds the blade tightly and is easy to thread into pilot holes.the blower works great . Having the arm tilt is an invaluable feature for me . I am not crazy about the hold down ... the arms are too far apart for some of the small work I do . But other than that , a fantastic machine , and getting the stand free is a great incentive . A built in light and blade holder would nice added features . I just completed cutting and building a very intricate clock that was all fret work with this saw . It 's outstanding to operate . Changing the blade and re - tensioning from one hole to the next is fast and easy to do . I like the extra long air hose on the saw ; it does a nice job of keeping the work area clear of dust when cutting and it adjusts easily . This saw also runs very smoothly and quite . If you enjoy doing fret work or making small detail cuts this is the saw to have .
4 #### This is ok for when I do n't feel like fussing with my beloved espresso maker . This pot does n't come close to a decent home espresso machine , but it makes a good cup of caffe ! Easy to use and clean .
5 #### The item was larger than I expected but fitted my vac quite fine . In fact , because of the size it 's sure to last longer
5 #### Bought to replace small canisters and it works great and has held up very well for several years
4 #### Works well . Enjoying owning it . Makes cook time a lot faster .
5 #### makes may roses and azeleas grow disease - free , big and beautiful . Thank you Bayer ! !
1 #### This is a review for the Gilmour 20 Gallon Lawn Sprayer 390 Teal / White . It was received with 2 parts missing ( the interior tube and the black sprayer that fits on the tip ) . I also ordered the Gilmour No Pre - Mix Sprayer 486 at the same time , and it too came lacking some parts . That s 2 out of two Gilmour products that were lacking parts . Obviously , there is a lack of quality control . Unit was exchanged , but why waste my time exchanging it ? update : The replacement came with all the parts , but the on / off valve does n't work . What s wrong with this company ?
5 #### Very nice ! I have two essential gardening tools : a pickaxe and a machete . Still have n't found a really good pickaxe , but this machete does a decent job of pruning hedges and clearing brush in my fields ( especially young wild roses ) , as well as keeping trails open in the woods . It handles small saplings without difficulty and is ideal for trimming my weeping willows . I like the weight and balance ; I 'm a 55 - year old woman with arthritis and carpal tunnel issues . Nice product so far , and definitely a great price .
5 #### Sharp and easy to use . I like the catch to hold it closed
5 #### This thing is huge , it really is a Monster . But it works great . I have every confidence that I am getting clean reliable power and surge protection . As well as great cable length . It 's easy to identify products by the included color labels and logos on the device , and offers superior cable management options . All around a great product .
5 #### Brews one shot of espresso in a jiffy . High quality and durable . Easy to clean . I only regret not buying a larger version . Sometimes one coffee cup just is n't enough ...
4 #### Sometimes simple is GOOD . I have a APC battery backup that my modem , router , Ooma VIOP box & telephone base station are plugged into so that when the power goes out my internet & phone stay connection . They all have larger transformer plugs and I could n't fit one of them on the battery backup side . This simple / inexpensive device solved that .
4 #### Works great and love the bonus battery feature . Not as powerful and or light as the Dyson , but a quarter of the price .
5 #### The packaging was excellent , in a sturdy box and the tool was well - protected inside . This unit is heavy , which helps to dampen vibration often found in other units . Access to the lower blade clamp is a little difficult , causing one to bend down and use a flashlight to get the blade properly seated . This tool uses plain - end blades - no pins - which for some might be a negative . However , this allows using finer blades than you can get with pin - end ones . I have seen some scroll saws that take either . This unit is very quiet and the large table is good for stability , minimizing ' chatter ' even at the highest speed . Angle adjustment for the table is fairly easy , but I recommend using a gauge rather than relying on the scale below the table . The blower is weak , so I push the nozzle up and out of the way . I would like to have seen some sort of work light mount , but there being none , I found an inexpensive gooseneck lamp and place it on the table next to the saw . Overall , I am pleased with the tool and have used it quite a bit for marquetry and cutting parts for a wood - gear clock .
5 #### This atomic clock is the perfect size for out by our pool . It 's nice knowing that the time is always correct with the atomic technology . I looked at many clocks that had more of the nautical look since we have it outside by our pool , but I really wanted an atomic clock and this one by La Crosse won me over . It had great reviews and for good reason . It 's not the cheapest clock around , but I 'd say it 's a quality clock worth the price . It 's also a good looking clock , with a nice classical look . If you 're looking for an accurate clock , you ca n't go wrong with this one .
5 #### great for doing a prewash of vegetable before prepping them . tried it on tomatoes and does n't bruise them at all !
5 #### These are great clips . These clips hold the bag tightly shut . I will buy more in the future . The colors are great , but it would be nice if more colors were available
4 #### i got this in reasonable time , the seller was very good . it is a little difficult to work , but we will figure it out . it is a good item .
5 #### Just wanted a double boiler like I had for years and this did the trick . I like to melt chocolate and make sauces without the threat of burning .
5 #### Only use once and did the job easy clean in dishwasher ! !
5 #### I bought this as a gift for my mom , she really likes it , bread bakes nice and evenly . I 'm not sure what the lid is for yet , but it 's nice to have .
5 #### I love this rotisserie ! Ever since I added the Weber Rotisserie my grilling has been revolutionized and my chicken , beef , lamb and pig are the best tasting ever . Installation is supper easy and the rotisserie allows up to a 20 " animal to be cooked . I cooked a Suckling Pig on Thanksgiving and it was the juiciest and most tender pig I have ever done . If I had one wish , it would be a way to more firmly mount the ring to the kettle . Since the ring sits in the kettle it is possible to tip the ring if you are not careful when seating it in the kettle . This is a really minor nit .
1 #### I always bought OXO products because they were n't made in the USA . So I needed to replace some baking utensils and ordered them from OXO . Imagine my dismay to see that they are now made in China ! Gave them away !
5 #### Sharp lpeeler works great and stores with the protective coveer .
5 #### I wish I bought this sooner . I love it . It is miles better than the old , busted one I had been using .
4 #### Works great for a pry bar and nail puller but it is a little small . Works great in small suitations .
5 #### Fits perfectly . So much more economical than big box store prices , too !
5 #### Easy to store , handy and does a good job grilling .
3 #### These work well as long as you occasionally wax them . Otherwise , they bind up . Also , the set screw that is supposed to keep them in place has a knurled plastic head that is easy to strip off the set screw if you tighten them down too much ( which is not much at all ) . They do increase the safety and ease - of - use for the 4100 table saw .
5 #### This is the best measuring tool if you need a precise measurement . Much better than the glass version .
5 #### Just like I remembered it from long ago ! Pops my popcorn and gives me a show at the same time ! Easy to clean and fun to use . Pops without many unpopped kernels , as well .
5 #### Since I use our Camp Chef for canning a lot during the summer , It is often set up for several months . This cover is wonderful , as it keeps the rain out , and goes low enough to cover the joints on the legs and protect them . There are two elastic cords that strap underneath the stove , and this has kept this cover in place even during crazy wind storms . This cover is even large enough to place over the unit if you have the BBQ box on .
5 #### I 've never used a vegetable brush before , but after scrubbing potato skins until my skin started to prune , I figured I 'd try it when it was on sale . Wow ! I did n't realize how well a simple device like this could work ! Scrubs and cleans potato skins perfectly , and about 90 percent faster than scrubbing with your fingers alone . This is just a great little implement , one of those things that makes an annoying chore go so much faster . Highly recommend for " non brush " types like myself .
5 #### Everyone needs one of these if you are doing any tedious task
4 #### I use these for my Hoover U5140 - 900 Tempo Widepath Bagged Upright Vacuum . They 're pretty standard / easy to replace . I 've been told they 're a little small for vacuum cleaner bag , but I 've had no problems .
4 #### BEEN USING NOW FOR 3 YEARS . SLOWLY REPLACING ALL HOSES WITH THESE . KEEP THEM WRAPPED IN A WIND UP STORAGE CONTAINER AND IT LOOKS LIKE I SHOULD HAVE MANY YEARS OF QUALITY HOSES .
3 #### Only used once , but definitely no flavor or scent in the water . When putting away , it did not kink , it just rolled up easily . Update : I have used this hose on each camping trip in the past year . It does not leak and is holding up well . However , we notice that if any part of the hose is touched by direct sunlight , a strong plastic scent and flavor appears . I try to keep it out of sunlight now , but some camp sites just are not shaded that well .
5 #### So far so good , I think they 're nice for the price . Have to see how they hold up .
5 #### drips is slower than other hoses I have bought , but seems good quality
5 #### This is a great bread knife and matches my Henckels knife set .
5 #### These are AWESOME SHEARS , AND MADE BY A FAMOUS GARDENING CO .
4 #### My doggies are very important to me so I chose the Safe Paw ice melter to insure they do not get harmed when I 'm trying to melt all of the snow and ice we had this year . It worked well , perhaps not as quickly as some of the regular melters , but it did not cause any problems for my doggies . The only complaint would be that the tiny white granules are slow to dissolve and are easily tracked into the house . Otherwise it worked well .
5 #### Love it , love it , love it . DeWalt really thought this one through . Form the smooth belt drive to the cam lock table . I can not find fault with this saw . It has absolutely the largest capacity of any SCM saw on the market . It is the only one with such a huge fence to support your material . If you need to bevel cut , just turn the knob , and it slides out of the way . No one else gives you that option . ( If Makita did , I would be more inclined to go that direction , since their LS1211 is such a sweet saw , even more refined than the DeWalt . ) The cam lock table is a very nice improvement over a screw knob design . The whole saw is very easy to adjust if it gets knocked out of whack by careless workers . It is however pretty heavy to lug around , so I mounted mine on a Trojan Miter saw stand . Now I roll it around instead . It sets up in less than 2 minutes . If you need the capacity , you ca n't go wrong with this saw . If you do n't , consider the DW705 .
5 #### This was added to my utility box for some new wiring in home . I ca n't say just how electrified this product left me feeling after I flipped the switch and brought power to the a new area of my home !
1 #### I bought this as a temporary cover until I got a better one . What a big mistake . Not only did it leak , the dye from it stained my chair . One of my worst and most regretted purchases ever . Trying to save some money cost me multiples more in the long run . Even if not for the leak , the quality is very poor . It is an old style vinyl cover which means it does n't breath and that is not good because you get mildew and such . Yuck . I bought a duck brand cover for my sofa at the same time that I bought this one . The quality is ten times greater than this even though it cost just a bit more . No leaks , it breathes and you can see and feel the quality difference is light years apart from this one . Lesson learned , passing it along to you .
2 #### This mandoline received top ratings from Cooks Illustrated , which ranked it above the more expensive budget ones like the Borner , so I bought it in spite of my skepticism . At an old - fashioned department store , it was a bit less than the price here . The safety guard does not grip vegetables adequately --- the spikes are too short to hold the vegetable . Even if you could grip , the vegetable must be oriented perpedicular to the slicer , which limits the types of slices . When I did use it ( without the guard since it did n't work ) , the carrot slices were uneven and looked more torn apart than cut . The julienne function did not fully separate the julienne into separate pieces , so you had to intervene by hand afterwards . The gripper sometimes worked on a sweet potato since it 's softer than a carrot , and the slices of the sweet potato were more even , but I still had to push too hard to feel like it was entirely safe . The plastic also stained yellow from the carrot juice despite being washed immediately afterwards . I 'm going to return it because it 's too much of a safety hazard due to the dull blade and lack of safety guard , since I mostly wanted it for carrots . If you are looking solely to cut potatoes , it may be okay .
5 #### I bought this pull chain socket for use in my shed . It works fine ! You could also use it in any other area where you need a plugin plus a light .
3 #### The PLS3 is a great tool , but not very rugged . It shoots a bright red light in broad daylight that you can easily see from at least 50 feet away . I used it to level my 30x20 rectangular foundation and it was accurate to at least 1/4 inch at 30 feet . As long as you handle it with care , it is very accurate and self - levelling . Unfortunately , we dropped it a few times from a height of 2 feet or so to the ground . I would have expected the PLS3 to be more rugged than this since it is used at a construction site - but after it is dropped , it goes way off course by at least 2 feet per 30 feet . The self - levelling feature goes haywire too , and the color of the light wo n't change even if you tilt it 45 degrees . Then , when you shake it a little , the accuracy changes again , sometimes to 1 feet per 30 feet , sometimes more of less . I would feel more comfortable if it will at least flag an error when it is off - level , rather than making me think that it continues to work .
5 #### It 's hard to tell if the bit is cutting it 's so smooth . No tear out , very clean surface , minimal effort .
2 #### This is designed well for those with back problems , but a poor trimmer for my weeds . Probably just intended to cut grass .
5 #### Love these tongs . The 12 " model is much more practical for the kitchen , but this 16 " model is absolutely perfect for the barbeque . There are many brands of tongs , but OXO has the best springiness -- not too strong and not too wimpy . The only other tongs worth considering are the 12 " Hamilton Beach ones that lock or unlock by gravity -- one or the other as you invert them . The latter are excellent for a cook who can not use a second hand to move the locking piece at the handle end of the OXOs .
5 #### Always know that OXO products are quality . The one I had previously was not OXO and was terrible .
3 #### Best price for my small vacuum . Fits together okay , but can slip apart easily . However they are flexible . Feels weird to vacuum hardwood floor with the flex , I would prefer something rigid like the metal wands of the old days .
5 #### Fits perfectly and adjusts is nice and flat Adding this to my table saw was a simple and amazing upgrade ! As an added bonus , I have noticed that this directs much more of the sawdust to below the table while compared to the original insert .
5 #### It 's a blade , it 's expensive , do n't know why , it 's smaller than a " utility " knife blade , maybe it 's not popular enough !
4 #### Like it and it stinks , hope it stops the deer from eating my flowers , , Time will tell just got it ! ! ! !
5 #### Wonderful replacement just pop off the old one and pop this one on . If its real dirty or beat it is much easier to just replace then clean .
5 #### I needed cutting boards so bad ! These are awesome ! I love that you can fold them up and stick in the microwave for a min to become sterilized ! I love that they are different colors , so I can designate a color for different types of food ! Very impressed with these ! Would highly recommend these ! Disclosure : I received this product in exchange for my honest review and I will be telling everybody about these !
5 #### plants like this stuff now I see why my friend told me it was a must - have
5 #### This item fits great and does its job ! It does discolour in the sun though . Water will flow on top and if left in the sun , it will start to discolour . Otherwise , nice product .
5 #### As a plumber , I will vouch for these as the best pliers for plumbing . The 440s are the do - all Channellock that you will find in every plumber 's tool kit .
5 #### I have the two shorter sizes of these tongs and they 've served me well for many years . I purchased the 16 " to use outdoors on the grill . So far , so good . The longer length makes it easier to flip food without having my hand directly over the heat .
5 #### Good product for spraying insecticide on my spruce trees . The pump up sprayers required mixing and simply did n't enough liquid up into the tree branches . And the hose end sprayer that I purchased from the local box store just did n't get up high enough . The Gilmour 362 shoots a stream nearly 30 feet . Unfortunately , my trees are 35 feet tall . But I think if I stand on a ladder the nest time I spray the trees , I should be able to get clear to the top !
5 #### Not a ton of leverage like others have mentioned , but it does the job for trimming grass and plants . Heavy duty .
5 #### very useful well worth to have . Once you get past the dangers of steam .
5 #### Out with the old , and on with the new . Fits and eorks perfect . 2 day Prrime is excellent ...
5 #### I love this pressure cooker . I use my pressure cooker several times a week . I switched from an aluminum cooker to this stainless steel one and food tastes better . It cleans very easily , heats up quickly and evenly . I even put it in the dishwasher and it comes spotless . Beans cook in no time , tough meats come out extremely tender in less than 25 minutes . Great product .
2 #### Convenient yes , and I hate going to the store for these things but when I compare the price of these 3 M filters ( the same ones ) sold in 2 packs for $ 18 at the big box hardware stores which is $ 54 for 6 these seem very overpriced on amazon.com at $ 76 ( today 's price ) . Which is a shame , amazon normally has the best prices , but not in this case
4 #### The product came with two batteries . One is fine , it runs for a long time , the other only lasts about 30 seconds before it 's out of juice . We use the same recharger for both so do n't understand why one works and the other does n't . Other than the vacuum works fine . It works well on carpeting as well as tile floors .
5 #### Thank you for carrying this item . The vacuum is old , belonging to my mom . When she passed away . I had to bring it home because it works so well . Sadly , you are the only place I can get belts for it .
5 #### This is a Powerful vacuum love the accessories easy to hook up , not that expensive . Able to reach places with the long hose and attachments .
1 #### the can emptied very very quickly , and the spray did virtually nothing to the bees . i 'd bought them for carpenter bees , perhaps it is n't intended for them , but the darn things did more to each other in their territory fighting than this stuff did .
5 #### Yeah ... well damn it happened , placed the cover on and forgot one of my burners was on low and I forgot to turn the LP tank off which I always do . Well needless to say the cover did n't fair well but also never caught fire . So hence I went shopping and the replacement cover at Home Depot was over 45.00 that 's when I found this cover . This cover is lined and also heavy duty with the same velcro closures and not rope or elastic cord which just do n't work for me . Top notches for quality for the price . This by far and away is the best cover without spending 2 to 4 times the price ...... buy it you wo n't regret it ..... just remember to always turn your burners off ....... like duh !
5 #### Genuine high - efficiency Shop - Vac bags for the cost of regular disposables . The are working great .
5 #### My knife arrived right on time and in perfect shape . It has been years since I have had a Case Knife and I am very pleased with this one . This is made in USA , which is one of the main reasons I purchased this knife , and seems to be very well made . The fit and finish is fantastic . It is very smooth opening and closing and has a nice spring pressure to the blades . It came sharp but a little rough ground . However I feel this is fine for an initial factory edge . I will touch it up this week and then see how the edge holds up . This will be one of my everyday use knives so it will get a variety of use at work and home .
4 #### Have ordered these twice . Loved them . Way less expensive than buying at HD or Lowes . In last batch though I had two dud bulbs . That 's why the 4/5 stars .
5 #### The title is what my girlfriend says every time she uses this salad spinner . Easy to use , easy to clean .
5 #### Bought this for my Dad and he was very impressed with the quality of the receptacles . I bought two packages and the pricing was excellent compared to buying them in a store . I was so pleased that Dad was pleased and had no complaints only praise . He was surprised that they were made so well . There are so many different kinds to choose from and since Dad is very handy in do it yourself projects around the house I was concerned that I might have chosen a brand that was cheaply made , but I hit the jack pot . So I am as happy as Dad that I took a chance on this brand and it was more than I expected .
5 #### Works great for mosquito larvae . This is for standing water such as a bird bath , deep standing puddles , pots , etc . ) You do n't have to add this to places you have fish . The fish will eat the mosquito larvae . If the fish eat this , I can see why it may kill them because it is made from crushed corn cobs ( and the BT is within the cob pieces . ) I think the fish may eat the cobs and are unable to process the fiber . The BT , ( the bacteria that kills the larvae ) will not hurt the fish . Our dogs drink standing water with BT in it and they have not been harmed .
5 #### Sitting across the large patio from where the clock hangs , makes it so easy to see because of its size ... and , as with any Atomic Clock it works perfectly . La Cross are the masters at this Mark L.
5 #### In the summer , I grow lots of lettuce in my garden . This spinner makes it easier to clean and prepare salads everyday . Easy to use and clean .
5 #### The " hooks " that secure it to the string line are very well designed - they do n't let go when you inadvertenly trip over the line or otherwise twang it . The level is durable and corrosion resistant .
4 #### It is really a problem to use a metal whisk in a non - stick pot / pan when trying to make a sauce , since it can damage the pot 's coating . This whisk solves the problem nicely .
5 #### Ca n't wait to use this before I plant my garden . Ca n't wait for spring planting ! ! !
5 #### I have been looking for this pry bar for ages . Exactly the same as the one I had in the 80 's !
5 #### Never had thought of needing this but after seeing Julia Child use one I was convinced . It 's the idea tool for mixing difficult ingredients ( i.e. making meatballs ) .
5 #### These are great shears for careful pruning of all your delicate plants . I like how it does n't tire out your fingers like a regular scissor you have to manipulate by hand . These you just lightly squeeze with your palm . Very nice design .
5 #### Does what it says it is gon na do . Turns one outlet into three . Not much that can go wrong here .
5 #### Same quality as my other 30 year old Estwing hammers .
5 #### I like this timer , but it has a minimum time setting of 2 hours to start . Still finding a timer like this in the big box stores is next to impossible . Amazon Prime got this to me fast in two business days .
4 #### The fine side works well . The coarse side is too coarse for most uses . Handle will slip at times . Used for cutting door jambs for hardwood flooring .
5 #### Used these things for the first time today . Cuts 2 AWG like butter . Plenty of leverage , comfortable grip , good price , and made in the USA . I recommend .
5 #### I have now bought 4 of these . I started by buying one for my husband who loves checking weather reports . He now has his own weather station and I have since bought an extra sensor so he can check the temperatures in other areas . My dad saw it and became intrigued , so I bought him one and now have ordered two more for future gifts . Great gift for anyone interested in the weather , temperatures in different areas of your house , yard , RV , etc . Easy to use too !
5 #### This is a good product . I had a little trouble getting the anchors to pull in correctly , but after screwing the set screws in and out it finally grabbed on . Now it is perfect .
4 #### In reading the reviews , I must agree , this works great if you honor it 's limits . I gave it 4 stars because the funnel does go together in a flimsy and uncertain way , and when I hand tighten the shredder to the base , it tends to slip . That said , we have been using it to shred STRAW for making cob for a strawbale house , and it has been working great AS LONG AS WE DON'T OVERSTUFF IT . Give it time to shred before overloading , and it works well . Definitely need face mask and eye wear as there is a lot of straw dust flying around . Do n't know what else we would use for the job if we had n't bought this . So far , so good !
4 #### The insertion - removal tool does not quite fit so it takes a while to insert or remove . Maybe with more use the tool will ware down to fit .
5 #### My wife bought this a while back , and my first thought was that this was a gimmick designed to part a fool from his money . But after using it to make a salad and then using it to preserve lettuce in airtight jars I can definitely speak for the value of a salad spinner . This thing has saved me a lot of time in trying to dry my lettuce before preserving it or using it in my salads . Looks like I was the fool for not believing in the hype , but this is well worth the small amount of money spent .
5 #### I love it , it is really a time saver . Works beautifully .
3 #### I ordered five ..... arrived one was broken . The box was not damaged , so I wondered how a jostle could have broke it so easy ?
1 #### Although the 811 nomenclature matched my old solenoid , this one would not work . I replaced it with the Orbit 57241 Solenoid which did . I suggest you examine the tip on the screw end portion of your solenoid and confirm they are the same .
5 #### I was initially going to use an ordinary hammer for my upholstery project for tapping in Tacks but glad I purchased this as well . This small profile hammer allows for you to gently and accurately tap in the small decorative tacks .
5 #### I have used these ceramic briquettes extensively throughout the past 14 - 15 years and can not think of a better way to prevent flare - ups and turn a mediocre gas grill into a ' cooking machine ' . The composition of various brands is different but they all are seemingly good briquettes . Some brands stay together better than others after being exposed to months of propane fired heat and the gaseous vapors associated with such but I can not definitively recall which brands at the moment . When I was handling these to install in my grill , these appear and feel to be of a good composition and higher quality than some I have used in the past . I line a subsurface grate with these briquettes across the entire width and length of my grill to prevent flare - ups and to distribute heat evenly . The subsurface grate is just expanded metal cut to fit , nestled in place approximately 2 - 2.5 " below my cooking grate . I simply fastened four homemade aluminum brackets for which to lie that subsurface , expanded metal grate upon . Just one screw through the sidewall of the grill body into each bracket will suffice to hold . Cooks really well .
5 #### Cut 20 feet of very hard older stucco and some nails . Worked great with no noticeable ware .
5 #### This plunger & case does a good job of hiding the ugly plunger rubber while still sitting in plain sight in case it 's needed . It was reasonably priced and a decent quality . I recommend .
5 #### I will be purchasing the big bottle of this product ! ! I Love it but I really like Dermologica
5 #### This product worked great for removing a carpet tack strip . It is heavy duty and is a great addition to my toolbox .
3 #### Not bad for a flexible adapter . Just found out that this is cheaper from big box improvement stores .
5 #### Good for when I just need an extra foot or so in height . I had a wooden one , but it 's rickety . This one is solid . It does n't shake when I stand on it .
5 #### works great weather off but that is n't why I bought it . Looks great
5 #### The pads are well constructed & durable I 've had them for 8+(purchased my first set June 29 , 2006 ) years now Review is based on experience using the pads with I - Bar Clamp . http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000224CI/ref=oh_details_o02_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
5 #### Works well got the job done that I needed it for , paint removal on cynder block wall . Must add more words .. Say more speak spot speak boy !
5 #### I got this for my boyfriend who works as a cook in a nice restaurant . It was meant to be for him to use at home , but it just happens that just before I gave it to him , he got a new , better job where he was required to have his own knives . He bought an 18 - piece set that retails for $ 800 , and said that this knife is better than the chef 's knife in his set . AND all of the guys in the kitchen - including the head chef - want one !
5 #### This thing is fantastic ! ! Together with the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Wooster - Brush - BR036 - 18 - Sherlock - Wideboy - Adjustable - Frame-18 - Inch / dp / B003E478KY / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Wooster Brush BR036 - 18 Sherlock Wideboy Adjustable Frame , 18 - Inch</a>&nbsp;Wooster Wide Boy roller painting suddenly becomes so much faster . This is a must if you are painting large areas , or paint frequently . Following another reviewers suggestion we lined this bucket with a heavy duty contractor trash bag before pouring in our paint . We cut the bag so they were not too long . It was perfect and made for easy clean up afterward .
5 #### I love these trimmers . They are sharp and really do the job .
5 #### I needed a replacement for the pan that fits in the toaster oven . We purchased our toaster oven a few years agon , and the pan that came with it had worn out . I saw this set and found it to be well priced and just what I needed . The pans fit perfectly in our standard sized toaster oven . The non stick finish works well , and we have had no problems with cleaning the set .
5 #### A very good seeder . It is best to have the soil well rototilled , dry and free of clumps . If the dirt sticks to the ground opener , it 's too wet .
4 #### Worked great on my clones w rapid rooters I had roots in 8 days
5 #### This is a well constructed cable bag . It has enough room for jumper cables - plus . I would recommend it for anyone wanting to buy a jumper cable bag .
5 #### Quality gloves . Perfect fit for my husband . Prompt shipping ! He has a pair that have lasted years . Highly recommend .
5 #### Another good product for my wife that loves to play in the dirt . Quality product .
4 #### I already owned a popper like this one but it did n't last as long as I had hoped for . I tried a different kind but it wan't as easy to use & clean as this one . So I ordered it again . The popcorn tastes great , the clean up is quick & maybe I 'll be lucky , and it will last !
4 #### Quite a different way of growing tomatoes but works------also good for trailing flowers
5 #### Great saw ! It has all the features needed for every type of construction , demolition and home use . I have used most of the major competitive brands and I have to say that this saw out performs all of the others . If you are buying a replacement or if you are a first time buyer you will be very satisfied choosing this model Milwaukee .
4 #### I 'm not writing a review on the use of the base as I have yet to work with it enough to give it a fair review . My review has to do with the assembly . I , like many others , had an issue with the bolt length . No matter how hard I tried to get the nut to thread on the two - inch bolt it seemed like I just could n't get enough thread to get it started . So , here 's a solution that will cost you about fifty cents : Go to the hardware store and buy two 2.5 " bolts ( 5/16 # 8 , if my memory serves me ) . Use those two bolts with a pair of nuts that came with the kit and tighten the bracket on the wood . Once tightened , remove the nuts / bolts and now use the Delta 2 " nut that came with the kit . You 'll see that since the bracket got clamped down on the wood , the width of the bracket has been reduced and there 's now plenty of thread .
5 #### Did a nice job , put a stop to string algae . Will get more .
5 #### What can I say . It is original equipment for my Shop Vac and works as it should . I like that I can get this type of part from Amazon with my Prime account access and get 2 day service with no freight cost .
5 #### Perfect size for our toster oven . Holds just enough when cooking for one .
5 #### I 've had a garden claw since they were first introduced . It 's been so great in our clay , hardpan , and rocks . I 've used it to work up so many flower beds that I was afraid it would eventually break . I bought the second one just in case . It would be a disaster if they were ever discontinued .
5 #### Believe it or not it is impossible for me to find this product locally so again I turn to amazon and found exactly what I was looking for . It does the job ! I do n't want to use dental floss or the like as was suggested so I am very glad to have been able to locate this . Thank you again AMAZON !
5 #### These are handy in the garden . I just wish it came with a little carrier to clip on , for when I do n't have back pockets !
5 #### Edit 12/21/14 : The Amazon pictures for this unit are not all correct . The differences in the Klein 601 - x is the length . The -8 ( inch ) Amazon photo on this page is the correct image for all three lengths . The other photos show conventional tip screwdrivers but all of the 601 's are cabinet tip ( I own all length 's ) . Fit and finish are excellent . The 601 ( 3/16 " ) size is the perfect fit for electrical outlet / switch cover plate screws . I have a large Wiha soft - finish handle collection ; but find the equivalent width blades of the Wiha are too thick for that same application .
5 #### Really happy with the Fly Web . Have to get replacement glue boards since I change them out once a week in the Summer
4 #### This is one of the BEST timers I have purchased so far and believe me I have gone through several timers for my pool pump . Very easy to program and use . Built strong and reliable
5 #### This is sooooo much better than having to lug a sprayer around on my back or drag one around with me . Works well so far , no clogs , even spray so I am very happy so far
5 #### I do n't know how some reviewers can right an essay on items .. But a simple review would say this is a great tool to have . I used this on my 1/2 backyard away from the city . I LOVE IT ! I used a garden pole from home depot to put this at the back of my property and ran an extension cord along the fence .. Hundreds of bugs meet their demise every night .. If you refill the mosquito packs once a week or so you get great results . Otherwise you mainly catch the larger bugs . Very powerful , I ve watched bugs catch on fire !
5 #### I like this set , it is exactly what I was looking for . I have n't used the broiler / rack yet , so I can not comment on that piece , but the muffin tin and baking pan are great . A previous reviewer mentioned that the plastic lid did n't fit on the muffin tin , but mine does fit ( perhaps they changed the design since then ? ) . You definitely need to measure your oven and verify the dimensions of these pans . ( To the reviewer who said it did n't fit your oven , obviously it 's not fair to give a bad review for the product 's size if you did n't measure your oven , now is it ? )
5 #### Really ripped through the steel - better than my previous blades . I would recommend these blades . They stayed sharp , while still cutting true like the original blades for the Bosch sabre saw .
5 #### Better safe than sorry . A fire extinguisher , carbon monoxide and smoke detectors are a must in every household . I 've used these a few times , from a VW engine fire , to burning curtainry to the next door neighbor who had a grease fire . All three three times it was the same Kidde as the one I have purchased today . Always stnd back and aim for the base of the flames . Sweep back and forth . That 's the first thing you 're taught in basic marine firefighting ( thanks India Tango Ballard ) . Make sure after a few months you invert the unit and tap on the base to keep the chemicals mixed . Be safe everyone .
1 #### I generally am pleased with Fiskars products , but this one I do n't like at all . Before ordering this , I read most of the 1 - star reviews . I ignored them , because I believe the majority of the concerns were the result of using this splitter for the wrong job -- concerns about breakage and safety , but they were using this for a job that requires a splitting maul , not a small splitting axe -- i.e. , serious chunks of wood , or even cants . An axe this size is designed for small stuff and kindling . Okay , so here 's what bothers me . One , the handle is too long . It just is n't right for , say , holding a board and splitting it for kindling . Two , and much more important , the plastic handle is dangerously slippery . It 's prone to flying out of your hand unless you 're wearing some serious gripper gloves . This is simply unacceptable . So , I 'm going back to one of the Estwing splitters . We gave a friend ( a logger ) the Estwing E3 - FF4 blue one - piece as a gift and she loves it . I had their EFF4SE splitter for years ( the one with the leather ring handle ) , and loved it , but it has gone missing . Sorry , Fiskars .
1 #### If I could leave 0 stars I would ! Never close to the right temperature ! It is made by Taylor Precision Products in guess where ? China ! It can not be mounted without disturbing the mechanism because the screw mounts are in line with the coil . If one installs it , and follows the instructions , the wind blows it right off the screws . If one tightens the screws , the coil sticks , and whatever temperature you installed it at , stays the same no matter what the current temperature is ! I would return it , but , it has blown hundreds of feet across the field several times ! Wind catches it , it becomes a " frisbee " !
5 #### I really prefer the rubber hoses compared to the plastic ones . The plastic ones are hard to roll up when it 's cold or even cool . The rubber ones get dirty easily but if you take care of them and wipe them off when they get grease or dirt they will last forever and stay in good shape .
5 #### Henckel 's knifes are the best and this beauty is no exception . German quality and craftsmanship are second to none . I highly recommend Henckel knifes . This one came used , but in excellent condition . For the low price , it is just what I need .
5 #### The difference between this veggie brush and a cheap dollar store one is like doing a 180 . The bristles are much sturdier , and it fits comfortably in both my husband 's and my hands . We can tell a difference -- for the better -- cleaning with this brush versus a softer one .
5 #### Love this weird little rubber tube . It 's the best way to peel garlic !
5 #### So far we have been using this filter for about a month , and it seems to work as expected . As far as I can tell , the A / C system does not strain to pull the air through it . We do not do air quality check at a lab , so I can not speak about the effectiveness of this filter , but by looking at it , it becomes apparent that it does catch a fair amount of pollutants . Based on the experience so far I would definitely buy it again .
5 #### After I had a Licensed Electrician install it now works like a charm . I really like the battery backup and would do it again .
5 #### We researched hammocks and landed on this one and we 're glad we did . Comfy , large and a beautiful hammock . Installed easily .
5 #### Good trap and well constructed and rust resistant . Ready to use when you unpack it from the shipping container , just add bait .
4 #### These work incredibly well . The smell is nauseating , though . Do not get if you plan to keep it near a seating area
5 #### These little bags will catch more flies than you can count . Have to change them every other day as they are full . By at least 12 because if placed correctly they fill up fast here in Florida
5 #### Really very handy ! I always need a tape measure for small stuff , works like a charm !
5 #### I have n't had a chance to use it yet , but freud has always made the best router bits in the industry .
5 #### ANother great pot that has a great weight and does not burn on the bottom .
5 #### I live in a townhouse and have limited space in my front yard . I did n't want to get one of those big bulky hose reels to have on display on my front patio so I found this ames one and figured I would give it a try . Pros : Very VERY lightweight , comes with quick connect attachments which makes moving it from front to back yard a breeze . Very small depth so it can hide behind bushes easily . We have an azalea bush and bought a 12x12 cement stone from lowes to put behind it and the hose reel sits on that stone out of sight . Easy to unwind and wind back up . Cons : The only con is the inner diameter of the hose is on the smaller side so I do n't get as much flow out of it as I do with the big hose I have in the backyard . I mainly use this for watering the grass , landscaping , and washing my car so the reduced water flow really is n't a big deal because its not needed ...... actually , I think because of it I actually SAVE money on washing my car because I use less water with this reel . I would buy this again in a heartbeat . There is n't a single other small reel on the market to compete with this .
1 #### I ordered this for a Remington because Remington was listed as one it would work for . It does n't work for a Remington .
5 #### This item was purchased as a gift for my dad . He loved how sturdy it was , and was amazed at how it folded up compact . He enjoys doing wood work , so it was the perfect gift . It was a great deal on Amazon and arrived on time , as I have the prime membership .
1 #### Macy had these for $ 39.99 so I bought three . All three failed within a very short period of time . Cuisinart charges $ 10 for warranty repair and you have to pay shipping to return them to Cuisinart , plus all the time required to copy your sales invoice , repackage the unit , deliver it to the post office and wait in that line all for the $ 17 difference in simply buying another unit . Then again , why bother buying another or even getting a warranty replacement since you 'll be going through the same process a few months later .
2 #### if you put it in the oven , it warps . Go figure . But the nonstick part works
5 #### This is a very well made machine . Like others I was dismayed at the very poor and out of date instruction book and video . Basically I had to call Vega for help and leave a message for a call back . The video ( which is too fast and vague ) for set up is out of date and shows out of date mounts installed on this tool which are different than the ones you receive . The video is soon to be replaced with a professional one the Vega person assured me . Plan on calling Vega to get help ( 1 - 800 - 222 - 8342 ) until you can get the right video / instruction book . Other than that , it is a pleasure to use and looks like it would provide many years of service . It is worth a little frustration to get it setup and adjusted .
4 #### I have purchased 6 of these Orbit valves . Not too much will go wrong if you install them properly . Properly means , among other things , the valve is above the highest sprinkler by the amount indicated in the instruction sheet . They can be a little leaky during operation so you should pay attention during initial startup to determine if there are any problems . I have had none in the 6 months of having an automatic system . There are other choices but not much different in construction if plastic . I replaced a brass valve system with this one and the brass valves leaked .
5 #### I love this small vac for my bare floors . It is a bit loud but most vacuums are so that 's not an issue for me . It does a great job and is light weight , easy to carry up and downstairs . All in all , a great little vacuum cleaner for the money . Time will tell about durability .
5 #### Usual excellent OXO quality . Seems very durable and works very well . Looks like it will last a long time .
5 #### Sharpens well . I mostly use this for my Santoku knife , and the blade is certainly straight as a die after sharpening . Please keep in mind that , though titled a " sharpening steel , " sharpening steels are not used for sharpening , per se . They are used for straightening the blade . It 's always helpful to check some videos online for sharpening techniques ( though it 's not overly complicated ) .
3 #### My family had one of these many years ago and it worked very well . However , our water pressure at our current home is not great so this product does not work optimally . Also , it has trouble keeping upright on uneven or sloped terrain . I know this product can be effective once I level our yard with additional dirt and see about beefing up our water pressure .
5 #### This replaces a 30 year older model and we are happy with it .
5 #### I always wanted one of these so I bought it , found some loose tea leaves online to buy and tried it out . I like it . It 's a great way to control how much tea you want and I also found some stevia online in a dried leaf state and added that in with the loose tea as a sweetener . Works great !
1 #### No directions ; unable to get product to work . Huge disappointment .
4 #### Use it for above the kitchen sink so I have light to do dishes . It 's alright , nervous about the switch feeling a bit loose , but otherwise good c : when it arrives the cord is inside it , for anyone starring at it wondering what to do haha .
5 #### If you are going to plough a dado with this make sure you have a powerful router . Use a router table and fence if possible . I have a 3 Hp Bosch and it takes all of that to rout a 1/2 dado in another piece of plywood ro poplar . Making two passes makes for a sloppy fit . Best to do it in one pass .
5 #### What can i say it 's a tool , use it every day
5 #### Spent $ 400.00 on propane grill it was nice but heavy and the burners rusted out in 1year . I spent $ 30.00 on this little Weber and use charcoal the food tastes ten times better I do n't have to buy expensive propane and can take it any where I want . Extremely happy with this item and would recommend this product .
5 #### Great Price . Tool is heavy and just as nice as others I have that cost twice as much .
5 #### Finally a whisk that i can hold any way i want ... Comfortably !
5 #### really do like this little vacuum cleaner -- it is lightweight , very handy to use and it has a lot of power -- good suction when vacuuming -- would definitely recommend it to others
5 #### This works surprisingly well for my small and retangular backyard which i have my patch of grasses newly installed . Compare to others , this suits me so i may be getting one more after i monitor it for some times . Thumbs up .
5 #### I recently used the flapwheel sander to sand stain off of some thin edges on a wooden dresser , and I was very happy with the result . The flapwheel is tough enough to sand through stain , but delicate enough not to dig into the wood ( although it can dig in a bit if you slip of us it on an edge ) . The sanding surface is surprisingly durable . One flapwheel goes a long way before needing to be replaced . I think this is a great addition to any sanding arsenal .
5 #### Ca n't imagine why you would buy anything else . Forget the plastic things and go with this one .
5 #### This is sharp so does n't require much effort in peeling potatoes or carrots . It 's also larger than my old peeler ( which was lost in a move ) .
5 #### This stapler has functioned exceptionally well . I have had no problems with this stapler . It is easy to load , clear and/or use . The long nose helps to get into tight or small places where an ordinary stapler could n't reach . I would highly recommend this item to anyone .
3 #### Designed for the Intex Ultra Frame pools . It works however it does n't take much to work it out of the clamp that keeps it attached to the frame . I had the same problem with the blow up easy set pool , that being a big clamp that wrapped around the blue tube . Intex needs to come up with a better clamping mechanism .
5 #### Works just like I expected . Very useful for detailing and carving
1 #### flimsy metal seperated after a couple of uses , not happy
3 #### I thought this would kill flies , but it did not . Good for mosquitos and moths , though .
4 #### Excellent product . For it 's size , this sweeper does a great job . The only draw back I found so far is the the hose is a bit flimsy , otherwise I would have given it 5 stars ..
5 #### I perform meat smoking nearly every weekend in our home and use a variety of wood chips , depending on the type of meat being smoked . My personal preference has always been Mesquite and I found these chips perform well . The size of the bag is comparable to that which you would find in a local box store , but there are two important difference in this particular brand . 1 . The ratio of heart wood to bark is approximately 80/20 which is very important to red meat smoking . 2 . The physical size of the chip is smaller than box store brands allowing it to be feed into the Masterbuilt Electric Smokers without difficulty . There is one thing I would change about this product , and that would be to put a ziplock top on the bag as a typical 4 - 5 hour smoke would use less than half the bag . The ziplock is rarely found on any brand so it does n't force me to take away a star . I have solved this problem by purchasing a couple small pet food bins and put the wood types in those .
5 #### Unbelievably pleasantly surprised . Did not want to use stainless whisk in new All Clad double boiler , this was a champ , twice as fast at lump busting in the Bchamel sauce and the handle really had the right ergonomics Mojo working . Count me a convert ...
4 #### Way smaller than you think , but still the same great Oxo quality .
5 #### tongs are tongs , but these are very good quality . Like the locking feature a lot .
5 #### So happy to have this extinguisher in my home . I definitely feel more secure !
5 #### For us guys that want that old familiar feeling of an old wood handled saw , this is the one you want . Compact , fits in a 24 " toolbox , flatter than a Fat Max , fits against the back wall of my pack - it - to - the - job 26 " box . I barely notice it 's there . the handle only measures 3/4 " more or less across . I 've cut plastic pipe , drywall , foamboard , fiberglass and all sorts of wood with it and it just keeps going . Cuts on the push and the pull , so do n't put anymore pressure against it than you have to . Let the saw do the work . My only gripe with this saw is the same with all wood handle saws , check the screws often , they will eventually loosen up . The PERFECT saw to finish a notch cut , like a crows foot on the bottom end of a rafter .
5 #### Works great as charcoal box replacement . Fits right into the grooves . The smoker itself sucks though . Save yourself the $ 70 and buy something else
2 #### I may have given this one star , but when you use the star rating system , one star is for " I hate it " . And the fact is that I did n't hate it . It is a good size with clear numbers . The temperature and humidity seemed to work perfectly . But this is an atomic clock , and it never set itself . I ended up sending it back for a very similar clock with a different name - but the new one is accurate to the minute and reset itself even though it is hanging in the exact same spot as this clock . I would also state that any time I have ever had to return a product , Amazon is the king of returns . You go back to the original purchase , ask to return it and you either print a label or they will send it to you . No hassle . No real questions . Always an apology that it did not work the way you would expect . Sorry this did n't work - but glad I purchased it on Amazon .
5 #### Good size and great quality , I recommend this product
5 #### We 've been using this fan every night for months . While it was still hot out , with was on nearly 24 hours a day . It 's still working like day 1 and does an awesome job at bringing fresh air into our apartment .
5 #### Bought this as a gift for my daughter in law . She has used it a few times and loves it .
5 #### This is an excellent bird feeder . Not only is it squirrel proof , but it holds enough seed for about 2 weeks . I have two of these , one for sunflower seeds and the other for songbird seed . It is also easy to fill and can either be hung or pole mounted .
5 #### This is the third year that I am using Mosquito Bits . I sprinkle it all over the garden (= all the backyard ) during the first hot days ( this year it was in April -- in Michigan ) and preferably before it rains , or just after . I heard a couple of mosquitoes today ( perhaps it was the same one following me ) so I made a second application . I may need a third one in August . The label tells you to reapply it every 7 to 14 days but , applied at a more generous rate , I find that six weeks is enough . I use about 1 - 1/2 to 2 containers every summer . It works for me : my neighbor has several huge pine trees in her backyard , and mosquitoes like to breed in pine needles . In addition , our backyards are on a slight slope , so that water tends to accumulate and puddle at the bottom of the slope . Mosquito bits have solved the problem for me .
5 #### One of the most legendarily durable tape measures out there for the price . Can easily extend long distances without folding up .
3 #### It seems to chip tiles . I would bet this is better on concrete of brick . Not so sure I can recommend this for tile or marble .
4 #### Quality of blade set is very good but Freud packs them in a plastic inner support and a nicer plastic outer case . The first one I rec'd had a broken inner plastic support due to weight of blade set and improper packing . I sent back and advised that these blades require better outer packing . The second one also had a broken inner plastic support due to improper packing . I thought about contacting Freud directly to get an unbroken inner support for storing blades , but gave up .
3 #### I really liked the look of this knife roll and the size was just what I needed . But a few days after taking back and forth to work , my chefs knife just randomly fell out right between my legs . I truly could n't believe when I turned around and said " what was that ? " and a coworker said it was my chefs knife hitting the floor . I 'll be honest , I may not be the sharpest knife in the box , but there is only one way to put a knife in that roll and after I got home I tested and it fell out again along with my paring knife . So , it 's pretty , but I had to return this bag because I just ca nt take that chance again .
4 #### The unit fits the B&D RTX like a glove . This unit is well made and comes with all the bits as advertised .
5 #### Everyone needs one of these . Comes with a wall mount which is easy to install .
5 #### This is my favorite nozzle . I 've purchased many more expensive ones , thinking the higher price means a higher quality .... wrong ! This one works great !
4 #### love it so far . kills bugs all night . our backyard is now comfortable to use without being attacked by mosquitos or gnats . highly recommended . but you must use the octenol . do n't skimp on the chemical attractant . increases the effectiveness of this by 10x
4 #### Works fine on my 2 gal Gilmour Professional sprayer . I have difficulty in getting it to spray a fine mist .
5 #### Super useful for many things around the house and quick / easy to use
5 #### I love this zapper . My brother bought a different brand with protective strands across the zapper strings because he has a grandson who chases the cat and dog with it . Mine is off limits to everybody except me , so I do n't need the protective layer and it works beautifully . There was a 2 " black spider in my 3 season room hanging on the screen . I touched it with my zapper and it fell down dead , curled up , like immediately . Some critters snap , others just light up and fry . Lightweight , reasonably priced , best thing I bought this summer . Plus , it 's fun !
5 #### Does a good job and is very natural to hold - rubber keeps it from slipping in your wet hand - just what I wanted !
4 #### The official DeWalt sealed packaging says that the bulbs are made in Japan . Amazon 's packaging was sturdy . I included a couple of pictures . The filaments look nearly perfect as you can see . I do some serious soldering . The filament connection looks strange to me , but others can judge for themselves . Overall , the bulbs / packaging looks fine , buying this product is a bright idea . Plan to use it in my Bosch 10.8/12 volt flashlight . Good luck and have fun .
1 #### Unsure how the detector works . I ordered from Amazon WH and saved a few bucks for a repackage item , box was damage . I 've bought other things off here the same way and all was good . I pulled the detector out and could see that it had been together before , paint worn off the adjustable part that goes to the ground piece . Also looked dirty and took a look a little harder and the small overhang on top of the screen was spotted up from being wet . The plug in for the headphones had copper corrosion growing out of it . I slid it back into the box and shipped it back . Knobs were crusty / dirty . I will order again when I have other things to buy and will update the review .
5 #### this is a awesome cd it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this cd are Tracks 2 . White America 3 . Business 4 . Cleanin out My Closet 5 . Square Dance 8 . Say Goodbye Hollywood 9 . Drips 10 . Without Me 13 . Superman 14 . Hailie 's Song 17 . Say What You Say 19 . My Dad 's Gone Crazy if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
5 #### Perfect fit for my DW705 . One little snag on side of bag , but functions , fits and looks correct .
5 #### good wood chips . bought these for smoking ribs . so far so good on the flavoring these give the ribs . no complaints
3 #### I really had high hopes for this as my dad has a similar one and it has worked well . This one gets the job done but I feel like I am having to empty it constantly . Other than that it has worked well and was very easy to put together .
4 #### They are joining biscuits . Not too brittle or dry , absorb lots of glue , hold tight . They do everything i ask of them and the price seems good to me .
4 #### The Freud shim set is precise , and is anodized with a dark material to prevent corrosion . There are four .004 , two .008 two .012 and two .020 shims in the package . They seem flat and true . The only problem I have with this set is that they all look the same . Can you tell the difference between .008 and .012 ? I can .... with a micrometer . If you do n't have one , you will have trouble telling the shims apart . There are some other sets that use color coding . These might be easier for some people to use . I like the fact that there are extra shims of each thickness ( particularly the .004 ) , since they could be damaged easily .
4 #### While I do n't typically cut large sheet stock on my table saw , when I 've needed to or had longer items than normal , this support extension has been a life saver and has most likely prevented injury when I think of the jerry - rigged set ups I used to make to support larger workpieces . It conveniently slides back into the body and the mitre slide gaps in it 's face ensure it does n't interfere with my larger table saw sleds . I have n't had any issues with plywood ' flexing ' or getting hung up on the extension even when fully extended .
5 #### I think this is our third Stir Crazy . Not because it does n't last , because we wear them out . Would hate not to have one .
5 #### + Very lightweight , making it easy to use + Dishwasher safe is a necessity in our house , so that 's definitely a plus + Durable + Glad to have the hole in the handle so that we can hang it + Love the Good Grips handle
3 #### This is my second order due to losing the first one , which was a wonderful tool . I was so disappointed at losing and missed it terribly . I ordered a replacement which was terrible and nothing at all like my first . It felt light and did n't cut well . The button was also loose and made it difficult to keep closed . I returned it and bought another one that arrived with a chip in the blade . What ? ! I requested one last replacement and it is perfect . It is identical in quality and heft to my original purchase - the one I lost . I am so happy to have one again , and one that works . Should n't have taken three tries to get a good one , but at least I have it now . Love these shears and use them every day , along with when I mow . There 's no other similar tool that I 've found and do n't want to lose this one , ever , ever , ever .
3 #### It 's fine and I use the toast one all the time but , it is very small and I could have used a little larger one . I have n't used the cake pan yet but , it 's plenty sturdy and looks like it would last .
5 #### This is the most disgusting thing ever . Mine did n't come with the string so I fixed it up my own way . In less than 12 hours it was filled black , annoying and disgusting flies . I will be buying more .
5 #### I set this baby up , then me go grab a beer and watch me neighbors struggle in the Texas heat with a water hose and an inferior sprinkler . By the time they are done I am on me second beer and they look like they pissed themselves . Meanwhile me grass is perfectly being watered , along with me flowerbeds . By the time me gets my 8th beer this baby shuts itself off automatically , because me never remember .
5 #### I 've had one for about 12 years and I 'm looking to order a new one now . Very good for hardwood floors and low profil for under sofa and beds . My home is 100 years old and has plank flooring that is one big scratch already , but I have never noticed any damage from the vacuum . Very strong suction .
5 #### Always purchased a wooden step stool . The last one only lasted 6 months . So I purchased this one and will probably use it for life . well built and light weight .
2 #### These are not the allergen bags I thought I was going to receive ... type A , yes , but not allergen and that is my fault for becoming impatient with ordering on my phone . Just be sure they say ALLERGEN if you need that . Too much hassle to return so just going to blow through them .
5 #### This is to be used as an early detourant to pests . It 's not going to resolve a full scale infestation but it helps keep them away and at bay . It 's great for hot spots that pop up . My girls do n't seem to mind it , no foliage burning . Use it at night indirectly . Hot spots , directly , out of light .
4 #### This is a great tool . I 'll never have to slice an apple with my trusty knife again . I ca n't just bite into an apple ( fragile teeth ) so this does the trick for me . ThanX.
5 #### I was alittle hesitant to order this bench as I had owned one 25 years ago and while happy then I thought maybe the quality would not be the same in this current bench . I am pleased to so far Iam no longer hesitant about my decision and would recommend to anyone to order it .
3 #### Too small for me . It is a single shot but other than that no problem .
5 #### Plenty of power for jobs around the house and holds a charge well . 12 volt batteries / drills are great for the casual cordless drill user . This style battery is getting harder to find and the price was reasonable .
4 #### Its a bulb , it worked fine in my dewalt flashlight . Not sure what more can be said about it other then it fit and works fine .
4 #### The size is perfect for small items and I have been using it successfully throughout this year . I am disappointed , however , that the small orange - colored tab is no longer dependable , with the result of opened blades .
5 #### I need some more of these ... I am a plant freak .. Love it .
3 #### They keep finding ways of making these filters seem less and less quality . Saves them money , but the price does n't come down for us . Thank heaven I find I can clean the filters if not wetted and make them last for years .
5 #### It did n't take too long to assemble , very strong , makes moving the saw easy . I 'm very satisfied .
2 #### I have a yearly problem with Canada geese covering my yard with stinking poop as they eat my grass . I bought this device even after the poor reviews and noted issues . First , I had no water leaks at all after a firm twist to connect parts . The 9 volt battery worked for more than a month . Now the bad news . The presence of the geese in the field of coverage by the device was insufficient to trigger the sprayer . It is possible that the geese do not have a strong enough heat signature to trigger it . A passing car would set it off when on the highest sensitivity , but no setting or re - aiming or repositioning would cause it to spray the geese when present . So all in all , it was a failure for my intended purpose of geese abatement .
5 #### Oh my gosh , i have made popovers in muffin tins for YEARS , because i do n't like buying one -use items . The popovers are absolutelly gorgeous ! ! ! And thinner and crunchier because they rise higher than in muffin tins . I just love this pan .
5 #### Clover had slowly taken over a third of my lawn ; after one use of Step 2 Fertilizer , clover was all gone in about 7 days . The lawn is gorgeous ; Scotts never let 's me down !
5 #### These are great chips and smother without burning especially when soaked for an hour or two in warm water . These are much better quality and larger chunks than those cheap chips you get at Home De ... or Walm ....
5 #### I have been using these for longer than there has been an Amazon website . I have numerous and various pliers , these are my " go - to " pliers . Absolutely no regrets . The new ones are still made in USA . Like any good tool steel , they do need a bit of oil to keep them from surface rusting especially after they get wet . I gave a set to a good friend and now he relies on them . I expect them to last the rest of my life without problem . Jay
5 #### Although you need some room to spread the handles , the gearing really helps to cut through thick branches cleanly . Great for yard - cleanups of fallen branches and trimming .
5 #### This is a popular choice for use in router tables . My Kreg lift accepts it without the need for adapters . I work with hard woods ( oak , cherry , & walnut ) . This router handles these hardwoods with ease . Combine the horsepower with a soft start and variable speeds , this is a great router .
5 #### Quality product by a quality maker . Item was exactly what we wanted .
5 #### I have 8 ladders and step stools , and this one is my favorite . It is lightweight so it 's very easy to flip around with one hand , and just high enough to reach tall cabinets , paint upper parts of the wall / ceiling , and trim taller bushes . It folds up quickly so it 's not in the way . I ended up throwing away my other step stool which was more bulky and use this one everywhere .
5 #### Getting ready to plant in bare spots it grows nicely when feed properly with lawn food needs to be watered constantly to avoid dying out is the only flaw that it has .
3 #### The hose is sturdy , and with a simple washer added to the wall fitting , there are no leaks . As for the coiling feature , suffice it to say that you best have a strong heart if you 're going to extend this hose more than three or four feet . I insist on helping my wife water our garden and back yard because getting this hose to extend the " supposed " 50 ft , takes a Herculean effort . Thus , I stretch the hose out and hold it for her , and she works the nozzle . Hence , if you enjoy ' togetherness ' projects with your significant other , and you get a smile out of the two of you appearing like two firefighters from a hook and ladder team , this hose works just fine ..
5 #### I ended up returning it because my wife and I accidentally bought 2 of them . But we kept one of them , and we love it . It is an excellent grater , handling cabbage for slaw ( the original reason we bought it ) with no problems at all , and creating mountains of shredded cheese with unbelievably little effort . Definitely recommended
5 #### I have purchased a number of the OXO steel products , and like the others , I am very pleased with the quality and construction of this one .
3 #### This is really big . I was really surprised . I had a similar one prior to this one and it was the right size . This one is just too long and thick .
5 #### awesome love the big size will be ordering another one
5 #### Very good quality wood chips we soak then about 30.min . or so in cool water we think this helps to release the most flavor . Remember a little goes a long way . Super great smoke flavor to the food your smoking . No bitter taste . These wood chips are a great value .
1 #### Have several of these . One just failed . Gets stuck at the 20 minutes mark and stays there , keeping the fan on indefinitely . It 's a couple of years old . I expect better quality / reliability . It 's not rocket science .
4 #### Needed a replacement blade to get my other one professional sharpened . Always good to have a backup blade just incase , something uninspected cmes your way .
1 #### I thought it was pretty basic and would last but I was wrong . After 3 months of use the dial now spins freely and nothing can be set . Also when it was operable it shuts the water off in a very abrupt way causing a quick bang through my water pipes . Other timers should last longer although this one was not expensive .
5 #### The hummingbirds seem to like this feeder . A friend had one in CA and she had plenty of hummingbirds so I purchased one because they did n't seem to like the feeder I had . Would come and look at it and then fly off . While we do n't have a lot of humming birds at our elevation , we did have hummers visit the Perky - Pet feeder each day and even sit on the perches and stay longer . This feeder is easy to clean and completely comes apart to make it very easy to keep clean which is so important for the health of the hummers .
2 #### Sequence of events that led to this review : 1 . I exchanged the first Oxo kettle I bought because the lid ( not the spout ) did not fit right , and the steam escaping from the top burned my hand . 2 . I returned the 2nd kettle because the lid was so tight I had to have my husband open it or fill it through the spout . ( This made cleaning it impossible . ) 3 . The 3rd kettle was returned beacuse it had flaws in the finish and would eventually turn into rust spots . I gave up and expressed my disappointment to Oxo about this kettle , They were kind enough to send one to me . This kettle was great -- at first ; but , after awhile , the handle loosened up and , yes , steam began to escape . It now sits atop my refrigerator looking down on my ten - dollar kettle that has lasted me for years . Save your money . It 's a great concept but short - lived .
4 #### Nice basket - easily adjustable for chow thickness . It did a great job on a 1/4 " spit with 4x chix thighs & 4x legs yesterday . I used tongs to remove the bird pieces without any sticking at all . Cleanup was simple even though I let it sit with cooked BBQ sauce on it overnight ( I was just too stuffed to attack the kitchen after supper ; p ) ; soaked in a soapy sink for ~10 minutes and it all brushed off easily . Only ' druther ' I have : I'druther the sheet metal at the spit - thumbscrews be thicker so it does n't bend when I tighten the screws on the spit . Since this basket will accomodate a thicker spit , that flex resulted in the basket shifting that 1/8 " from side - to - side as it turned . No worries for something like yardbird , but more delicate pieces like fish fillets or some such could be damaged . Pork chops are next !
5 #### By far the best veggie brush ever . The bristles are just the right length and unlike other brushes I 've used before , they do n't flatten out . The shape is ergonomically perfect , at least for me and much easier to use than those with handles . Morever , whether it 's because of the bristles or that I 'm able to grip it really well , potatoes get REALLY clean . I 've even used it on tomatoes ( do n't exert a lot of pressure ) , celery , grapefruit , oranges , turnips , parsnips , and carrots . I 'm even thinking of getting another one to use for pots and pans - to get baked - on goo off . It 's that well made and sturdy . And , it 's dishwasher safe . This is a product that 's both reasonably priced and does exactly what it 's supposed to do . No bells , no whistles , it just works !
5 #### Just right for my window box .. No loose hose no clutter
4 #### I bought this imitation door knob for the small side door to the garage . We installed an electronic lock some time ago but its hard to pull on the all - but - inexistent handle of the lock itself , making closing the door difficult . Its even harder if you have greasy or wet hands from working on something in the garage . So we bought this imitation door knob to hold on to with the other hand and pull the door closed when needed . Its simple to install ; just two screws and a hole template is provided to make things really simple . The handle is static but that only makes it easier to grip . And it has the same satin nickel finish as the electronic Shlage deadbolt so they complement one another quite well . So overall , the door know is inexpensive , does the job and looks good on the door . I recommend it .
4 #### Nearly universal repair for damaged Schlage exterior latches with 2 - 3/8 or 2 - 3/4 " backset . No more than 10 minute install with phillips screwdriver .
5 #### Installed these in two bathrooms ..... do n't have to worry about leaving the fan on ..... timers arrived quickly , in perfect condition , installed easily and work great ..... thank you .
5 #### This thermometer is pretty accurate until the afternoon sun hits it .
1 #### Since the trap is a waste of money , these pads are also a waste of money . Maybe you can glue them onto your wall and hope that a fly lands there .
5 #### Great little tool ! I have looked at and turned away from these trimming planes so many times , believing them to be more gimmick and toy , than tool . Wow , was I wrong . The sole was flattened on wet / dry sandpaper first and to remove the black finish . The blade was re - sharpended with a secondary bevel and has n't been touched again since . This plane is primarily used for easing edges , and for fitting . Could n't be happier using it for my purposes .
5 #### The Rat Zapper is by far the vest electronic trap I have ever used . No mess no hassle . Simply put in batteries , add a couple kernels of dog food , turn it on and zap away . When the light starts flashing dump the vermin , place a few new kernels of dog food in it , turn it back on and your good to go . It just can not get any easier .
5 #### Splitting some serious logs with this , about 3 foot ( yes , foot ! ) diameter oak logs . Some take a couple hits to split , but gets the job done . Bought sharpener too to keep cutting well .
5 #### They all sprouted and the company really cares about it 's seeds . Great to have a company that actually makes use of the e - mail to be positive their customers have received the product and are happy with the product . Very accessible and concerned with excellence .
5 #### At 62 I have very arthritic hands , the more I to hold onto , the less pain I have later . so yeah it does the job well and saves hand problems
5 #### This is one of the most used knives in my kitchen . I buy them and give them as gifts , too . I really like the way the handle fits my hand and the small blade is perfect for little picky jobs where a larger knife is too unwieldy . A favorite of mine to use and to give !
2 #### too big to make a cup o f tea and difficult to clean .
4 #### Seems to work well so far . We seem to have had a light mosquito season , likely due to a dry late summer . Still it seems to work so well enough so far .
5 #### Lay them flat ... it is amazing what small bugs crawl over and are caught ..... have not had a problem with mice . However , did catch a small one a few years ago . We keep these under furniture in basement level of home ... Good value for the number of traps .
5 #### Love this product , I have a difficult time attaching thins t o the outside spigot ( I think it was installed too close to the house n and it can not be moved , it allows little room fir attaching things tightly ) . I t leaks a little bit , drip ... drip .... drip , but hen again , everything else drips as well .
1 #### I used in my ikea bathroom set thing , as you are putting it inside it gets too hot to touch , I do n't want to install it or it might blow up . It heats up in less than a second to the point you ca nt hold it .
5 #### I have a huge gas grill but I really miss that smokey flavor that a charcoal grill gives meats so I thought I 'd give this a try . I 'm glad I did and also glad I got the weber quick start charcoal chimney . Coals are ready to go in 10 minutes . I use this little bbq weekly .
5 #### What a great idea . I bought this and a pour over coffee maker and where have I been that I did n't see this . I love both of my new coffee makers and this one is great for camping too .
5 #### Just got this and for the price and what you are getting it is amazing . This has been redesigned by the company so it is FOOL PROOF in regards to assembly . NO TOOLS REQUIRED- It is very sturdy and is larger than you imagine 4 feet to be . The light is powerful and adjusts with ease . I would recommend this to a friend . - happy new year !
5 #### Oo Good Grips makes the BEST plungers and the they work and last for years . We have 4 for each of our bathrooms . Love the way the case hides the plunger and the white blends with a white toilet and any bathroom !
5 #### This is the perfect instrument for making peanut butter and jelly . It 's not really sharp , so it 's great for my kids . And it 's long enough that it reaches to the bottom of the jar . I bought 3 overall !
5 #### Very good , works as expected , well made , good quality plastic , more settings than I needed . I would buy a again and recommend .
5 #### I have n't used this Hedge - hog H.D.Edger replacement part yet . But I 'm sure it 'll work ok .
5 #### These are the best made router bits I have ever seen , top quality even for Freud . So far only used them once for some trial cuts , but they made easy work of hard maple .
1 #### Do n't buy this ! I bought three . One broke after two uses , and the second after two months . In both cases , the hose separated from the connection collar . I guess the only reason the third is still working is because I 've only used it once so far . What a waste of money .
1 #### I 've owned numerous of these Broan ventilation fans . If there is one thing that defines every unit , without exception , it 's premature failure of the motor which drives the fan impeller . The motors employ cheap bearings that wear out quickly and result in a loud rattle/ squeak .
5 #### I have n't used yet but it is exactly what I wanted - GREAT . I will use it next time I put a big roast on the smoker .
2 #### When working properly , the skimmer does an excellent job of pulling in debris off the top of my 16'x32 ' Intex Ultra Frame salt water pool . HOWEVER , as I 'd feared , after just a week in use the plastic arm that the unit relies on to remain attached to the rail of the pool and thus remain firmly in place at the waterline is steadily weakening , resulting in the unit raising above the waterline and creating a vacuum whereby no water can get into the hose and into the pump . This in turn results in a low flow alarm situation for my pump , shuts it down and ultimately the solution fails . Based on this , I would NOT recommend purchasing this item . If the plastic arm were of a higher quality of plstic or made of aluminum or stainless steel then I would highly recommend it as the design is good . It 's just the execution and materials that are poor .
4 #### It 's a great little light that helps with a ton of tasks . I 'd buy it as a gift . The flex arm is perfect and stays where you put it . My only gripe is the clamp . I 've tried double stick tape to keep it in place but it always comes loose . Still very good .
5 #### I have an awesome huge whisk , but sometimes you just do n't want to bother with the weight of a heavy whisk when you 're whisking something lighter . I reach for my OXO Good Grips 11 - inch whisk 90 % of the time . It does a great job , the handle is comfortable , it 's not too heavy but can whisk just fine . Unless you 're whisking egg whites by hand , this is an AWESOME go - to whisk . Also , OXO has really good customer service . I had an issue with another product that was my fault , and they replaced it kindly . I really appreciated that . I have many of their kitchen products and have liked them all .
2 #### Got wet once and that was it ! So for any tile setters . Construction workers , remodelers or anywhere there 's water do n't buy it
5 #### I love this product ! I have two now and it works GREAT . You can push the rod into the ground for the amount of water you need in the layer of dirt / grass you have . It feeds the trees / or the lawn . It 's PERFECT . Here in Mesquite TX we have hard CLAY , this feeder puts water into the root system without ground lever evaporation .
5 #### These were used in a NuMax SFL618BR pneumatic hardwood floor nailer ( also purchased from Amazon ) and they worked very well . The floor was 3/4 inch x 2 1/4 inch oak boards , so it took lots of nails ( estimated 1500 nails ? ? ) to finish my living room floor . No problems .
3 #### Very loud not so sure how safe it is on my ears , but does a good job and is light enough to do smaller jobs .
5 #### excellent and easy to hold . bristles are good quality and long lasting
5 #### I have had my lawn buddy for 2 gardening seasons and find it indispensable . I have back problems and had knee surgery and no longer can kneel even on foam pads . The lawn buddy has been a lifesaver for me . It is lightweight , sturdy ( I 'm over 200 lbs ) , wheels roll easily even on the lawn and it carries all my tools . I can either straddle it or sit sideways and it is low enough for me to reach into the garden to pull weeds , plant etc . I purchased 3 other non mobile garden stools before I found the lawn buddy and havn't used the others since . When I purchase larger potted plants I can put 2 or 3 of them in the storage compartment and it also holds 2 flats of flowers which makes transporting from my car to the garden so much easier . Moving a bag(s ) of garden soil is now possible . I used to load these items into a wheelbarrow which inevetibly would get off balance and tip over .
5 #### Assembly took a little longer than I expected . Works much better than the Home Depot 's Rigid version or the Ryobi wheels that I could have bought for my Ryobi BT3100 table saw . Quite pleased with its functionality . Much sturdier than the pictures conveyed . Significantly improves the versatility of my workshop . Recommended .
5 #### I received this pan yesterday . I made a 7 - up pound cake this morning and it came out perfect . This pan is worth every penny . I have used the cheaper pans and I just about gave up on making a bundt cake . After reading all the reviews on this pan I decided to give this pan a try and I am glad that I made this purchase . You will not regret buying this pan .
5 #### Better than a tank top heater in that it is very light and portable . Does n't put out as much heat as tank top but I love the handiness of it .
5 #### I have long been searching for a pie or cake cutter that would n't break the bank and this is absolutely the one ! No more messing around with a knife and a spatula . This product is outstanding and I highly recommend it ! !
5 #### Pure music . The best chimes ever both in sound and looks . I will purchase more from these builders .
4 #### I usually keep one of these on hand . So , needless to say I was disappointed when a friend accidently through the item in the trash . If you are a tea drinker this is a must have item .
5 #### I recently purchased this set for some doors that I was doing for a china cabinet . I used birch as the primary lumber and I was amazed at the results . The doors came out perfect and I was very surprised at the alignment . They were much easier to set up than expected . Although these might seem a little expensive , they are worth every penny .
5 #### Extremely clean cuts . Used it on the Work Worxsaw 4 - 1/2 compact circular saw to replace hardwood flooring .
5 #### love these gloves . i wipe mine with warm bacon grease for great water resistance and it softens the leather making them feel like they were made for your hands . i love these gloves .
4 #### I know Kettler products from Germany . Unfortunately they are far more expensive in the United States . This chair is great for my patio , sturdy and not to heavy to maneuver around . I just wipe it off with water occasionally , done . The reason I gave it only four stars , it is not as easy to unfold as some other ones I had in the past . You definitely can not get an American product in this quality for this price though . Get yours , while they are still available .
5 #### What 's to comment other than it worked as advertised .... It turned ON when I flipped it ON , and it turned OFF when I flipped it OFF ... OK ?
5 #### If , like me , you learned to mash potatoes with one of those mashers that looks like a thick wire bent back and forth , you probably do n't like mashing potatoes by hand . The wire tools do n't work very well . This masher does ! Spray it with a little non - stick spray , mash a few time , and yum . This is definitely the tool to mash potatoes by hand . I avoided making mashed potatoes before I learned about this type of masher , now I make them frequently . It 's small price to pay for a tool that really works .
1 #### Uploaded a picture , brand new out the box it looks like cheap metal , with rust .... This stuff is going in your coffee .... I used it today one time to give it a chance , but coffee grinds go in the coffee , just nasty .... Returning and ordering a French press thing ....
4 #### I bought this on a whim and I totally loved it . It easily cuts potatoes and it easily sets up and breaks down for cleaning . I am not very strong in the arms and yet I find I am able to cut the ' taters ' with this very easily . My mother in law , who is in her 70 's is still able to use hers to cut potatos . As with other reviewers I would say that this cutter could be bigger . If you have large potato you will have to cut it into smaller sizes in order to fit into this cutter . That is the only con that I can share with you . If you make french fries or sweet potato fries , this is the tool to use . We do parboil our sweet potatos before cutting them . This is one item I would buy again if we were to lose this one . Enjoy .
2 #### Does not have square edges . marking line has a 1/8th inch round to it . My harbor freight square beats this hands down !
5 #### The kind my hubby likes . He is a full time carpenter . We have bought many of these over the years . FatMax is the tape to buy . It is not flimsy . It is just what you need . Buy it . You wo n't regret the purchase .
5 #### Amazing knife : Pros Awesome in design , sharpness , handle , balance , size is great . Cons : ? ? ? ? ? ? ? I pondered buying this knife for quite sometime had it in my wish list among other things that I check price daily when I 'm bored . And it hovered about the 50.00 range and then one day it dropped for some reason to the 25.00 price range I could n't believe it the shipping was still free so I snatched it up and boy was I pleased . I have never seen it that low before . But I found that happen numerous times with various other items . I do n't know why but suddenly suppliers may need to move a product and drop prices significantly and it 's time to move when you see it . God bless and happy hunting . But I would say that at the full 50.00 this knife is MORE than Worth it !
5 #### These are high quality . I 'll be back for more . Our A / C cycles a lot of air living in Houston =)
5 #### This is an excellent router for the money . I use it primarily in a router table and have been making my own moldings and trim . The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust . I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much . Other than that , i think it is the best router for the money .
4 #### The crystal prisms are pure glass , not plastic . The sunlight hits it and sends rays of color through out the room . The price point in very low , compared to other sites . Thank you .
1 #### The product description details of this item clearly stated the bulb type is LED . However the version that I received is the old incandescent model . It is not worth going through the hassle of a return so I will look for a LED conversion kit .
5 #### This is so sharp and awesome ! We had been using a dollar store peeler that we 've had for 6 years now . To say this is an amazing upgrade would be an understatement .
5 #### Fantastic product . Great Price ! ! You can spend a lot more on scroll saws and not get half the saw that this is . I do scroll saw work for sale and this saw keeps up with all my needs . It cuts any wood I have put it too . By the way my favorite blades to use with this aw are the spirals and it handles them just fine .
5 #### Very large and easy to read . Seems to be very accurate . Bought it for the patio so I would know if I was hot or cold ( just kidding ) . Nice to have and very reasonably priced .
4 #### I was having major issues with lesser surge protectors being able to keep up with the constant A / C usage and allowing me to use the lamp and laptop without blowing the circuit or the protector . This bad boy is compact ( when you factor in all of the plugs you get , has a convenient side plug , which allows it to fit snugly behind my couch , and this sucker does the job !
5 #### very satisfied with this product ; easy to use and really gets moisture out of leafy vegetables . Sturdy construction .
3 #### Tupperware bowls are n't what they used to be . I understand companies designing with an updated , sleek new look . However , this does n't mean destroy functionality . I am a blind individual with dexterity issues , due to shoulder replacements . Removing the outer lip for easy grasp , huge mistake . Getting rid of the tongue and groove lid , an even huger mistake . It still somewhat snaps to let you know it 's closed . However , I would never flip over like old ones to see if secure . Just another company puting out garbage to the masses . I will still keep , plastic is n't as flimsy as other companies . If you are an arthritic individual .. I honestly do n't think this is for you . The extra effort it takes to snap , would be difficult . As well as I do n't think you would have a good grip with new handles . Only my observation . Tupperware , please bring back the old design I had as a child .
5 #### very nice heavy duty design , easy setup . Good for up to 7,000 feet altitude . I am heating 400 sq ft . The white ' Mr Heater 's ' will only work under 4,500 ft altitude , I live at 6,800 ft so the one pictured is the one for me .
5 #### What can I say , these Ridgid pipe wrenches always do the job plus when I buy Made in the U.S.A. I know I helping my fellow Americans ! ! ! ! ! ! !
4 #### Much better than the original oxo one that you have to balance oddly to sort of remove the glue without cutting the cannEffective , normal
5 #### Perfectly CUTE pancakes for the 3 yr old Grandson . Might consider buying another style or buy the same one for a Gift for a Mother of a 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 yr old child . The Kids love it .
5 #### Using this in an outdoor culvert that keeps freezing due to a very warm Alaska winter . Hopefully come spring , it will work :)
5 #### Turns out if the diameter of your pool is 10 ft at the ring , you actually have a 12 ft pool ( they 're measured at the bulge ) and you need the 12 ft version of this cover . I learned this the hard way . Given the cover it so cheap it was n't wort going through the return . I 've since ordered the 12 ft version , which fits well and has a lot of over hang . The slack is enough that I do n't have to pull the rafts out when putting it on , I can just cover them over . The weight and snugness of the overhand is also enough to keep it on the pool even without using the tie rope . These are nice covers . The material seems strong and it 's a little pliable which is nice to work with . The holes in the cover are good because they allow trapped water on the surface to get back into the pool . I bought the cover to cut down on the debris in the pool which is helps with , but not a lot . Most of the benifit seems to be that the water stays cleaner and the chlorine stays in the water longer . I 'm putting in less chlorine and the water does n't seem to want to turn green anymore . I 'm guessing that keeping the sun light from the getting to the water when not in use , is helping with that . Anyway it 's a great cover and I highly recommend it .
4 #### This is a good , fairly stout , pry bar . It will come in handy for those occasions it is designed for . A must for any tool collection or set .
5 #### i m sick of getting my hand right up on the grill . these tongs protect my hand from the flames and heat . love it . a little hard to squeeze fully when holding near the back , so adjust upward some and your good .
5 #### Good price . Fit as expected . Quick install and got my vacuum back on the road ... err should I say carpet .
5 #### This is a well made extension cord that I have used quite a few times .
3 #### This saw cuts really well and the 3 extra blades it comes with make it well worth the money . The only con I have about this item is that there was a semi - large piece of melted metal on the threads of the handle and the frame kept falling over . I simply chipped it off and now it works great !
5 #### There is something about feeding hummingbirds that creates an almost Zen like feeling . Watching them as the fly around and feed multiple times a day . They are actually quite friendly and many will fly within a foot of you or less and listen to you talk to them . We have had this feeder for several years and it is the best one we have owned . It is easy to clean up with the large hardened glass bottle and the hummingbirds like the perches to sit on . We like how the bottle screws into the base and then you can flip it and hang it . I even have a photo of a hummingbird , a monarch butterfly and a honey bee drinking at the same time . In the summer time the humming birds can drink up the sugar water like crazy . Now if I could only get them to stop fighting over it . They all think that they own it and they sit there all day long and guard it like it is their personal lunch line . Feeding hummingbirds is fun and enjoyable . This is the best feeder we have owned out of about 5 styles . Try it and you will like it !
5 #### I never owned a non - electric can opener so was n't sure what to expect . This one works perfectly . It is very easy to turn and has never slipped or needed any extra effort to open every can I 've needed opened . It also came in handy when the power went out !
5 #### this works great and is better than a simple on and off . You can set to turn on and stay for 4 - 6 - 8 hours after dark . Very good so far .
5 #### Great leaf grinder . Think weed whip with a hopper . It 's American made with available parts . My mom has had one with a Craftsman label for 25 years and it 's still running well . Comparing the two side by side , I can only see a different connector ( improvement - now metal vs. plastic ) to tie the two halves of the tube base .
5 #### I had trepidations about the power of this device , especially since it had a carpet brush . I thought , as battery powered , at first , something has to give as a tradeoff ..... either power or run - time . Well , all worries came to ease after it 's initial charge of 16 - hours . This broom is a little powerhouse . It is perfect for our use , which is , to pick up stray cat litter . It not only achieves this , but also serves to pick up crumbs or just about any small items from a hardwood or low - pile carpeted floor . Run - time is fabulous . It has run for more than fifteen minutes , with no degradation of power , on the initial battery . if one has to sweep longer than this , of course , the battery can be changed with the charged one in less than ten - seconds . Highly recommend .
5 #### this this product work well I am very pleased I recommend this product because it serves me very well , I have no problem
5 #### Think I bought 10 of these . Same product at Lowes , and I paid about half the price they were charging .
3 #### Not sure the results are accurate . We are in an area that has high phosphate and the test kept reading low phosphate .
4 #### It works fine for the intended purpose and makes a good saw guide when needed .
5 #### Cleaning plastic bowls is a real pain , and ceramic / glass bowls are heavy . Stainless steel is easy to clean and light , reserve your ceramic / glass stuff for acidic foods and toss the plastic .
3 #### The clamp is rather flimsy but it works for holding a shelf on a railing adjacent to my hot tub .
5 #### Works as described . Good price . I will buy them again .
5 #### These r great IF you do n't have many hrs . of work to do . For me , any spring loaded snips r prone to give me numbing in hands . I prefer the ARS brand , have collection of varied ARS snips and some decades old but perform like those right out of the box . Better than other bonsai or botanicals snips , ARS brand stays super sharp and admit have no problems if cutting fine , fine manicure or thru that massive main stem . For all your oils , butters , tinctures , salves , lotions .. use code for discount [ ... ] Happy !
4 #### I caught this little bas$#% the first day . Seems to work well but very hard to set .
5 #### We had a pair of these which we wore out . We could not find with any with gears at Lowe 's . I bought two pairs . One was a Christmas gift . We both love them .
3 #### I got this because a couple of skunks kept coming in my backyard eating the birdseed and digging holes . It scared them off a couple of times , but now they just tolerate it . It does n't bother them at all . So now I have two soaking wet skunks in my yard . Oh well , it was worth a try , I guess . I hope you have better luck .
5 #### Great Product Great Product Great Product Great Product Great Product Stanley 39 - 130 3 x 1/4 - Inch PowerLock KStanley 39 - 130 3 x 1/4 - Inch PowerLock Key Tape ey Tape
4 #### Chose this because of the brand and our generic pizza wheel had never been that good anyway . Well - made product and easy to handle .
5 #### I really like this Action Packer . It was my first one to purchase and I 'm glad I did . It is extremely durable for a plastic product and just the right size . I have it stored in the back of my vehicle ( 03 Ford Focus hatchback ) and it contains various auto related needs such as extra oil , coolant , cleaning supplies , and jumper cables , etc . It 's easy to wash out too with a simple water hose and some soap .
5 #### This is a nice sized pressure cooker for a small family or single person . It 's also easy to clean . My meats come out so flavorful and tender . I highly recommend it .
4 #### Good lightweight , durable whisk that does n't scratch your non - stick pans . The price is reasonable and Oxo is a very reliable brand .
4 #### Needed a small , light duty , vacuum for our store . After checking various reviews , purchased this item from Amazon . It is compact , lightweight , has lots of power and uses a readiliy available dirt bag , which I prefer . It comes with a normal complement of useful accessories and has a convenient length power cord . We use it for bare floors and low - pile carpeting and its performance exceeds our expectations . Three minor , non deal - breaking negative elements are - 1 ) the hose and tubes are friction fit and can disconnect easily ; 2 ) The hose is corregated plastic and seems a bit cheap ; 3)the power cord has a wrap - up rather than retractable storage mechanism . But , the cord wrap - up holder is well designed and located . I would say that the performance is surprisingly beyond light duty and the dirt bag holds plenty of dirt before needing to be changed . All , in all , this is a very good answer if you want an inexpensive , convenient vacuum .
4 #### This came as expected . Good solid mixing bowl . Be sure you know how much four quarts is , though , before you order . This is a good medium sized mixing bowl .
5 #### These are very well constructed , as I had hoped . Just what I wanted and the locking feature works easily without having to tug at it . Nice .
5 #### A very well made router bit ! I have used this bit on oak and birch with very good results . I will buy more Frued router bits in the future .
5 #### I USE THESE SNIPS ALL THE TIME AND THEY ARE HOLDING UP JUST GREAT !
3 #### Very light duty , only good for scratching around in soft soil .
4 #### on time delivery great size for kitchen just what we wanted
5 #### We dehydrate apples a lot and this thing makes it so much easier ! Simple to use and perfect size .
5 #### I 'm not sure what is in this lure , but it does a fantastic job attracting the Japanese beetles ! ! ! Wonderful product ! I am so happy to have found something that works so great !
5 #### These stainless bowls are thick , have a nice finish , and are extremely well made . I bought my wife a full set , I liked them so much I purchased another two for my dogs . The entire " it does n't hold 8 quarts " is insignificant to me . I choose a bowl from my cabinet based on its visual size , not what 's stamped on the bottom . It 's not like they are measuring spoons .
5 #### We finally replaced ours after 10 or so years . This is wonderful , sharp , easy to handle , and a good buy .
2 #### the draw string ripped out first time i put it on pool , not well made
5 #### Works like a charm . Peeling garlic has never been this easy .
5 #### I just bought this from Target , coz do n't wants to wait couple of weeks to receive it from Amazon and was a same price for $ 28 anyway .. IS A Great solid built machine & the doom is clear plastic such as solid and thick .. Clean up is a breeze with little , sponge & soap here & there , Easy ... Makes delicious buttery popcorn for about few people in my movie nights at home with friends in week - ends , top of the doom got holes in it to steams out , and also U can shave off some butter on top of the holes , then can melts & drips inside , while is corns popping HOT , To gives that theater buttery flavor .. AWESOME design ... my friends liked it a lot and they end up bought one too ... I am real happy with it NO problem whatsoever , Simple & Easy popcorn maker ... GREAT buy with fair price !
4 #### The melon baller works well . It makes easy cuts of little round balls and then releases them well . The availability of two sizes is fantastic . The handle however is not too comfy to hold . For a single melon it works fine , but if you are going to be using it a lot of long stretches of time , look for a better handle to hold .
4 #### Unit operates as described in advertising on Amazon . Price included shipping to the front door by UPS . Would recommend to anyone with sidewalk and driveway areas that need an edger to help keep your lawn looking good around the edges . The house we just moved into has a sidewalk , curb and gutter , the first house I have ever owned in town to have these items . I soon found out I needed an edger to help keep the grass trimmed at the edges of concrete . The weed eating device just did n't make it look right . My neighbor came over with his B&W edger one day and demonstrated it and I was sold on an edger .
4 #### Wished it would open from the front instead of the top , otherwise that is my only issue
5 #### These work great for cutting something flexible when you do n't want to use a cutting board or other surface to back up the blade . I used them to cut sound deadener for my van . Pretty sharp , a good product !
3 #### Ordered 3 packages that were supposed to have three(3 ) wands each . They only had two(2 ) wands each . Product technical details says " 3 , " picture shows three , but the package says " 2 " and that 's all there were . So I paid for 9 and got 5 . I need them and I 'm keeping , but annoyed.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Shop - Vac-9061400 - 1 - 25 - Inch - Extension - Wands / dp / B00002ND41 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Shop - Vac 9061400 1.25 - Inch Extension Wands</a >
3 #### This is a good pressure cooker and takes very little time to cook . I have no complaints about the cooker . I just should have bought a larger one . I tried to cook ribs and had to cut in 3 pieces . Delicious too . My fault . Even if you live alone , as I do , it is still worth getting something larger .
5 #### This is my favorite for weeding because it 's short , but wide , light and not metal that clangs around . My old one is still in use after years , but the handles rotted off . The handles lasted for years until I started leaving the container outside and then the handles and strap quickly were destroyed by the UV rays . That does n't make it any less functional , but I wanted a second one . The new one is substantially similar to the old as far as I can quickly see . Since I do not compost in my in - city yard , I like to bag my weeds , cuttings , etc . so I can haul them to the recycling center . Tall kitchen size trash bags fit perfectly in this 10 gallon size gardening bag . I also use this bag with a plastic bag when entertaining outdoors as a convenient trash can .
5 #### I 've wanted a set of these Channellock mini pliers since I first saw a pair many years ago in a friend 's tool chest . That particular pair was plated and did n't have plastic - dipped handles like those offered today . Mine have been VERY handy to have . The pair I bought are only approx . 4 - 5/8 " long and the jaws can clamp down on something about a half - inch thick . There are all sorts of uses for these pliers . Some small parts that I used to crudely reach in to grasp with slipping needle nose pliers are now effectively grasped tightly with these mini jawed pliers . I also appreciate the fact they were made in the U.S.A. , which is no easy feat given our nation 's economic situation . I like them !
4 #### Nice , but rather large wish I would have ordered 9 inch for salad bowl .
5 #### Sturdy , strong , safe . I am 240 and have been using this with a 24 ft ladder to reach the second story roof . I do n't know what I was thinking using the ladder before without this thing . I could tell a huge difference between using the ladder without the stabilizer and with . Works as advertised on corners also . The pads do fall off from time to time when I move the ladder around but nothing a touch of super glue wo n't fix . Highly reccomended .
5 #### Worked great . One dollop of peanut butter , and I caught two mice the first night - then three in the garage the second night . Picked up another stray one in the garage third night . These are California mice , really cute little creatures , so setting them back to the wild felt like the right thing to do ...
5 #### Arrived on time . This replaces my original OXO apple corer that lasted years but finally broke . Love it , and will buy the same brand when in another 10 + years it will need replacing again from lots of use .
3 #### Came in an open box , had to take the time to verify it was the correct chain . Prefer new in box when purchasing ' new ' product .
2 #### whoever designed this product should be shot ! It does NOT fit the Intex Ultra Frame 14 ' pool ! The whole thing continues to float up in the water and air lock the pump . You certainly ca n't leave in on unattended as it will kill the pump . I 'm sure the bracket will most likely crack as the last two have after a year or so , too . Why ca n't you make a product that works in your pools ?
4 #### It works great , figured it would , I like Freud 's blades .
5 #### I purchased this fence system & love it . It installed very easily in about 30 minutes . I took care to get it leveled up well & to have the fence sit about 1/64 " above the saw table so it does n't chatter when I move it . This fence is vey much like my table saw Biesmeyer fence , just smaller . Much better than the melamine covered particle board table & fence system I had purchased .
4 #### I was looking for a heavy wire French whip for heavy sauces - and this is not that . This is a fine - wire whip , not a balloon whip , very narrow . The construction looks good , and it is very light . I think this is the one for making light sauces so I will keep it and give it a try for that . The Update International is the heavy wired French whip for thick sauces , gravy etc . so now I have both . The balance point is about 2 " out into the wire - the wire being heavier than the handle . The loss of a star is because of the price , about double the larger , heavier , better constructed Update International whip so even though they are different tools , this one seems over priced , but I am not an expert ..
5 #### Easy to assemble , easy to setup , easy to operate . I have four HTC 1000 mobile bases in my home workshop , put into use over the past 10 - 15 years . This HTC 2000 has beefier wheels and levers , but otherwise seems identical to the 1000 . I put it under my new bandsaw . So , now my workbench , drill press , table saw and jointer are all on top of HTC bases . They certainly meet my needs and hold up with years of use .
1 #### Brass coupling connection leaks after using it 2 times . Not impressed with this . I will probably go to home depot and buy a new end to replace the ends of this hose . Loved the idea of a non toxic hose for connecting to my RV but do n't like the idea of buying poor quality products
5 #### I am an avid tea drinker , making 2 or 3 pots of tea daily and this is a beautiful , well - made tea kettle . I was surprised at the large " footprint " . But , now that I have used it for a while , I will tell you all the positives . 1 . Great looking . 2 . Easy to pour . 3 . large capacity . 4 . Easy to clean . 5 . Heats quicker than an enameled tea kettle . The only negative is that it is larger in size . For those , like me , who like to boil water to make tea , a very good choice , indeed !
5 #### I really have n't found a use for these but they are cute .
5 #### Another great design from Oxo . The handle offers a great grip , and the bowl has a spout for easy pouring . It stays put when you mix ingredients , and it 's the perfect size . Not too big , not to small .
5 #### Had 1 of these that I got from a Tupperware consultant and ended up losing it so wanted to get several so this would n't happen again . I love these things , they work so well and use them every time I peel citrus .
5 #### i have only used 50.00 or so blades in the past.on the reviews only did i decide to go with this blade.i am glad i did its as good as everyone says.now i want another for a spare .
5 #### I bought this because I was tired of the cheap plastic one my wife would n't let me throw away . This one is very simple in its design but elegant at the same time . It is also very sturdy . I like the long handle for getting into pots and it scoops pasta easily without getting caught up . I do n't have concern with bending it or anything , even though the handle looks in the photos as though it might be thin . I would buy more Amco products based on this purchase .
3 #### So this salad spinner works excellently , I can not take away anything about its function . Big capacity and very solid performance . However , design features are design features . This fell from my standard height counter onto my wooden floor , and it cracked into several pieces . Yes , I understand this is my own fault , and it 's not meant to be dropped . But really , neither are phones or many other items . And its was from a reasonable working height onto a wooden floor not even tile or concrete . So I learned a lesson and looked for a polyurethane material ( like my mom has had for 30 years ) . It is softer so if / when you drop it .... it wo n't shatter . Too bad , as this really was an excellent product otherwise and I was upset to see it blow up .
5 #### You wo n't find a better sprayer that will last you a lifetime . Do n't waste your time with the cheap plastic ones unless you like wasting money .
5 #### Works just as advertised . I could n't find anything large enough to take my toilet tank apart and these ended up doing the trick . They seem like they will hold up well .
5 #### I have been using these for quite awhile and provide an easy way to capture the crickets ! ! ! ! ! ! They do the job !
5 #### have had it for over a year now with no complaints . This is easily my favorite sprayer . Liked it so much I have one for the front AND the back hoses .
2 #### Package arrived intact and in good order . Upon opening I found an empty plastic bag with no parts in it . Tried to contact the mfg , but their instructions were to contact the seller . Got a smart reply in a chat session with them and no instruction to assemble . Used it one time and the paint is peeling off it . I would imagine rusting will occur shortly . Worst experience I have ever had with an Amazon vendor .
3 #### Not great quality , but it is difficult to find ground covers . It does the job okay . Have purchased these for the last 2 years .
5 #### When I left the Navy , my sisters plowed through my sea bag and my peacoat ( the one thing I wanted to keep ) " poof " gone . Found a cool leather peacoat(Tommy Hilfiger ) and these buttons definitely works . Strong and durable .
2 #### Although this router bit cuts fairly cleanly , I have a major issue with it 's manufacturer description and dimensions shown right on the packaging . My objective was to get about 1/2 inch engagement distance between the drawer side and front which would allow for additional 1/4 dowel pins to be added for strength and looks . The 99 - 240 bit packaging shows a dimension of 33/64 inch as the engagement length but that is just incorrect . As another reviewer stated this bit requires a fixed engagement of 3/8 inch only . Freud should understand their tools and market things accurately . The best setup instructions come from lee valley where their drawer lock bit is set up for only 1/4 inch engagement . Follow their instructions substituting 3/8 for 1/4 and you can use the Freud bit in appropriate locations like the back to side joints when using 1/2 thick stock .
2 #### I know this plane was inexpensive , but I was hoping for a little better . I ordered this Stanley Block Plane as well as the Stanley Sweetheart Low Profile Block Plane . The Sweetheart lived up to its name - it is well built , nicely machined , sharp and flat . This plane is roughly machined , not even close to flat , the blade is heavily burred , and there is slight rust on the sole plate . I know , you get what you pay for . I started trying to flatten the sole plate last night ; I spent over an hour sanding it with 100 grit on top of my cast iron table saw table . After an hour , I have it nearly flat , but decided to quit for the night . I will continue working on this , sanding the base and filing the throat as needed . Sharpening the blade should n't be too big of a deal ( I generally expect to do that on a new tool ) though it was quite jagged . My guess is that I will probably end up investing at least 3 to 4 hours " tuning " this tool before it is ready to use . Do n't expect to pull this plane out of the box and put it to use .
5 #### they are channel locks , , , they only have one standarfd ... superior ...
5 #### The perfect whisk for making sauces and gravies . OXO rarely misfires with its products and this is another winner . It is the perfect size . When I first saw it I thought it was too small , it is n't .
5 #### As usual , OXO gets it right . Basic whisk with comfortable handle and it 's dishwasher safe . No complaints .
5 #### Well made and works great . What I have come to expect from Oxo .
5 #### This knife is made of lots of good , hard steel . I 've had one for the last -- let 's see , how long ... ? 10 years . And I could easily have it for another fifty ; unless you 're a professional chef , you 're unlikely to use up the blade in a lifetime of sharpening . Ultimately , when you choose a Henckels knife , you need to hold them , because they make three handle styles , all of which are combined with those terrific blades . They are stainless , so they do n't hold an edge as well as the old - school carbon steel , but they also avoid rust that way . You ca n't go wrong with this knife .
5 #### Using as outdoor clock facing west . No operational issues so far after few weeks . Appears well constructed . No problem having time.calibration .
5 #### Why you 'll love it : Both of these were incredibly sharp out of the box . The grips are larger , which makes it easier for people with large hands . Paring knife has n't failed in cutting through tough vegetables or packaging material yet . Why you wo n't love it : There are cheaper alternatives out there . Still , if you 're committed to the OXO design philosophy , this is a must for people of any age .
5 #### I just started cooking with a pressure cooker . I loved these so much that I bought the 4 qt also . Made really well and easy to use . Love !
1 #### Defective / Does not work properly Details : I used this for 45 minutes . I moved the hose 10 feet and the brass end pulled off of the hose . This hose does not rate 1 star . You should discontinue . Amazon made it right ! Thank you !
5 #### I was looking for a can opener that was sturdy . This fits my needs perfectly . It opens cans with ease and I have never had a problem using it.it fits great in my hand and I do n't have to squeeze hard . I love OXO products . Always reliable .
4 #### This tool peels easily and feels comfortable in your hand . The gouger part at the end for digging the " eyes " out out potatoes is pretty much junk though . It 's so dull you have to use a lot of force to make it work , and in end up jabbing myself with it occasionally when it slips ( because it 's dull ) . Frustrating , but the main function of peeling is smooth and easy .
2 #### would not recommend . too difficult to install and the wire does not stay tight .
5 #### This stuff works great in keeping the string algae out of our pond ! This is the second year we have used it !
5 #### Nice blades they come in handy for all type of projects that come up time and time again wether it might be on the job or for home use .
5 #### I have been testing this dado for some time ow and I find it to be very well build . Its ultra finish when used in your best projects make it on of the finest dado ever made . I have use this Dado in a Ryobi BT 3100 , Ridgid 3650 and a Delta table saw . The wrench that comes with the set only fits Dela products . Be sure that you use this tool to its super potential . It 's price will be a draw back for many home shops but it is still a deluxe tool built for a craftsman in mind . John Cupp
5 #### this is a refill and I can tell you that this stuff is no joke . the light attracts insects and the paper cements thier doom .
2 #### Not very accurate and difficult ( or maybe impossible ) to adjust or calibrate
3 #### I 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it . It is quiet and has plenty of power . I find that it is stable in my hands and its ' weight actually contributes to that stability . That said , I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism . Shortly after I brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking . After repeatly cleaning and recleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while . I no longer use it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router . If the plunging action is n't that important , then this is a great router . If the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere .
5 #### These are the perfect containers for working out in the garden . They are light but tough and easy to store when not in use .
5 #### Good nozzle . Has a uniformly round spray pattern and shuts of completely .
5 #### Bought this for my Husband and he really loves this grill . You do n't use as much charcoal as you would in a large charcoal grill and it cooks food really well . He is very pleased with this grill & it is well made , not cheap at all , like other small grills that you buy in the stores , sturdy too . Easy to put it together . Would highly recommend this grill to anyone who is looking for a well made , sturdy table top grill .
5 #### It 's sharp , alright . Really sharp . So much so , that I can not stress this enough : BE CAREFUL . I slipped somehow , and managed to cut a really deep gash in my left hand with it- this , after warning my kids about axe safety ! LOL The ER doc was impressed with how nice and clean the cut was , as he stitched me up- clean edges , and no debris in the wound . ( It 's ALWAYS better to have a cut from a sharp instrument than a dull one ! ) Prior to that little accident , though , I was mightily impressed with how easy it is to split even knotty pine wood with this axe . The non - stick coating works wonders , too- these are really great wood tools . We bought the hatchet , at the same time , for kindling work . Well - designed , they really are wonderful axes- very much a step up from the ones my dad had . I would highly recommend them ! :)
5 #### I have wanted this dado set for a long time now and finally saved up enough to make the purchase a few weeks ago . One of the best purchases I have made for my woodshop . Superior quality .... packaged perfectly for storage ... highly recommended ! !
4 #### This is a review of the Shop - vac 90304 Cartridge Filter . I have an older 10 Gal Shop - Vac and needed a new filter . Although I was tempted to buy a third - party filter at a greatly reduced price , I just decided to go with this filter that I knew would fit without any issues . Not too much I can say except that it fit perfectly and works as expected . I can gently brush the filter off after using it , particularly if using it for Dry Wall Dust , which will clog the filter pretty quickly I use a soft bristled paint brush that gets into the pleats pretty well and makes cleaning if off rather quick , albeit dusty .
5 #### Worked out great , saved a lamp base from the landfill . This is a very cost - effective solution !
5 #### This is a great product . I love it more than my coffee maker
5 #### Been using these for decades . It works great . Makes garlic peeling faster .
5 #### Great wind chime . It is large and loud . The sound is soothing and not overpowering . Great to listen to while laying in the hammock .
4 #### Mostly I chop garlic , I 've had a press for a long time that I got right here on good ole Amazon , but it was n't THIS press ! This press will hold a lot of garlic - hurray ! It does a quick and easy job of squishing it through the holes and doing what you want done , turning a big bunch of garlic into tiny tiny pieces . It 's easy to clean , too . The one caveat is it 's BIG , including the handles ... so if you have small hands ( or stumpy ones like me ) you might have a small ( pun intended ) problem squishing the handles with one hand , definitely not a reason not to get this wunderkind of garlic smooshing technology , though . Highly recommend it ! :)
5 #### Excellent product , simple and pretty easy to use and produce excellent quality of coffee .
5 #### Well crafted work glove , the fits properly and should hold up well under normal work usage .
5 #### Very good , I get all kinds of birds in my yard
5 #### Had a terrible moth problem this year swarms eating my whole yard , this bug killer helped a lot to cut down the moths and killed a lot of other bugs too !
5 #### I COULDNT FIND ANY QUALITY MUFFIN PANS , MOST ARE VERY CHEAP , AND THIS ONE IS ONE PIECE OF METAL FORGED INTO THE MUFFIN PAN . VERY GOOD QUALITY . THANKS .
5 #### Much larger that the 6.5 inch versions that we had been using . Much more open to be able to fill the taco shells with abundant ingredients . Seems like they have to be left in longer than what is called for in order to ensure that the tortilla is done and crisp versus chewy . Flour tortillas are fine for this application . We use the store bought versions made for burritos . Would love to make them with corn but finding a commercially made corn tortilla that big is problematic .
5 #### I have purchased much more expensive kitchen utensils and have been very disappointed . This is a very nice piece , good quality and well worth the price .
5 #### Works perfectly , and amazing Price . These bulbs were $ 3 - 4 a PEICE locally . Thanks Amazon and CBconcept !
4 #### Does the job . The stopper button could be better because you really have to press down hard to get it to slow down and stop .
5 #### I 'm lovin' it . Have no experience with spokeshaves but I like this . As soon as I got it I sharpened the blade , just did n't seem sharp enough right out of the box . After sharpening I grabbed a piece of scrap and went to work . Had so much fun I almost turned it into a toothpick . I can think of quite a few things I 'll be using this for .
5 #### For the price and of the size pipe it was designed for it is as good as any i have seen . Especially in that price range .
3 #### Did n't work very long ... Stopped detecting motion after about 3 weeks ..
4 #### Fits well , use it on my John Deere L118 lawn mower . Only complaint is that the shape , while fitting well , does n't fit perfectly . In my car , when I get the air filter seated just right , everything closes up just right . On the mower , even when its seated just right , there 's awkward pressure on the flap as if it 's not quite right - but it is .
5 #### I bought this specifically to put my morning bagels under the broiler . I wish it was about an inch longer because I buy pretty large bagels which I cut in half . I no more have to use a full size cookie sheet . Compact , with a non - stick surface that cleans up quickly and easily . I would definitely buy again .
2 #### I have been using these sprouts and noticed that almost all the red clovers have small black dots on the leaves . I e - mailed Amazon and Todd 's seeds about the problem asking if it was okay to continue eatting . Amazon said they could n't do anything and Todd 's never responded . I am not sure if the spots are a problem , but it would have been nice to get some kind of response . Will not be ordering again .
4 #### It 's getting more and more difficult to find a decent hummingbird feeder for the window . Lowe 's used to carry them but I now find myself ordering them . I live in Central TX where the sun and heat break plastic down like paper . Most plastic things only last one summer around here . Usually the little perches snap like twigs after the year is over , but this will make it a second . And for some weird reason the hummers love this one , they fight over this one and I have a couple others in the garden area . Do n't know why really , but they prefer this one . Makes me happy b / c we can see the little jewels all throughout the day from our kitchen window . And the glass jar part is way better than the plastic .
5 #### My yard looks great . Tried a weed eater but using this edger my yard look professionly cut . The edger is light and will cut through concrete if it gets in the way
5 #### Great pan for cooking pop overs . I use it a lot and I am very pleased with my purchase .
5 #### Arrived early ! Works Great ! Simple + Durable = perfect combination ! Buy it ! Lawns Love water !
5 #### And it sells for 4 - 5 bucks less . Has same 3 hole pattern as the makita 5 inch R.O. Works ok fine .
5 #### Have only been using this pot for a few weeks to make the coffee for church , so do n't know how long it will last , but so far I 'm very happy with it . It takes about a minute per cup , we have been using hot tap water to start with and it reduces your brew time by about 1/3 . It is a little noisy when it first starts perking . It sounds like it 's trying to launch into orbit , then quiets down after it gets going . Attractive coffeepot , so far I like it a lot and the coffee tastes good , does n't leave many grounds in the bottom .
5 #### you know it does nt get any better for the price ... sturdy thick hose also ... thought it was gon na be cheesy but its NOT
3 #### not a clear description ; this does NOT fit the battery powered skill saw
5 #### Thinner material , but perfect for the new toaster oven I just purchased .
3 #### Well , after reading all the positive reviews , we purchased the CC 120 . For many years , I 've been sharpening our kitchen knives by hand ... using both oil stones and water stones ... with great results . It was tedious and took hours for all the knives , so I tried the Chef 's Choice . What a dissapointment . After carefully reading the instructions , I used the sharpener on a few of the knives . The manual suggests the knife would be sharp enough to cut paper . Nope . Hand sharpening produces a much better edge ( cuts paper ) which is then easy to keep true with a steel . This one will be returned . Followup : I subscribe to Cook 's Illustrated and they indicated that it takes roughly 14 passes ( 7 on each side ) to achieve a good edge . I tried it followed by 6 passes through the polisher ( 3 on each side ) . The knife I tried this approach on is definately very sharp and cuts paper . That being said an IMO , too much metal is removed in the process , so I 'll stick with hand - sharpening . However , I will keep this CC 120 since I paid only $ 90 for the chrome model .
5 #### They float then sink full of algae . I dry them out and place them back in the pond . The price is the best .
5 #### We ordered this pool after using one at a friend 's house . The pool is small , but big enough to float on a raft inside . We mostly use it on hot summer days as a quick dip to cool off . it is only about thigh high deep , so its use by adults may be limited , although we did have 6 adults in it once ! of course we had to refill it after that . its built in pump does an excellent job of keeping the water clear , except for small particles of sand that we used a small net to wrangle out of the pool . I hear that you can get a type of under water vacuum to remove that . We also ordered a cover . I hear that one can also order a type of cover that may help to heat up and insulate the warm water for use at night . Here in the high desert our summer nights get cold . Great product with a super quiet pump .
5 #### Looked all over my local area and could n't find them . Was just what I needed and it came in less than a week . Great tool for anyone dealing with Drywall be yourself .
5 #### Bought a pair for each of my ladders , Delivered quickly and a perfect fit for standard size ladders . Used a shim to adapt to my 12 indoor ladder that had a smaller rail .
5 #### It is good hardware cloth . The price was good and so is the quality . not much else to say about it .
4 #### I use it almost every day . Brownies , pancakes , cornbread , pretty much anything for which you would make a batter can be made in this bowl . Nice and deep . Nice non - slip bottom . One down side : it 's got a right - handed handle , making it difficult for left - handed people to use . Would have been a five - star but for that .
1 #### This product was recommended with the push real lawnmower that we purchased . However , it constantly comes disconnected from the lawnmower and does n't work the way we had hoped . I am very disappointed in having wasted my money on it .
5 #### Despite my skepticism , this item is great and works beautifully . It is not difficult to clean as I had expected it would be .
5 #### It is nice a heavy like my very first bundt pan . and bigger also . Great qualityy pan .
5 #### The tool is wounderful . It came from the retailer with some damage , but I contacted Kreg and they shipped out a new piece that very day . GREAT service . I have always had good things to say about Kreg . Now I will just have more to say . I will recomend Kreg to everyone .
5 #### seems dumb to rate a tea ball.but nice to have an honest ALL stainless ball.if a newbee do not expect the stainless to stay stainless in TEA.this is a throwback item they got right . thank you prepworks .
3 #### Was less of a pie server than I thought . It 's very shallow in the bend . Good for pizza though . Just not great for pies . Too clumsy .
4 #### This tea ball fits enough leaves for a strong mug of tea , and allows water to flow through it well . It is flimsier and slightly harder to use than the Twist Lock Spice Ball , which only comes in larger sizes . After few uses part of the mesh darkened . Overall , it does its job well .
4 #### I am a guy but I make the World 's best chocolate chip cookies . It is hard to find a 3/4 cup though . I even went to the specialty shops and they wanted to charge me $ 25 for their set with that size cup in it while the other sets were 1/2 the price . They only had one and had to go to the back to find it . People who pay that much are stupid , crazy , or desperate ! ! You can pull the desired cup from the ring as well so you do n't have to wash them all each time even if you just used one like other sets I have seen . Well , maybe that is just the spoons but you get my point .
5 #### Just used it for the first time . Perfect cake , a little brown on the edges , did not stick .
5 #### Handy little spud crescent . Well built also as it stays adjusted while using - hey , it 's a Klein !
5 #### Good clips - not the cheapie kind you get at the dollar store . Should last a good while .
5 #### LOVEIT ! ! ! ! ! It works so well and picks up dog hair . I was so excited , I vacuumed under all the beds , wood furniture , and the sectional . Great price and buy .
5 #### This is the first Chef knife I 've ever bought . I was impressed with the quality and sharpness of it when I first tried it out . I first underestimated the sharpness of it and almost cut myself several times . Excellent for normal slicing and chopping . You 'll enjoy the quality of an awesome gourment knife at a really reasonable price .
4 #### The knives arrived at least 2 days before they were projected to get to my door . We were having a steak dinner that night , so I was delighted in the early delivery . They are very sharp , and cut through the steak with very little pressure . I 'm told they will hold their sharp edge for a long time . I hope so . Although I believe it said they were dishwasher safe , I do not wash my knives in the dishwasher . Thank you for a very good product at an excellent price .
4 #### They are nails . Tough to get too excited . They are sharp and go through wood .
5 #### This is a great product . Made very well . It cuts without much effort . If you have arthritis or any hand pain , do n't fear this product . It is easy and smooth .
5 #### I needed a small hand rake for doing things like fragile flower beds , in my landscaping business . It 's well made and works very nicely . I 'm pleased . And the bright red handle means that you wo n't lose it at the job site .
1 #### This is a true waste of time if you have any moisture or anything but sand to plung this in . It plugs each and every time . It would work much better if the tubing was tapered so you could at least have a chance of digging the dirt out after each penetration . I gave up and rented an aerator . It worked .
5 #### Seems like it 's doing the job it 's supposed to . Our lot is 50 x 150 approx and this is killing a good share of mosquitos and other nasty bugs ..
5 #### I used this for mixing an outdoor bleach mix to clean off the algae / mold on my gutters . It came right off . A great product .
5 #### We recently had laminate and tile flooring put down in our house , taking carpet up in all but the bedrooms . My big vacuum has a hard floor setting , but I knew I would like something lightweight to use on the new floors . While searching the internet I came upon the Quick Up Cordless . After reading the reviews I decided to order it . The bonus battery pack was definitely a selling point . I can vacuum the entire hard floor areas on one charge though . It is a little messy cleaning the container out , so I do that outside . It 's amazing how much the little thing picks up . I normally use it with the brush roll off , but have turned that feature on at times . It 's delicate enough to use on the laminate without scratching it like a regular vacuum would do . It 's wonderful not having to plug and unplug a cord from room to room . Please note that this little vacuum can not be expected to vacuum carpet like a regular one . It 's not intended for that use . It will pick up off of carpet of course , but not deep clean carpet like a regular vacuum . I use my Quick Up everyday on my tile and laminate and love it !
5 #### The 4 1/2 " Channellock pliers is the perfect pocket tool . It 's what you carry when you did n't think that you would really need a tool . Dimes and pocket knives can be used in place of a screw driver , but everything else requires pliers . This size is nearly impossible to find in stores , so ordering on the internet is the best way to get one . With a small Swiss Army knife , these 4 1/2 " Channellock pliers , and a 4 " Crescent wrench in my pants pockets , I can do minor maintenance on 90 % of the equipment in my laboratory .
3 #### Just thought I would give some feedback on the lifespan of the duracord hammock . We live on the Gulf Coast where outdoor furniture is subjected to high heat and humidity , severe sunshine and some salt spray . I purchased this hammock in April 2010 and left it out year - round . Recently ( July 2012 ) two ropes fell apart , several others look frayed and it 's clear that it is not safe to use any more . While this sounds like a negative review , I was quite happy with the hammock for 2 years - it was comfortable , attractive , and put up with use by multiple kids . Just do n't expect it to last forever .
5 #### used the chips once so far and I should have soaked them longer but still , they worked well in my smoker .
2 #### Bought it to throw into my helper 's tool bag . Definetly not for precision work . Lock is flimsy , blade is thin , takes a lot of effort to set the blade depth to just where you want it . If you want a real block plane , go Veritas or Lie Nielsen !
5 #### Does what it 's suppose to do and that is it makes it easier to screw in screws , especially when you 're screwing into wood . The magnetic benefit is simple but makes screwing so much easier , especially when you are prone to dropping your screws . When you are working in limited work space it 's much easier to be able to put a screw onto the bit and then put the screw onto your work area instead of having to use two hands to hold the screw onto the bit until you have a bit into your work piece . Being able to simply pull out your bit out of this drive and replace it with another without having to remove the whole drive out of your drill constantly is another benefit . I 'm constantly misplacing mine so I made sure I have extra on hand . Happy screwing !
5 #### Our neighbors are flying flags more often -- most of us have copied each other and have a flag pole on the house and now we 're all getting into bunting . These fan buntings are a bit wrinkled when they come out of the package , but a quick steaming and low heat iron fixed them up ( I think a humid day would do the same , eventually . ) They hang nicely on the white vinyl deck railing . It was a bit more trouble to hang them ( using eyelet bolts ) on the garage door moldings . I really could have used three of them , one for the porch , but two will do nicely . There are slightly cheaper ones , but these fans are made in the US . A long time ago , a friend had a USA flag button on his ball cap . We were slightly chagrined to see the " MADE IN CHINA " mark on it . Seems a bit contradictory , to have a patriotic item made overseas , but what is n't these days ? Well , Valley Forge flags are n't . These are mini fans ( 3 foot by 1 1/2 foot . ) For a big deck or house , you 'll want something larger .
5 #### These storgae seats keep items dry inside and make a nice seat on the patio .
5 #### This kills flies and moths well . I still have the mosquitoes , even with the sticky papers . It handles the lawn sprinklers just fine . Replacement bulbs were pricey .
5 #### The instructions were clear and simple to follow , the timer switch was very easy to install , and it works well so far . Ca n't complain !
5 #### Bought this to replace my 15 + year old pressure cooker of the same model . Not as sturdy as my old one , but overall a great product . Easy to use and makes for cooking dinner a lot quicker .
5 #### I know of no finer pie slicer . It works and looks very good and I would heartily recommend it to all .
5 #### I used a 5/8 " hose to fill a hot tub , and it took an hour . Next time , I used my new 3/4 " hose , and it took 45 minutes .
5 #### I have a small pond . This pump works great and is so easy to clean and use . GREAT purchase and price . I am very happy with this pump and the speed and packaging in which it arrived .
5 #### Very handy and lasts quite a whiles with the XRP battery .
5 #### This is a great chime for peaceful , calming , delightful sounds as it fills the air with beautiful music . It has become my favorite . Even those who normally do n't care for wind chimes have commented on the lovely tones this one makes . Has a easy bass reflection not a tinny sound so many chimes produce . Excellent find ! ! .
4 #### Finally replaced our old one after many years of use . We love these for eggs . I only wish that the attachment point was stronger , that said , the old one lasted a long time .
5 #### These are the best pliers in their class that have ever been made .I've been a skilled tradesman for over 42 years and have suffered many blood blisters and pinched hands from similar pliers . These pliers will not close to pinch your palms and they have and exceptional gripping power . If you do n't own these be sure to get a couple of pair as they are the best pliers on the market today , bar none . Thank you Channellock .
5 #### I needed a replacement water hose for the RV . Having had two 25 ' hoses , getting the 50 ' was a no - brainer . I wanted a decent hose without spending a lot of money , but I did n't want an inferior product . This hose meets all of those needs . In addition , my old hoses wanted to stay coiled up and this one just rolled out and laid flat .
5 #### I love this edger , great for the wall 's edge and corners . It actually holds a bit more paint than expected , so I got a nice line . They are n't really easy to clean , but with a little effort I re - used mine twice . I will definitely be getting more , as I have a lot of my house left to be painted .
5 #### Many hoses are less expensive , but non - kinking is important when camping , and setting up and tearing down on a frequent basis . Good hose .
5 #### This one is good but the hard bottom one is better .
5 #### Working Great ! I have only used it a few times but so far very happy with it and it 's smaller size . As always with Amazon , fast and easy delivery ,
1 #### bought little over a year ago . My wife finally started using it . But , the pressure regulator does n't works properly . it does n't heavy enough to hold the pressure either . Trying to contact Presto or Amazon for a replacement or a return .....
3 #### It works fine . Pretty hard to push down the lever . Kept thinking it was going to break . The huge downside is that it only cuts very small potatoes . I tried to put a medium on in and had to cut the tips off a good inch each and shave off some of the side . Granted , these potatoes are regular old potatoes you buy in a bag . They are n't large so I 'm disappointed that I have to cut the potatoes to fit . I was under the impression that this could at least hold a medum sized potato
5 #### We use our mini shop vac regularly and keep these filters around . Easy to install .
5 #### This is a great little pressure cooker for making meals for under six people , I have a 16 quart one too . I use them about once a week for meals we love pressure cook food . Makes food taste good and tender , Like my mother says there is no such thing as a tuff piece of meat , and I agree .
5 #### I purchased two sizes of these to replace another brand that did not hold up for us . These are great , with a nice handle and solid feel .
4 #### I bought 3 and they all work the same ( nice ) , however I thought they were a little stiff . It is nice to have the additional reach and it 's nice to have the additional pressure . Overall they work very well .
4 #### The flag , pole , and the eagle on the top are great . However the pole holder is a piece of junk ! ! ! It bent in half with the first wind gust . I had to order a cast aluminum holder . Very strong now ! ! !
5 #### a great work bench , stores easily . very stable even with projects that are much longer than the bench . pros . very stable . stores well , functions well cons . the belt that allows you to turn one handle to tighten or loosen the clamp on the table slips off a lot . thoughts . i just took the belt off and control each side individually .
5 #### This is the finest sander on the market . Virtually vibration free and no swirl marks . The PC 505 simply floats across the work surface . I actually look forward sanding my projects . I can use it for hours without the fatigue I experience with random orbit sanders and get a much better finish . As another reviewer noted it lacks dust collection . I 'm not to impressed with any of the dust collection systems I 've seen on other sanders anyway . Buy or build yourself a sanding table , and sand away . This is far and away the best power tool purchase I have ever made .
5 #### Nice looking , well - made as are all OXO products . Can spin lots of veggies for large salad . shipped promptly , well - packaged .
4 #### Had this for years ... Used it all the time to prune my palm trees ... Got a little aggressive this month trying to remove a ( too large ) branch on a ' real ' tree & broke the plastic pruner head case ( my fault ) ... Called Fiskars & they mailed me a new unit in ~1 week under their Lifetime Warranty ... If this new unit works as well as the last one I 'll be a Fiskars customer for life ...
5 #### Finally I have another pressure cooker with the rocker regulator . I have been using a pressure cooker for over 35 years and never had a problem with them . My previous pressure cooker was dropped and it bent enough that I could n't use it anymore . I purchased one of the newer ones without the rocker regulator and it scared the hell out of me . I could n't tell if it was pressurized until the steam was coming out so strong that it blew the safety valve . It went straight to the trash can . I bought this one and I am back in business with pressure cooking . When the rocker starts hissing and rocking I know to adjust the heat to get that slow steady rocking . I also have a 4qt . electric pressure cooker that I use for certain things . The biggest reason for the stove top model is , being able to take it to the sink and run cold water over it to instantly remove the pressure , add something else and pressurize it again .
4 #### Easy to hold and use , could be a little heavier , but works fine . Used it on some chicken breasts and they came out well .
5 #### Filters were just what I needed . Original one lasted a long time so I expect the three I purchased should get me through years of cleaning .
5 #### My friend was happy that I got him this tool , a great addition to any tool box .
3 #### but it shears off it 's teeth too rapidly and becomes a jagged wiggling wobbly weirdo tool that disappoints . They meant well but did n't deliver in tool steel - strength department and maybe that 's why they give a 3 - blade pack cause you 're going to need lots of these suckers to finish the task . They do n't like to strike even the smallest nails and this needs to be corrected as the Fein tool is specifically designed for blind incision work and will ultimately strike buried objects of varying hardness . Keep trying guys ........... I'll be patient .
5 #### 3 keys came in genuine Briggs & Stratton packaging . Perfect fit in my Craftsman self - propelled mower with the 6.75 Briggs engine . Well pleased . If your mower is running bad , inconsistent , or not at all AND you recently hit a tree root ... it 's probably this key that has sheared . It protects the internal engine parts from damage . There are videos on you tube that will show you the easy ways to change it .
4 #### Works exactly as advertised . I suggest that you ignore the installation instruction that have you aligning the paper template to the second rung . Align the template to the first rung and you wo n't need to cut the ladder and will gain some additional height . The mfg has you cutting the ladder so they can remain in compliance with the original ladders length , no other reason . Other than this change be very precise and accurate with the install markings and drilling . Tolerances are tight and unforgiving . Use a tiny drill bit to start with a solid dent with a center punch , then graduate sizes till you obtain the correct hole size . Mine is now installed ( after a bit of head scratching over the instructions ) and I only wish someone had explained what I learned about the second rung vs first rung before my install . Hope this helps and best of luck with the install .
4 #### I did get a package of 3 wands , but when all 3 are put together they are about the same total length of the 2 wands that came with my shop vac . Not a major issue , and might even come in handy when vacuuming in tight spaces , but the product description never actually mentions how long each wand is . I had thought I would be getting 3 " regular length " wands . However , they seem well made and will give me the same overall ability I had with the original pair of wands .
5 #### You can put more torque on these screwdrivers than most any other screwdriver . That quality alone makes them worth the price .
5 #### Great time saver . Why wait a week for your soil tests to come back from the State Extension Office ? You get all the info you need right here , and you get it in minutes , not weeks . I highly recommend .
5 #### For the price they work great . No leaks , good water flow and easy to turn off & on .
3 #### It 's ok now . Was way too big when I first tried putting it on . Did n't know you had to shrink it first . Googled to find out how to shrink it .
2 #### I liked the packaging but it is not exactly 90 degrees . Since I am architecture student , I can not miss even 1 degree . I liked the weight . Heavy and strung .
3 #### I 've been very happy with my Wiss left cut M1 ( red handle ) , which has served me well for years . There have been times when I needed a right cut , but managed to make the left cut M1 work . Finally I figured I should have the correct tool ... to make the task easier . My search for a right cut snips found these . The pros : + Good product reviews . + Priced right & the shipping was free . + Good quality tool . + Does a pretty good job of cutting straight & slightly to the left or to the right . The cons : - Actually designed for straight cuts , so it can only cut slightly to the left or to the right . Closing thoughts : Looking back , I bought these thinking I 'd have the best of both worlds ... a left , straight & right cutting snips ! I was wrong , as these are designed for straight cuts , but can cut slightly to the left & sightly to the right . For tight left or right cuts , you need a Wiss red handle M1 ( left ) or a Wiss green handle M2 ( right ) . I have since purchased a Wiss green handle M2 . Now I have all 3 , so I 'm ready for anything ! :) Here 's a link to the Wiss right cut M2 ( green handle ) that I purchased:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Wiss - M2R - MetalMaster-1 - 3 - 8 - Inch - Cut - Capacity-9 - 3 - 4 - Inch - Straight - and - Right - Cut - Compound - Action - Snip / dp / B00002N5KP / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Wiss M2R MetalMaster 1 - 3/8 - Inch Cut Capacity 9 3/4 - Inch Straight and Right Cut Compound Action Snip</a >
5 #### I recently visited a relative lacking in sharp kitchen utensils ; cooking there was difficult . I thought of the one tool I use most in my kitchen and it was my 10 year old ZJA Kitchen Shears . Never had to be be sharpened and still my go - to for cutting up raw / whole cooked chickens , trimming fat / cutting - cubing along the muscle line on all protein pieces , trimming produce , etc , etc . Sent it to him and he 's amazed . I try to use them only as a kitchen utensil . I have less expensive Fiskars , garden shears , box knives , etc . for other cutting tasks . Usually hand wash but dishwasher occasionally .
5 #### I could not believe how well this chain cuts and takes large bites . It cuts through logs twice as fast as the factory chain , taking larger bites out of the wood . I have to rev up the engine more though because it requires more power to cut more , but my Shindaiwa can handle it . I love this chain .
5 #### Sturdy and useful for many things other than just spreading icing on a cake .
5 #### I installed two of these sets at my mountain vacation home , one on the front roof and one on the back . Installation was straight forward they are working well . I would buy again .
5 #### Looker all over for the right belt replacement for my upright vac . This is the correct model so I ordered them . Free shipping as long as 3 or more were ordered . Not bad on that note . The only bad is the rubber is smelly China dog doo rubber . Those that know what the smells like also know the product has been sent to us on a boat instead of produced in the USA . I did n't expect USA made but it sure irritates me rubber from China needs to fill this order .
4 #### The older Raintrains had metal gears and were very tough . Knowing that these newer ones have plastic gear sets should be a hint to the user to be very careful with them . Do n't push or pull the train while the gears are engaged ( not set to " neutral " ) . I now have 3 of these trains and there are some keys to making them work on sloped ground ( which is all I have ) . 1 . Always run them downhill , not uphill . The wheels can dig into the dirt and then it will " high center " the rear axle , making it stay stationary . 2 . If there are holes or soft areas in the irrigated area , avoid running your hose ( the train follows the hose path ) over these areas as the train will either tip over sideways or get stuck . 3 . To adjust ground speed , adjust wands so they do not spray straight up . angle them up at a 45^ angle to the ground . This will increase ground speed and quicken the cycle although relative water output to the irrigated area will decrease accordingly . All in all these do quite well . If you have a level lawn , they should work great . If you have slopes , read the tips above .
1 #### How do so many people post reviews for seeds that are certifiably NOT organic ? . Todds is simply a slick bulk re - packer of seeds , and there is no chain of title with the seeds . Here is a sad example of someone throwing out a claim of Organic for the sake of profit , when the few smart ones that noticed no USDA certification on the bags answered posted questions . I suspect these could be from that poisoned earth of China , and none of you will ever be able to discover the truth unless you go dumpster diving at their re - pack factory . Best avoided until a chain of title can be posted with full certification . But it will not happen , as they simply buy whatever the market has at the lowest price .
5 #### What can I say , they do what they 're supposed to do .
5 #### Works pretty good . I would recommend it to a friend .
5 #### Working very well - the complex part was connecting the pipes to the valves - compatibility of threads and the need to use adapters between the various pipes is confusing . Fortunately , rainbird valve uses standard threading ! ! Too early for me to comment about long term reliability over winter season - i have installed it a month back , and the valve appears to be well - built . I am using 2 of these valves with rainmachine mini-8 controller .
5 #### 2 wonderful men in my life hate onions . I do n't know if you know this but onions add a lot of wonderful flavor without anyone having to notice they 're there . You know how I hide onions ? I puree them in this machine . Add them to the food and no one is the wiser . This also works for celery , garlic , and carrots . I read the previous reviews about people saying it broke right away ? Not mine . I use it all the time and is still going strong .
5 #### This thing is a horse ! I put it together and hung it all by my 67 - year - old self but it would be a lot easier with another person helping . Very heavy and very solidly built . It 's rustic with the various pieces having natural cracks and rough spots so Martha Stewart probably would n't be interested but I love it and everyone who has visited my porch has commented favorably . I love the solid wood uprights , which are so much nicer than holding onto a chain . The swing holds a whole generation of grandkids . The directions were , uhm , minimal to say the least but it goes together intuitively . It has the heft and hardware of something that will last until those grandkids have kids .
3 #### vacuum works well , but charger does not work . luckily I had another unit which I use to charge the batteries in . Came with 2 batteries so it works out .
5 #### my favorite axe in the collection , brag to all my friends at camp about it every time .
5 #### It was a little more involved to put together than some of the all metal ones , but works great and is well worth it in the end .
3 #### I 'm returning item , I did n't like it , opening was n't big enough and when you opened it up , your hand span would not fit .
5 #### Works great . Very simple to set up . Began catching stuff as soon as we turned it on .
5 #### These filters seem to be the best compromise between price , filtration and airflow . They will filter the smoke smell from the air which is a plus .
5 #### time owned this product ? 15 Months Reliable ? yes use it sparingly ? yes pick the time 2 use it because it can run out of capsules quite QUICKLY will buy again ? yes great for Soil ? yes REAL AMAZON COSTUMER 100 % < ------
5 #### Love love love . So easy and so easy to clean
5 #### Will fit a Vacmaster VBV1210 if you remove the bottom latch . Works well keeps the dust in the vaccum !
3 #### Great product EXCEPT if the power goes out , so does the timer 's output setting , and you 'll have to manually reset the number of hrs the unit remains on after dusk . Bad design .
5 #### these are so cute ! And great for corn on the cob . No burnt or buttery fingers thanks to these holders !
5 #### I get up a lot at night with insomnia , and this little thing puts out enough light to get me where I want to be without waking up my husband .
5 #### I love this cake pan . I can now bake a cake that does n't stick to the pan . My cakes have been absolutely beautiful . I recommend this product and will purchase again .
5 #### Great user friendly timer that is heavy duty and handles the weather !
4 #### I really happy with the product . I mixed it with my soil and I noticed a big difference . I well be purchasing more
5 #### Easy to handle but seems a little light . Maybe it 's just good balance . Splits small tree sections well .
3 #### I ordered this because I wanted a brand name UL rated 3 plug adapter with a smooth look . I did n't want one with the ledge or bumps on top but unfortunately the new design is very blocky with the overhanging ledge .
5 #### Edited : added pictures Do not buy ! it 's either black magic or voodoo ! It 's not that 's it 's not working , it 's just that I like to have the best garden around and being able to brag about it . So , please do not buy if you are living in a 50 miles radius of Boston . For the others , living far , far away ... A picture is worth a thousand words , hence below you 'll see Parsnips , Cabbage and Kale . As a reminder , this picture ( Parsnip ) was taken on May 7th 2015 in Massachusetts . -- We just had one of the worst winter on record with ~110 effing inches of snow -- The backyard was still covered with snow on March 28 . -- Everything is about 4 to 5 weeks late . -- I have planted parsnips for the past 5 years , and never had such a results so early , even with much better weather condition . -- I have tried a lot of type of fertilizers , manure , soil amendments , etc So , take a look and decide for yourself . As for myself , I have not only purchased this product , but I am also starting my own worm farm . Nota Bene : This parsnip was started last September , it 's NOT seeds planted in 2015 . I overwinter it . Nevertheless , for the past 4 years , it has been , at best , half the size . I simply sprinkled worms castings as soon as the soil had thawed . Picture added : Kale + Green Cabbage
5 #### I did n't realize how limited my bandsaw was by being tucked in a corner of my shop - now that I have it on this base I find myself wheeling it out often to handle larger stock I would have otherwise used a combination of a table and jigsaw for . The stand went together easily and functions well .
3 #### Once put together it works just fine . However , putting it together was a whole different story . The instructions lack , and are less than accurate . Once I realized my error it became pretty simple , but the damn thing literally took 4 - 5 hours of staring at it to figure out . Actual assembly time was like 20 minutes . I will never see this product sitting in my shed without it reminding me just had mad It had me putting it together . Sad thing is , it was n't complicated , just unclear instructions easily interpreted the wrong way . We live in an age where diy videos prevail . I would highly suggest a 5 minute video be available for assembly .
5 #### This has worked well , is sharp and does n't have the food clog the opening .
5 #### Works great and cleans up easily . Allows us to make homemade fries easily at home .
5 #### I 'm posting the same review as others have . I 've used the name brand $ 100 sanders ... but I might use this once a week in my commercial shop where we do light fabrication and repairs . I sand everything from wood to metal to fiberglass . This does it all . Yes it does n't have speed control but for $ 25 - 30 that amazon sells it for .... its just as good as the dewalt and porters ... honestly I think its the same motor . This is great for the occational professional needing to sand and a MUST have for the DIY'er who does n't want to spend $ 100 . I love to spend money on tools , and I usually buy the best reviewed tool .... and this sander deserves 7 out of 5 stars , especially for price .... buy the way - buy the multipack of the MIRKA sanding disks .... very well priced and very good quality - and you get a little of everything ! ! !
5 #### Runs a water pump for a fountain ... does EXACTLY what its supposed to do . and no issues ...
5 #### Excellent hose for my Makita Big Bore 2.0 hp air compressor . Pair it with a good set of interconnects and you 're good to go . Proud to purchase American made .
5 #### These OXO kitchen tools have proven to be amazing ! I have yet to find anything that compares . This can opener is so smooth to operate and just wo n't fail . As for quality , it has n't rusted or shown any defects in almost two years of use . This includes throwing it in the dishwasher ! The handle is large , easy to grip and turns without effort . I was so impressed , I have a cart full of their products ready to buy when I move into my new house . Not only has this piece performed flawlessly , but the entire set I received has too . I can only imagine how well the rest of their products will serve me . Whether for yourself or a gift ( or both ) , OXO wo n't disappoint !
3 #### They seem to work . For the price i should catch enough to clean the county .
4 #### These work pretty good . My wife likes them because she does n't have to exert as much pressure to cut through . I mostly use the regular anvil .
5 #### Being in South Florida , we have mosquitoes year round . This formula of Bt is great to throw into bromeliads , pond , birdbaths , and other places in the landscape where mosquitoes may find that teaspoon of water they need to lay their eggs in . These make it so much easier to use than the mosquito dunks which are the larger blocks .
5 #### Sure beats my old 8 pound splitting maul . I bought this because I kept breaking wooden handles on my splitting maul and got tired of replacing them . The x27 is much lighter and seems to work just as well . I like the tang on the end of the handle it gives me a little more leverage and no chance of slippage out of my hands . I 'm 5'9 " and I would n't want any shorter handle than the 36 inch . Its a little pricy but I think it will pay for itself in the long run by my not having to replace wooden handles every year or so .
5 #### This really does kill rats . That said I have to admit that if I had written the review when I first bought it I would probably have gone with a one star . You need to be patient , rodents are very sneaky and will stay away from new things in their area . I have used peanut butter placed on the plastic lids from milk gallon containers and also dog food . I put it in , in three sections . One all the way at the end , one about half way and one close to the entrance . I also wear rubber gloves when handling the bait as that helps keep the human scent away . Mine is in the back yard against the foundation of the house . Due to owning a dog this is the best product for me .
5 #### This is a quality product . Quite heavy and I would recommend it to someone else . Not disappointed with the product and will probably use it quite often . We eat salads everyday and it makes it a lot easier to begin with dry ingredients so that the dressing is not watered down . Very satisfied and it would make an excellent gift .
2 #### OK , for starters , it 's strange for me to have an appliance that you can not easily clean . You can wipe it clean , but immersion is out of the question , and even though I have treated this appliance with the utmost of care , it gets real hot and smokes ( in a scary way ) every time I make popcorn . I 'm waiting for it to spontaneously combust so I can toss it and get a popcorn machine that is n't quite so daring . The popcorn tastes better than if you air pop , but the machine makes loud grindy squeaks as the arm turns , and again , the smoking is just too obvious to overlook .
5 #### If you want the best ; it 's Stabila . I was at a woodworkers show and the guy at the Stabila booth was demonstrating the quailty of their levels by sliding a level across the floor and crashing it into a cement wall . It still worked perfect . When it comes to levels ; why would you want anything less than the best . Afterall , if you ca n't trust the level , then it 's just a piece of junk . I own 5 Stabila levels ( digital , door frame , long and short ) and I love them all . Best level made ...... period ! ! ! !
3 #### Twisty cap actuation . AAA battery . Tiny size . The Maglite Solitaire is ok , but considering the technology available , why have they not gone to LED yet ? For just a few dollars more you can get a light 10x better . The Mag works and you can focus the beam , which is very nice . But the overall brightness is lacking . 3 stars , worth the $ 6 or so I paid , but I 'll spend a little more to get a lot more next time .
1 #### I have ordered this twice once I returned for another because it was leaking . Just got the replacement and the envelope almost feel apart and my top got all wet because it was leaking again . Not happy not returning and not ordering again
5 #### Love it , works great for touch ups on grout for bathrooms floors .
5 #### Alright it 's a router bit . And from all the Freud bits I 've used before it works very well . Really it 's only as good as what you do with it , so that 's gon na be your issue . Think about this thing , you are n't slot cutting , you are basically making molding . For my application I 'm making some 8 " baseboard that are pretty spot on to what is in my house now . So I have 8 " by 8 ' boards .... free handing this is somewhere near impossible . I made a guide , but that 's iffy at best , and I do n't have room for the needed 18 feet or so to use a router table . Right now I 'm building what amounts to a horizontal track router . It should work and only take up about 9 ' of space . If you have the space for a table and the needed in / out feed tables it 'll do it 's job well .
5 #### I could n't find anything like this in town , and was happy to find it in my usual go - to place , Amazon . Perfect and just what I wanted . Very well made .
4 #### I have had excellent luck with all of the Gilmour products I have purchased . This one comes exactly as shown and carries the tried and true , Gilmour brass mechanics . The unit is a comfortable size and easy to hold . Pressure builds quickly ( only 10 - 15 pumps needed ) and the adjustable spray pattern and directional nozzle are a plus . My only complaint lies in the handle ; it feels a bit flimsy compared to the rest of the unit . I have n't had any issues with it to affect performance , but wish the handle had a bit more structure to it . In the end , this gets the job done , and does it well . I used it for a natural weed killer , but you can use it for insect treatments , or pre - treating with various cleaners on siding , windows , wheels , tires , and so on .
3 #### The zipper on this Toro product , just like the original Toro bag and the other 4 replacement bags I purchased , usually fail within a season . They fail so reliably that they ought to come in packs of three to service the Toro blower / vac through one year and into the next . More expensive replacement bags come with the plastic attachment tube for a third more dollars . SO , do n't throw away the plastic attachment tube of the broken bag because you have to use it on the new cloth bag . My original plastic attachment tube has n't worn out and the tube just slips in the replacement bag . You just tighten a zip tie already installed . However cheaply it 's made , it 's less expensive than buying a new Toro blower / vac each season . The red machine has lasted me for four years ( 5 bags ) and it 's just now starting to have problems with a switch .
5 #### Nice size capacity , removes most of the water leaving the salad nice and crisp . Can also put in sliced tomatoes and spin to remove seeds . If you spin it too fast it does wobble a bit , but it 's not necessary to spin it that fast anyway . The rubber ( silicone ) ring on the bottom , helps it stay in place and it does not walk around the counters while being used . Note that if you 're letting your hamsters use this as an exercise wheel , you should not put on the top and spin them . They get dizzy and do n't like it at all . Cat 's however do enjoy sitting in the bowl if left in an accessible place without the lid . This is not to be used on animals . No animal testing was performed at my house . Spinner cleans up easily , dry upside down and reassemble when finished .
4 #### These things work , but boy do the STINK ! I guess that 's why they are so effective .
5 #### The exact OEM parts to fit my ca . 1998 Delta 2 - handled faucets , which still had their original parts . Compared side - by - side , the new and old parts are identical in size and shape . I noticed a lot of other listings ( for this part ) with reviewers complaining about getting non - Delta parts . This kit ( sold by seller Plumbing Overstock ) arrived in Delta packaging , and has " Delta " stamped in tiny letters inside the rubber " seat " . Cheap and authentic . Recommended .
4 #### A little clunky but serviceable . I 'm hoping that the marking survive the dishwasher . I 'll try to get back and add another updated review after I 've used them for a while . June 2017 : I guess it 's time for an update and I 'm kicking my review up to five stars . These are used at least several times per week and go through the dishwasher every time . No loss of markings and they still look great !
5 #### This thin is amazing . It has taken my outdoor BBQ to a whole new level allowing me to make side dishes and broils with my meals .
4 #### After several failed attempts I 've found that I ca n't sprout seeds in Florida during the summer . Even while air - conditioned to 78 the temperature and humidity must still be too high for the seeds not to spoil during the sprouting process . I 'll have to try again in the winter when we have humidity under 70 % and temperatures in the 70 's . Now that it 's winter in Florida , the seeds are sprouting and not rotting like they were during the summer . I soak the seeds 10 - 12 hours after storing them in the refrigerator for six months and over 90 % of them are sprouting . Pleased to know I can grow sprouts in Florida from November to April .
5 #### Got this to use for cleaning out behind my trash compacter where I ca n't reach ! ! !
5 #### My lock malfunction and could n't open the door . Removed the door knob and found out the latch was broken . Did n't want to replace new door knobs and recut keys . Got this latch and now door is working like new .
5 #### You do n't realize how nice it is to have fresh blades until you replace them ... now the wood passes through faster , quieter and smoother and with 2 - sided you can flip them when done . Be advised , these are not carbide tungsten or anything crazy , they 'll dull a bit after passing wood for 15 - 20 minutes if the wood is hard so best to think of these like disposible razors : great for a while but know when it 's time to move along .
5 #### ITS PERFECT ! I HAD TO BUY THIS ONE SINCE MY OTHER TEA INFUSER WAS CRAP . IT HOLDS ALL THE HERBAL TEA LEAVES AND I DONT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DRINKING LEAVES WITH MY TEA .
4 #### This grill topper is really good ! I can grill sliced veges , shrimp , items that can easily slip into the gas burners . I love to grill sliced veges with a marinade and I was having trouble keeping them on top of the grill . Since I 've been using this grill it is so easy . I gave the grill a 4 star rating rather than 5 stars because after using , the grill topper blackens . Even after scrubbing , the original silver color does not come back . However , the grill still does the same good job ! I recommend it .
5 #### This is a fantastic , easy to use , easy to clean maker that my 16 year old is now addicted to . He loves his popcorn , and swears he 'll never miss the microwave crap he used to make . Just spoon in the coconut oil ( another added health benefit ) and spoon or pour in the kernels , put the big cover on ( without the smaller black cap ... leave that off so the steam does n't make the popcorn stale ) , plug it in and in just a few minutes , you 'll have a big , fluffy batch of popcorn to sprinkle salt on . If you like it buttered , I suggest melting butter in a small dessert dish in the microwave and pouring it over the batch before salting . Enjoy the movie !
5 #### I have been buying belts from a different manafacture that have been breaking with every use . I decided to get Hoover belts . These have worked for at least 2 months now with no sign of breakage . I was about to throw away a good vacuum but do n't have to now since it was the belts .
3 #### Filters are good but they come with a retaining band that seems too small .
5 #### If you have the shop vac , these are the bags you need . Frankly , those three - in - a - package units are a nuisance . Please , Mister Shop - Vac , package some a dozen at a time for those of us who use our Shop - Vacs for almost everything .
5 #### The tea kettle is more expensive than most but it was worth the cost to me . It is well made . The top is easy to open but it seals tightly . It comes with a hot pad holder for the handle , but I never use it because the handle has never gotten hot . Every time I boil water , the whistle makes me smile . The whistle is loud and sounds like a harmonica .
5 #### Have you ever seen such a marvelously flexible shaft ? Makes getting into those " hard to reach " areas as easy as a prom date . I 'm sure there are more puns to go with this flexible shaft , but you 'll have to come up with those on your own .
5 #### Great variety pack to start out with . I bought this along with my DEWALT Reciprocating Saw . ( DEWALT Bare - Tool DCS380B 20 - Volt MAX Li - Ion Reciprocating Saw ( Tool Only , No Battery ) )
1 #### Love the convenience and how easy it is to connect and change hoses and sprinklers . But have n't had these even a year , used very lightly , and the connectors all have developed leaks and spray water all over when under pressure . Not surprising since they are all plastic , but I sure do n't want to have to be constantly buying new ones all the time as easily as these break . Will be looking for a similar system that holds up to use a bit better .
5 #### this light made my green pond clear as could be !
5 #### No complaints here . Bought these to go with freeman 3 in 1 flooring nailer I bought for a home project . Worked great . Nails were in perfect condition in the box .
2 #### This tapes lock mech held better but still a bit too large in my small hand . ergonomically the Komelons feel better .
5 #### This is the best purchase I 've ever made , it makes excellent coffee ! I will be buying the 3 cup version soon for guests , but the single version is great when you just want a single espresso .
1 #### We used the same old Stir Crazy popper for years and years and it made the best popcorn ever . When it finally gave up the ghost we did n't hesitate to buy another Stir Crazy , even though several reviews warned that the new Stir Crazy 's do n't hold up . They were so right ! We got our new popper on January 28 . We 've used it less than a dozen times ? Tonight it quit working ... and the 90 day warranty expired 5 days ago . We wo n't make the same mistake twice . No more Stir Crazy 's for us ! ! ! We DO NOT recommend this popper to anyone ! They do n't make 'em like they used to !
5 #### Good Grips is good stuff , this simple $ 5 brush does n't disappoint !
5 #### Great product for herbs and loose tea . IT works well while hanging over a pot .
3 #### I could swear I posted a review for this item the other day , but it 's not showing up , so here goes again . I already have several bee houses purchased over the course of several years from various places . My hard - working solitary bees were running out of space so I decided to pick up some more blocks for them . All of the other blocks are solid wood so I was surprised when this one arrived and it 's layered , pieced wood for the depth . It also seems to be a much softer wood than my other bee houses are made from . The bees were happy to have more space , but I do n't expect this bee house to hold up as well as the others have . Even though I have my bee houses off the ground in a somewhat sheltered location , they are subject to moisture and temperature fluctuations . My purchase arrived quickly and is being used , but is not the quality I expected .
2 #### Burns in the bottom easily ....... too much work after cooking due to all the scrubbing I had to do to remove the black burns
5 #### Work fine in landscape lighting for 1/3 the cost of " name brand " bulbs . Durability to be determined .
3 #### I have used these for a few years . They are sturdy and do not deflect all that much even with abusive projects like fencing . The big negatives are : 1 . Hard to adjust due to choice of screws on the base that hold them in place . For some reason , these screws are not knobs or thumb screws . Instead , they are big screws that require a tool to turn . Why ? This is the sort of thing that begs for a knob or at least a thumbscrew . 2 . This works in conjunction with a length stop attachment . Because thee is clumsiness in setting up this units ' support extension , there are issues that are caused on the length stop , too . It all works OK , but it is slower , stickier and more frustrating than it could have been . In any case , if you need / want something like this for the DW , this is your choice and at least it wo n't break .
5 #### Good fit in my 6 gal , 3.0 HP Shop Vac ( the old style blue and grey one on casters . ) I have used this to vacuum the fine ashes from my fireplace , and to clean up after cutting gypsum board or sanding wall patches . Very pleased with its performance . And DELIGHTED that , with free shipping , it was priced less than what is available in the local home improvement store .
4 #### Nice bright reading light What more can I say ? It makes the pages look at night Like they do during the day .
1 #### Was advertised as fitting my dewalt planar so I bought it so I could hook my vacuum system to my planar . Long story short , it does not fit the planar exhaust . It 's also way overpriced for a piece of molded plastic . Save yourself the money and avoid this .
2 #### I kinda wish I had n't bought it . I do n't use it much and it takes up valuable kitchen space . ooops .
5 #### Best knife sharpener available . I had the same model for over 20 years . This new one is even better .
5 #### It was a good value for the price and works well . It was a little heavier than what I expected . '
5 #### Very sharp blade with a very stable tip . I 've used it to cut through golf club grips and short carpet . I did n't do a lot of cutting of carpet but my first blade is still sharp .
2 #### I purchased this in May 2011 . One year later and I 'm back on Amazon looking for a new nozzle . Only used this mainly on weekends during summer months , so to say it lasted a year is actually being generous ... probably only got about 4 or 5 months out of it and even that was light use . I bought it because I liked the idea of several different spray types . The nozzle worked well in the beginning , though it had a cheap feel to it and I knew it would n't last many years . After a few uses I noticed that the trigger would stick and not turn off so I would have to pull it to get it to stop . Then the trigger started coming loose and cracking ... just kept getting worse until the trigger snapped off . I would not purchase this again and do not recommend it .
5 #### It 's a great Wok , but I got it per online recommendations for a charcoal pan for my Brinkman Smoker . It fits perfect . I did use it as a wok once , and it cooked my veggies great .
3 #### Smaller than I thought for the tines size and tines too far apart for getting weeds out well , but does the job . Really needs another foot or more to the handle , still hard on the back bending .
5 #### Love it . No rubber smell that some other reviewers have mentioned . No complaints . Works great . Storage is brilliant . Fantastic price . Would buy it again without hesitation .
4 #### What can I say - it 's a paint mixer . From the looks of it , it will do just fine . The only thing annoying is the Amazon product description says / said " Origin : USA " . The product label says " Made in China " . Since I chose this product specifically because of the Made in USA I 'm slightly peeved .
5 #### These are one of my favorite sprouts . Try using the Easy Sprout Sprouter . You can sprout a half cup of seeds at one time with almost no waste and no rinsing .
5 #### This is great ! I love that it can collapse for easy storage . Super product .
2 #### quite snug for a size large , but still wearable . very little material to cover your wrist
5 #### This is a beautiful windchime with a wonderfully relaxing sound . Very peacful to sit on the patio and hear the chimes when the wind blows even slightly . Ca n't go wrong with this chime .
5 #### I just ordered 2 more bags of this as my squirrel loves it .
3 #### Ca n't judge how well it worked but i do know it did n't hurt
2 #### I suspect it is a decent price for the quality and size of this tarp . It seems waterproof and feels very lightweight , too . The grommets are aluminum and about every 36 inches . This is a real weak point . If you put a light cord or rope through one , and try to pull with any amount of force , many of the grommets will rip the tarp around them . So far , none completely have released , but there are rips already ( one day . ) I 'm just hoping it survives for at least 4 months , but I bet it will be close . The brown is much lighter than the photo , too . It 's like heavily creamed coffee color . Also , though it is " reversible " if you have the green side facing out , there is a strip / band of the brown around the entire perimeter . so really , one side is all brown , and the other is green with a brown stripe around the edge . This might matter to some , I guess . Also , a good portion of one edge is mfr defect ( like it 's pressed onto itself ) but in my case it is not visible or affecting tarp 's performance . just know these are real cheapo , but better than anything I could find locally in this size ( 20x30 . ) .
5 #### love watching the hummers come right up on the porch to the window and use this item- we can see them from inside- keep it clean-
5 #### I do n't agree with people claiming its odorless but it does work ! Its better than anything I ve ever tried before . Kept it by the balcony door this summer and was mosquito free for the most part . Wish I d found this earlier .
5 #### Got for my Granddaughter who does nt need a good Quality Wisk ? ? ? She Loves it
5 #### Great product . But now , maybe , the dial - in model is newer and easier if it produces as good a cut as SD 508 ? ? ?
5 #### Easy way to save money on electric . Set it for several different times for 7 days or week days and then different for weekends . I have mine set to come on an hour before we get up and then off all day . Comes back on in the evening for 3 hours and then off all night ... have never run out of Hot Water yet ... I have installed one of these at every home I have owned ... it is a money saver for sure ... you are not reheating water over and over when you are not home or not using it . Very easy override button if you find you are doing something that requires more hot water ... the timer will fall back into sequence on it 's own not need to do anything else .
5 #### Very , very nice pressure cooker . I really like the design of this cooker , after all , who wants something grotesque in your kitchen ? It is also a great pressure cooker . Easy to clean and easy to lock up to get your meal started . If you 've ever watch a cooking show and see a chef fuss with getting their cooker working properly , it was n't a Kuhn Rikon . It 's full - proof . Pressure valve is no fuss and practically intuitive ( like pull it up and down to make sure it 's free moving ) . There 's nothing to do but keep it clean and if you have to take it apart , it 's simple ( I 'm a guy , so I wanted to see it 's ' guts ' ) . Expensive , yes , but I 'd gladly spend the money again for another .
4 #### Yup , it works . I had the same ice thawer for years but this winter it had failed . My biggest problem is the ( very ) short cord . It means the device ( and the plug ) can slip beneath the surface of our fountain . IMHO , it should be about 30 " long .
5 #### This is a heavy gauge stainless steel pot ! The gaskets are thick and sturdy . It has a lid locking mechanism that is a great safety feature ! It is a roomy 6 quart pot . I highly recommend this pressure cooker !
4 #### This plug is good quality , and does the job . I have had no problems with Leviton products . I expect this to last for years .
4 #### Well if you are going to spend your hard earned money purchasing wood chips online , these are as good as any .
5 #### The lip on these bowls makes it easy to flip a bowl of the same size over and grip together so you can shake loose garlic cloves ( if you have n't seen this done utube it and it will change your cooking life ) and for spreading spice evenly over veggies or dressing even over kale . Also holds up well . I own three sizes . Holds a chill very well . No logo on bottom so it 's smooth . I use these daily .
5 #### I think it died after about a year , but she had fun making it beep and giving everyone a headache on the beach . I have no idea if she found anything but it kept her occupied for a very long time .
5 #### What was advertised as an Oregon chain in a plastic container turned out to be a chain in a zip lock bag with a label claiming it was the advertised item . I have no complaint wit the product , just feel mislead .
4 #### Just do n't like junky kitchen gadgets . I have a Kitchenaid ice cream scoop , that I 've had for quite a few years , so I will compare the the OXO with the Kitchenaid , which I think is fair as the prices are comparable . The Kitchenaid is heavier , has a longer handle , and the scoop has a little thicker metal . The OXO has more of a pointed scoop and is thinner at the edges , making it slightly easier to scoop hard ice cream , which is nice . As of this writing , I should point out that the Kitchenaid sells for $ 11.99 while the OXO is $ 7.99 , making neither a cheap choice . Do n't get me wrong , I think the OXO is a good product , just not quite the quality of the Kitchenaid . The OXO does work well , but the shorter handle is not as convenient when scooping in the bottom of the ice cream carton . If you do decide on the OXO I doubt that you would be disappointed . Wish I had more to compare it to , but this will give you an idea of the ones I have . They are both good but I think the Kitchenaid has just a slight advantage . UPDATE : I 'm liking this scoop more and more . When ice cream is really frozen hard this scoop with the pointed end outdoes them all ! Four Stars Now
4 #### Received this a day or so ago . It shipped from China or Hong Kong . Shipping took awhile , which was fine since they were so cheap . The basket was wrapped very nicely , was alittle dented on both sides ; I figured from being shipped in a bag . There is no reason the basket will not go back to the regular shape . I have not used it yet . Bought it for my aromatherapy infusions , smaller infusions . The basket looks great , the dents are no big deal to me . I am happy with this purchase and do not see why anyone else would feel otherwise .
2 #### I was happy with the design and layout , very easy to measure . However I would not have purchased if I would have known it was plastic . Do not see that anywhere in the description . Amazon should note this .
5 #### great for the money and a must have if you purchased a new grill . i would recommend this to anyone
5 #### Very basic item but good quality and nice grippy handle . Stays in place solidly when pulled . The 16 - in is pretty long , I use it mainly for grilling and moving briquets . The tongs come together only at the tip , not the entire cupped part .
1 #### I bought this blade to upgrade the standard blade that came with my 7 1/2 " miter saw that I bought to carry around to smaller jobs . BIG mistake . Do n't know why but this blade will not cut anything without kicking back . It will even take chunks out of 2x pine . Do n't even try it on hardwood or cabinet moulding unless you 've got a suit of armor on . It 's not the saw alignment . It 's dead on . And the saw works fine with the original blade and it even works better than this with some of my worn out framing blades from my circular saws . Saw in another review where another user had this same problem with another Freud blade . This is only the second Freud I 've purchased . I bought one for my 10 " Radial Arm Saw thinking it might make it safer to rip with with the anti - kickback feature . WRONG ! ! ! The kickback I got with this blade dang near destroyed my guards and probably would have killed me if the guards had n't been up to snuff . I 'm beginning to think that the Freud anti - kickback " feature " is nothing but a dangerous sales gimmick . And I definitely wo n't be buying any more Freud blades in the near future . This one 's going back to where I got it , too .
5 #### nice heavy weight bowl ... I use it several times a week
5 #### So far I do not find anything I do n't like about this salad spinner . It seems perfect . I can cut up a whold head of lettuce and a few other things with it to fit in the basket all together and after washing and spinning it can dump the salad into the outer bowl as a serving bowl . The pump presses down easily on the top and spins it well . There is a little button on top that works as a brake if you are in a hurry and want to stop it quickly , and there is a little lock button on top also , so if you want to store it with the handle pressed down into the bowl you can lock it in place with it down and it would take up less space in a cupboard or the refrigerator .
4 #### four years ago I would have given it five stars , loved it , dead bug pilled on ground under it . four years later , $ 20 for new bulb but should have just bought a new unit . does not seem up to par as when it was new . can stand next to it and they are flying around it , but no zap . opened up and brushed the grid to clean , still nothing . will buy this brand again just because I have the extra bulb now .
2 #### The grackles , blackbirds , crows , cardinals all learned very quickly to eat the seeds . They put one foot on the dipper and the other foot in the seed hole . Therefore only half their weight is on the dipper level ..... so it does n't dip and flip them off . And the little birds were being chased away by the bigger birds . My solution was I returned the Droll Yankee Dipper Feeder and got a wide diameter cage and put my tube feeder inside this . The small birds hop in an out and eat ..... while the grackles at first would go round and round the cage trying to figure where they can get their head through and get to the seed , but to no avail as their head ca n't reach in far enough .... and they give up and pick up any ground droppings .
5 #### I needed a short water hose that was for hot water . Found it , love it ! I do n't know how durable it will be , because it is dragged over concrete floors all the time .
5 #### Good product well built - heavy duty . Good working surface ... Good finish Very stable with weight on it . Great Price ! ! Delivered On Time ! ! Very Satisfied ! !
5 #### A great kitchen product . Could n't love it more . Great quality , and perfect for all straining , washing vegetables or fruit . Could n't be happier !
5 #### We have birds who need water every day . Our Lovebirds and Zebra Finches use this kind of feeder , the larger one , because it fits in their cage , height wise . It lasts a long time . After one just was getting older for the Lovebirds , I purchased a new one , great price , and very healthy knowing every day they had fresh water and it was well protected , no seed was in it . When it gets low , I can get them fresh water . The one I purchased was for water . I 'm waiting to try the one for food . It will probably be best to use for small seed . The larger seed for the Lovebirds wo n't go through . I 'll try that later . Right now I 'm working with the water feeder
5 #### Why did n't I have a flat whisk before now ? ! Love it . Sometimes OXO grips are just too bulky for my taste , but this one does n't bother me a bit . Good quality . It has become my go - to whisk .
5 #### Have 2 of these ! So much easier to use than one with upright longer handle . Takes less force & stress to arms & shoulders . Not just for potatoes . Great to separate ground beef for sauce or chili !
5 #### I purchased this after realizing how bad microwave popcorn is for you . My kids were disappointed I was n't buying the microwave kind anymore but quickly changed their mind once I made some in this . Its delicious and tastes like movie theater popcorn ! Its also quick and easy ... even my 11 year old can make it herself ( I just have to flip it over for her cuz it does get hot ) . Clean up is a breeze ! Highly recommend this popper !
5 #### Outstanding product . Works well . Great components . High quality material . Small footprint that I can add to my keychain without adding a lot of bulk .
3 #### I love the sizes this grater has ; the larger side is just right for so many foods and I do n't cut myself as I often do if I use the four sided upright type grater . Plus this stores in such a small place . However , as many others have noted the design is poor and it eventually cracks along the sides where the plastic is just too thin to take the pressure . Using it carefully I managed to make it last for 3 or so years , but it 's finally got too many cracks to work . They now make a new one - Good Grips Two Fold Grater - which looks like a new design made to take the weight of grating . I 'm ordering that as a replacement.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/OXO - Good - Grips - Two - Fold - Grater / dp / B004VLYQHM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">OXO Good Grips Two - Fold Grater</a >
5 #### estwing hammers , the very best tools for a carpenter , framer , what have you . excellent .
5 #### I followed the recommendation of Cook 's Illustrated in buying this . The corer is so much better than the half circle corer I used growing up . Solid handle is easy to grip and gives you enough torque that it feels almost effortless to use . The hardest part is aiming the thing so it goes through the center of the apple . Also the size of the core extract is a little on the small side for the biggest apples . A little of the core is left in the apple , but for normal store sized apples it works great . Highly recommended !
5 #### I purchased this nail puller to remove sub - floor in my home . I could not be more pleased with the construction and usefulness of this tool . I love the slide hammer feature .
5 #### I could n't do upholstery projects without this tool . It 's light , small , and very simple to use . And the price is right .
5 #### I have been using this brand for 10 + yrs . Recently had some major construction done in my living room and ran the air intake throughout the work . I was amazed how much dust it collected from the air and how quickly the concrete dust was collected . Highly recommend especially with children & pets in the house .
4 #### Outstanding blade . Vary little vibration , with no or little sanding required . The slower you feed , the better the cut .
5 #### Works great and has cut down the flying insect population in my yard .
5 #### Perfect size and width for mixing smaller batches of batter . I 've bought so many whips in the past but was never satisfied because it was always to wide and clumsy or poorly made but this one is great !
5 #### Best bug zapper you can buy . This is my 3rd one in over 20 years - I buy one with every new house when I move . They do not wear out easily and are well made of substantial galvanized steel . Quality made in the USA and will zap anything . Even more effective when used with an Octenol lure .
5 #### Works awesome , never used this kind but figured it out quickly .
5 #### Never saw a miter box like this one before . The clamping mechanism works great for holding the work piece .
5 #### Works as intended . Good solid receptacle with a nice tight grip around the incoming wire . A good mate for the Leviton 000 - 515PR-000 plug . The price is fair .
5 #### These are my goto measuring tape . I have used the Stanley tapes forever as I never have problems with them , unless my kids get ahold of them and let the lip slam on the tapes base which causes the lip to break eventual .
3 #### not very sharp , had to work at it to trim blossim ends from BASIL plants in the garden
2 #### * * See my review of the N89C as well I bought a N80 and it would not drive a 3 " or a 3 1/4 " galv . spiral nail into Douglas Fir . After sending the gun in to see what was wrong with it . It was send back with nothing wrong . I took the gun , the nails , and the wood to the Bostitch distributor . They could not get it to drive the nails . Even the new one they pulled off the shelf did not do it . They gave me a N89 . The depth adjustment on the N89 is nice and it has never jambed . Changing nail sizes is much easier then the N80 . Both the N80 and the N89 double fire easily . I have listen to nails land 50 - 60 ft away on the street . The crew framing my house uses 4 Hitachi NV83 guns . Thees guns are more balanced , drive 3 1/4 " nails no problem , and I have not had a double fire yet . The Hitachi guns run 3 - 6 coils of nails a day 6 days a week in the mud and sawdust . If I ever wear my N89 out I 'll be spending the extra $ $ $ on the Hitachi .
5 #### These are the second set that we 've ordered for our daughters and by far these have been the best bottles we 've ever owned . I ca n't say much about these new set ( because they just arrived in the mail ) but I can about the other set . We 've had the other ones for nearly five months and they have survived numerous trips to amusement parks , zoos and trails with ZERO leaks . We 've owned dozens of other water bottles for our children but the majority of them tend to warp and leak ... but not these bottles . The only issue that we 've had is when we dropped one on concrete the bottle cracked . The bottles are hard plastic and not the soft type material . Overall , we 're very happy with these bottles . The price is reasonable , my girls love the designs and they DON'T leak . We highly recommend .
5 #### I use this to cut off the bottoms of existing trimwork while installing new hardwood floors that replace carpet . The carpet runs up to the bottom of the door casings , and the hardwood is thicker , so you have to cut off the bottoms . Rather than peel the things off the wall and reinstall them , just cut them in place with this guy . You can do about 95 % of them - all you need is enough room to pull the saw . I had a couple trim jobs that needed a power tool , but that was only because I could n't get the saw in and pull it because of space or obstacles . Flip over a piece of the flooring to use as a guide , saw along the top , and you 're ready to install . The results look great - a custom fit . This is about as fast and MUCH quieter than the power tool .
4 #### Works fine - it replaced a 30 + year old Broan 678 in my bathroom remodel . My only disappointment ( not with this product ) was that Broan does not make anything that is a upgrade to the plastic look of this unit . I could not replace the fan box ( no room in attic to work ) so I was stuck with just replacing the light and outside parts for the fan .
5 #### Our pond has never looked so clear with an algae kill off and refill then the addition of one of these . Thye can be dried out and re used though slightly less effective after several uses .
5 #### This is a great product to control any power item . It is a bit long to program .
5 #### We bought for making naan bread . Very pleased with results . Fit just right in oven . Would recommend or buy again .
5 #### I have not used these yet but if they work like the one in the trap now they will be great . Once the fleas on it the cann't get off .
5 #### I 'm not into fancy baking , so I was n't looking for a perfect icing knife . This one just does the job , and I 'm glad I have it in my kitchen .
3 #### This is a pretty effective deterrent against marauding squirrels who 'd otherwise dig their countless holes in my garden . Also the adjustable sensitivity is nice in case there happens to be a breeze and foliage moving around . Only concern is that the sprinkler itself is of extremely cheap construction , mostly plastic parts . Back in the day these kind of sprinklers were made completely of metal and were very durable , but this ? Also it likes to leak out the back when activated , a bit annoying when you 're trying to adjust it when you get a blast of water at crotch level . UPDATE : After just a couple of months of actual use this spring and early summer , I went to reposition the Scarecrow when the plastic screw - on ring for the hose split , rendering it useless . Props to Amazon , I contacted them asking whether it 's still under warranty and they just allowed me to return it and refunded me the purchase price .
3 #### works pretty good , but obviosuly wo n't work as well as a built in unit , but with some pools , you do n't have that choice , like the Intex Easy Set line . Does capture larger debris , but stuff like pine needle slip right through , as one you expect . Price was right at Amazon .
5 #### This is my second Henckels carving knife after the first had the tip damaged in the dishwasher after four years .
5 #### Well , it 's a can opener . It does its job well . The legs and handle are comfortable to grip and easily manipulated . The blade comes very sharp . The gears are smooth . The opener latches on well and turns with gentle pressure , smoothly and quickly . While the opener is bulkier than traditional openers , it is light ! This is a high quality kitchen tool . Well - made and worth the money .
5 #### WELL HELLO AGAIN TO ALL YOU WOOD WORKERS OUT THERE , I THOUGHT I HAD BETTER WRITE A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THESE OUTFEED TABLES FOR THE UNISAW . WELL TO START WITH I JUST ADDED ANOTHER UNISAW TO THE SHOP AND HAD TO BUY AN OUTFEED TABLE FOR IT . THE REASON I DONT BUILD MY OWN IS , I DONT HAVE TIME . ITS EASIER TO BUY ONE FOR A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS AND THEY FIT RIGHT ON . THERE 'S NO MESSING AROUND TRYING TO MAKE EVERYTHING FIT LIKE IT SHOULD . ALSO THEY ARE VERY WELL MADE . I NOW HAVE 6 UNISAWS WORKING IN THE SHOP , ALL BUT 1 HAS AN OUT FEED TABLE . THE 50IN . FENCE WITH THE RIGHT SIDE TABLE AND THE OUT FEED TABLES HAVE NEVER BEEN REPLACED ON ANY OF MY SAW 'S AND THE OLDEST IS 7 YEARS.YOU JUST CANT BEAT THE QUALITY FOR THE BUCK . AS FOR DAMAGE TO THE TABLES DURING SHIPPING , I HAVE FOUND THAT UPS WILL DAMAGE THE TABLES WHILE RPS AND FEDEX HAVE NEVER DAMAGED ONE . I FEEL THAT PEOPLE THAT GIVE THIS TABLE A 1 STAR RATING WOULD ALSO STIFF A GOOD WAITERESS BECAUSE THE FOOD WAS BAD . OH WELL EACH TO HIS OWN . EVERYONE KNOWS HOW I FEEL ABOUT THINGS , IF I DONT THINK THE PRODUCTS ARE REALLY GOOD , I DONT HAVE TIME TO SPEND WRITTING THESE REVIEWS ABOUT THEM . ANYWAY SO LONG FOR NOW , WRITE ME IF YOU NEED TO KNOW MORE AND HAPPY WOOD WORKING ............ JAMES
5 #### Great product and it miraculously delivers electricity to my power cords
5 #### Bosch makes the best jig saw blades in my mind . These in particular are perfect for ripping wood . Big teeth , and sharp . They stay sharp for a relatively long time too .
5 #### oxo , the best for sifting everything , no more squeezy hand sifters for me !
5 #### Used these on excursions across the world . Good to have especially when running water and towels are n't around . Smell is slightly off putting but not terrible . Would buy again .
4 #### Works with my DEWALT DWE575SB circular saw . I have made a few cuts with it and it works great . Wish it had been included with the saw .
5 #### Some assembly required but boy does this make fertilizer application easy . I used to have a drop spreader and endured using it until we bought more property . This thing lays down some fertilizer . Takes longer to clean it than do my acre . I do n't see why it wo n't last a lifetime . I you are up against edges all of the time you might want to get the directional plates offered . Oh yea , I just double checked , made in USA . Finally something that has some quality left in it .
5 #### Used it to build a deck . Worked flawlessly in Black Locust , which is one of the hardest domestic woods . The bit taper is perfect for drilling pilot holes which allow the screws to draw boards together tightly .
5 #### High quality Schlage passage door knob set . Ca n't go wrong .
5 #### Least amount of wood damage . Wished they would make a smaller model for smaller nails . well make like the original .
5 #### I bought this for my 895PK router mainly to make mortices . It works very well for that purpose . I especially like the micro - adjustment . I was able to get the gross position for my mortice , then use the micro - adj to sneak up on the final setting .
5 #### These cases are great ! The included frosted white plastic dividers are easy to use and easy to not use all of them . We like options . The double layer of compartments are very handy with the larger items on the bottom and the smaller items on the top . They hold together well and we have not accidentally popped them open . Everything stays organized which is why we purchased them . In fact , we bought more ...
5 #### Says everything It seals great to the sink , Can put 2 sponges in , no problem
5 #### This spatula is thin enough to slide under chocolate chip cookies without disturbing a single chip ! With other spatulas I would end up ripping up the bottoms of the cookies , but not with this one . I highly recommend this spatula .
5 #### We buy these even though they are more expensive because I have severe allergies . We change them on the first of every month and they are VERY DIRTY ! So I think they work well ! BTW my house is around 2,000 square feet .
5 #### I had a tiny brush before that had a grasping surface much smaller and shaped / colored like a potato . The garbage disposal got it a couple of times and started to eat it , so I replaced it with this . This is large enough to not want to go down the disposal , which is good . The bristles are stiff , which is good for a potato or carrot , and it 's got more of them so it scrubs a larger area faster than the stupid thing I had before . The large grip makes it easier to handle for sure .
5 #### The Victor M231 Ultimate Flea Trap Refills work great , 3 per package . You 'll be surprised !
5 #### This pool vac is small but does a great job of cleaning up the bottom of our Intex 12 ft x 30 in pool . Not sure if it would do as well for a larger pool , but I am happy with my purchase !
2 #### I 'm still getting a tons of nasty mosquito bites every single time I go to the yard after buying this . Finally i asked the local government mosquito and vector control people to come , he told us the zapper only worked for moths or beetles .
5 #### Works - wires are sealed at handle so no water enters .
3 #### Lost the effectiveness of it seal in a matter of 2 or 3 months .
4 #### Who would not need this to turn dead animals over the open flame ? Actually you should use indirect heat . That said , this unit works like a charm . I have used it twice and cooked the young fowl to perfection both times . It is pricey given the weber kettle grill is the same price . But if you need to see hunks of flesh rotating while you drink beers ; this is the unit for you .
5 #### Bakes and with " Baker 's Joy " spray comes out clean as a whistle . Will bake even the largest bundt cake as well as the smallest .
5 #### Fiscars are always great . Have used them for years and will continue to do so . Have had some of them for YEARS !
5 #### I purchased this replacement after considering other brands -- saw that the pull string types etc had mixed reviews . I have to say that the original which lasted me 8 + years until someone threw the bowl in the dishwasher , was fantastic . The only con was the fact that the dishwasher destroyed the bowl which cracked up . Guess my children might have sat on it and broken it etc also , was considering the stainless steel version , but fell in love with this versions looks , and the handy light weight feel . To describe this version , the outside bowl is clear , the inside colander and all trim are green . Very pleasant to look at vs the clinical clear , black and white looks of the original . It is beautifully designed with a non- slip base , a lock so that the pop up handle which you press down to spin can be locked down for storage , and a button to stop the spin immediately with a brake . All features identical to the old version .
5 #### I purchased these bag clips , as I was tired of those cheap bag ties that are on a loaf of bread ! These bag clips are so easy to use and work great ! I would buy them again and would recommend them !
5 #### My husband is very excited that he can give me an empty package of the items he wants , and I can find them online . These are exactly what he needed at a value price .
4 #### This is a good overall electric chain saw . I originally had a Poulan chainsaw that had its electric motor burn out after seven years of use . I purchased a replacement Poulan chainsaw , but it came DOA . Returned to Amazon . My SO then ordered this saw after some serious research . I have had it in use now for over a year & it works great . Note , however , that this is a light duty chainsaw for work around the house & is not as heavy , or as powerful as most gas powered units . Note : This saw uses Oregon 91VG56 chains . These can be purchased from Amazon , eBay , or your local hardware saw .
4 #### Here in the Vale of Doomed Attempts at Yardwork , we are suffering through 100 degree weather and also the aftereffects of a storm that knocked out power for a week and dumped tree limbs and other debris everywhere . Now that we have ( almost ) finished cleaning up , we can not help but notice that much of our lawn has died while we were cleaning up and that several of our trees look sick . ( It 's usually the sick trees that lose the limbs ) . So , once temperatures drop a bit I expect to be doing a lot of spraying to try and get things fixed up . All our old hand sprayers have died or seized up . So this backpack sprayer will be a useful adjunct to the cheapo hose end sprayer that I also use . The backpack sprayer should be less tiring than the hose end sprayer ( no heavy hose to keep lugging around ) and I should be less likely to get wet in the process . Also , my hose end sprayer always dumps stuff in my face when I try to spray up into the trees . This sprayer should avoid that problem and should be able to spray higher into the trees . If my results turn out not to meet my expectations I shall correct this review before September 1st .
4 #### Still trying to get this thing to work as it ought to . More and issue of the operator than the spinner .
4 #### The knives are great . Would have given 5 stars if they were a little sharper .
5 #### This makes beautiful bundt cakes and its an ease to take out the cake with its nonstick pan . very little butter / spray is needed .
5 #### This is a great pressure cooker . We use it every day . It 's amazing how good a roast comes out in just an hour . Most other dishes are much faster !
5 #### In fact , I have to leave top off for a bit , otherwise my tea stays too hot for over an hour . You will never have to worry about leaks .
5 #### very good whisk ! Have n't had a balloon whisk for a long time . The narrower ones really do n't work as well . Whips cream in a couple minutes ! Sturdy and with the filled handle should n't get rusty in the dish washer . Very happy
5 #### Essential attachment for your Dremel . I have used this in my jewelry making several times a week for over a year and it has never let me down . Makes fine work much easier with a pen - like grip for better control . The shaft could be longer and more flexible , but is not a big enough impediment to use to not get .
5 #### These are great ! ! ! Worked perfectly and after a few months of use and a lot of wood through these things and they 're still sharp ! ! I would definitely buy again ! You ca n't go wrong with buying Freud .
4 #### This track is very solid . It 's quite a hefty chunk of aluminum and should last practically forever . I got it along with my Board Buddies , figuring it would make moving them around a lot easier . I have n't moved my Board Buddies since I installed them on the track . I keep them close to each end of the blade so that I can feed short or long stock into the saw with no worries . It makes sense to me that one would want them to be close to the blade since that 's where you 'd need them . What this means is that I do n't really have a use for the track . I adjust the Board Buddies side - to - side all the time but not forward / backward .
4 #### I bought these for my boys to take condiments in their lunch boxes . They are perfect for caramel dip for apples , ranch for veggies , etc .. Just the right amount , spill proof and nothing to throw away . The only down side is that they are a bit difficult for the kids to remove the top by themselves . Overall , they are great !
5 #### This is the best manual can opener I have ever had . It opens cans with very little effort .
5 #### Birds love it , they spend a lot of time at our feeders .
5 #### Great light . It 's not too heavy and it 's bright . You can use 1 or both light bulbs and can still read with it . If it is n't very bright change the batteries . I 'd borrowed one before I bought it and almost thought it was n't bright enough . You can clip it on something nearby ( like the headboard ) too . Besides it 's purple ! !
5 #### I bought this for a large ( 400 sf ) room . Based on reviews that said it worked well in large rooms I ordered it . The fact that it was so small made me nervous , bc I had guests about to stay in the previously unheated room , but this little Lasko heater proved itself ! It 's super easy to figure out and works quietly . I 'm now using it in my 2 car garage to warm up the space for my dogs at night . It 's keeping the insulated garage at exactly the 60 degrees I have it set to , even though it 's 10 degrees outside . I love it !
4 #### The quality is n't as good as older pairs I have . The pivot points are not as solid , the metal finish is not as smooth , and they do n't seem as ' crisp ' as the old one . I have accumulated about 40 pairs of Vice Grips of various styles over the past 25 years or so , and side - by - side it 's very easy to tell the " new " pairs from the " old " pairs . They are still head and shoulders above the Harbor Freight brand , but the gap is narrowing . This time I bought 2 pairs of these , then went to buy a couple more pairs 2 days later , and the price had jumped by almost $ 7 !
1 #### My shop rolls on HTC products and I 've always been happy with them . I restored an old Parks planer and the footprint fit none of the dedicated bases so I opted to try one of the universal bases . Big mistake . Unlike the dedicated bases , the fixed wheels have no brake on them . THe machine rests on two small rubber pads and the wheels when " stationary " and that does not work out well . The base is prone to movement as there is insufficient locking mechanisms- if this base had brakes it would be a nice option for odd pieces of machinery .
5 #### This is made by the Stanley Company ; a company that has a reputation of making & selling high quality hand tools . You will be hard pressed to find hand tools that are as good as Stanley yet within a reasonable price the average consumer can afford . This is my 2nd purchase of this type of knife , both are made by Stanley & will last many years . Basically I put my Stanley knives through * cough , cough * and have yet to ever have a problem with them . They are very well made , very cost effective , & most importantly , very easy to use . I highly recommend this knife & any other hand tools made by Stanley .
5 #### Use several of these around the property . I add a gear drive stake into the ground sprinkler head to water .
5 #### Hubby had me order this for him because he was tired of standing outside watering with the sprinkler hose nozzle thingy . He is absolutely ecstatic to have this . It seems to work exactly how he expected / needed & wanted it to . It has two tubes that the water comes out of & depending on how much water you want going through it there is either a good high spray of water or of course a little amount . It has made his watering chore a lot easier . He would definitely recommend it . * I paid FULL PRICE for this item and I am under no obligation to leave a review , positive or negative *
5 #### Solid strainer . Practical size -- can rinse / drain a half - pound of rice or pasta or more . Front tab allows me to span the sink . Fine mesh is easy to clean -- but you need to rinse it before food dries in it .
5 #### This is the best tool bag I have ever had . I use for my welding equipment and in this tool bag I can put all what is needed . I put in it a welding helmet , a purifing air system , welding gloves and other accessories for welding . With this tool bag I have resolved a great problem . Before I needed two or even three bags but now I just need this one !
4 #### A Home - Ec teacher suggested this as a reliable and affordable brand . I 'm very happy with my new sharp knife ! Cutting is safer and more enjoyable . It 's a very stable knife that feels solid in the hand . I do n't live the handle material completely , which is why I did n't give it five stars . It 's made of some kind of plastic or resin that is slippery if your hands are oily .
5 #### I always keep a Mini Maglite handy . One in the glove compartment of my vehicles , one on the night stand and the toolboxes . You never know when you might need a flashlight and these are handy and reliable . This accessory kit may have been a whim but I have no regrets .
5 #### excellent sturdy bag for yard cleanup , folds back flat for storage .
5 #### No issues here . Got a great deal buying this versus just the cutting bits ! I needed the little guide so it was a win win !
5 #### I love this hammer if I could give it 10 stars I would . I install windows for a living and use a hammer a lot . I was getting sick of my stanley fiberglass standard 16 oz curved claw hammer , i call it pinger . The stanley pings really loudly and it is very anoying . Anyway the Estwing hits a lot harder and has better comfort . Even though the Stanley has a " form fitting handle " that gives me a blisted after ten minutes . Estwing is the way to go . I may suggest that you get the 22 oz because it is the same size , cheaper and unless you frame for a living you wo n't need the little extra power the 28 oz has , . Also the 28 oz hurts your forarm a l;ittle quicker than the 22 oz .
5 #### Nice little whisk , very comfy handle as usual with OXOs .
5 #### Love the steady feel . Not like the cheap dollar store knives . Well worth the price .
5 #### Buy it and enjoy it ! Our first Stir Crazy lasted 38 years . We used it at least twice per week . The plastic lid finally cracked beyond repair , but the heating and stirring functions were still going strong . The antistick coating was still in good shape on the old unit because we made sure that the stirring wires never touched the surface . We never had a problem with them bending down , but as with any nonstick surface , it pays to make sure that it is not being damaged . We have used the new unit several times now and are very pleased with it . For best results : Do not use the butter melter built into the lid . We experimented with it several times with different recipes with bad results . Use coconut oil , it will not break down under high temperatures . Put the oil in the pan , then shut the lid and start the unit . When the oil gets good and hot , then put the popcorn in . This will prevent the first kernels being popped from being saturated in oil and coming out soggy . The stirring wires In our new unit were perfectly spaced up from the bottom of the base , but be sure you check yours before using it to prevent damage to the nonstick surface .
5 #### I used this as soon as it came in , And not disappointed at all ..
2 #### I 'm very pleased on the holder however , the suction cups do n't stay stuck . I 've tried the container both empty & full . All I put in it are my sponge ( which I hardly ever use ) , a scrubber & the sink stopper . Hardly any weight at all .
5 #### We own multiples of the 9 " and 12 " stainless steel version ( no plastic on the end ) . I purchased my first one in 1999 , and has performed flawlessly . The rubber on the handles allow you to grip them with greasy hands , and when they get hot . They can easily be locked / unlocked with one hand . I 'm a personal chef , and take these on every job . We have never had a rust problem ( or any other problem ) with these tongs . If you 're looking for a good set of tongs that wo n't fail you , these are the ticket .
4 #### Easy to hold on to . Have brushes with handles , but they do n't work as well .
5 #### Already had one , bought this as back - up and works just great . I find much easier to work with these than any snow shovel , especially those ergo metric ones . Only wish that they made one maybe 3 - 5 " wider , but then I would probably kill my back using it .
5 #### My former boss bought one of these years ago , and we hung thousands of sheets of drywall with it over the 13 years I worked for him . Now , I have my own remodeling business , so I ordered the same model . I was concerned about the quality after reading other reviews , but it arrived in great shape ! I inspected each piece as it came out of the box . Yes , there were a few " wear " spots in the paint , but no scratches or dings . A few of the parts have been redesigned , but everything worked like the older model . I 'm looking forward to assembling and using this new model . One thing : I almost threw away the crank handle with the cardboard box ! It was rolling loose on the bottom ...
4 #### Seems expensive for a nozzle but it works well . Curious to see if my price ( 16 ) stays in the title .
4 #### This thing is better quality than you will typically get in this price range . I have BBQed about 50 times in this and have never had a bad meal . My only complaints are that the outlet cord is short , so make sure you have an outdoor outlet where you need to set this up . You CANNOT use an extension cord with this thing . My second complaint is that you can not control the temp . You plug it in and it is on . The manual claims it cooks at a steady 275 degrees which is adequate for most things to come out good . I have made turkey , chicken , brisket , ribs and pork butt in this . Everything turns out good . I 've used this in summer , winter and during rain storms with success . If you 're new to BBQ , this is a good place to start . It is easier to maintain than a Weber Smokey Mountain , but the trade off is that you have to cook everything at its consistent 275 ( so no super duper slow cookin ' for you hard core BBQ buffs ) . You use CHUNK wood by placing it around the heat element ( I do not recommend using chips in this thing ) .
3 #### I bought this to go with my grill 's rotisserie for making chicken , fish , veggies , etc . It feels kind of cheap , the thumb screws are flimsy and it is hard to clean , even after spraying non - stick spray on it before use . My first use was a few chicken leg quarters but I could barely get it to closed due to the chicken sitting up to high . While cooking , it slipped around a lot , even after tightening the screws all the way down ( which felt like they were going to break ) . I guess I can use it just for veggies , if I can get it tightened down well enough . Over all , it 's okay but I wish I had bought something a little sturdier and better made .
1 #### I live in NC , so only need this device on the rare occasion when we get ice storms and freezing temperatures . The first time I used it was during our January ice and snow event -- worked beautifully , birds out there even while snowing . Second time to use was this week . Apparently it crapped out , so the water froze , cracking the birdbath . So now I am out the $ 27 I paid for this AND the birdbath . So it worked maybe a total of three days . But I got it before xmas so I suppose I ca n't return it . There was a cheaper one online , maybe I 'll try that .
5 #### A nice metal heavy duty sprayer compared to the plastic ones , you wo n't be disappointed if you order it . Oops , I bought 2 sprayers at the same time this was the plastic one and is nice too but I like the metal one better .
4 #### Was nt expecting this to perform very well but it is xlnt ! Would have given a 5 but you really have to mash down the set screw so the blade does nt slip . Purchased to restore a 60 's surfboard with a wide stringer . Reccomend this to shapers !
4 #### I 'm a scientist , so the first thing I did was to test the accuracy of these cups . I placed them on a scale and weighed how much water each one held ( 1 gram of water = 1 milliliter ) . I 'm happy to report that all of the cups held pretty close to what is stated . Since accuracy is the most important part of a measurement tool , I give it 4 stars for coming through . However , I 'm not a fan of plastic , so I 'm still going to reach for my metal cups by choice . Unless I 'm baking , in which case , a gram scale is really the only way to go .
1 #### Bleah ! The loops are too thick and inflexible to use in a skillet . It is going in the donation box .
5 #### So far so good no problems to report , worked really well all thru the summer
5 #### I have several Felco pruners for various landscaping tasks and love them all in spite of the rather high price .
5 #### Very pretty , and very well crafted . Surprisingly difficult to find a functional and aesthetically pleasing lazy susan . This one was both and also a good price . Very happy with this gift purchase !
4 #### These are great ; I own four of them now . One issue : the RH adjustment is almost always maxed - out .. and just one point off from being adjustable ; I have had each of my four 445715 hygro - thermometers calibrated in an ISO17025 lab against a really high - end RH sensor that is calibrated against a NIST standard at another ISO17025 lab . A more accurate hygrometer will cost about 10X this one ...
1 #### way too small ( thin ) . ca n't use chunk applewood as i planned . only good for " chips " or " shavings " type wood for smoking on my charcoal grill
5 #### Excellent pan . I made my Thanksgiving Dressing in this pan this year . It turned out wonderful . I plan on making a Version of Lady Bird Johnson 's Lemon Pound Cake for my daughter 's birthday this December as well ! It is well - worth the extra cost for this quality of a pan !
5 #### Needing a high quality cover for my push mower , I searched through Amazon looking at various products , and of course the reviews . After looking at the reviews , I found that the covers from Classic Accessories were the highest , so I focused there . I chose this one based on some of the features , but a couple that I did n't know about was the quick release clip and the attached storage bag until I took it out of the box . Both of these features were a +1 . Over the years , I 've come to dislike the tie strings you see with some covers that eventually tear off . As for the cover itself , it has a high quality fabric that also has a additional layer of padding on the inside in stress and contact areas . The attaching was quick and easy due to the thick elastic and cording sewn inside the cover . After installing the cover , I turned the hose on it . Carefully pulling up the edges , I found that all of the seams remained sealed and the water just beaded off . This is a product I will NOT be returning .
5 #### this are great ! i used work with the ones that chraftsman use to make , since i could n't find them anywhere i tried this out and work perfectly !
4 #### I bought these clamps for glass interior shutters I am making . 2.25 " oak frames surrounding hammered glass , 45 degree cuts ( to be followed up with spline keys after the glue dries ) . This clamp made it easy to clamp the frames with the glass in place . The only reason I did n't give this clamp 5 stars , was because unless I was VERY careful when moving the clamped shutter from my work bench so I could address glue drips on the " under side " , the corners had a tendancy to pop ( slide ) off . I attribute this to the plastic corners sliding on my poly'd frame . I figure I 'll glue small ( 2 mm thick ) neoprene pads to the mating surface of the corners to eliminate the slipping issue . Overall , no problems with applying pressure and they worked as one would expect .
5 #### Love this because it keeps it concealed and looks neat .
4 #### Handy addition for a person who works alone . Great for larger pieces of plywood . It was a little hard to get it level , but after a little tweaking I was able to get it setup .
5 #### These covers ( boots ) work great . They keep ladder from slipping or moving .
3 #### Decent . Do n't use a lot because of large botton rail .
5 #### I tested this with a few recipes and the pan performed well . I have purchased several Chicago Metallic pans and they have not warped , discolored or stuck during any of my baking to - date .
4 #### i bought this to replace the light sensor that blew out on the transformer for my outdoor walk lights . It works perfect outdoors stuffed behind the hedges in my garden . Only issue I ran into was I found the tabs on the dial hard to pull up when trying to set the timer . Other than that its a great no frills outdoor timer .
5 #### I am glad that I purchased this product . It is very light weight and does n't take up a lot of room . I bought it last fall because I did n't want my snapdragons to die during the winter , so I put a 3 + foot planter box underneath this light . Not only did the snapdragons survive the winter , they bloomed and bloomed profusely with a deep gorgeous red flower . I had also put several new cuttings from my rubber tree in a jug below this light and they thrived and bloomed . I have my spring seedlings under it now . I wish they would make one with two bulbs so the light range was a little wider .
4 #### I 'm quite pleased with my OXO products in general , and this 8 - inch Double Rod Strainer works well for rinsing quinoa and other small grains ( the trick is to wet the strainer mesh prior to adding the quinoa ) . I would buy this again .
4 #### I 've used mine almost daily for 10 years ; it makes a noticeable improvement in convenience . I only wish the plastic had n't started to craze after about 3 years . It does n't seem to have affected performance so far , but it probably will in another 10 years .
2 #### I am impulsive . And saw a video of people making slab stone walkways easier than raking leaves . So I got this stencil thing and now it occupies space in my garage next to the topseeturvee tomato planter , and bionic fisherman , and other crap I buy because I 'm an idiot . Just buy the stones .
4 #### This is second bit I have bought . The shaft is fragile
5 #### I must own about a dozen of this could not work in the kitchen with out them
5 #### Just what I needed , and easy to use . Strong quality , fit is perfect . My brothers make their own inserts for their saws , I do n't have the time . This was perfect for me .
4 #### First off these utensils are HUGE , these are n't your average spatulas / spoons . They are very sturdy and have held up well so far .
5 #### After receiving this I was n't sure I would like it , since it was so flimsy . However , after using it , I love it . Perfect for eggs .
5 #### I purchased the eight gallon . It is light - weight , yet very solid . If you are a cigar smoker , these make excellent coolidors .
5 #### I am using these gloves for over a week now for -at times heavy- property clean - up . They feel almost like a second skin only tougher . I also love the ball & tape wrist chinch which gives me much more of a secure feeling when I am using my little black & decker chainsaw to cut some firewood . One tiny minus is that your hands get a bit cold when the temps are below 30F but that was to be expected . Otherwise these are great gloves and hopefully they will last a while .
5 #### My recent purchase was my third M12V. My first was in 1991 at a tool show .One thing that really impresses me is there is no vibration , no jerking at start - up . I have not had any problems with any of them-- they all are working just fine . This is a great all around router for handheld use or table use .
5 #### Love this for our camping trash can . Make sure you get 40gal trash bags .
5 #### Perfect for martini garnish . I like to garnish my cocktails with curly striped of citrus peel . The groove toolon this zester does a great job on oranges and lemons . Exposes a lot of the skin so the citrus can infuse the drink .
4 #### Good cover . Goes on easily and keeps most leaves and grass out of pool .
5 #### I am very happy with the performance of this little tool . I put a few cloves of garlic inside , roll with the palm of my hands and presto . It takes a couple seconds to have peeled garlic .
5 #### I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FOR ME AND I LOVE IT . I FEEL SO HAPPY WHIT THIS PRODUCT IT WOKS PERFECTLY . I RECOMEND THIS ITEM IT CAME TO MY HOUSE ON TIME . GREAT SUPPORT . SO FUNNY
5 #### Was so tired of hand can openers that break after a short period of time . This product is made sturdy enough to last . Works great on those large cans that the electric opener just ca n't quite handle .
5 #### I love , love , love this item . It is very easy to use and makes peeling and coring an apple a breeze . I find myself eating more apples because of the ease of using the peeler / corer . Highly recommend it .
4 #### True replacement for the Eureka H style - finally ! I have looked all over and this was the best deal ...
4 #### This is a decent , mid - range blender . We 've had ours for nearly 7 years now and the black gear finally gave out . I found a replacement part on smallappliance.com ( search for cuisinart and then choose the model from the list , SPB-7 ) . Easy and cheap fix . Until I have the disposable income for a Vitamix or Blendtec I 'll just stick with this one . It does have trouble with thick mixtures , they have to be pushed down often . But for the light duty blending and occasional milkshake or smoothie , this blender has served us well .
5 #### Lightweight , with reliable cooking instructions , easy to clean , complete with stainless steel rack and no health issues cooking with aluminum . I 've followed cleaning instructions and it 's easy to keep looking and working like new . A 10 , thanks !
5 #### I have given this to a couple of cooks in the family , and they love it . Easy to use , and it works very well .
4 #### The plastic top / bowl on this is so flimsy I was worried I 'd break it just putting the butter cap on and flipping it over . I do n't expect the bowl to last long , it 's almost a disposable grade of plastic . But it was very inexpensive , so I ca n't really complain too much . Made popcorn last night and the machine works just fine .
5 #### Love this salad spinner . I searched and search and so glad I came across this one . Large size !
5 #### We have a huge bug problem on da island and this has been amazing ! ! ! Helped so much with the mosquito problem ..
5 #### Not bad for the price . I like the three pronged forks ; it 's fun and different . These are good for the price .
2 #### The opening on the bottle is very small , making it difficult to truly clean . Had this been an open mouthed container , like the larger sized acrylics , this would be a wonderful product .
1 #### Mine froze up after a month of use . Wayne has been bought out by some larger corporation and their customer service has gone to hell . They wanted me to pay the shipping back to Indiana from the fire zone in Northern California . Not a good time for pump failure . The supervisor ultimately paid for the shipping . A few years ago , they would just send me a new one . They have gone stingy . Similar to Sears after their buy out . I used to keep a couple of these on the shelf , now I need to find a new brand . I got a response to this review saying that they have not been bought out but the parts I ordered for my new pump come from Campbell Hausfeld .
5 #### I bought this as a gift for under 30 bucks on Amazon and was completely blown away by the product quality . Years of lightweight Plastic , galvanized , " stainless " ( yeah , right ! ) easily dented or bent drainage devices of every kind , with holes or mesh weave just fade away by comparison to this well shaped , nicely sized shiny , solid item ! No downside unless you are looking for greater circumference or a more shallow depth . I now have to wait for the next sale on this to get one for myself , and throw out the half dozen inferior ones I currently own !
5 #### Good size broiler pan for one person . If I jsut want to do onelamb chop for me , this is a perfect size .
5 #### THE best can opener there is . Does n't get nasty or require cleaning , because it never touches food . Also , much safer , so do n't have to worry about kids playing with it or getting hurt by the can lids ! It is easy to use , but different than traditional can openers . So it 's funny to watch your friends pull it out of the cupboard and try to use it the wrong way :)
4 #### Works well on dry , fluffy leaves . Those that were matted down needed to be shredded in very small handfuls . I did need to reach in frequently and clean out the stuck leaves . I did n't want to put it over a garbage can as I knew the full bag would be too heavy to remove from the can , so at first I used the bungie cord attached to the shredder to hold a bag , but it kept falling off . Eventually I put it over a plastic garden basket that was about the same diameter and emptied that into bags . I was careful about no sticks getting in as I knew that would break the string . I used it for about 10 hours and changed the string five times . Changing the string was very easy . I also have a commercial - grade chipper shredder with a metal blade and this works much better than it for leaves .
4 #### I used it today to whip eggs for scrambling . Works great .
4 #### I do n't give 5 star reviews except in really extraordinary circumstances , but this little Broan unit has nothing wrong with it . Easy to install , works as it is supposed to work .
5 #### Love this one . First grater I 've ever loved . It stays put well with great grips . It comes apart easily for cleaning and folds together easily for storage . The cheese grates easily as well . Ca n't beat this one . Updating my review and after many months I ADORE this cheese grater . The cheese grates so easily and smooth . I normally ask my husband to grate the cheese because my arthritis prevents me but not with this puppy . LOVE IT ! ! ! !
5 #### I needed a small cultivator for my worm bin to move them around gently and to add food scraps to feed them . This is working great . It was certainly a good price and is just right for my needs . Recommended .
5 #### Not much to say but this replaced my years old rusty rack and should be could for many years .
5 #### I chose this joiner based on the favorable reviews from many sites , the price and Dewalt 's reputation for fine tools . So far the joiner has performed to my expectations . The fence has been accurate and easy to adjust , the blade depth is very simple to change and the performance has been excellent . The dust collection is decent considering the amount of chips this thing produces . If I had a negative , it would be the that joiner " jumps " across the face of the work when the motor starts ... you have to make a very conscious effort to hold it in place , but once you get the hang of that it 's fine . Beyond that , I think you would be nitpicking to find anything truly negative to say .
4 #### It works just fine for the purpose of spot - spreading . It does have a pretty wide scatter area and if I only need to fill a very small patch , I just hold it by the handle and sprinkle a little bit out of the cannister . Great value .
5 #### Love this clock . Mounted outside on wall with overhang so rarely gets wet . Face of the clock happens to face north . It was fun watching the clock set itself .
5 #### Very happy with these , just check the dimensions because they were a little smaller than I anticipated .
4 #### Yep , they work alright , just as claimed . Good for about 8 months in our 1200 gal pond
4 #### Very good speed square , durable and visible . There are far more accurate squares out there for double or triple the price , but this one does pretty well . It is best suited to construction , but I use it with good results for layout of more precise cuts as well . I always double check if in doubt with a precision tool before cutting though .
5 #### very good price , rocket fast shipping , well made product , works excellent , motion detector goes off , jets of water come out at a very rapid rate , and keeps cats from crapping and digging in my lawn . Also keeps the racoons , possum out . Put this unit by your sidewalk and it will stop people from walking their dogs in your yard and allowing them to crap in your lawn . Caution : You will want to secure your scarecrow(lock it down ) , as there are those types of people that will want to steal it . Highly recommend this product .
4 #### One of the top 2 feeders preferred by my Hummers ! I have over 50 Hummers and have several types of feeders out for them . This is one of their favorites , hands down . The only problem I have is that is a bear pulls one off the window ( we live in the woods near the Canadian border ) , the perches or the plastic fingers get broken . The easy answer to that is a piece of copper wire wrapped around the screw at the bottom that comes around to the back and then through the holes and folded outward . For the perches , you can do the same thing making little loops of copper wire that fasten to the screw on the bottom . I have more then 10 of these feeders . All but the two most recent have some sort of copper wire fix and most are more than 6 years old . Just ordered 2 more to hang on the fence line .
5 #### Sog has not let me down . The handle is very comfortable .
3 #### Battery did not last long despite me charging it once - a - week when not using it .
4 #### Overall this is a nice product , but make sure you read the directions from front to back before assembling . You do n't have to cut anything on the newer Unisaws . Fortunately , I heeded that warning from other reviewers . I have a slight ding in the corner of the out feed table . Do n't think this was from shipping since there was no damage to the carton , and it was packed well . Probably mishandling at the factory . After seeing this and the maximum 1/64 " thickness of the lamination , I plan on banding the sides with hardwood . It wo n't be long before I add my own dents . I agree with other reviewers . The instructions are horrible . The mistakes in the instructions have been there for a long time . Correct them Delta ! It does work and save me space when folded down . The brackets are nice and heavy . I gave it a four due to the horrible instructions and thinness of the lamination .
5 #### I have had a whole assortment of grills over my long lifetime . I loved my Weber kettle , but it was just too big for the two of us , so I bought one of those cheap little portable grills . It lasted about a year . I then bought my Go - Anywhere 4 years ago and I just love it . It is easy to light , it cooks very evenly and it is plenty big for meals for 2 or 3 people . The cover is beginning to rust a little , but I can easily fix that . The rest of it is in great shape . It lives outdoors but does have a cover to keep the rain and snow off it . I use it all four seasons , even when I have to shovel my way to it in the winter .
5 #### This pump works exactly as described . The one I purchased is now in my portable shop " swamp cooler " . I got tired of replacing the normal swamp cooler pumps every year and the solution is a submersible pump . I have had this for a long time . It is used daily for the hot summer in Arizona and is still working fine . I highly recommend .
3 #### The edge is n't honed evenly at all . When I try to slide it under wood only one side goes in . I have to persuade it with a hammer . I was demo - ing so no huge deal but it slowed me down . I ca n't use it for wood siding or trim If I 'm trying to save the piece because it breaks thin wood . bummer .
5 #### These measuring cups are so nice . How can one say that well we had cheap ones for starting out and let me just say your never disappointed by Oxo products I 'm trying to buy a full set eventually and ca n't wait till I do
5 #### I have a few of these bowls and they are great for making anything in the kitchen . They clean up really well by hand or just put them in the dishwasher . Buy one or more , you will love them that much !
5 #### Great for popovers . Making them was easy and they poof - ed right out of the top like they should .
5 #### THE EDGE HOG WORKS EVEN BETTER THAN THE ONE I USED FOR YEARS AND WAS STOLEN . I HAVE MISSED IT BUT NOW , MY OLD FRIEND IS BACK AND SEEMS TO BE IMPROVED OVER THE FIRST ONE I OWNED .
5 #### So far so good , I made soups and beans with it . The size is ideal for me .
5 #### Very pleased with the vacuum . It has plenty of power and does everything I expected it to do ; basic cleaning of vinyl floors and drapes . James
5 #### Very easy to use and my dad loves them . Much healthier than deep frying them
5 #### My husband sold our gas mower when we hired a lawn service . I got rid of the lawn service when we replaced our backyard lawn with a deck , but I still have a small , shady front lawn that needs care . I do n't like the noise and smells of gas mowers , so I thought I 'd give this a try . It 's wonderful ! It arrived in three days and my 12 year old put it together in ten minutes . My 9 year old immediately used it to mow the overgrown front lawn , which took him less than five minutes . The mower is small and easy to maneuver and the blades are sharp and efficient . I was even able to trim the edges of the lawn easily . This is a simple , inexpensive , quick , and very effective replacement for a heavy , noisy , smelly gas mower . Highly recommended !
5 #### Had mine for 17 years and it finally broke . No reason to buy a different brand .
5 #### I 've avoided making salads for a long time because of the preparation time . I had an older salad spinner , but it was the kind you had to turn , and cleaning it afterwards always seemed to take a long time . This spinner is a huge improvement over any I 've used before . You put the rinsed greens in the strainer , or rinse them after they 're in , and then put the strainer in the bowl . One easy push and it spins on its own and it does not move around at all on the counter . I have found that it takes a couple spins to dry them the way I like , but while the greens are spinning , you can be chopping up other salad ingredients . Even better , you can lock the handle in the " down " position and use this spinner to store the unused greens in the fridge ; no separate " lettuce saver " is needed . I 've had leaf lettuce in mine for several days , and it is still crisp and fresh . Since buying this remarkable spinner , I 've had salad every night . And enjoyed every minute of it , preparation included ! If you love salads but hate the prep , get this . You will wonder how you ever got along without it .
3 #### This plane must have the roughest sole of any plane I 've ever seen , but with a lot of work , I managed to get it flat enough for my liking . I had to start all the way at 120 grit , and work up from there . After about an hour , I still had roughness in the middle where it was slightly concave , but at least the edges were all polished and flat . It 's certainly not a premium plane , but it 's also less than $ 40 , so you ca n't expect miracles . The hardware attached to the plane is a bit flimsy and cheap feeling , and is a bit fiddly to get set just right , but for the price , it 's not too bad . It 's certainly good enough for a backup .
5 #### I keep coming back to these 3 M filters . I have had good results using them for perhaps more than 5 years . I do not follow a regular replacement schedule but check them periodically depending on the amount of heating or cooling we are doing . Great results .
5 #### bought this timer for shutting off appliances that are not in use and it does the job very well . thank you
4 #### I used this for apples and found that it works well on totally round apples with a flat bottom . If it is an uneven bottom of the apple it cuts it through the core rather than beside the core . I could still use it and it is easier than by hand just know that you will need to clean up some of the apple slices that have the core still on it .
5 #### It is not just a compatible part , it is a weber thermometer . Came in a bulk type plastic bag , not a retail box . It fits perfectly !
5 #### Those hummers love these , even without a perch , cause the finches ca n't eat their stuff ! Pretty too , like a little ruby hanging there .
5 #### This is one of the BEST sprinklers on the market ! I just bought my second one ! and it works great , just like the 1st one which was purchased back in 1972 , yes you read that right 1972 , and it still works GREAT !
4 #### This fits perfect for camper , seems to hold up well in use . We use for dirty sheets and clothes . We sip up , carry into house , clean and put back in and are ready to go .
5 #### This peeler is the best i have ever used . Really smooth when you peel . I put it in the dishwasher for over 2 years now and it does nt rust . The blade is still very sharp . Also the handle is big allowing a good grip .
5 #### I 've had this set of blades for over a year now and am very pleased with them . I use them on my Delta Unisaw and they work great . The most freqent use I get from them is making dados in plywood or hardwood cases for plywood shelves and dividers . The adjustability with the various blades and shims helps me to match the groove exactly to the various widths of my sheet stock . The bottoms of the dados are very smooth . Not router bit smooth , but perfectly acceptable for fit , finish , and glueups . They make very clean cuts and I have seen almost no tearing or chipping when cutting in veneered plywood . In a pinch I had to use this set once on a project that used green treat lumber . They tore through it with ease , and most importantly kept their edge . These are very high quality blades and should cut great for years if properly taken care of . I store them back in their hard case with the supplied dividers between blades after every use , so they still look like new after many hours of use . * * * As other posters mentioned , the shims are not labeled . Something I can not believe was not done on a set as expensive as this . One of the first things I did was mic the shims and mark them with a Sharpie as to their individual thicknesses . This has saved me headaches and trial and error numerous times .
5 #### Great product to protect house from ladder marks and scratches on all types of house siding ... Would not use my ladder without them !
5 #### All of the new ceiling fans in my house have this type of bulb . The local big box store wanted almost ten dollars for one . I bought three for almost the same price . It is as bright as the one that burned out . Will purchase again .
2 #### I ordred two of these for holding fruit in my VW camper van . They would be perfect if they were better made . One of them broke after just one week , and now I do n't trust them to hold much fruit . The rope loop end that loops around the dowel pulled out . Rather expensive for something so cheap . :-(
5 #### Nice an easy to put on and take off and does a great job . Is an extra worth combining with the mower .
5 #### Great price . I have these scattered through the house for when I need them . Seems I 'm always need needing to slit something open . Works great for rapidly and precisely slitting the 4 sides of plastic from the top of tofu containers . Close enough to the edges that I can then use the container for holding things like screws and such of my various projects . Also works for smoothing wood of carvings .
4 #### There is a noticeable decrease in bugs in my backyard around my flood lights vs when this light is off . I still get bitten by mosquitoes approximately 45 feet from this zapper despite its claims to be effective for a 1/2 acre radius . For the price I would say this product is still worth it , though .
5 #### This timer is very easy to understand and program . I use it all the time in a garage environment . Price was right too .
4 #### this is the third mighty mite vaccum i have owned , but this one gets hot when i use it , so that do n't impress me . as a mater of fact it sort of scares me .
4 #### If you read my other reviews on OXO products they are positive . I personally love OXO products so as a lemon zester I 'm sure any brand will do the job , I prefer OXO and the soft silicone handles . Pricey but good .
1 #### its working ok ....... so I ordered another one.they never sent it 4 months later ....... kept my money
4 #### Would get 5 stars if the mosquito bait lasted longer and were less expensive to replace .
5 #### But it works , simple as that . Have used this for a about a year and no more problems with bambi here .
5 #### This kept a little warm water in the middle of our bird bath when it was -17 degrees in rural Illinois . I 'd say it works well !
5 #### I purchased this item to brew beer , and could n't be more pleased . Its much easier than trying to brew on an electric stove - top , and after using it 6 - times , is still going strong . When I first purchased it , I noticed a foul - smelling odor when using it the first time and soon realized it was just the black paint burning off right above the burner ( no harm done , and still works great ) .
5 #### I have owned literally dozens of hose nozzles of pretty much every shape and size you can get ... and I 've hated every one of them ... until now . This nozzle operates smoothly , does n't leak , shuts off * completely * every time and has pretty much any setting you need from a mist to a sharp cutting stream ( all of the settings will give different results depending on your water pressure though ! ) I was hesitant about the price ... but am sold on the Bon - Aire and am glad to have spent the money on something that I really believe will give me years of use . Buy one !
4 #### Bought this shovel intending to use on steps . Although it 's easily maneuverable and small enough , it 's not quite the best thing for uneven surfaces ( like my sandstone steps ) . However , it quickly and easily cleared my long , wide sidewalk as well as my front porch ( deck ) . The shovel was easy to assemble , was more powerful and ran much quieter than I expected . Despite not having wheels or a runner blade , it moves along level ground very nicely & without hangups . My back and my budget are quite pleased with this product .
4 #### I ordered this from Amazon and it arrived in two days shipped by FedX. I bought this shed for a place to store my generator along with it 's propane tanks . Shipping carton was not very heavy , large and bulky though . It takes longer to get it out of the box than to assemble . After you understand the assembly steps it can be assembled in 5 minutes . It took me longer to level a place to put it in the yard . I placed mine on a small concrete slab that I made with a few bags of Easy concrete . Shed is very light , probably around 40 pounds assembled . You will have to load it with something heavy or tie it down so the wind wo n't take it away . I put in a plywood panel over the floor to distribute my generator weight as the floor is very thin . I also added a few vents so the propane tanks wo n't get too hot in the sun .
4 #### Nice for the price . I like it . Has a very pleasant sound and the scale is neither large or small .
5 #### Fit perfectly and was easy as pie to put on . Sure beats sharpening the old one if you do n't have the time .
4 #### I 've discovered a pneumatic sprayer is still better for some applications but this a great universal use sprayer for plant food and some chemicals . Even can be used for soap and antiseptic application . My garden is in a different spot now and I get less use out of it . But it always works , unlike the dispenser Scotts sells with their WS plant food . I usually mix solid substances with a bit of water and adjust the mix accordingly . Handy for applying Epsom salt , as well .
5 #### I got this item to replace springs in an EWG because I did n't want to get smacked in the face . This holds fine for smaller spring related applications . It also will work for grabbing someones head when they are sleeping and scaring them too .
5 #### Needed these to remove a stripped torx T50 on my tailgate so I could install the DeeZee tailgate assist on my supwercrew .
5 #### The wife said she does not know how she has lived without one ! ! ! ! Works great and the price was better than we have found locally ! !
5 #### I ordered the Oatmeal colored Pawleys Island ( the only true hammock maker ) and love it ... something did n't go right on the shipping end and I did n't receive it at all originally , but I simply called amazon and they overnighted another one the next day . It 's duracord is amazing and does n't stain or fade ... I 've had it 3 months now with a sprinker system running ... no mold , no fading , no complaints . It 's great !
5 #### If you do any kind of handyman or DIY stuff and do n't have a speed square , you need one . It 's amazing how a tool so simple is also so useful . I 'll probably still be using this same one 20 years from now .
4 #### Ordered this for my old 9 inch toro weed eater and it worked great . Until I used the weedeater too much one evening and it started smoking and quit working . But no fault with the replacement spool . Just and OLD weedeater .
5 #### This saw was priced right , and does exactly what I need : It cuts holes in drywall . The saw is thick enough to handle punching through drywall and sharp enough to cut it with ease . I used this to cut holes in for Low Voltage Boxes I was installing for network cable runs in my house . I would purchase it again !
5 #### Fabulous hammock , and this type of rope is softer and more comfortable .
4 #### I have had it in my pond for 3 days ... I know I need to wait 30 to make sure it works . I was shocked at how big it is and I only have a 250 gallon pond - these got up to 1000 gallons each . I looked and there are no smaller ones . That being said I am anxious to see if it helps keep the algea problem under control .
4 #### This jar opener was one of my favorite gifts from my bridal shower ! I was sick of using those rubber pads ; not only did they tear easily , but also they did n't work very well . So far , OXO 's version has been a big improvement : the little metal grips easily take hold of most lids , and with a simple twist , the lid is off cleanly and neatly . I have found that the unit can sometimes slip , especially with a very small lid , but if you use it carefully and on a firm surface , you should have mostly success , as I have .
5 #### I just received the set today and love it . I have n't had the chance to use it as of yet but I am able to tell that it is a good quality and will be great for our RV oven . My biggest concern when ordering the set was the size of the muffin tin . Though it is n't made for the huge muffins you could get in a bake shop , it is big enough to make an average sized muffin or cupcake ( though I don;t really plan on making that in an RV . The different pieces have a non stick coating that look a bit more durable than you would see on a standard fry pan and seem to be very sturdy
4 #### Bought assuming the hole in the middle was universal . It was just a tad smaller than the Craftsman edger shaft . Just reamed the hole a little bigger and worked fine . Not the blades fault .
5 #### does a great job of attracting mosquitos until it is used up . Then replace it with another . they lasted longer than I anticipated .
5 #### We 've used this for a week now . Installation : it is easy , but may require some work to install , depending on your window frame . I had to pre - drill for the screws . Pros : -not too loud , even on high ( but then I grew up with a large metal box fan in my window ) -Easy to change speed and direction -nice size , larger then typical 2 blade fan , just smaller or equal to box fan -appears to be well built . -should be easy to clean . The blade cover is held on with a couple of screws and it looks easy to remove and get to the blade . -privacy , the side panels not only hold the fan in well , but also create some privacy there . -close windows and leave fan in place ; removal is easy any way Cons : - size , it is a good size but the way it juts into the room it could be intrusive in small spaces , no problems for me though -some rattle at low speed , bought 3 fans and one rattles so much on low that I keep it on medium . Other two barely rattle , it appears to occur where the blade is connected to the motor . -price , but the usability and sound construction indicate it will be worth the price I bought these to replace several dual blade fans that died simultaneously . I really like these and would recommend them , but with the understanding that you will have permanent screws in the window sills year round .
5 #### Nice tape measure . OMG but that thing weighs a bunch - at least I wear suspenders when working so I wo n't embarrass someone by losing my pants with it clipped to my belt
5 #### Beautiful flag ! There is no other flag as pretty as our flag . I love to see it waving in the air
5 #### Great chisel for a light duty chipping hammer for tile removal and other surface removal . I am using in on a DEWALT D25213 K , and this is the widest head chisel you will want to use with this drill or similar drill . This class of chipping hammer just wo n't have enough impacting force for anything larger . I recently used this bit to remove about 80 square feet of tile . After finishing the work , the chisel looks like its barely been used . Definitely upper end of quality and durability . Other cheaper bits from HF or similar would have worn greatly on a task like this and probably would be slightly bent . This Dewalt bit looks nearly brand new . Amazing ! Bottom line , if you want a quality , durable chiseling bit for tile removal and similar tasks , this is the about the best out there . Again , if you are using a lighter duty chipping hammer like the DEWALT D25213 K , this is the widest you will want to go . A 2 " wide bit needs to be paired with a medium or heavy duty chipping hammer .
5 #### THESE ARE THE BEST FEEDERS WE HAVE FOUND . THEY REALLY SEEM TO BRING IN THE BIRDS . THEY ARE THE RIGHT SIZE AS WELL . ALSO , THEY ARE VERY EASIER TO CLEAN AND HOLD UP MUCH BETTER THAN ANY PLASTIC FEEDER WE HAVE EVER USED . AND , OF COURSE . AMAZON HAD THE BEST PRICE FOR THE SIZE WE WERE LOOKING FOR .
2 #### The screws that came with the unit seemed very cheap . I have been doing carpentry work for years , so I think I know how how screws work ... but these screws seemed to strip out incredibly easy . The magnet is powerful and this would be a 5 star product with some 2 cent screws instead of 1 cent ones .
5 #### Very sturdy and easy to swing . Came sharp enough to use right away . Spend the exta monies for this model as it is much better than the other lighter weight models I looked at in stores ( including a cheaper version of this brand .
3 #### Too bad Nicholson ca n't offer an American made file . I fear they have lost their touch and their reputation is in jeopardy .
5 #### Very nice quality pan . It was a gift for my daughter who is very happy with the traditional bundt pan .
5 #### I contracted scabies at work and had a difficult time cleaning everything . I recommend spraying mattresses , carpets , and furniture . Exact same stuff I had to pay 70 $ for at the pharmacy for scabies . Works well . Ivermectin helps too .
5 #### Gift for daughter . She lives in an apartment , uses the heck out of this , says she loves it .
5 #### Remodeling our stairs from Carpet to Hardwood , Of course the walls are n't perfectly square , I sought a tool to help in the measuring and marking of the new treads and risers . I 've got 29 steps in my house and tried to do the first 7 steps w/o this tool . This tool works great , cut the time in more than 1/2 for me- took about 4 hours to do the 1st 7 steps w/o tho Stair Wizard , and less than 2 hours for the next 7 with it . Made measuring and marking a breeze . Was about to design something like it myself , when I decided to take the time for an internet search for stair tools . This was the number 1 tool choice and it is worth the price .
4 #### Is sometimes difficult to line up all the through and apple , particularly a very large one . So the bottom of the core may be off center and you give it a second run through .
5 #### I 've not had a better popper . The cords go bad , the plastic cover will crack and become wobbly but the popcorn is delicious . I do think that West Bend has upped their workmanship on this particular model . The plastic cover does n't seem to be as hard , and in my mind may not crack around the seal like the previous models . Regardless , i would replace before finding a different popper . I probably would like to see the " after - care " of the popper made easier . My sense is that never put / run water over the metal cooker . Damp soapy cloth to remove the clutter , rinse cloth and repeat until surface is clean . This may be my fifth because i tried to run water over the metal cooking surface ? Nothing seals the electric wiring inside from the moisture . So am trying the wet - cloth approach ! :)
5 #### This is a very comfortable bowl to use . Made of sturdy plastic , it is much lighter than glass mixing bowls , which makes it convenient and easy to use . The handle is very ergonomic and comfortable to grip ( really good when pouring batter into a pan , for instance ) , and the shape of the bowl itself is perfect for wrapping an arm around for those heavy duty mixing sessions . The rubber on the bottom keeps the bowl right where you put it - no sliding . I use this bowl the most of all my mixing bowls and am looking forward to getting a bigger one just like it . Oh , by the way - it 's dishwasher safe , too . I 've washed mine over and over and it still looks new .
1 #### Back in October 2013 when I purchased this can opener I thought it was the best thing to come along since can openers were first invented , and I gave it 5 stars . Now , in July 2015 , only a year and nine months later , I have to bump it down to one star as a little piece of plastic ( plastic , of all things , on this stainless steel tool ) broke off and I tossed it in the trash . So , buyer beware !
5 #### This item was very well package . The bundt pan was copper in color , sturdy and very nice looking . I 'm excited to use it .
2 #### Works ok when there is no wind . The smoke is not strong enough to chase the mosquitos away . Still got bite .
5 #### Not much to say here . I did not notice any quality issues with either the plates or the included screws .
5 #### I just used these blades to cut some 3/16 " weldable steel stock . I had no problem cutting the metal , and it left a very nice cut without jagged edges .
5 #### Easy to grip , sturdy , and attractive ! I do n't plan on putting them in the dishwasher , so I 'm not concerned about the markers wearing off .
5 #### These are much thicker and sturdy than the standard metal mixing bowl I 've been using . I like them so much I bought more sizes .
5 #### Easy to use for backyard kindle splitting and light enough to take with you on a backpacking trip . Comes with a cheap - o plastic cover for the blade but it does the job . Ax splits small kindling logs with ease and the back side can be used for a wedge hammer .
4 #### Nice spinner , easy to clean . I saw a Chef 's video that showed it being capable of removing seeds from canned diced tomatoes , which I why I purchased it . However , despite being able to easily spin very fast , the holes do not allow tomato seeds to pass through . I realize that is not the intended purpose of this device , and otherwise it 's a nice spinner . I knocked off 1 star because , in my opinion , it is over - priced for what it is .
3 #### Holes are too big so it soaks the lawn very quickly and if you have it in tandem with another sprinkler this will take all the water from the other one .
5 #### Makes fast and good sized fries . Is easy to clean
5 #### Nice spinner . This is the best one I 've owned yet . Sturdy and nice size .
3 #### I had a Weller soldering gun for many years and it was a great unit . I used it on the farm then for six years on our charter sailboat . We left the old one on the boat for the new owners and purchased this new one when we moved into our home last year . This unit is definitely not up to the quality of the old gun . Furthermore , it did not work out of the box . I did some sleuthing and found that there was no electrical connection between the tip and the holding unit . Upon inspection it appeared that whoever put this together did so in such a careless manner as to drill the insertion hole incorrectly and bend the tip insertion legs on assembly . I had to do some drilling and straightening to get things to work . I think the Chinese need to institute a rigorous inspection and approval system such as that the Japenese started many years ago to turn Japanese products from a joke into a worldwide - recognized high quality producer of goods .
5 #### The larger version of the ergonomically designed whisk . Easy on the wrist ! Whips up big batches , without wearing out the cook .
1 #### I wish I did n't have to make such a vicious statement , but this thing really is poorly - constructed junk . The tool mount flexes too much to guarantee any accuracy in your work . What 's worse , on the one I had the tool did n't even mount centered in the hole - preventing me from ever using any wide router or sanding bits without damaging the plastic of the table itself . If there were an adjustment - a pair of slots of some sort - to which I could center the tool properly , I would have kept the table and given two or three stars . At least it would have been somewhat useful to me . I just do n't see how a plastic molded part can get this wrong , and for that I returned it . I do n't expect too much from a rotary tool system like this , the quality is cheap and you get what you pay for - but this is ridiculous .
5 #### We purchased this board to use for carving turkeys , roasts , etc . It has a nice deep groove all around it for catching juice and drippings , and is a perfect size ! We treated it with mineral oil when we received it , and have so far ( only a few weeks ) been very satisfied with its utility . It is good looking , well made , and fairly priced . We received it in a timely manner . No regrets ! Update : on January 1 , 2011 . Still going strong . We think that treating once or twice with mineral oil has made a difference .
5 #### Great , I have n't been able to find it anywhere until now and I am so happy . Great product !
5 #### Best for the money ! Perfect for a really big cup of expresso !
4 #### Does a good job on carrots and potatoes , but the bristles smash down a little with use .
5 #### I use these constantly around the house . Of course , they keep my hummingbird feeders clean , but I use them everywhere ! I ordered extras to keep in my private " stash " because Hubby was sneaking them out to his shop to use on his tools , etc .
1 #### This product has major design flaws . The worst is that the three pieces you must assemble by screwing together will NOT seat with amount of effort ; the screw " pitch " is far too fine for the poor plastic threading . If the manufacturer simply used a larger pitch , like a outdoor hose thread it would solve the problem . I attempted to use a silicone spray;still no luck in seating either of the two joints . Then after cleaning off the spray I attempted a seal with first Superglue then epoxy , hoping to both seal the water leakage and stabilize the stem - mounted motion detector which , without the stem fully screwed in , flopped around ( not good for the motion - sensitive part of the unit ! Finally , when I thought all was well the unit would not spray water - the manual said if this happened you might have too high a water pressure ( without telling you what pressure to aim for ) and that you might need to buy a pressure - reduction device on the line . Great product idea ; lousy execution and incomplete manual . AVOID THIS ITEM .
5 #### I use my saw to trim around our one acre lot . We have several trees and shrubs . I like to keep a spare chain for those times when I may cut into something that dulls the chain . I have found Amazon has the best price and the fastest service . The shipping by Amazon is amazing . I do n't see how they get it here so soon . Thanks Amazon
4 #### The True Temper products seem to be well made . The wood handles are nice , and they get the job done .
5 #### I 've been lugging around a Hatteras hammock for years , but could n't find stands large enough . And never could find trees in the right place . I noticed that the green version of this was only $ 119 . Although I wanted rubbed bronze , I saved $ 60 by going with dark green . It 's fine . Pretty easy to assemble , and it 's even quick to break down ... I could imagine taking this camping . The last time I went camping on a beach in Texas there were little scorpions running around on the beach , so I started taking a hammock and sleeping off of the ground . This is n't small , but when broken down it would probably fit in an SUV just fine , and you could take your hammock with you . Bliss is a hammock on a beach ! !
2 #### I should have listened to the other complaints . You can not program the second times . If you set it foe early morning , the next watering will be mid day , the worst time to water .
5 #### Best wire cutters I have owned . Lost one , came straight in and ordered another . Awesome !
4 #### This is a neat wind chime . A little on the cheep side of quality materials it 's made of but over all it sounds & looks nice
5 #### Product was just as we expected , was a good addition to our ad on room . The light fixtures did not look cheap , though they were inexpensive . Very happy with the end result !
5 #### It works , in Texas heat , to clarify green water and completely stop daily algae bloom . I did have to use it every 3 days to achieve clarity . I have fish and tadpoles and plants in my pond , and it does n't bother them at all . I was sent a 1 gallon container by mistake - I'd ordered the 2.5 gallon , and when I called , they immediately sent the correct size and let me keep the other one too . VERY pleased , as this is MUCH more reasonable than the lovely pond shop that is 1 1/2 hours away , and I always buy more stuff when I go there as well .
4 #### Works very well . Good to repair and save expensive garden hoses . Much better than the plastic fittings .
5 #### This grill fits my sheet pan perfectly , it hugs the outer rims of the sheet pan causing no movement of the grill cover . I love my sheet pan and grill cover . At first because of the size I use to keep them in the oven , but now I have found the perfect place for them .
4 #### This pruning shear cuts cleanly and seems to be built sturdily . It feels right in the hand . Only complaint is it sometimes sticks in the closed position even with a clean blade and some oil- not a big problem , but annoying .
5 #### Wanted something white and clean to match my modern bathroom , but without looking like it would get disgusting quickly ( b / c it was white ) . The clam shell is a great invention and does have air holes to evaporate any water . Highly recommended ! ( oh and it 's cheaper than it is at The Container Store )
5 #### These use universal metric / US hose connector sizes that should fit either or ( I 'm using them on US sized threads ) . I bought two sets of these to go on various hoses , pressure washer , sprayers , sprinklers , virtually every watering device and hose I have has these connected on it . It makes it incredibly simple to switch devices on the hose without having to shut off the water . For the past 6 months I have heavily used all of them and none have leaked at the quick connector or the screw fittings ! You can pick up a set of o - ring from harbor freight or buy the proper ones from Gardena to replace the quick connectors if they fail ( have n't had any issues yet ) . You can also try to oil them to bring them back to life , especially if you 've left it out over winter . These seem really durable . I have had these on hoses and sprayers that have dropped on pavement and not broken off . I 've had several cheaper hose fittings that either started leaking within the first year or broke apart the first time they touched pavement . I expect these to last many years without needing replacement . Had a slight issue when I ordered one of the packages was missing one of the female quick connect fittings from the box - Amazon quickly replaced though . Otherwise these are quality connectors that I will continue to stick with Gardena from now on .
5 #### I love my many - years - old Eureka upright vacuum and refuse to risk using anything less than Genuine Eureka replacement bags . Vacshack quickly shipped what we needed at a very good price via Amazon . Recommended .
5 #### My kitchen was renovated this summer . I have a 1.5 gallon shop vac that I used to clean up after each days ' work . The construction crew LOVED having it on site . Each day , I washed out a filter and hung it up to dry . For seven weeks , I rotated between the three filters . Even with HEAVY use , they are still working well .
5 #### I had one of these for years . It 's sturdy , and small , which makes it convenient for travel . Admittedly , it wo n't work well for backpackers , but if you 're looking for a great little grill for camping or your small recreational vehicle , this is your answer . It will easily accommodate outdoor cooking for four people . Keep it clean , and it will last forever .. I gave mine away to a friend , but now need to buymanother one for our month in the North Carolina mountains .
5 #### I have used Henckels for many years and have recently given some to my daughter . We love them and wo n't use anything else . thank you .
2 #### I 've tried this popper several time , using the recommendations from other users , different corn , oil , etc , and still ca n't get a satisfying batch of the crunchy stuff . And it take a lot to clean each time .
4 #### Got this to replace my thin spatula that is slowly disintegrating . It 's not as good as my beloved utensil , but it works . The blade is very thin and slips under eggs perfectly . The only complaint I have is that the blade is uniformly thin . My old spatula has a thin edge then the blade slowly widens , providing support . This OXO spatula is not as stable , flexes easily and can snap , sending food flying unexpectedly . It takes some getting used to , but I have found it to be a suitable replacement for a utensil no longer available .
5 #### Love the brand , love the peeler , the best I ever had . It allows fast movements and the blades stay sharp year after year . And it does n't rust . OXO is not a cheap brand of kitchen tools , although competitively priced , they 're just a little much for my budget , or else I would OXO my whole kitchen . This one was a gift because I kept bragging about it and never saw it in my friends ' kitchen . They love it too .
5 #### Excellent timer with multiple on - off options . We 're using it with a water fountain pump , and it 's working flawlessly . The price was also excellent .
5 #### I used this to separate molding from the wall when laying down a new laminate floor . I was able to do this without damaging either . the coating over the claw prevents it from marking up the surface it touches . good weight and feel .
5 #### I love my Makita drill , but the batteries do n't last more than 6 or 7 years with mild use . The drill came with two batteries , one which finally failed about 3 years ago . This battery replaced the second one which finally failed last year after 7 years of use . I firmly believe in buying replacement batteries from the manufacturer . I 've purchased replacement ni - cads and li - ons from " no - name " brands for my tools and appliances and they do n't last , do n't retain a charge as long as the manufacturer 's product , and do n't provide as much power as the original . I think manufacturers ' batteries are over - priced compared to the no - names , but for me they 're worth the extra cost . Do n't buy junk .
2 #### It was n't that great and it 's very bulky to store . I bought the microwave bowl instead , which I love . I know it 's a classic , but it did n't impress me .
3 #### NO deal , found it elsewhere for a few cents less ....
5 #### This hose reel does its job and can be used wall mounted or freestanding which is a nice option . When you first put the hose on the reel it 's a good idea to lay out the full length of the hose to remove any twists or kinks . Then just roll it up and you 're done . My heavy duty 100 foot hose fit with room to spare . 2 year warranty is a plus if parts are needed . I 've found that Ames products are better than the others I 've tried .
5 #### Does exactly what it is suppose to do ..... turns on my outside lights at dusk and turns them off by my schedule .
5 #### This set of brushes are fairly expensive , but they are invaluable for cleaning the ports on your hummingbird feeder and other items around your house . I use mine almost every day for cleaning something !
2 #### These did not last but a few weeks before becoming hard to operate . I do use my tools heavily for my job .
5 #### Most consumer grade air compressors come with a miserable hose to use and store . This high quality hose is very durable , pliable to work with , easy to store . The connectors are first class .
5 #### Very cool measuring cup . Bought on the recommendation of Alton Brown .
5 #### I own many Oxo kitchen tools and the 6 - inch strainer is another example of the company 's dedication to producing quality products . It is very sturdy with a fine mesh basket and is long enough to prop across the smaller side of my double sink . This is not a large strainer , so if you want a more versatile size , the 8 - inch strainer would be a better choice .
5 #### OXO has become my go to company for kitchen stuff . This peeler is no exception . My favorite aspect is the firm grip . My current one is skatey - eight years old and slips in my hand . I really like this one .
4 #### I am always on the search to streamline , organize and simplify life . Our kitchen , like most family kitchens , is very busy with lots of activity and busyness going on . Although we have a large sink , it tends to get overcrowded and difficult to manipulate all that we try to do in and near it . I purchase this item in hopes to declutter some of what goes on there . For me , it just was n't what I was looking for , the smaller side is just really too small for what I was hoping to use it for . We do n't have dish sponges , but tend to use wand type cleaners and if I put silverware in one side , the shorter , less deep side just was n't going to work . On the whole the product was well made and serves a purpose . However , for me , it just was n't going to work .
3 #### way to much corn in bag , needed a better mix of other seeds !
1 #### 3/3 failed within a few months , all in different ways . The end cap blows off , or the plastic explodes and you ca n't fix it . Waste of money and time .
5 #### Great price , great product . So superior to non notched blades . It makes edging so much easier .
5 #### Cuts through branches with ease around the house and is sharp even against wet branches / leaves . I 've hit tougher items that it should n't be cutting and it never " nicked " the blade . I think people are reviewing a past version of these shears . They should have put a new listing for the newer version , just to be clear .
5 #### Nice sturdy pan . Good nonstick coating . Popovers come out easily and pop up nice and high . For an easy to prepare addition to dinner these things are great and folks are always impressed !
3 #### I purchased this for my front yard at my townhouse . I got tired of lugging my electric mower and extension cord from around the back of the townhouses to the front just to mow what I consider a patch of grass . I 'm exaggerating but you get the point . Assembly was pretty straight forward albeit a bit annoying for no other reason than I hate putting things together . It was simple however . The unit looks clean , looks of high quality and is light and appears durable . The problem arises when you try to cut grass that 's even slightly high . It seems to choke and the spinning blades get stuck . I then have to sort of kick it with my foot to get it spinning again . It feels like over time the spinning would get smoother as the metal breaks in but now it seems to get stuck periodically . It is height adjustable though I did n't attempt to adjust it . It did a nice even job of cutting the grass I did want cut . All - in - all it gets the job done for what I need . I do wonder if I could have purchased a better performing manual mower . I 'm on the fence with recommending this . If you purchase it , it will get the job done albeit with a little stubborness from time to time . You wo n't regret the purchase , but you wo n't be overly pleased either .
5 #### Purchased these so I could make taco salads . The large totilla fits perfect . My daughter had a set so I decided to purchase a set for myself . They are also easy to clean .
4 #### So far so good - very easy to read . Purchased mine at a local Pinch-&-Penny for less than $ 11 .
4 #### Agreed that this is a little loud , but only a little . It also shuts off at the fill level with a hard clunk . I solved both those by throttling down the wall valve . Now I do n't hear a danged thing even though it now takes two minutes to fill the tank . Not really a life - ruining thing . There is one little flaw with the design . There is VERY LITTLE force holding the valve body latched at the right adjusted height . Turn the top just a bit ( so easy to do ) and the water pressure in it will force the thing into maximum extension , causing the toilet to run without stop . Those of you with kids , grand kids , neighbor kids , and so on understand full well that someone will eventually play in your toilet tank . They have included a " landlord " locking wedge for this scenario . Take the time to remove the valve just one more time and use that wedge !
5 #### Simplest way to feed the plants ... no muss , no fuss , no burnt foliage . I will continue to use these .
5 #### Good fit and price and convenience are the main considerations here , as I can never remember to go shopping for these .
5 #### Great for quickly peeling potatoes in large quantities . Previously I 'd been using a small knife which is horrible . Good quality .
5 #### Probably not the correct spelling but whatever you call it , flies are helpless against its powers . Photo i posted shows 6 days worth of captures . The way i figure , each adult female produces 500 offspring so i just saved myself and my animals about 25 milion annoyances .
2 #### The head was ccrooked on the handle , returned it with no problems ! Just an error , I 'm sure they all are not faulty .
5 #### Seems to do what it says it does .... Guess , I 'll know for sure after this winter .... I do like the construction better than the green ones like it at Lowes ....
5 #### My windchime just arrived today ~ so I have n't hung it up yet .. but the sound of it is * * magnificent * * . Its sturdy and lovely to look at .. but nothing compares to the beauty of the sound . Absolutely thrilled with this windchime !
5 #### ... in the house , instead of personally enjoying your awesome salad spinner , you 'll be relegated to the role of mediator over screams of " It 's MY turn to spin ! " My grandkids self - appointed themselves " official salad spinners " the day we got this wonderful product and woe to me if I dare try to sneak in a spin or two of my own without making sure they get their turn ! This has to be the best , most efficient , popular and enjoyable - to - use gadget I 've ever bought for the kitchen . It 's worth every penny , and as others have said , it makes a great gift as well - one that you know will get used and not catch dust in some dark forgotten corner cabinet . Buy it and enjoy !
5 #### I have two of these in the house and never had to use one until recently when a big grease fire started on my grill . Three brief shots put it out . The powder worked great .
5 #### These knives get a lot of use in our house and I love them . Very well made and always sharp .
3 #### It 's too small , and a bit flimsy . I think it claimed to be big enough for heavy duty cables , but not for mine !
5 #### I DID ORDER TWO , BUT NOW I ONLY HAVE ONE . MY DAUGHTER WAS AT MY PLACE HELPING ME IN THE KITCHEN AND WAS EQUALLY IMPRESSED AT HOW WELL THIS PEELER WORKED . OF COURSE , I GAVE HER MY EXTRA ONE . I MUST REMEMBER TO REORDER ANOTHER ONE FOR MYSELF .
5 #### Why did n't we get one of these sooner ? ? It works great . We have a bit of an incline in the front of our house and I was n't sure it could climb it , but there does not seem to be a problem .
5 #### I love this magnet . Because of my reaction when I look at it , I believe this is how he looks like .
5 #### I like the load rating and the traction tread . I 've used marathon on all my wheel barrows .
5 #### They 're little chunks of wood that smoke when you put them in the smoke box on the BBQ . What more is there to say ?
5 #### Built to last , sharp as a tack and easy to use .
5 #### I bought 2 of these fans ( at different times ) to use with an air filter as a DIY air filtration device . There is quite a bit of dust that comes in through my windows ( no air conditioning in my place ) . The fan with an air filter attached move the air around my apartment and filter out a great deal of dust . I clean the filter once a month ( it is reusable / washable ) and I breathe a lot easier now . I leave them running at the lowest speed when I am at home and only turn them off when I leave my apartment . They have never overheated or stopped working . They do move some air at the highest speed , shakes a little ( the feet really help to stabilize them ) , and make a bit of noise on the highest speed but at the lowest speed ( which I have them at ) you can watch tv without having to raise the volume too high .
5 #### We needed a wider garden fabric for our 4'x4 ' planting boxes ...... this product worked great and a great value from Amazon
5 #### I always try out new trimmers hoping there 's a magic pair . These are always the go to . Simple , efficient , affordable . Anyone who trims la gange will know .
4 #### This was a huge help to our summer vegetable garden last year . A little goes a long way and these castings really helped our veggies grow ! We have a small garden so did n't need much . We used the smallest bag and was able to use when planting and then again about halfway through the season .
5 #### What can I say ? Pressure cooking has always been something my family 's done and I do . Its great for soups , stews , cutting down the time it takes to soak beans and any time you need to get a mead dish done in a hurry . I 've suitched to an induction burner and needed stainless steel . The Presto is the same high quality as the aluminum one I used for decades . A good price on a basic pot that works just like I expected .
4 #### I have had no problems with the pressure cooker so far . The six quart size is big enough for a whole chicken . The package comes with a few recipes which are a good starting point , especially since cooking times for different kinds of meat are provided . My main issue is that all the ingredients in a recipe will be cooked for the same amount of time , so that some of them will be overcooked . A workaround is suggested . Items like vegetables which take less time to cook than the main meal cooking in the pressure cooker , can be prepared seprately in the normal way , and then added to the rest of the meal . A few minutes of cooking will then blend in the flavors .
5 #### It 's very big , hard to store , but it holds a lot of salad ! It 's also very high quality .
1 #### Product purchased new is very good and will buy it again and again . However do not buy from Amazon used deals I did this and received two literally used chains . The one had oil but was still sharp . The other was oily and dirty and was dull . More dull than a chain I would throw away .
5 #### These side cutters will be added to the RV tool box .
5 #### Good vegetable and fruit brush . My last one had a long handle with the brush at an angle and it was difficult to use and the handle broke off after only a year 's use .
2 #### Put in the first of the 3 pack in a few weeks ago . Leaking already . Looking for a quality product and can not find it . Leaks to refill point every 6 hours . Wo n't buy again
5 #### I Find it hard to express just how much I love my dremmel tool and every one of the little extras for it . This shaft attachment makes an amazing tool just that much more amazing .
1 #### Item used twice , before it pulled apart when using the garden hose , with a little tug . for a 3/4 " hose , ( EXTRA HEAVY size , ) This is the only thing I could find made of solid brass , but not strong enough to lasts a full season .
5 #### It 's spectacular on potatoes ! ! ! I used it to cut the potatoes for my stew , which I usually do by hand , and it takes ages . With this cutter , I just put them in place in the cutter , push the lever , and in 2 seconds , I have the potatoes cut into French - fry shape . Then I just cut across , to make the squares for stew , and I 'm done . It will do other vegetables , too , including carrots and larger potatoes . If they 're too long ; I just cut them in half , and then put them through the cutter . It cuts easily and cleanly through the potato , with little to no effort on my part . It saved me almost an hour , which I usually spend cutting up all the vegetables by hand . It 's a super quick cleanup , too . It comes with 2 size blades , in case you want thinner fries , etc . It 's so much fun , that it 's really not a kitchen tool ; it 's a fun toy . I 'm going to be using mine , a lot more , from now on .
4 #### Makes a huge difference in the vacuum 's ability to suck up dirt and debris , especially when mated with a new agitator brush roller .
3 #### Went together easily enough . The hanging string design is a bit wonky and is hard to really get level . I 've found these size bulbs are difficult to find locally . It serves its purpose , but I think there are better options for the money .. though they do require a bit more DIY spirit .
5 #### I have purchased other Agri - Fab implements in the past and have had nothing but good service out of them . My new Roller is no exception . This one was a no brainer to assemble and what 's not to like . Very Reasonable price and works like it 's suppose to . If you consider renting a lawn roller every time you really should compact / level you would have paid the purchase price off in no time . Even Made in the USA . I like the Agri - Fab Roller would recommend .
5 #### I installed the trap next to where most of the flies are , instead of far from the house because of its odor ( which is significant ) , and it is filling with flies rapidly . Because we are surrounded by neighbors with dogs , I decided to do something to make it more habitable around here . As observed by other reviewers , it may be attracting flies from next door as well . Which is OK , because now I can make a sport of it by going out with my fly swatter and having a lot of targets to hit ! I expect that I will be able to make a big dent in this generation of flies , hopefully resulting in far fewer flies in the next generation . These flies are small and pesky , and follow us into the house to become a nuisance . But they are fairly stupid and are not hard to kill .
5 #### Keeps the dust down in the bag , not all over the place , wish I had it sooner .
5 #### i WANTED A SAFETY CAN OPENER , I HAD A ELECTRIC ONE BEFORE , IT DID NOT WORK WELL.THIS ONE DOES THE JOB AND REALLY WORKS , IT TOOK SOME PLAYING AROUND TO SEE HOW THE GRIPPER WORKS FOR TAKING THE LID OFF.BUT NOW WE KNOW.HOLD THE CAN OPENER AND PULL THE LID TOWARD YOU , EXCELLENT SAFETY CAN OPNER .
5 #### Good quality . Strong clip . Bright light . Can set on table top without clipping to anything .
5 #### I have tried various forms of deer repellant from liquid concentrate to shaker crystals . This has ended up as my favorite . I like the sprays because they cover the new growth which MUST be protected . This is the only spray that does not have chunks in it which clog the nozzle on my sprayer . Recommended .
5 #### If you 're looking for a NICE 3/8 ratchet , you probably ca n't do much better than this model . Like the other SK ratchets I 've recently bought , this thing has good heft to it and is smooth as glass . The knurled end of the handle is very well done and gives you very positive grip on the ratchet . I imagine this would work well for anyone that got it dirty or oily , although it 's much to beautiful for me to be that careless with it . The ratcheting mechanism is quite fine and exceptionally smooth . I absolutely LOVE the sound of an SK round head ratchet click and if you buy one of these I think you 'll agree . It 's smooth , very quiet , very positively engaging and very comfortable in hand . Well balanced , -extremely- well polished and best of all it 's still made in the USA ( unlike most ) . This ratchet is easily one of my new favorite 3/8 ratchets ( and I have a number of them ! ) and I 'd gladly buy another or recommend it to anyone else looking for a good 3/8 ratchet ( take a hint ! ) . Buy one for yourself and see why people love SK ratchets so much , and why this particular design has been around for several decades . Put one in your hand you 'll be sold on it , without a doubt .
4 #### Bought this sander for my girlfriends crafting hobby . It fell apart in just a couple of months . Luckily I still had my Amazon receipt and Black and Decker sent out some replacement parts . After that did not successfully get it working again , they sent out a whole new one , which has been working well .
3 #### I have one of these for my intex pool . It does stay put and is n't difficult to put on , however the holes ARE an issue . I purchased the cover to keep leaves and debris OUT of the pool and this cover does n't really keep anything except large leaves and small animals out . I understand the holes serve the purpose of not allowing water to build on the surface but living in FL if I 'm not able to get to the pool after a good rain storm its going to overflow - with or without the cover . Hopefully by covering the holes it will keep the mess out . I had to buy a vacuum today because there is so much small tree debris at the bottom of the pool now . Typically you buy a pool cover to keep the pool clean , this pool cover does not succeed for that purpose . The ties do keep it secure - so far even under 40 + MPH wind gusts , but the hole where the tie comes out ripped after 2 days . Probably would n't purchase this one again .
5 #### I had one of the first OXO pizza wheels and it died on me , I had had it for awhile and it was used a lot . I love OXO products so I decided to upgrade to the nicest pizza wheel they make . This one is so much nicer than my old one , it feels nice in the hand and cuts through pizza smoothly .
5 #### Quality DeWalt product . Cuts fast and true . Use with battery circular saw .
4 #### I have gone through 8 deferent motion lights with 5 deferent models and vendors ; this is the only one works in my garage with CFL bulbs . My garage has many windows , it is little darker then out - side day light , way much brighter than " Dawn " , all other lights will not turn off the lights correctly during day time - some work 50 % of time , some do n't work at all . Some of them do n't turn off the lights even at night if use CFL bulbs . The only issue I have with this light is the range is much smaller the 70 ' like other reviews stated , it woks 90 % in 12 feet which is the distance I needed . Since this is installed in my garage , I will not have the water proof issue and the below 20 degree issue like other reviews stated . I hope this light can last a few years before someone makes a good security light - I have exhausted all the options from Amazon , Home Depot , Lowe 's , ACE , and Costco at this time .
5 #### Replaced mine that died after YEARS of service . Like the red !
5 #### My children and I have been trying to learn Spanish and I have bought a variety of great resources here on Amazon including this Magnetic Poetry Kids Spanish Kit . It 's a fun supplement to the books and software we currently have . These little magnets ' home is on our fridge , but we also like to set them on the table Spanish side up and see if we can remember the English translation of that word , which is printed on the back ( magnetick ) side . It 's really convenient to have on our refridgerator since we see it everyday . We have had no troubles with these falling off , as long as we keep the Spanish side facing out . We have really enjoyed these , and would recommend them to anyone looking for fun ways to supplement / reinforce their Spanish education ! In addition to this fun kit in aiding us with our Spanish , is this incredibly useful ( and very inexpensive ) book,&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Easy - Spanish - Phrase - Book - Over-770 - Basic - Phrases - for - Everyday - Use - Dover - Easy - Phrase / dp/0486280861 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Easy Spanish Phrase Book : Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use ( Dover Easy Phrase)</a>&nbsp;which we have used almost as frequently as these magnets ! * As an aside , my children have also had fun just playing around artistically with these magnets , one of our ( My Little Pony fan ) daughters made a Rainbow Dash design using these magnets ( see photo :) *
5 #### Much better price than local hardware store prices . It is easy to read with the color scheme . Metal squares can be beat .
2 #### This really did n't do much for my pond . Instead I used quilt batting cut to fit my pressure filter and placed it between the foam filters . This addition filters out the smallest debris and keeps the water clear . Less chemicals is better for the fish and plants .
5 #### This is just what I needed to fix up an old lamp . Looks just like what came off good sturdy feel no shaking . I would recommend
1 #### These do not cut that well , I used them on 1/4 in bolts and I gave up after breaking 2 blades on 3 bolts . Went back to the 14 tpi multipurpose and did much better
3 #### This is a Weller soldering gun . These guns have a lot of heat , but there seems to be a law that these things have to be cheaply made . On the last pair the plastic casing broke where the screws hold the two parts together . I glued the casing shut and it seems to be ok for now . The little light bulbs stopped working too .
4 #### I received a hand me down DW705 with a busted dust collection bag from a friend . After reading all the negative reviews on amazon , I was a bit hesitant to purchase this replacement , but did go ahead nevertheless . First , the bag fits perfectly , is the same size and design than the original one and even has DeWalt written in big yellow letters all over it ( not shown on picture ) . After working with my new old miter saw for a day , I looked into the bag and it was full of saw dust . Maybe half of the dust was not collected , but that still means that half was and for me that is better than having no a bag at all . Let 's be clear , the bag simply collects the dust that is " thrown " its way by the saw as it cuts through the wood . If not all the dust is collected , it is because of this a passive collection method and NOT a feature of this specific replacement part . When cutting pressure treated wood , the intake of the bag can occasionally get clogged with the moist sawdust . Overall , I am very happy .
5 #### Just roll a clove of garlic in this " soft plastic cannoli " and presto , it comes out naked and perfect !
5 #### Great quality pizza cutter . Impressed with how sturdy it was for the price . Great value .
5 #### I use a large commercial shop vac for dust collection . This fitting worked perfectly to convert my table saw four inch dust port to my shop vac . Fits tight . No duct tape required .
5 #### These briquettes make sure the food cooks evenly on a gas grill . The price was fair for the product when compared to smaller bag sizes offered at a slightly lower cost .
5 #### Very happy with this on my redneck bug zapper and intex pool pump . need more ...
5 #### This little magnifying glass is the best ! I do tons of crafts , and even though I have glasses somethings just need a little extra help to see . I craft with adhesive vinyl and sometimes I can not seem to find the cuts . The glitter vinyl is the worst ! Sewing is another craft I need help with at times . I like to do embroidery work . If I make a mistake without this little magnifier I 'm in trouble . This set comes with three different magnifing glass lenses . I use the larger one the most . It has the lowest power magnifier . It seems to be the best for the projects I do . Each one clips in and out of the handle or base . The handle is comfortable to hold and its overall pretty light . It 's very easy to switch from one size to the next . I do not have strong fingers and I have no trouble at all . They slide in the base and pull out with a light squeeze on each side . There is a switch to turn the light on and off . It 's great because for me the more light the better I can see . Do n't worry the batteries are included . The light is LED so it does n't eat up batteries like others can . I received this magnifing glass at , a discount to test and give an honest and unbiased review .
5 #### Perfect for traveling . My husband and I take our own food with us when we travel , as we do not like to eat out . This little grill was perfect for our last adventure to Fredericksburg , Texas . We picked up our own food on the way there and made the most delicious meals . Beats spending a lot on chemical and salt laden prepackaged food . If your going camping this would be a wonderful addition to your little adventure .
5 #### Bought this to replace a cheap wood handled melon baller that started to come loose . Like my other Oxo products this one feels solid and I expect it to last a good while .
5 #### This pillow is exactly what we were looking for , is the correct size for two people to share it on our hammock ( a Pawleys Island Large DuraCord Rope Hammock in green ) , and it matches the hammock . It 's been rained on several times , and when we go to use it , it 's clean and dry . We 're very satisfied with this item .
1 #### I bought four of these last spring and all of them are broken . It absolutely infuriates me that so many garden supplies are made of plastics that deteriorate in the sun . It 's an outdoor item ! Make it durable enough to withstand outdoors ! ERGH ! Such a waste of money and space in a landfill . They work great when they work . If you are willing to put the oscillator inside between uses it will last you much longer . The width adjustment would probably break anyways though , it 's flimsy plastic and a poor design .
5 #### Very easy to use , just place the apple under it and press down -- presto , the apple wedges appear . It does take a little effort to remove the wedges since the blades do not always cut all the way through the bottom skin . Also , the apple must be carefully positioned so that all the core is removed by the center ring without leaving seed parts on the wedges . But , altogether , an extremely useful device .
3 #### I used to cook with a pressure cooker that my mother had given me and I loved the time saved using it . Somehow in one of my many moves , it disappeared . After considerable research , I chose the Kuhn Rikon Duromatic Pressure Cooker Set . It is a beautiful set of pans that work very well . My only hesitation in recommending this purchase to someone else is the expense . I think the cooking results could be obtained with other pressure cookers . I must admit I was swayed by the brand reputation . The fact is that it is still just a pressure cooker underneath its beautiful looks . As long as you know that ahead of time , go ahead .
5 #### Product is exception on water pressure and has multiple adjustments for the stream . Much better than the one season cheap pistol nozzles .
5 #### I have recently upgraded to stainless steel in my kitchen and I love this spoon rest . It is good quality and heavy . Looks great on my stove . I see where people complained of sticker . Here is a trick that works for me when removing stickers from items . I first use warm water to soften the tag , then I use pure acetone nail polish remover to remove the sticky residue . After wiping in circular motion with paper towel , tag and residue is gone ! Nice and shiny ! !
5 #### I have some butcher knives that I use for processing game , I like to keep these knives sharp , and this storage roll lets me keep them sharp and safe . If I need to go to a friend 's to help process I can take them with me and not have to worry about them .
5 #### typical OXO quality : sturdy and long lasting . the extended length is perfect for using on the grill . i 've lifted 10lbs chickens with it with zero flex .
5 #### We have several pans made by Chicago Metallic , and have been satisfied with their quality . The thickness of the metal make these shell pans very stiff , and they should endure many years of use . I 'm unsure how long the non - stick coating will last but other reviewers have not expressed concerns after purchasing these 5 + years ago . While it has nothing to do with the pan itself , I was disappointed to find out that whole wheat and multi grain tortillas ( La Tortilla Factory brand ) did not bake well , and virtually inedible ( turned rubbery ) . I tried several attempts precisely following the mfg . directions as well as trying other techniques found posted on the Internet . . . none made them crispy . I re - read most of the 43 reviews hoping to gain insight from others but nothing seemed on point . I then decided to buy some regular flour tortillas . They came out fine following the mfg . directions . I lightly sprayed oil on one pan and not the other , and neither tortilla stuck to the pan , and no noticeable taste difference . So the oil seems unnecessary . A 10 - inch tortilla fully fits inside the pan . While I have n't tried one , I think a 14 - inch tortilla should work fine even though it would probably extend about 2 inches above the top of pan . We 're happy with these pans , and enjoy making tasty taco salads .
5 #### This is awesome ! What a great design . You just do not need to apply any pressure to peel . Just glides perfectly . Love it !
1 #### We only used for a month and the plastic part on the lid is loose and leaking the air . I ca n't use it as pressure cooker anymore . No way to return now .
5 #### Great price ( add on ) and works good for my indoor plants
1 #### Absolute junk , worked for 4 or 5 days and stopped in one position . Nothing is broke or bent , just a poor design .
5 #### Slightly different housing from the old one I had , but it worked perfectly right out of the box as it should ....... May get a spare so when I screw up next time , and crush it , I have a backup .
5 #### At first I thought this brush was ok , but nothing special . Then today I used it to clean green beans . Now I love it . You can slide a green bean right through the little hole in the middle and it cleans it perfectly . Very happy with this brush . I also like the feel of the bristles . And I love that it 's dishwasher safe . Ok , I guess I like it more than I originally thought I did .
5 #### For safety sake , you pretty much have to have a stabilizer if you 're working more than 16 ' off the ground - and this is simply the best . Simple installation on my Warner extension ladder(it just slides on and two pins hold it in place ) , it 's aluminum so it does n't add much to the weight when you 're trying to hoist it , and the hook that comes with it is adjustable to either side for hanging a paint can or a bag of tools . Well made , easy to use , and indispensible .
5 #### This saw rocks . I also purchased the DW723 saw stand and the two work great together . Every angle I have wanted has been really easy to set and the crown , base molding and chair railing all looks great . Have recommended this saw to all of my friends . They just seem to envite me over to help them for the price of a pizza .
4 #### I do n't personally use this blade . I resell it . Most people who use this blade , give it a good rating and they seem to think it is well priced . I have bought these for some time and will continue to purchase them .
5 #### Got this over a year ago for my mom in law and it 's still doing its job ! :) Fantastic . Good for salsas , sauce and more .
3 #### Okay , like most of us , I am not sure what happened to my old soldering gun , so I got this one that was the best I could find . It heats up right away , and gets nice and hot . It has that two heat range thing with the trigger , which was a little confusing before I read the instructions . Somehow I got the impression when I ordered it that it came with a large and a small tip , but it came with a large tip , and two paddles , one vertical for smoothing and one horizontal for cutting . Course , the first thing I had to solder was a miniature connection on my motorcycle headlight switch up inside the plastic switch . The large tip worked , but I was concerned that it would get the small part too hot and makes things worse , instead of better . I think my lost gun was a Snap On Blue - Point and had the one piece solid large and small shafts instead of these wire tips . I do n't see a small tip for this D550PK Weller anywhere , so I guess I m stuck . Anyway , the case is nice BUT the hinge broke the first time I opened the box . Guess being stored inside the house in my special tool cabinet took its toll on the box NOT ! The gun itself seems to work and feel good . I gave it 3 stars because I do n't see a small tip and the broken case hinge .
1 #### it does n't cut the pizza at all . you have to apply a lot of pressure to cut the pizza .
5 #### We love ours and then bought this one for our daughter - who also loves it .
1 #### I purchased your Hibachi - style Charcoal Grill ( L410 ) May 2011 and the cooking grill / grid is rusting terribly . There are spots where the rust is coming off in layers . My built - in gas grill has cast iron grids / grills and after nine years only get surface rust which is easily wiped off . At the rate the grid / grill is rusting , it will be rusted through and destroyed in another year . The grill is stored out of the weather and has never been rained on . Other than the cooking grill / grid , the rest of the unit shows minimal surface rust . Lodge says , " The grill is losing its seasoning . I would recommend re - seasoning . " DUH ! , The first time you cook over charcoal producing temperatures well over 1000F , any seasoning is GONE . Be careful with this grill .
5 #### Not much to add . Pops the popcorn SUPER FAST ! I do what another review said , let the machine run for about 3 mins or so to get it warmed up , then place the popcorn on it .
5 #### I 'm here to tell you that this is a little work horse of a tool ! We have used it as a pry bar , nail puller , lever and for a multitude of other jobs . It has become an indispensable tool in our arsenal of tools as it does n't bend or twist out of shape and makes life much easier for us . We 've always had great success with Stanly tools and this pry bar is no exception .
5 #### The Amco 4 - piece Steel Measuring Cup Set is something I use all the time . They are sturdy and well manufactured and I do n't think they will be falling apart very soon . I bought it as an extra set of measuring cups I can use when cooking , but I now consider this set my main one . I consider this purchase a good investment and will most certainly purchase other Amco products in the future .
5 #### Love it ! Works like a charm . Set it on our table and all is well . Do n't expect it to work in a bigger area than what the description states . Well worth it !
5 #### I have been an Estwing user for many , many years so it was a no brainer to pick up another Estwing to handle all my home repairs . The handle is great and it has a generous head area . I chose the 16 oz straight rip claw to compliment the need of a claw in potential remodeling situations with the understanding that I would probably be dealing more with trim projects rather than rough framing and the need of a checkered head 24 oz framing hammer .
5 #### I got extremely nervous when I was at the top of 22 ft ladder trying to paint / stain our home . I believe that when this stabilizer pushes the ladder away from the house , the ladder just " feels " so much safer that I have no problems feeling comfortable at the ladder 's top with the stabilizer attached .
2 #### I have one of these that I picked up locally . I gave up on the thing because you need the strength and leverage of a quarterback to make the thing work . I 'm short so when I put this on my kitchen counter it hits me at chest level -- not the best for leverage as I ca n't put any weight behind my arm for pushing it down . Mine came with three blades -- all sharp and everything but essentially worthless because I do n't have the physical strength to force it through a potato . I recently picked up a similar product that works by pushing down instead of applying force at an angle . Much better even if it only makes one size . Plus , it only cost five bucks .
5 #### A good product . I purchased two and attached each to an Orbit base . I have tried other brands only to have them fail after a season or two . I find that Rain Bird products are built to last and work well . I would recommend these to anyone looking for a quality impact sprinkler .
5 #### Works like a charm . Fill it . Steep it . Compost it .
4 #### So this review could be premature but oh well . Unit worked fine , make sure to read the instructions . The nozzle provides for a wide spread of whatever concoction you are putting down .
5 #### Love this muffin pan . There 's just two of us in the house so we do a lot of baking and cooking with our toaster oven . This pan allows us to bake small batches of muffins or cupcakes easily !
5 #### One of the BEST hammers for the money ! ! ! This hammer is asthetically pleasing , well balanced , ergonomically comfortable , and most importantly ... She drives nails straight and true ! ! !
2 #### I m happy with the functionality of the bar but disappointed with the quality of it . While trying to remove a nail , part of the v - notch tips broke ( see pics ) . I was very surprised to have this happen . The pieces just snapped off as though the tool is too brittle . I ve never had that problem with previous bars . While I plan to continue to use it to scrape up vinyl tile , it is too unsafe to use for nail removal . I will look for another bar for nail removal .
5 #### Somebody said they are hard to clean ... The bottom has lots of little black squares . I cut out about 1/4 of them . Unplug the unit and turn the water hose on it . All the bugs wash off the bulbs and go out the bottom . The birds take care of the rest of the clean up . And it is kinda fun to sit on the porch and listen to the bugs fry .....
3 #### Get what you pay for not bad but it 's still not like a linx pair .
5 #### I had to wait a little while for this product but it was n't too bad but I do really like the product thank you .
5 #### Worked very well , even in our last winter which saw numerous ice storms . Cord could be longer ( only 18 " ) , but wattage is low enough that you can easily use an extension cord . Really is specifically designed for bird baths , but we use it in a larger fountain with a smaller raised bowl in the middle and it kept the water running all winter .
5 #### I got ta admit I got into the hickory smoked pork ribs by accident . Mind you , I do n't care for pork products . I was traveling cross - country with my mother and came across a hickory smoked bbq place . She wanted some pork ribs so I got her some . In the motel room the aroma of the smoked ribs was so tantalizing I had to try one . Man I was hooked ! ! Ever since then I 've been smoking my own pork ribs with these hickory wood chips . Man if you know how to use them you 'll experience such a great taste experience . By the way , the price is $ 2 cheaper a bag than in my stores around here . Order enough to take advantage of the free shipping and you 'll save big time .
5 #### so far so good ... I have been using fluidmaster for years but when I realized Korky is made in USA and Fluidmaster is made in China ... I decided to change
3 #### Item as expected , but found the same brand locally for half of Amazon price .
5 #### Three years ago my employer bought me a pair of these for my job . After months and months of extensive pruning , it has kept it 's edge and works just as well as it did on day one . Loved it so much I had to buy my own pair for home . High quality , long lasting , ratcheting ease of usage for those of us with arthritis . Love them !
4 #### Well , it produces light but is a little loose in the socket
4 #### nice grill cover , low cost and fits my weber spirit grill perfectly . time will tell on durability .
4 #### This works pretty well . I like not having to stab a clam shell type of digger , which I also have .
5 #### This device has really cut down on the mosquito population in our backyard . Indiana has set a record in July for rain and the mosquito population was unbearable . This is very easy to clean and we have not had any problems so far . Be sure and set it away from where you would like to sit as the attractant really does work .
5 #### I gave this product 5 stars because it is a quality piece of Black and Deck equipment . I have an older 9.6 volt wireless drill and because it looks exactly like my worn out battery pack that it might work on mine and give me a little more power . I was wrong should have gone with what the product came with which was the 9.6 battery pack . This was my error .
5 #### bar and chain fit as expected on my Craftsman 16 " saw . Oregon is a good brand and was n't concerned at all on the quality .
2 #### This de - icer was working fine when the winter was mild . However , once we started getting sub - freezing temperatures and lots of snow , it died ! I would not recommend it .
5 #### Great fork to hold meat coming out of pot . It is sturdy and has little knobs at tines that help hold the item . OXO makes great products for those of us with arthritis , as we can hold the handles without losing grip .
5 #### This is the perfect tool . I bought it for moving charcoal on my camp dutch oven . but it arrived and I realized it would also be perfect for moving food on the grill too !
5 #### I own 4 of them . I live in DC where you are elbow to elbow with neighbors . This thing is amazing ! I ca n't believe I 've spent $ 200 for these gadgets but I 've probably spent more adding up all the mouse traps , glue traps and other gadgets that did n't do the trick . This DOES this trick . There 's an easy set up , signal , and clean up . I had one in every room for piece of mind and no more signs of mice !
5 #### Sometimes things just work and this does just that . Use it and throw it in the dishwasher . Great for making apple cake
5 #### This pan is fantastic ! I used to scrub and scrape my last pan . The food ( even cheese ! ) slides off this pan . It washes up in a jiffy . Great Purchase .
4 #### This heat tape has performed well for me and has saved a lot of time and work by clearing the edge of the roof .
5 #### Worked perfectly on my Generac 2700 psi pressure washer . Easy on , easy off , and secured by a quick release strap . High recommendation here .
1 #### It would be difficult to imagine a toaster as poor as this one . It toasts unevenly , and it takes forever . When it is used for two slices , only three sides toast . Or , one side toasts and the other three sides burn . When we try to do four slices we get the same resolts multiplied by two . The sad part about this is , that this is our second VillaWare toaster . we had these problems with the first toaster we purchased but we kept and used it for about four months when it failed completely . I contacted the Factory and , without hesitation , yhey instructed me to return it for replacement . They were very pleasant and co - operative . That is the only reason they got even one star . There service is great but the product is BAD , BAD , BAD ! ! !
5 #### I had one of the standard grilling tongs you get from your run - of - the - mill grilling set , but it was SO dang hard to close the tongs compared to the OXO Nylon headed tongs we used so often in our kitchen . I looked into it , and low and behold , found that OXO produces this all stainless version , which obviously is much more suitable to the high heat encountered on a grill . This stainless pair is also easier to clean than our nylon version , so I actually prefer to use it in the kitchen now too . Just a very well thought out product that performs perfectly !
5 #### No wood shop would be complete without it . For the price , it is excellent . One feature I 'd like to see added is a hole somewhere so I can hang it off my workbench . I added my own via drill .
5 #### This is a very well built metal sprayer . It holds the pressure well and the nozzles and O rings seal the tips perfectly for an even spray . It is a little pricey but there is no comparison with this sprayer and those plastic ones you see in the big box store . This sprayer can handle harsh chemicals and just about anything else the normal homeowner will need to spray around the house . The adjustment nozzles have a great range so you can spray back in those deep corners from a good distance or set it to fan and get the up close spots without it leaking all over the place or on you . The unit is well sealed for leakage at the wand end . There is a bit of a learning curve on using this sprayer - the top seals in a different way so read the directions before you fill it up so you wo n't get a face full of chemicals . Amazon shipping etc . was good as usual - they are the best .
4 #### couple of blemishes in finish but works OK for light duty use as a salad mixing bowl
5 #### As a former Chef I am picky about using only quality kitchen utensils , and I heartily endorse this can opener . Most manual can openers have a tendency to hang up or run off the lip of the can , but not this beauty . It stays on the lid without ever jumping off and has incredible ease of operation due to it 's large mechanical advantage and handle construction . This may look like a cheap can opener from the local retailer , but it 's ease of use , durability , and the fact that it is dishwasher safe ( many are n't ) makes this the best value for the can opener dollar imaginable .
5 #### The fence was easier to install on my 25yr old Craftsman table saw than I was expecting it to be . I only had to adjust one of the holes . I only wish I had gotten this fence many years ago . Could n't ask for a better product . I would recommend this fence to anyone !
2 #### out of 400 ( ? ) seeds . Went to the local market and purchased a catnip plant than the cost of the seeds .
5 #### The Finns know their blades . And the Fiskars X27 is pure contemporary Finnish axe porn . Sure , you could splurge four or five times the price of that tool for a Vipukirves Leveraxe , but for us weekend warriors who nonetheless still need something reliable to generate wood stove fuel , this thing delivers . After breaking twice the handle of my 7 - lbs . maul , I decided I really needed something with a composite handle . I love the way it feels in the hand , it does n't slip , and it 's 2 or 3 inches shorter than a traditional maul . My output is much better with this thing .
5 #### Needed a spare for my pump they do wear over time and is good to have a spare this is my second one . I recommend this covet
5 #### Comes with well made double socket assembly and mount , did n't expect that . Explains the price , thought it was a little steep for just a glass ! Decided to use it and am glad I got it . I did n't realize how flimsy the old one was .
5 #### light duty plastic but it will never rust but will last 2 - 3 tears perfect for low water pressure 7 bucks you ca n't beat it
5 #### Pretty much an essential tool if you use a drill to set screws .
5 #### If you are tired of all taste the same micro popped corn and want to get a true popper than this unit is for you . The Stir Crazy leaves almost no unpopped kernels every time we use it . The small amount of time spent cleaning up ANY oil popper is well worth the bonus of great tasting popcorn . The Stir Crazy heats up and starts popping your corn in a very short amount of time . One note : Someone wrote a review stating that the stir arm scraped the coating off the bottom of the popper , they tightened the stir arm down too hard . This is something that they tell you NOT to do in the instruction manual ! This popper gets 5 stars in my book , well worth the money for great tasting popcorn .
5 #### These are great for 1/2 inch or less . You can cut bigger but 1/2 inch is easy and comfortable .
3 #### It works ok . It 's tricky to get it straight through the apple , and it 's not big enough around to remove enough of the core ( for me , anyway ) .
5 #### These are hard to find locally , an excellent price on Amazon too ! This fits perfectly in my vehicle to hold tools , recovery straps , air compressor and a jump box .
3 #### I probably would of given this a better score if the design of where the two little prongs are , was different . They support all the weight of this big bird feeder , and its heavy when filled ... its good its a big one , filling less often interests me . BUT ... the large plastic tube has two little holes drilled in it to have a little piece of metal stick into each hole to hold this , and I am thinking in time , just from the elements and the sun / heat that with taking this apart to fill , refill , etc the plastic will fatigue ... then you have a very expensive bird feeder that the squirrels ca n't even TRY to get into anymore . To me the design of it and how it will probably not last too long is important as this is a pricy feeder . On the upside , it was easy to assemble . I was interested as to where it was made , it says its made in the USA of US and CHINA parts . Draw your own conclusions .
5 #### I bought my first Smokey Joe in 1992 . I am finally replacing him ... not because he wore out , but because I tore him apart to use the pieces for something very important . ( It 's a long story ... Smokey Joe was all I had or I would have been outside all night in my car ) . Anyway , I am now replacing my first SJ with another . I 'm quite certain he will be chillin ' and grillin ' with me for the rest of my life .
4 #### Good quality . Little small for my toaster oven . But they clean up great and I bake in them too .
5 #### As an avid plant lover it 's a little hard to cut thick rose stems , and trim back plants and such . I LOVE these things . They cut through foliage like butter ! and I do n't have to get so close to the rose thorns to do it ! 1/2 the price of cheep little pruners that become dull in a week these are awesome ! I just make sure to keep them clean and dry for storage . maybe a drop or two of oil now and then . My husband showed me this idea after the umpteenth pair of pruning sheers wimped out on me
5 #### My grandfather is in his early 70 's and he has an Estwing with a leather grip that he 's been using since he was a teenager . The grip is a little worn now , but that 's to be expected after using it nearly every day for 50 + years . I saw the very reasonable price of this Estwing with the leather grip and I had to pick this up . My only complaint is the stickers . I do n't understand why they would take a beautiful hammer and cover it in stickers that leave sticky glue behind . I know stickers exist that can be peeled off with almost no residue left behind , why not use those ? Anyway , this is a fantastic hammer that will last you a lifetime if you take care of it . Hell , it will last you a lifetime even if you do n't take good care of it . But Estwing , for the love of everything holy , lose the stickers .
5 #### This is a great way to toast the taco shells without them collapsing . The quality is better than it appears in the picture , it is study and heavier than it looks . It 's big too , you can cook the biggest taco shells on this . I cooked the flat bottom ' stand and stuff ' shells and they held their shape . This thing is great !
5 #### High quality square . Very easy to read and use . Goof product for the money .
5 #### This is by far the best hose nozzle for the money . It has a wide variety of spray patterns and the rubber cover is nice . If you bang it on your car it protects the car from scrapes and dents .
5 #### Perfect if you need just a short piece of hose
5 #### Is exactly what I needed to hang my livingroom light/ fan .
2 #### We did the bayer last year and this , last year I thought it worked well , so I reordered this spring , with 30 roses I thought this would be great , it really did n't work very well this year I have enough left over for 2 more treatments , but will not use it , it worked well on 8 of the 30 roses , The other 22 not good , I would not recommend this product on more than a couple of roses , and especially not hybrid tea roses . We have had to spray most of our roses and cut them way back , good idea does n't work
4 #### Great solution to allow your trash can to be easily wheeled around your garage or driveway . The wheels are n't big enough for it to work on gravel or rocky surfaces , however .
3 #### Let me start by saying , I love OXO brand . I use their bottle brushes ( best ones out there ) , and I 've had a few kitchen tools that were great . I initially was just looking for a vegetable peeler after ours broke , but have been needing a new pairing knife , so I purchased the combo of the peeler and pairing knife . They are both very , very sharp ! The peeler is the sharpest , smoothest peeler I 've owned . But the pairing knife is already showing a few spots of discoloration ( rust ) , so that is why I 'm giving this * set * 3 stars . If it was just the peeler it 'd be more stars . I 've used the peeler more and it shows no signs of wear . I do want to mention that I was concerned the handles would be a bit chunky for my smaller hands , but they 're fine . The thickness is not really the issue , its the shape . It would be nice if it had a better shape to fit your hand , rather than one big chunky handle !
5 #### Thank you -- I am very happy with my purchase from you .
5 #### I enjoy a good hot cup of expresso and this pot does n't disappoint . It 's not easy to find a good pot like these in local stores , so to be able to order it online and have it delivered quickly was another plus . I would recommend this expresso maker to anyone that know how to make their expresso and enjoys the way that this type of pot works . Pleased with this purchase .
5 #### Looked at a bunch of food containers at local Pet Stores . All were decent . But I like these because they are big enough to hold a lot of food and seem very sturdy even when stacked . Love my set . I would buy them all over again - and these prices at Amazon are fantastic
5 #### These are the best foam brushes on the market . They last and they can be washed out in the case of water based paints and reused . No cardboard inserts to get soggy and go limp . Tight foam that does n't rip through after a few passes .
5 #### I was very pleasantly surprised with this little gadget - it makes coring apples so much easier ! We had been using a paring knife previously , and that not only took forever , but also caused some major cuts . This little guy cores an apple in mere seconds and other than having apple juice squirt back at you there is zero risk of injury ! I also love how it does n't take up any storage space , since it 's roughly the size of a vegetable peeler . Overall very happy with this and wish I had bought it sooner .
5 #### Easy to install and makes for safer ripping . Good quality .
5 #### My wife had one of these years ago , well , one just like it . It does take the work out of peeling garlic , especially if you want to do a bunch of it . 30 year retired chef .
5 #### Worth the price , good workhorse yet finer cuts are smooth . Had it for about 6 months no complaints . Lever on front can get stuck if not properly set ahead of time for blade adjustment . I prefer wood block planes , but for fast work it does a good job .
2 #### I was pleased until unit stopped working . Bulbs seem to be an issue with this company . I will replace but will go with another brand .
3 #### This is a handy and sturdy strainer for draining pasta for 2 people or grains . It works for small grains like quinoa and millet . I agree with other reviewers that it works best if you wet it first .
5 #### A great product from Dewalt . Cuts concrete , or shaves it off . I would recommend this Dewalt product over less expensive cutting wheels .
5 #### I have bought three of these peelers . Our family of seven has meals some times with five pounds of potatoes or sweet potatoes and these peelers make quick work of them . The blades are sharp and the handles are comfortable to use . I recommend them . Update : Almost 3.5 years later , the peelers are still working great !
2 #### This Feeder is lovely - however , mine had a slow leak that caused an ant infestation . I reluctantly had to return it .
3 #### The blades do n't stay sharp long enough and all I 'm cutting mostly is drywall .
5 #### This is really cute - looks great from a distance , but a little plastic close up . It 's so fun to have as a decoration I bought another one .
4 #### Basic retractable blade , perfect for us to have a garage spare to break down boxes for recycling . Love that it comes with spare blades , was a little difficult to line everything up to install the blade and the retracting mechanism and not cut myself accidentally .
5 #### Quality you can feel . When you need to cut or slice .... grab the Henckel .
5 #### I have purchased many vacuums that say they are good for hardwood floors and dog hair , but this little wonder is the first that actually works ! ! ! It is light - I can carry it around . The wand is long enough that I do n't have to bend over to vacuum the floors . The bag is large and lasts 5 - 6 cleanings . It does not push the hair around , but actually inhales it ! ! ! The price is wonderfully low . Anytime I would even look at a vacuum cleaner I would perspire , but this little gem gets the job done before I even know it .
5 #### I purchased this to work with my Jet JWTS-10jf table saw and it does a very fine job . I have used it many times since owning it and have not once second guessed my purchase . Money well spent .
5 #### The Black and Decker Cordless Hedge Trimmer is an item I have been waiting for for years . I have cut so many cords with the old type . And since I have three acres , the cords do n't reach everywhere they need to go , so having a cordless trimmer is heaven . I keep an extra battery charging all the time so I never run out .
5 #### I finally replaced my old quarter sheet sander and have to say ... this sander is a huge improvement . It 's quieter than my old one , lighter , and the velcro sheets are super fast to switch out . Love it !
5 #### I had purchased the smaller one and it worked very well . It is comfortable in your hand . It is extremely sharp and makes quick work of small branches . The locking mechanism is easy to you use .
5 #### It is a great product , sorry not much of a written . think you will love it too
1 #### I am not sure what this brand is about but I purchased 6 from local home depot and had to return all in 2 weeks as they failed . My neighbour purchased 4 and none worked after a week . Heath Zenith , Please get into some other business as you are bringing some cheap product in the market , which is very unreliable and cheap . After buying this product , I realized how bad some products can be , ..
5 #### I went by just the picture that it would fit my JD equipment as the ad said it fit 18 - 26 hp engines . It was exact fit and in just a minute , out with the dirty and in with the new and I was on my way to mowing .
4 #### I ordered 2 more because of sturdiness and price but was a little startled it had no blade . Thankfully I had a bunch of blades here . Last few times I took these things apart to change blade they would n't go back together right . This one did so easily . It actually looks better than in this photo .
5 #### Ca n't beat this knife for quality . Like all the Henckle Four Star knives I have , this one is sharp , solid , and comfortable to use . More importantly , it cuts thru touch , whole grain bread like it was butter - unlike other bread knives we 've had . Go for it , and while you 're about it , buy an entire set of Four Stars .
5 #### I bought one regular medium sized bowl for my 93 year old Mother and she liked it so much that I got her this one . She loves that fact that it is light and does n't move on her counter when she makes biscuits . The pour spout works well for pancakes or runny batters .
5 #### Klein is the very best . I have been using some of there tools for over 50 years .
5 #### It works great with excellent key feel . It is 100 % compatible with our Windows 7 Lenovo PC , but I ca n't speak definitively for any other OS / PC you may have . And , it 's a whole lot better quality than the cheap crap I found on that huge auction site we all know . The Toshiba name seems to really count for something with this keypad ! I would definitely recommend this to family and friends with a W7 PC ! !
5 #### I 've got a pretty large area , about an acre , that I mow occasionally . I live in a dry climate and vegetation seldom gets juicy and thick , but does get somewhat tall at times , though sparse . I 've found that I can drain the battery in about 45 minutes by lowering the deck and seeking out large clumps . If I 'm feeling more willing to stay with it , I raise the deck and mow a lot longer . It is very nice to have this control over how long you have to work at a given time . There have been times when the vegetation is very dry and it seems like the battery will never use up its charge . Thankfully , those times are few . Also thankfully , I have not had to buy even one gallon of gasoline ( at $ 3 per , sometimes ) to operate this mower . About a 10 cent 8 hour charge and it 's ready to roll . As of 9/21/2008 - I have learned that battery care is of great importance . Do not let your battery run doun all the way and if possible , keep the charger connected even when not in use for long periods . Lead Acid batteries do not like to be fully discharged and will lose charge just sitting there . They have no charge memory like many metallic based batteries , so the onboard charger is safe for continued use , in my experience .
5 #### Great for adding flavor to slow cooked meat . Make sure you know what you 're doing and do n't go crazy on the wood . A little bit goes a long way , but apple wood is one of the best woods for smoking pork . the chips are good sized they arrived dry no musty smell no bugs and are much better then I can get at our local store . I will be buying this again .
5 #### This F-2 is the best pruner I have owned . Tried ARS -- returned due to the annoyance of both a rotating handle and spread of the grip ( as if you need to concentrate on the how you grip , sometimes twice ) , sharpness was not exceptional , and Fiskars I returned to Home Depot - simply not sharp enough and had an annoying tendency to pinch the branch between the blades ( where you had to spread them open and start over ) . F-2 has a lifetime warranty and all replacement parts available . Spend the money and make sure you wear good gloves . They are sharp .
4 #### These brushes are perfect for cleaning out my hummingbird feeder ports . Only downside is sometimes the brush will come unattached from the handle and I will have to push it back in . They are great for those small holes you ca nt get to .
3 #### I bought it to scare the squirrels out of my garden .... I can not get the sensitivity set ! So it goes off without warning sometimes . I think its is because it is in the full sun in Texas at 100 degrees and it just has a hard time detecting the temperature of the surrounding environment . But that 's ok because it still scares the squirrels away .... even with it constantly spraying its been a month and the batteries have not died yet ! .... that 's better than my orbit sprinkler timer . It only goes off once a day and never lasts more than two weeks !
4 #### You may have to use a hacksaw to make some small modifications on your new greenhouse , but once you do , you should be very happy with it . The tent pole sizing seems nearly random with the top ridge pole over 1 1/2 inches too long . No wonder other reviewers complained of the tent pole pockets ripping and falling apart . It 's a easy fix . Use a hacksaw to cut the pole down to length , being carefull not to cut the elastic shock cord inside . The poles are made from a soft material , so they 're easy to cut . Untie the knot at the end of the shock cord and HOLD the cord , while you remove the cut segment . Retie the knot and that 's it . I had 2 poles that needed surgery . Once the poles were the correct length , I was happy with the Springhouse . The actual tent material seems the right mix of flexibility and strength . I live in Northern California , so our winters are not extreme . A morning below 28 degrees gets headlines . The Springhouse is perfect for protecting our outdoor potted plants . The Springhouse web site has a link to their YouTube page . The video on folding up the flowerhouse for storage is very useful .
4 #### This one will handle extremely small seeds but be careful , small one such as carrot seed will fall out if it is tipped downward , even with the pin in the closed position . I found it helpful to drop a dozen or so carrot seeds into my palm , and the with the other hand pick them up a few at a time and drop them carefully into the seed bed . Someone larger seeds you can drop very carefully with no worry they will slip out , once you get the hang of how it works . Best to practice dropping seeds back into the package for a while , once you master that you can then head out to the garden with it .
4 #### They 're easy to install . A Philips screwdriver is all that 's needed . We put ours through the paces , trimming long stretches of grass where the lawnmower ca n't quite reach , so we go through two replacements every year . It would be nice if they lasted longer or were sharpenable , but that 's asking a lot .
5 #### Razor blades . They 're sharp , there 's a lot of them . The 100pk is in the same package , they just do n't put a spacer in the bottom of that one , and put more blades in .
5 #### This works great . A bit pricey . I wish the ( 8 gal ) Shop Vac had an o - ring seal for the lid . This 6 HP beast makes the whole house air cleaner and warmed while the room 2 degrees ! Who needs Air purifiers and heaters ?
2 #### These sheers work great when they are new . I bought one of these in a fancy nursery in Santa Barbara where I was told they would last em a life time . Yes , They cut through things beautifully even when you have a a bunch of branches adding up to half an inch and sometimes 3/4 " . But the honeymoon lasts only a month or two even for lite use at home . They become rusty very quickly . The blade on the one I got became black with rust after a year and I stopped using it after that . I have bought cheap sheers from the 99 - cent store that have not rusted at all under similar use . I just bought a new Felco last month and have been keeping the blade edge dry by wiping it and sharpening the blade once a week . I have used it on cut flowers inside the house only and it is already rusty . The rust does not come off easy . There are youtube videos on dismantling , oiling , cleaning and sharpening these but I think either Felco 's were always over - rated or they have gone down in quality .
5 #### Great popover pan . Makes it easy to grab it out Sunday morning and have a fab treat with butter and honey .
5 #### As advertised . replaced the old plastic ones and gave me something to hold on to .
5 #### It 's perfect for what I bought it for . Under a raised bed garden I built . Provides the drainage my plants need yet keeps the burrowing critters out . It was easy to cut - I used regular heavy - duty scissors .
2 #### does n't cover a very wide range of motion . Also wway too expensive . It did n't stop the dear from coming into my yard . Anybody want to buy mine from me for half price ?
5 #### I have multiple sizes of strainers in my kitchen because they are so extremely handy to have around . I love OXO products in general , and this one matches their usual standard . It is well made with double weave , that is , two separate layers of mesh to prevent even very small particles from getting through . It is a good size to fit over the top of my&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Vita - Mix - blender / dp / B0000YRJT6 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Vita - Mix blender</a > , and it has a handy hook to keep it from slipping away from hot pots . The handle does n't heat up , which is very important . Finally , in a pinch , it can double as a flour sifter . Highly recommended .
3 #### Used for its intended purpose ( carried to a picnic table , roadside campsite , or island getaway ) this grill is fine . It is not terribly rugged and it takes some fussing to be sure it is stable and level . Nonetheless it allows you to direct cook things in places that your primary grill could never go .
5 #### I use these for my aquarium - I stick them on the side to hold all my miscellaneous crap . They hold well , they 're not an eyesore . Love them !
5 #### We have only tile and wood floors so this is the best little vacuum for us . It is light weight , has a fairly long cord , and I prefer to have a bag over the bagless types which can smell and clog after time . The wand easily gets under furniture and it has a strong suction . If you have rugs this will not work well for you as there is not a beater bar .
5 #### I am using this to connect to the propane outlet on my deck . It can be used to go from the grille or my gas deck heater to the house LP hookup . It comes with an extra quick disconnect fitting which I did not need .
5 #### These have worked out so well for us . I love the fact they are stainless and I can throw them in the dishwasher . My husband is just glad they are n't plastic !
5 #### Excellent pressure cooker . Good size with thick stainless steel . Very easy to clean and maintain .
5 #### Very good cutting , the blade while large is very flexible to make close trim cuts . Very much worth the price , I have used this style saw for over 10 years . This saw is a very good value .
3 #### I do n't remember using this yet . I bought it to use on a hose I seldom use , so I think it is still sitting out on my front porch somewhere waiting to be used . If it is like the same brand and model it is replacing it should be okay and last a very long time . That is why I bought it , to replace one I have for about 5 seasons that I used outside . The one I just received was metal and seems as sturdy as they one like it that I replaced it for . The one I had before took quite a few years before it started to leak when I sprayed with it . This is a cheap cost hose but if like the other one it should be good ?
5 #### It is a good scoop for dirt , cat food , cat litter , just anything that needs to be scooped . It is handy
3 #### Fast & secure shipping . Perfect fit for the small space we have but not that much light . It should be brighter , I think .
5 #### bought 10 of these at a time due to it being cheaper than buying just one . Replaced a bulb in my over the range microwave and put the other 9 up for furture use if needed . item was exactly as descibed .
5 #### Would n't recommend the lawn mower but this is the blade if you have one
5 #### I could n't ask for a better pizza cutter . It does the job , and it it does it flawlessly . No complaints .
5 #### It is kind of cheaply made but it does the job well . Hold the tool up against the piece you want to determine the angle and then tighten the screw . It holds the angle well . It does not give angle measures and is a tool for transferring an angle not measuring it .
4 #### I bought this for a Christmas present and they were very excited to get it but other than that , it 's the best I can do .
5 #### Never thought I 'd be writing a review for a vegetable brush . The fact that I am should illustrate how good this thing is , as is everything I own from OXO . The grip feels nice in your hand and allows for easy motion , and the bristles are firm and do n't wear out . I use it to wash fruits and veggies all the time .
5 #### I was a little apprehensive when I first poured water into this sprayer , wondering how it would build up enough pressure to actually spray . Well , no worries ! This is the best sprayer I have ever used in many years . Easy to pump the top and the sprayer nozzle is adjustable ... very fine mist , fine mist , small stream . Now I have to buy another one to keep my husband from taking mine ! He uses his in the shop - perfect for misting garden seedlings , or spraying wet paint off the screwdriver !
5 #### Elmer sez " I could not catch that wascally wabbit ! " but the unit is well constructed !
5 #### This is the best deal for 5/32 files . I know they wear out , so I know I will use them all .
4 #### As others have commented , the hose you get is a crap shoot . My remnants are a little weak , but they do the job intended . Worth it if all you need is a short connector .
5 #### It takes a little time to put this together . The reason being is that they are very adjustable and can support many shapes / sizes of equipment bases . I purchased one about 5 or 6 years ago . The orginal one has served be very well . Purchasing the second one was a simple decision . This is a very good product at a very good price .
5 #### I had an issue with loose outlets when I moved into my current home . A large percentage of my electrical outlets were just worn out . I even had a couple of outlets in the kitchen that a simple light power cord from a lamp would fall out and drop to the floor . My solution was to replace ALL the outlets in the house . The outlets cost about a dollar each or even less in 10 packs . If you are handy , you can shut off the power and replace them or have an electrician do this . I replaced about 30 outlets in 3 or 4 hours . For me , no more cords or transformers falling out of outlets . Usually when anything falls out of an outlet , is because the outlet receptacle is worn , not the item being plugged into that outlet . Many people do not understand this and fool around bending prongs and in general waste their time blaming the cord or transformer they are trying to power up , instead of the real problem . These Leviton are a good choice , and should last for quite a few years . I would not advise using the Quickwire terminals . Attach the wires to the screw terminals and tighten securely ,
1 #### I used algaefix in my two thousand gallon pond . It killed algae , all koi , all tadpoles and adult frogs were dying slowly . It will take me hundreds of dollars to replace my koi . I followed directions , I have aerator and waterfall . Who said it does n't kill fish is lying . They said the same thing about cigarettes ...
5 #### excellent cart needed to fill the tires with air but the thing is sturdy and reliable used it for the last month several times do n't be afraid to buy this as is is very durable
5 #### The weed eater string is exactly as advertised and packaging was in a bubble envelope . No problems and I expect it to perform well .
5 #### This hummingbird feeder is my favorite out of all I have tried and I have tried many of them . The hummers always come to this one over anything else I 've put out there and yes they are picky . I do n't mind spoiling my babies at all . I do make my own sugar water mixture and would n't touch the premade stuff with a 10 foot pole . It 's just not good for them with the dye in it . This feeder will stand up to just about any type of weather except for this sub zero stuff we are having right now I suppose . The hummers also like the little stands so that they can relax a bit while taking their fill of sweetness . I have several of these as I have found that having just one or two the hummers get territorial with them . Stinkers . Oh well , they are like children and they have to have their own way but I wo n't complain because they are my favorite babies .
5 #### Well made and the white is unique and quite nice to look at . Plastic but high quality . Case really has it together compared to my many other brands of pocket knives . There are more expensive pocket knives but for the price and USA made this is the best value no question . I have many other Case knives and they are all consistently well made and quality tools . I can not say that for some of the other name brand pocket knifes that I collect .
5 #### I thought this thing woulen't work and woud get returned immediately , because I bought a cheap plastic one on ebay once that looked the same but was too cheap , but this one slices medium potatoes in a split second very well .
5 #### these 2 saw blades are well worth you money if your looking for a good buy . i do alot of wood working building bird houses and feeders and other yard pieces . they cut extremely clean and last a long time .
5 #### i absolutely love this batter bowl . I make my own Kefir ( cultured milk , pronounced " kehfeer " , which has had wonderful effects on my health ) . It has to be strained , then poured into a quart jar . I had tried my 4 C measure and a bowl - both with issues . Was looking for something lightweight and big enough for my strainer to fit . This is it ! It 's a dream .
5 #### First thought I 'd ordered a replacement " TAPE for an old Unit . Got the Whole Tape - Measure ! But for the price , No complaints ! Thanks .
5 #### Original Dremel - quality and accuracy made in USA . Tried a chinese copy - poor - then found these on sale - perfect .
1 #### I have what was supposedly this exact same knife at my winter house . I bought it a few years ago and I love it . When I decided I needed a knife for my summer house I looked at all the fancy ones and decided that my Spanish - made Henkels was still the best way to go . So I ordered this one . What a disappointment ! My older knife is about 3/16 " to 1/4 " thick . It has heft and good balance . This pathetic excuse for a chef 's knife is only about 1/8 " thick . Yeah , I know that the marketing people like to be able to use words like " now lighter weight ! " or " easier on your wrists ! " in their advertisements , but this is ridiculous . There are lots of lightweight " chef 's " knives out there . How about just one really good , heavy , well - balanced one ? I guess I 'll probably send this flimsy thing back and keep using my crappy boning knife until I can find a good chef 's knife in an antique store somewhere ...
5 #### These spikes seem to really help my large house plants
5 #### Have n't broken it yet - and it 's working well as a crow - bar / pry - bar / smashie - tool . Very helpful with plywood and picket fence work .
5 #### Good quality and nice to have this flat whisk , I had no idea what I was missing without it .
4 #### Great product . Easy to install and works great . Used my own washers during installation . Probably should come with some washers .
5 #### I carry this in an antique car . I have n't had to use it , but it appeared to be well made .
5 #### I originally bought this knife because I needed a decent carving knife . This knife has since become my favorite knife . It is extremely sharp and comfortable to hold . It makes slicing meat thinly very easy . It is also sharp enough to slice a tomato without any issues . I have been using it for just about everything since I bought it . I will definitely be purchasing other knives from the same company .
5 #### great keys came with extensions which was a good thing other wise they would have been too short .
5 #### Work very well and cost 70 % less than the ones from Home Depot .
5 #### I love making salads with my Salad Spinner . I also grow leaf lettuce in my garden and the salad spinner works great to help me dry the lettuce after I cut and wash it . It is a must have have my kitchen .
4 #### bring on the Apocalypse and an endless supply of propane tanks , probably could boil a moose if you found a big enough pot ..
5 #### I was not sure how well it would work being as light as it is so , I tried it today . I split an entire wagon load of green Black Jack oak in about 15 minutes . One swing and it just broke apart .
5 #### this is a great little knife . It comes with 3 blades which is nice , and the knife has a light feel . Only thing you should know is that when it is shipped , the blades are not attached , and are stored within the handle of the knife . You need to open the knife with a phillips head screwdriver to assemble it . So make sure you have one of those .
5 #### I bought one for each of my 3 kids so they can read at night without having a bright light on . They are really bright for such a little light . The neck is very bendable and has lasted after over a year of heavy abuse from the kids . It also has two brightness levels , which is a plus .
1 #### These tongs are supposed to lock ... but they DO NOT . They were returned and the exact same item was shipped .... Tongs that DO NOT LOCK . The tongs are shown as they look when closed ... and they do not look like this at all . These are far too long to NOT have the option to lock them . The span , when open , takes up too much space in my utensil drawer and are unwieldy as they mingle with other small kitchen items in that drawer . I 've had to close them with a coffee bag twist - tie in order to get them to remain relatively flat when stored !
5 #### This is the same that comes with the 750 it works well for rough finish but but its not slick enough for me . I used the 220 to get a slicker finish and it works very well .
3 #### I know they told me these were 16 inches long , and it 's my fault for not thinking more about the length , but ... These are great for grill use , but not as practical in the kitchen . The product is good , I just do n't think they 're great for indoors , plus you have to find the right space to store them . They do lock , though , so that helps .
3 #### Works good so far only use it one time in my garage will have to wait for winter to really check it out .
2 #### I purchased several of these in various sizes while on an extended " deal of the day " .... Unfortunately several of these arrived with " bent " edges along the top edge of the container that the lid goes on .... As a result the tops do not set / sit properly . I am disappointed with this purchase and also disappointed that the product was shipped in that condition . Since there was no damage to the shipping containers I can safely assume that this was a manufacturing defect - so the quality control by rubbermade and also the Amazon team that allowed it to ship are lacking . So ... I 'm not pleased , but ca n't be bothered trying to make a return .... Just " live and learn " .....
5 #### Great way to save energy _ have it hooked to a pool pump and it works fine
5 #### This is the BEST can opener I have ever owned . So easy to attach to cut the first slot then it turns by hand so smooth ! Way better than an electric that awkwardly bumps around and takes minutes to attach for the first slot .
1 #### Since the operative idea is to have control over the fan , having the fan go on in the middle of the night for no apparent reason is aggravating . Is it the neighbor 's garage door opener ? The government 's time signal ? Minor fluctuations in the quality of electricity coming into the house ? Unknown . It 's summer , and the weather is mild , yet the fan will come on spontaneously , as will the light , which is a sleep killer in the middle of the night . The only solution is to turn the fan off at the switch , which means that if you WANT the fan on during the night , you 'll have to live with the light coming on at 3 a.m. Bad design , from an engineer who did n't field test the product . By the way , it 's the same with the Hunter fans that come with the remote control units .
5 #### This cooks so fast that it will save you money in the long run because you will be using less gas to cook with . The pot itself is stainless steel but the screws are not , just make sure to hand dry the areas where the screws are and it will not rust . I was told this when I called customer service . I 've used it twice and hand dried it and no problems but all benefits so far . Get one !
2 #### There is a sticker on the insert that states it is compatible with the Dewalt DWE7491RS 10 " table saw . Well maybe . If you want to use your riving knife for this model saw , you have to cut all the way through to the end of the insert . Which means you have to lift the insert by the finger hole and drag it through the blade . Although it does fit in the saw opening , I can not get it to adjust such that it fits flush with the saw table top . There just is n't enough adjustment screw length . Overall I 'm very disappointed with this insert for this model saw . Another issue is the lack of locking mechanism like the factory inserts . It probably would not be a problem if the insert fit flush in the opening but on my saw it will wobble because the friction mechanism on the side of the insert is enough to hold it in place .
5 #### The best . The jaws are fatter than the originals ( Irwin invented them ) , but some excess can be ground off to fit in tighter spaces without affecting the jaw strength .
5 #### I have purchased several types of lights from CBConcepts over the years and have been very happy with them . These landscaping lights ( for my " Malibu " system work as advertised .
5 #### I 'm very happy about the Flat - Top teeth on this ripping blade . It 's great for grooves , dados , and rabbets . My Home Depot does n't carry a flat top blade like this . This thing has made perfect rabbets much easier than with an ATB blade .
5 #### Came in on time exactly as described stay put while mixing pour spout does great less mess . Can mix a good deal of batter for pancakes or waffles . Measure marks make mixing easier also.light weight for keeping in rv .
2 #### Looks nice but does not work at all on our elongated / oval toilets . Never creates suction no matter the angle you use .
5 #### Fits my 8 gallon shop vac perfectly . Works great and appears nice and sturdy .
1 #### This is the worst product I have ever purchased in my adult life ! It arrived well packaged and in a timely manner however everything after that was negative . After assembling the parts I connected it to a hose to test it . Every connection leaked a lot of water . After installing an additional hose washer at each connection I was able to stem the leaks except for the one at the standpipe connection to the scarecrow head . Attempting to tighten that caused the female threaded collar to break . After gluing the collar back on I tested it and it worked a few times then the sprinkler head itself blew out of the scarecrow head . I found the pieces and reassembled it and shortly after that the glue joint broke and the unit became totally useless . The couple times it worked it was fun to watch and I believe would be successful at scaring away critters but this device is so poorly designed and made of such cheap fragile materials I can not possibly recommend it .
5 #### I have used quite a few of these , I am pleased with the product because it gets through the small opening of the glass feeders that I have and I am able to clean the sides of the feeders .
3 #### Not a bad knife . Sharp , seems to maintain the edge well enough . My main gripe is the handle is too light and too small for me .
2 #### Rip guide bent during first use when tightening the screw . It also does n't fit properly in my C7SB2 case where it should . Hard to recommend .... be gentle with it !
3 #### This item works well and looks good in the process . I use it frequently , and after a year still in good shape .
5 #### This hammer feels like a solid hammer . It does n't feel flimsy and brittle . It actually feels like you can do something with it . I really enjoy the leather handle . I used it to demo at work the other day . Worked wonders . Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality hammer .
5 #### Very happy with this weed gouging tool . Works great even in dry , hardened dirt .
3 #### Worked well , but never long ... This is the Second Zapper which has Shorted OUT . Only Used a Few Times in the course of the Year , but started crackling & sparking & Now USELESS . That 's Happened On 2 of These Zappers in the past 2 years ... Not all that cheap , & Not All That Happy . Buyer Beware :o (
5 #### I hope they hold up as well as the pair I 've owned for 40 years
5 #### Had the cord type spinner before , as expected lasted less then a year . This model Has large capacity , sturdy , well made . use it every day . Another plus looks great .
5 #### This works a whole better than the $ 30 one it is replacing that I had bought from lowes . The other one was 180 degree motion sensor and the light was constantly coming on by itself for some reason , sometimes at a rate of once every 5 minutes when it was windy .. since I installed this light , it only comes on when someone is in the driveway
5 #### This is exactly as advertised . It is a solid piece , feels substantial and does exactly what I wanted . The price on this was dramatically lower than the same thing at the local big box store and hardware store .
5 #### Works just fine , a real help when cutting longer grass .
5 #### The squirrels in Miami had no idea what the raw peanuts were , but once they got the taste we had to get more . They went NUTS over them !
5 #### Better than expected . I have two 45 year old Stanley tape measures that look identical to the picture which are still in service in other tool boxes so I know the quality is good . I bought a new one to keep in my office and I did not realize it has a wider tape , which is a bonus , and quality looks the same as my tried and true 45 year old ones . It is worth buying this tape measure . I recently bought two " new " tape measures at a yard sale but they were junk ; once the tape was pulled out they would not rewind . My Stanley tape measures have been working without any problems for 45 years !
5 #### Outstanding whisk . Works much better than the old , less - flexible whisk that I had . Easy clean - up too .
5 #### Great tool . I use it to remove nails . The curved head allows for rocking . It has a strong cutter edge .
5 #### Replaced the blades for the first time on my planer . the blade installation was not very easy . the end product looks good . however , I seem to notice little snipe which I never noticed with original blades !
5 #### What can I say ? OXO products are awesome and this batter bowl does the job . We make many cupcakes and you can mix and pour all in the same container . Excellent quality . Love it .
5 #### Weber grills are the best . I have an old model with the three sets of 3 holes that must be shut individually , and the ash falls into a tray underneath . I like to save my charcoal , so these little closing devices get hot . the Weber grill I just bought ( as a gift ) is the " gold " model with a single lever that can shut all of the bottom vents , plus a built in ash catcher . A great improvement on a great product .
5 #### Got it as a gift , it works very well , and has created many tasty meals in a short amount of time ! its simple to use , but read the instructions first ! the included cooking times book is a nice touch . I am happy with this purchase of the aluminum version vs the steel , the heat spreads evenly and is lighter . Costs a bit more but is worth it not to have burnt food at the bottom ! it includes different racks as well for steaming . This is a good size for medium sized meals !
5 #### Flows a lot of water . Quite large . I use it on my 90 gallon reef tank . Keep the sponge filter on .
3 #### It caused a problem to my Dewalt Router . There was a lot of vibration associated with it 's use . I believe this size of router bit should have four ( 4 ) flutes rather than two ( 2 ) .
3 #### Was great while it was working . Now , 7 months later , the temperature is 80 degrees at all times . I would think you could trust a name like Springfield to manufacture an item of better quality .
5 #### This utensil was exactly what we were looking for for a nice heavyweight serving spoon . Very happy with this purchase .
5 #### Fits my old shop vac and and really cuts down on the dust .
4 #### Whenever I see a bunch of positive reviews and one negative one , I think to myself , " well , that person does n't know how to use it " or something like that . So , now I am the one that maybe missed something . The spreader worked fabulously well the first time . I am trying to spread that grasshopper bait , it looks like wheat bran . It was fluffing out lightly in all directions and giving an even disbursal in several directions . It was perfect . The second and subsequent times , the spinner does n't seem to have an effect , if I shake the thing , it will spit out clumps , but this is not spreading . They drop straight down in clumps . No wonder they discontinued making this thing . It might act differently with a material more granular with weight to it , but that is just a wild hope . Maybe if I take it apart , I will be able to see what the problem is . I am not counting on it being easy to take apart and fix . This thing is a gamble at best . A year later : I have to revisit this review to say that there is an adjustment button in the thumb area when you hold the handle of this thing . i had inadvertantly turned it to " off " . when i corrected this , it worked fine . i am sorry to leave a negative report , indeed it was my own ignorance that caused the problem .
5 #### Ca n't beat for the price . Changed out the valve in a few minutes . No expertise needed !
5 #### I bought this Mighty Mite to replace my 1998 identical canister though a different color combo . I loved that vacuum because I could easily carry it around the house to dust , and clean out the floor vents , to keep the dust off of my upholstered furniture , to clean the tops of door and window frames and ceiling vent fans . etc etc . You get it ............ it 's a handy and light dynamo . You can just pull it along with you too on it 's 3 wheels . There are 2 large ones in the back and a third up front . Tripod of wheels . I hope that this new vacuum is as long lived as it 's predecessor .
5 #### I start many of my vegetables for my outside garden indoors to get a head start . I have been playing with some different elements trying to improve results and these earthworm castings have been one of my biggest noticeable changes . I amend my initial soil with the castings , and when I repot I add a nice layer of this stuff in the pot to set the root ball on . The price is great and out of the few bags I have ordered I have never found any trash or twigs etc ... There are definitely noticeable results with using these castings ! update : I have ordered a few bags of this since my first . I have actually started producing my own but I order this to supplement me when I need more and it has done a good job .
5 #### Read the reviews for the digital version and chose to go manual . Glad I did . Saved a few bucks and ca nt go wrong with manual setup . Great purchase and recommend .
5 #### Heavy duty . nice , good quality . Need double recipe to fill this deep one .
5 #### Keeps the electric water heater on when needed . No need to keep 40 gallons of water up to temperature all day when just needed for a shower or sink use . Figures out to be around 20 % savings on the monthly electric bill . Great timer that has been in use for a long time in the industry .
5 #### Seems to be solid product , easy to program and use . Love the battery backup ... the timer arrived already charged and still working .
5 #### This is my second order of these . Traps and kills flies on a mass genocide level .
5 #### Great for any home -- the wall - mount was a bonus as well . I taught my kids how to use these and they are the perfect size for anyone age 5 + .
5 #### This is a great all around wood glue , should be in everybody 's shop .
5 #### I have an excellent filter and UV light in my pond but because there is no shade I get algae build up every once in a while . The POND CARE ALGAEFIX does a great job of clearing up blanket algae immediately . One application is all I need . It is important that you follow the directions exactly and make sure that you pour the chemical into a bucket of water then pour it into moving water like a fountain or waterfall so it disperses quickly . Never harms my Koi fish - they never seem to even realize it 's in there . Does n't take the place of a good filter and UV light but in extreme cases it sure does the job . It wo n't do a thing to string or fibrous algae but then it is n't meant to .
3 #### You really ca n't have much of a bend in this , otherwise it slows down significantly . If it is used pretty much straight , then it is great to work with .
5 #### Got these blades at a good price and I am happy as could be with them . It is a good variety of blades from a trusted brand .
3 #### This lasted me about two years before the plastic handle broke off . For the price , I am surprised it lasted as long as it did ! I am sure I dropped it more than enough times . Overall , I do not regret this purchase .
5 #### We have used these for years , they are so nice .
5 #### Standard quality of a reliable and good China Bristle . I buy them repeatedly and find them quite satisfactory . Buy with confidence !
4 #### Works well in Mexico .... takes a few hours until you see some results .... IT DOES WORK .
5 #### an excellent product at a perfect price with a very , very FAST delivery time .
4 #### Works great but instructions are lacking . It took a while to figure out how this thing works .
5 #### Wore my old one out after 10 plus years really like it
5 #### This will suck the hardwoods up .... Great little machine and our recently widowed daughter was smiling in minutes after trying it . Things always seem to go wrong all at once ... Each one fixed is a step forward ..
5 #### This is the smoothest and nicest can opener I have ever used . So far it opens cans with an ease I have not ever experienced before . I have come to really appreciate OXO as a design company that cares about what they are making and takes pride in it . They do n't always make the very best in a category but when they do n't they are still very close to the mark . I would be hard pressed to guess how many OXO designed products you would find in my kitchen . I also have the " Made in USA Can Opener " which is the traditional design and of course made in US and a very heavy well crafted product , but I have to say this approach with the extra large knob is a winner and in my opinion a better improved design over other openers .
2 #### I bought one of these for my father , a retired electrician who occasionally still takes jobs . At first , he loved this little drill . The only shortcomings he noticed in the beginning were the lack of a keyless chuck and the fact that the paddle - switch could be dangerous if you were n't paying close attention to what you were doing . In the end though , what became this drills downfall was the cheap construction inside the housing . After only a few jobs , a plastic component around the motor cracked , allowing the teeth to slip under strain . A DeWalt service shop charged ... to fix this problem . The second hole it drilled after that caused the gears to give out . It was a great idea , but DeWalt needs to send this one back to the design board for more work ... I wish now that I had spent the extra money on the bigger DeWalt right angle drill .
5 #### Perfect Fit for my old boy 's ax . Slipped right inside nice and tight and after the wedge was driven in the ax head it will never come off . Truly Satisfied !
5 #### Durable and effective . We have two ! The oldest over 10 years old at least .
5 #### For a wire cutter , staple remover & etc . , this tool ca n't be beat in the long run . There are cheaper cutters ; but only one brand is a Channellock . The curved jaw helps to pull out staples a lot easier by using a rocking motion .
5 #### I can agree with other reviewers that though it 's case is plastic , it is a rugged and sturdy piece of equipment . I remember the metal cased Stanleys my dad had from job sites and this is a fitting replacement . I 'm very pleased with this measure .
5 #### I love this product . I read a great many of the reviews before purchasing and found the reviews very helpful . The 96JZ is very light , easy to use , picks up especially well on our kitchen rugs ( used in kitchen and dining areas only ) and I find the width to be just right to get into corners and tight spots . Having a bonus battery pack really saves time . This has been one of my wisest purchases .
3 #### Seems like it does not work like it did a few years back
3 #### Not sure yet if this is a help , I need more time , they sink very fast too
5 #### I have never worn a utility knife out . In fact I 'm not sure I 've ever had one for more than a year . They always walk off when I 'm not looking . I have high hopes for this knife . I 've had one for several months now . It is far more visible than the standard grey we all have . Maybe it wo n't get lost as easily . The easy blade change is nice . I do n't always have a screwdriver on hand . I have noticed that the blade retraction lever gets stuck more than others I have used . A little graphite every so often helps it out . All said , I would buy this knife again .
4 #### Suction is above average . Blower function is useless . Unit also runs hot . Would not buy again , but it is what it is .
5 #### The brackets are all they profess to be and more . They are presently holding freshly cut oak wood from a neighbors yard that are awaiting to be split for next winter . Aside from holding firewood , they can be used to make a table / shelf . I am very pleased with the product .
5 #### My unit is an older model which is called " The Boss " but is the very same as this . Mine has EXCELLENT suction and I do n't mind that it is a little noisy . Mine is used for cleaning up around the woodstove . It does an excellent job of sucking up ash and wood particles of various sizes . I do n't understand the negative reviews , unless these people received " lemons " . I would highly recommend this vac for small jobs , I do n't think it was intended to be used for whole house vacuuming .
4 #### Really nice , quality spoon rest with plenty of room for different sized cooking utensils . My only problem with it .. and the reason I knocked off a star is .. Amazon sent me a damaged one and it 's not worth sending back . They really need to practice quality control .. I've seen this complaint on many items and seriously wonder if they buy loads of " seconds " to make money ... ? It 's a nice spoon rest however , and worth the money .
5 #### Love this ! Well constructed . Easy to use . Very large capacity .
1 #### My wife bought the same package as shipped by Amazon(one pound , but in a round can ) locally for $ 1.98 . I think I have noticed that the " Prime " items have their price raised to more than cover the so called " free shipping " .
5 #### I was looking at these for awhile . My old , heavy splitting maul 's handle was about to go . We had a large tree taken down by a very experienced tree guy and I had it cut up into firewood lengths to split , which he also did . This was the axe both he and his assistant used . I asked him about it ; he said it 's the best he 'd ever used . Some friends had gifted him with a custom forged maul and this Fiskars was better for the job . Mine arrived and it really is amazing . It 's much lighter than what I 'm used to , has a great edge and is easy to stroke through anything I used it on , both oak and some gnarly pine . It did get stuck a few times but no worse than my old maul and it was n't that hard to pry it out . Nice protective cover to hang it out of the way when not in use . Might be the last axe / maul I 'll ever need .
5 #### Filtrete will always be my brand of choice for A / C filters . I only wish this size was more readily available in stores and available in higher levels of filtration at lower prices !
1 #### Arrived with a huge chip out of one side . Appears very brittle to me . I understand that damage can happen during shipping with rough handling but for something like this , I would have expected better materials .
5 #### Perfect cutters for small jobs . Another garden tool for my collection .
5 #### This can opener is amazing . At first I thought it was broken . To my surprise I had opened a can thinking that it was n't doing anything . Sharp blade and no effort to open a can . I love it .
5 #### Handy size . Cooks delicious dishes and meals w/o a hitch ! EVERYBODY needs one ! Priced less than 3 qt . sauce pan and it is WAY MORE versatile ! EASY instructions . Dishwasher safe . So , what are you waiting on ?
4 #### Good product for the money . Helps keep house clear from dust when you are not at home .
5 #### Any woodworking shop needs lots of clamps of different types . These handscrews are particularly useful for clamping two or more pieces of wood together across their thickness rather than their width . Of course other types of clamps will do that too - some will be cheaper and faster -but none will work better . There is no comparison between these handscrews and say , quick acting bar clamps ( like Irwin Quick Grip ) . The primary difference is that you can apply far more force with a handscrew than with most any other type of clamp you would use in its place . These are also great for temporarily clamping lumber to your workbench or to a jig while machining . With a handscrew , you can be confident that the workpiece will not move . I enthusiastically recommend these clamps and their big brothers .
4 #### i was hoping this would catch my stragglers up .. but i did n't want to be holding back my stronger plants , so i added it to both , my healthy plant is loving it , my straggler does n't give a damn , still being lazy
5 #### works great on all different sizes ... easy to hold . no rubber on handle ( i like that ) . goes through diswasher . glad i bought it !
5 #### Very nice snips I used them for my siding job on my garage .
4 #### My only gripe is the plastic bottom of the system could be a little thicker and the plant containers could be of better quality . One of my plant containers was cracked when I received it . I would recommend this product . It 's a nice little set up !
2 #### feels very cheap in the hand , also had paint defects like large bubbles
5 #### Super easy to install and use on a 3/4 in black pipe
5 #### nice tea infuser for the price ! I have never used loose leaf teas , and this holds up well !
4 #### I got this chop saw about a year or so ago . It works great with good power to go through thick 2 " and 3 " stainless pipe and tube I have cut with it . I would suggest finding the 2414b model as being able to " rock " the saw helps to cut through tough steel . It seems like when you cut steel with a normal chop saw it gets half way through and does n't cut as fast based on the angle . The 2414b lets you basically adjust the saw angle so that it gets through it quicker . I would give it 5 stars but my saw developed a problem . It tripped the breaker as soon as I turned it on , without even cutting steel . Took it to service and they corrected the problem . I debated with many saws and tried many , but this is the best .
5 #### This products helps build the soil and holds moisture great ! ! My plants and I are very happy ! ! Thanks so much !
5 #### These measuring spoons are perfect ; Their accurate and I like how you can slip them on and off the ring easily . The handles are just like all Oxo good grips handles their soft and give these small spoons some heft making them easier to hold . One reviewer mentioned that the measuring marks [ 1 tbs , ect ] wears off . I think that may be because they used the dishwasher to clean them . Although these spoons are dishwasher safe , personally I always wash and dry little things like this by hand it makes them last much longer , the dishwasher just seems like over kill . I have recently replaced everything in my kitchen with stainless steel mostly Oxo products and these spoons match everything else . I 'm very happy with this purchase .
4 #### This product is something I use frequently at work , so I decided to get one for home use . I tend to solder a lot of my speaker cable connections together instead of just using crimp connections . This is definitely not appropriate for more detailed work and it can be awkward at times to use depending on the level of intricacy involved . However , the product is great if you use it for the intended purpose . It will heat the work piece quickly and will function well for a long time even under heavy use . The light bulbs are n't an issue for me because I light my work areas well .
5 #### I 've had very bad experience with inexpensive toilet valves , the sort typically found in the local hardware store . So I was somewhat skeptical about the Korky Quietfill . I also have tried expensive , rugged all - brass ones ( $ 25 range ) available from plumbing distributors . These lasted a couple of years , but 3 of the 5 toilets in my home began to have shut - off problems . Corrosion probably began to build up in the metal valves . I suppose these could have been refurbished , but this would have been lots of trouble . I replaced all 5 toilet valves with the Korky Quietfill . Installation was very easy , adjustment quite straightforward , and the clearly - written instruction sheet tells how to clean the valve should it ever become necessary . The valve works well , filling quickly and quietly . The 5 year warranty inspires confidence that the Korkys will last for a while .
5 #### Cooking without a thermometer is not for me . Once you get used to using one , you are lost . Meat today is getting too expensive to take a chance cooking without one , besides who wants to waste a good bbq with friends . I want them to talk about how good it turn out , not how I need to improve .
1 #### I bought the wrong size and returned it . My fault .
4 #### I purchased this stand for my belt / disc sander and it fits perfectly . I also discovered it is just right for my bench top drill press so I purchased another . Nice and sturdy with convenient storage underneath .
5 #### This 10 inch supplements the 7 inch channellock that I have . With both there has not been a repair job that I have not been able to complete . A excellent tool .
5 #### Box . Electrical . Serves the purpose well . Nothing else to say .
5 #### Great little veggie brush . Bristles are sturdy enough to do the job , yet soft enough to use on the delicate skin of tomatoes . Like most Oxo products , design is very well thought out . Highly recommend .
1 #### Worst nozzle I 've ever owned . It will barely create a spray pattern , and the same for the direct stream . You may as well use a regular garden hose without a nozzle and just use your thumb to create the pattern you want . I actually just took it out and added it to a new faucet I had placed on the other side of the house and I hate the time has past to return it .
5 #### Recently , it seems like a lot of people have been telling me to pick one of these up . To be honest , it seemed a little too - good - to - be - true , so I resisted since I did n't want to waste my money . I have to say that waiting was a huge mistake ! I finally did pick one up for a bow hunt a few weeks ago , and it works like magic ! Once I got into my tree stand , I fired this baby up and just sat it by my feet . Needless to say , after it warmed up for a few minutes , the mosquitoes absolutely vanished . I could actually see them being repelled by the invisible barrier ! Once I turned it off to get out of the stand , the mosquitoes would reappear - and that 's when I got eaten , so I started leaving it on and carrying it back to the truck ( even though it was more effective when I was stationary ) . Anyway , I ca n't believe how effective this is ! And I ca n't believe it took me so long to get one ! Now I 've been using it for everything . When we sit out with the neighbors at night , when I 'm out reading on the porch , and when I 'm at the range - now I need one of the holsters so I can keep it with me all the time . :)
5 #### these are great and very easy to use . I had to cut quite a few branches off a tree and I thought I would cut a few yesterday and then some more today but these are so easy to use that once I got started I just kept going and cut all the branches in one day .
5 #### new trucks now come a half a foot shorter , gotta be able to lay a ladder down in the bed and this fit the bill perfectly
5 #### Received item all good . Sharp new chain for my chainsaw .
4 #### works great , use with LED bulbs . but I had to lengthen the bulb elbow for ceiling mount on my porch
5 #### HANG IN THE SUN AND YOU WILL BE THRILLED WITH THE LIGHT SHOW IT PUTS OUT !
4 #### These are great replacements to my range . The halogen lights you could feel the heat coming off them . These are cool to the touch , meaning less electricity being used . Also good for preventing burns as our range has semi hidden buttons and the lights are nearby those buttons . They are of the same brightness as the halogen it replaced . I knocked off one star because after a couple months of use , one of the clear plastic lenses that covers the LED fell off . The light still worked so I super glued the clear lens to the rest of it . It may have been due to steam from cooking but honestly , we do n't do that kind of cooking that often . It 's now been months since I glued it and it has stayed attached and the other lens never fell off .
5 #### this is like the 6th one of these I have bought for the kids to keep with their keys for help finding them at night ........
5 #### FIRST OFF YOU CAN NEVER GO WRONG WITH ANY OXO ITEM . QUALITY EVERY TIME ! THESE TONGS ARE SO WELL MADE & I LOVE THE LOCKING MECHANISM . IF YOUR LOOKING FOR TONGS~ SNAP ONE UP !
5 #### Fits perfectly in the small coin pocket on jeans . I wish one of the three flat head screwdrivers were replaced by an awl .
5 #### I use this a lot , especially when building and rebuilding AK47s . Makes it a lot easier to get into weird spots and positions
5 #### I received the dust collection bag sooner than I had expected . It fit perfectly and it 's now collecting all the dust from my table saw . Clean - up is so much easier . Thank you , Tom Jenkins
5 #### These bits are crazy sharp . I only used it on a small job , but it cut nice and clean , threw chips all over the place . I would typically buy a cheaper bit than Freud for what little use I get out of them . Considering how nice this cut compared to some china cutters I have purchased , I do n't know if I can go back to the cheap ones .
5 #### It seems like every couple of years I have to purchase a new oscillating sprinkler . I hope this one will last longer . I do like the wide area it covers and the ability to adjust the amount of area you want to water . My last sprinkler had a timer but once I forgot to go turn off the facet when the time was up and it burst the hose . Granted .... it was an old hose . I decided to just stick to the regular oscillating sprinkler and just add a timer to the facet . This works for me .
5 #### It smells like horse doo Doo , which is , I imagine , one reason it 's so effective ! Use in same - brand 's container with small amount of added water , you will see big dead flies floating in it VERY soon . Great alternative to expensive fly zappers and ugly fly tape !
2 #### my homemade root beer tastes more like sweet cough syrup mixed with dirt
5 #### Ca n't be beat . good hardened alloy steel and adjusts to precision . The rosarians favorite
4 #### Worked great for my needs . Cutting 10 " vigas to size , just do n't push , let the saw do it 's job .
5 #### So nice to buy this stuff in bulk , if for no other reason than I go through it so fast . I 've got chickadees , nuthatches , titmice , downy woodpeckers , along with a couple of other WP varieties all clamoring for this suet . It 's all I can do to keep my dogs off of it but that 's another story . It shipped fast , was packaged nicely and the birds LOVE it .
5 #### After years of searching and I mean years I have finally found the vacuum of my dreams ! I live in a house with pets , kids , stairs , carpet and hardwood floors . I wanted a vacuum that could do the following - Strong suction for pet hair - Light weight for carrying up and down stairs - Easy to use attachments while working on stairs - Built for hard surface flooring - Lots of attachments and long cord This vacuum has made clean up much easier . The design is fantastic and makes vacuuming hardwood a breeze . In addition , this is an excellent price . I would recommend this product .
5 #### Gone Through 420 's ! 430 's ! And A 440 ! All Good ! But That One Pair Of 460"s ! Total Game Changer ! Kind Of Big ! And Heavy ! Carried In The Tool Pouch Though ! But These Baby 's Really Shine When It Comes To Bite And Leverage ! Leverage Can Also Mean Easier ! Curved Handles Help Hand Stay On All Day Long ! Lots Of 2 Inch Conduit ! Envious Looks ! Everywhere They Were Spotted ! Like Thor 's Hammer ! Damn Near All Powerful ! Laughing All Way ! Thanks Amazon ! Need A Bigger Stocking ? 2 Pairs ?
1 #### I guess i did n't read the description correctly but this thing is huge & flimsy and does n't fit in any of my drawers . I gave it to my cousin !
5 #### Easy to hold , easy to use . Get a shorter set for smaller jobs . I use this one mostly for the grill where distance is an advantage ... especially when I 'm grilling .
3 #### It is ok , but if you try to do something a little heavy duty it will break , but for light tasks it is great .
4 #### Of course- we 're having a cloudy / thunderstorm day here in central Fla- but I was able to read the instruction & " manually " set it- & know it 'll " properly- automaticaly " set when it can recieve the radio signal . It 's a gift to my community- to replace the " tiney / regular clock " on the parch at our pool , ( A definite improvement ! ) Enjoy !
5 #### Use this product as part of my pest control and find it helpful !
5 #### Well worth the price , could not find anything this good . I 'd use this level against any level and mine is just as accurate . I also like the lightness , which makes it easy to carry .
5 #### I 've had mine for 8 years or more , hangs in like a champ ! Both the metal and the rubber ... sitting in water for too , long , going through dishwasher cycles . Bought this new one for my mother .
4 #### Itdoes the job , but it requires many tries , and the cut is not as sharp as I want it . But , it is a good price and it works adequately .
4 #### i really like this item , now my biscuits get done and crispy brown on the bottom . Reheating pizza is also awesome , no soggy bottom !
5 #### This is an awesome mower . It 's actually a lot easier to use than a gas or electric mower , but it takes longer so it 's great for small yards .
5 #### These are great little vacuums , easy to carry around and use .
5 #### its a hammer . not much too it . Estwing makes some of the best so if you buy this one it will last .
5 #### Love this product , just have to remember to reset if utilities go out .
5 #### Great price for this brand and quality . Owned several other brands and they do not stand up to this one .
4 #### This product is as advertised . Satisfactorily made and serves the purpose for which it was designed . Would recommend it to others .
4 #### WAYY less expensive here than local stores . The 3 I tried all worked fine , be sure as with all halogen bulbs to wear gloves or similar and not get any of the oils from your skin on the bulb , or they will likely eventually shatter . Been going strong for a couple of months now in our new bathroom fixture , will probably be a while before I need to buy more !
5 #### Works just as advertised . It really removes water from lettuce and I find that storing washed produce in this keeps it fresh and ready for use . Very satisfied with purchase .
5 #### Works great , it 's used all the time and we love it . I would recommend this to anyone . Fast shipping too !
2 #### It 's on the small side for most toaster ovens , and it rusts terribly , starting within a month or so of owning it . Disappointing .
5 #### works great , realitively quiet , no dust on the exhaust side of the vacuum , nice value . Works best on hard surfaces , on carpet it has a difficult time collecting all the dirt but that would be expected in this time of vacuum . Light weight and simple , not too complex where a lot of things woould break . Uses bags and filters that really do help keep the house clean while using it - no dust blowing out of the vacuum like a lot of other stlyes do .
5 #### These are excellent knives that cut very well and stay sharp . Highly recommended for cutting up good grass fed beef steaks and such .
5 #### These things are massive . Simple to adjust , big jaws , lots of torque . Nice to see quality tools with a lifetime warranty still made in the USA .
5 #### I made cashew turtles and could never find a double boiler . I had looked everywhere . Then I found this one . I did n't think it was going to be as good but serve it 's purpose . It is the perfect size for my needs . The pots are thin , but not cheap feeling . It is great quality and the design is great . Very simple and both pots are functional on their own as well . I am very pleased with this item .
5 #### My hummingbirds love it - hang it from an overhang by the front door which I can see from the kitchen - love my little visitors .
5 #### Great OXO product . Perfect size for cooking and serving . Very durable . Delivered when expected and in good condition .
5 #### Great little cutting tool for flat sheet metal , straight cuts or turns . Needs help with hand shears on bends , or angles .
5 #### Have n't used it and hope I do n't have to . Located in garage just in case . Replaced one that had dropped pressure below green level .
5 #### For the nutrition , these are a great value . I 've been looking into sprouting seeds as a way to supplement a healthy diet , and this is one of the better deals out there for small scale . There are better bulk deals , but some people do n't plan on sprouting 5lbs of beans any time soon . The sprouting project ended up being a good activity with the little ones too , teaching about plant life and having very distinct observable growth every 12 hours or so . A good way to teach some responsibility too , depending on how you sprout them -- got ta keep them watered and in a bright area ( if you want green sprouts instead of white ) .
5 #### The thin flap does great getting cookies off the sheet which is precisely what I wanted it for ! Hope to use this years to come .
5 #### It works like promised and sprays exactly where I want it to go . The one problem I have with it is that it sprays a greater volume than the old nozzle and maintaining pressure is a problem with these Gilmore Sprayers . The wand also came loose a couple of times at the end closest to my hand the first time I used it but I eventually got a tight enough fit that the leaking stopped . If you are replacing the wand on an older Gilmore Sprayer , also get the Sprayer Replacement Valve R58C.
4 #### They 're not without flaws but I 'm glad I found out about these regardless . The drill guide did n't work for me so now I just use it to mark the hole . These and the T Jax are the ticket if you work alone like me . They are overpriced for what you get but the investment makes sense to me .
5 #### So awesome ! ! So glad I read the reviews and bought this ! Works great ! !
1 #### rats wo n't eat it . Ground squirrels love it . If you hate ground squirels put this stuff in a rat trap and you 'll kill them all .
5 #### This is a great little trap that captures fleas and other bugs with just a light and sticky pad . These pads are very sticky , and last several months . Highly recommended .
5 #### These blades are great . I put them through the paces right away by clamping two 1/2 " pine boards together and attempted to cut a fine line through both simultaneously and these blades held up fine and made a nice curved cut . Nice improvement over the blades that came with my PORTER - CABLE PC600JS 6 Amp Orbital Jig Saw . The fit perfect and worked great .
5 #### I have the 3 " ( < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/OXO - Good - Grips-3 - Inch - Mini - Strainer / dp / B001713L84 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">OXO Good Grips 3 - Inch Mini Strainer</a > ) , 6 " and 8 " strainers in this design . The 3 " is extremely small so personally I would recommend buying only the 6 & 8 " sizes unless you have something in particular you would use the 3 " strainer for . Overall these strainers are very sturdy , the handle is solidly fixed to the strainer , and the mesh is very rigid and keeps it 's shape well ( you ca n't poke it and make it deform ) . The holes are very small which allows you to strain almost anything without losing part of what you 're straining . These may be a bit more expensive than your average strainer but the quality makes them worth the extra money and I 'm confident they will hold up for a long long time .
5 #### High quality and durable . I 've owned this for 6 years now and there are no problems with it , including no rust anywhere .
5 #### This organic stuff goes a long way as an additive . I am extremely satisfied by this formula . In addition to Fox Farm Grow Big and Tiger Bloom which provide all the NPK nutrients , Big Bloom ( which is of little nutrient value ) has all the micro nutrients and beneficial compounds that help nutrient uptake and root health . It 's almost impossible to ' burn ' your plants with this stuff , but you definitely can with the other 2 . I would start off at half strength and work up from there based on their provided feeding chart . Big Bloom and the other two , ( with the addition of Cal - Mag ) is all you need to grow amazing plants . I have never seen my tomatoes do so well . Just remember less is more with these concentrated nutrients . Additionally , if you are using this to increase the biodiversity of beneficial bacteria and fungi in your soil ( all which are crucial for root health / nutrient uptake / faster growth ) then make sure to use carbon filtered water to get the full benefit of Big Bloom ... the chlorine in tap water wreaks havoc on that ecosystem .
5 #### We 've had 2 of these bird feeders for years . They are very well made , with a metal body and very strong plexiglass.window . They really work , the weight of the squirrel closes off the feeding area and keeps him out . A few things you do need to know though . You do have to adjust the feeding perch so that it closes up with the weight of a squirrel but once that 's set up it works like a charm . It 's best to hang it or place it on a pole that is not near anything else that will allow the squirrel to bypass the feeding perch and just dig right in . The only down side to this feeder is that after filling the feeder you must lift up the bottom of the feeder to latch to the top of the feeder and that is cumbersome . Secondly I do wish this company made a feeder with design with a larger perch . Blue jays and grackles are too large for the perch and do attempt to eat from the feeder but really are n't able to perch . I watch them make attempt after attempt but they just ca n't fit on the perch . But it works well , for any birds smaller than a blue jay including , sparrows , nuthatches , cardinals , finches , cowbirds and small woodpeckers .
5 #### I recently needed to set up a second kitchen and was very pleased to see that these knives , which I have been using for numerous years , are still sold . These are the best steak knives I have ever discovered . My original set have aged well , remaining sharp and blemish - free . They are also my go - to knife when I need to slice a tomato .
4 #### I was skeptical , but the moles have appeared to move on some place else , will continue to use them with rechargeable batteries .
2 #### I used Perky Pet feeders for many years and was always satisfied , however they must have changed their quality control people because the ones they sell now are junk . If you just screw the bottle on to the base snugly , they leak , and if you try to tighten them they twist off and have to be discarded . The flowers and the wasp guards do not stay on after a couple of washings and have to be glued on .
5 #### So far I have installed two of the 12 bulbs and the have worked fine so far . Time will show if the quality is up to par .
5 #### Wow , this is a terrific product . My old head broke and i needed a new one . This is a bit larger ( 22 " ) , but because of the increased weight and the clever connection to the pole that lets you control head direction , it actually cuts my vacuuming time in half . The reason is both because of wider head and more efficient suction , but also because the weight and control lets me vacuum just as well on the pull stroke . With lighter heads , they would come off the bottom when pulling , but this head is heavy enough to keep working on the pull stroke , and with the easy ability for the pole to redirect the head , the 60,000 gal pool is clean in 15 minutes !
5 #### These loppers take care of some big branches , saves me from having to get the saw . Bought a new property recently that needed a little cleanup on the landscaping , and these have been a huge help . Lightweight , sharp , and strong .
4 #### Half of the protective feet were missing when my 2 racks arrived ! I thought about returning them , but realized the feet would just get lost anyways . I suppose a dish towel under the rack will have to suffice to protect my tabletop !
4 #### I 've had three pairs of these and I love them because I keep buying them when they inevitably break . Fiskars sent me a replacement for the first set that broke , but I felt guilty after they broke too because I thought I may have been at fault by being too hard on them . Anyway , they DO cut great , the size is awesome and they are so easy to use . I will just keep on buying them even if I have to get a new pair every 18 months !
5 #### I needed a 75 ' version so I added this 25 ' size to my 50 ' hose of this same type . It is lightweight and easy to deal with . In fact , it 's so much more maneuverable , I 'm really surprised . We 've had some hot weather these last few days so I 've already had to water considerably and this hose has made the chore much less awkward . I also like the fact that I can spray the vegetable garden and not worry about toxic stuff from the hose material mixing with the water and affecting my crop . I 've replaced all my hoses with this type and am very pleased with them .
5 #### To me its one of the better ways to BBQ and smoke in tons of flavor into chicken , lamb , and beef . This addition will add a new dimension to your Weber and works very well .
3 #### It is big and cools the house . It is more powerful than the smaller two - fan models which is why I got it . BUT BE SURE TO CHECK WINDOW SIZE . I could not put it where I intended . Only the largest windows in the living room were big enough .
5 #### I have larger loppers , but the short handles permit cutting in tight spaces . I think it is a great tool overall .
5 #### My wife does a lot of work in her gardens and was getting tired of schlepping 5/8 " garden hoses around . The 1/2 " hoses are much lighter and she loves them .
1 #### Do not waste your money . When the unit works the water is nice and clear but you can not count on it . I have had two units within 11 months the first malfunctioned within two weeks and was returned to the store where I bought it for a replacement . The second unit malfunctioned two days ago after only being used since May . I contacted customer service of PondMaster ( Danner Manufacturing , Inc ) requesting they stand behind their product by replacing the unit . They told me to box it up send it to them using FedEx or UPS at my cost and they would inspect and test it and maybe then they would repair or replace the unit . I asked how long this process would take seeing how my pond would be going untreated . No answer , no concerns about their customers . After the failure of two units within 11 months ( 5 months of use ) one would think they would offer better customer support . Their product is junk as well as their customer support .
3 #### I did n't see a difference in activity after using the product .
5 #### Very sharp and comfortable to use . Use to trim rose bushes . Have also easily cut 1/2 " diameter sticks .
2 #### I was disappointed in the person that works for this company . My pan was packaged very well . It arrived on time . Someone sent me a pan that was scratched inside one cup . I will not order from again . I have ordered another Popover pan from Nordic Ware . This is the reason I gave it 2 stars .
5 #### It easily opens cans without leaving sharp edges . Large handle makes it especially easy to use .
1 #### These are cheaply made gloves . The stitching came apart on the right hand glove where the " palm patch " is stitched to the glove , also the stitching came apart on the thumb of the right hand glove . It was six weeks with very minimal use . I contacted Wells Lamont because it was past Amazon 's 30 day return policy . The company never replied to email or phone calls .
5 #### It 's great . Rainbird had the marketfor many years until ( apparently ) their patent expired . Then the cheap plastic imitators entered the market with their leaky junk . We trashed a couple of them when we received and began to use this well - made ( en Mexico ) device . It 's made of metal and well - crafted . The only caveat is that this product does not include the spike to anchor it in the ground . It appears it is meant to screw into an existing 1/2 " pipe already installed in the ground . Fortunately , we were able to adapt it to the spike from one of the cheap products we trashed and it works fine . My advice is to pay a bit more and get this well - made device .
5 #### Bought as refills for traps . Works as well as the enclosed with M380 Fly Magnet 1 - Quart Reusable Trap With Bait . I use this in the barn , near my ducks , in the doggie area , and where I spend my time in the pasture .
3 #### Looks like it might have worked , but was to short for my craftsman . Returned with no problem . advertised length ( height ) led me to believe it might fit my unit but alas , no cigar .
3 #### First let me say , this does pick up leaves well however , the reason I am giving it 3 stars is durability . We just got this , used it twice . 1st time , wheels lock up , screws and pins snapped in half right away , had to rig our own . 2nd use , again , picked up tons of leaves , but after the last pass this broke again where the basket connects to the wheels and the wheels locked up frequently . It is now sitting in the garage broken ( we have had it for 1 1/2 weeks ) . We will again replace the screws and connectors to get more use out of it . Sadly all of these sweepers are expensive but not very durable . Be prepared to replace parts that hold it together with better bits you own .
5 #### After trying it out once I threw away my electric coffee maker . It makes great coffee . And it will probably last forever .
1 #### This blade is the main reason that I purchased a Fein .. Now regretting my purchase .. You can not even cut out a single small tile without this blade completely wearing out .. The infomercials they produced , well let 's just say , if you see it exclusively advertised on late - nite TV then the product is definitely too good to be true .. The Fein concept is good and a lot of manufacturers have now low - cost copied the product ..
4 #### A decent outdoor timer with a very flexible programming capability . Unfortunately , the programming , and accessing special features are not very intuitive . Do n't lose the manual .
4 #### I know this is a great tape measure , we 've had one in the house for years . But I wanted one of my own . 25 feet seems to be the sweet spot of sturdy tape and max distance you need for 99.9 % of tasks . The ONLY reason I removed a star was for the packaging , which I know probably works great for a display or hanging in an aisle - But I was so worried I was going to break the clip in the back while removing the plastic . My wife thought I was over reacting , and normally she 'd be right , but I 've worked for a packaging company for almost 15 years and know my products . And even though this item is not classified as blister or clamshell packaging , it comes pretty darn close . And if you ever wondered why someone came up with hassle free packages it 's because of stuff like this .
3 #### Bought for specific use on rose bushes . Cuts nice but even though it is wiped of after every use it has rust and a stain on the blade . Lock mechanism is OK but not that easy to flip on and off . To early to rate longevity .
4 #### Still have n't used them but they came immediately and will be handy later on . Hopefully I will make a great project from having them .
5 #### I was using pyrex clear glass bowls as a double boiler . Pot of water with glass bowl on top . Had trouble getting eggs set . Decided maybe I needed a bowl that would take heat quicker . Got a 3 and 4 1/2 quart bowls . Just what I needed , eggs set quickly on double boiler . Been using them for lots of things , popcorn , mixing stuff , they are lighter than the glass bowls we were using and handy . Love them .
5 #### Perfect product for my need to get in between larger stems / branches to dead head my plants . The blades are sharp and the length is just right and makes the job quick to accomplish . The handles are comfortable and the protective blade tip cover is an added bonus to be able to put the clippers in my pocket while I go from plant to plant .
5 #### This ladder by Werner is easily the best ladder I 've ever owned ! The construction show a lot of forethought -- internal pinch proof spreaders , " traction - tred " steps and even a space for a medium size paint can on the top rung of the ladder ! Excellent ! Moreover , whenever I position the folded up ladder up against a wall or any other surface I always get the sense that it will stay . This could be mostly due to the strong rubber pads at the very base of each leg of the ladder . The steps of the ladder give you the sense that as long as you 're careful you wo n't fall off the ladder , either -- great ! Although this ladder seems exceptionally sturdy , I would not put more than 275 or even 250 pounds of weight on it -- just to make sure it holds the weight well . If you need a ladder to hold more weight Werner or other companies make other ladders for just that purpose . In addition , one more caveat : do n't sit or stand on the very top rung of the ladder ( the place where there 's the space for the paint can ) . This may cause the ladder to be unsafe . Overall , this 4 foot ladder by Werner can take a lickin ' and keep on tickin ' ! If you 're in the market for a ladder this size , I highly recommend this one .
4 #### I do n't use weeders . I use this tool and others , with my metal detector . I use it for the heavy prying work . I treat it rough , rocks and such , it 's held up well . I only rated it four stars , because I do n't use it as a weedier .
5 #### I bought one - cut it up for use with my toaster oven and loved it . Clean - up was so easy and , although they discolor , they can be used again and again , So I bought two more for cookie sheets and did n't cut those . Then I bought another two for gifts and more for me . I wo n't bake without one anymore . I even use one to raise the " 5 - minute bread " dough and then transfer it to the hot cast iron waiting in the oven . I keep thinking I 'll buy one of the more expensive , thicker type of baking pads . But then I think why ? These work great .
5 #### Razor sharp as expected . High quality Freud tool . I see reviews here from people who used this for something other than what it is intended for- mortising , edge trimming etc . This 15/32 " bit is used to cut perfectly sized dados for 12 mm offshore plywood . I buy " 1/2 inch birch plywood , finished one side " at a great price from the lumber supply , but it is not 1/2 " it is 0.46 " , or 12 mm . Using a standard 1/2 " bit to route dados for cabinet making etc makes a dado that is way too big , loose and sloppy . You can also get what is marketed as a bit specifically for undersized offshore plywood , but it is 31/64ths which is very close , but still makes a groove a little too wide ( 1/64th ) if you do precision work . The 31/64 " groove will fit together easily with that extra room but does not look good . If you use 12 mm plywood and can route a perfectly straight dado , this is the one you want . You 'll need to use a clamp to pop the joint together but with no slop or shadow line . For a particularly difficult joint , I 'll sand the edges of the panel going into the dado slightly and it slides right in .
5 #### What a great tool ! Had tree roots and large buried rocks to get out and this thing did the job . Heavy sucker but you need something like that to do the work .
5 #### When I retired , I wanted to retire my home made pvc light stand . Mind you , there was nothing wrong with it . Having said that , these light systems by Hydrofarm are fantastic . I have four of them and used them all winter . Packaging and instructions were right on and they are absolutely wonderful . I wondered at the system for raising the light up and down because it seemed so simple . Well , simple and smooth it is . It raises and lowers the lights in micro inches if you want . In this way you can raise them as the plants grow and it seems not to wear out at all with one season behind them . I wish I had done this way before I retired .
5 #### This stuff works ! I 've used other brands before and they are ok . I am not kidding this stuff stinks ! ! ! !
5 #### Way bigger than I expected . Better for a large family than one or two people .
5 #### Works great . Easy to hang , barely uses any power . I put this up and within 2 - 3 days I noticed a drastic difference in the bugs that would usually buzz around my porch lights . This thing pulls anything in range in to it , and kills it . Clears out about a half acre of annoying bugs .
5 #### Nice new garden tool . gets into all the tough spots . The tip is sharp and really gets those pesky weeds .
4 #### A great feeling splitting axe . Very comfortable in my hands and allows me to split wood easily . The overall sharpness of the blade is n't what I expected though . I expected much sharper thus the 4 star rating .
4 #### Works but the wind tends to blow out some seed .
5 #### If you write a review of a vegetable brush you must like it . This is a replacement to the same brush that I used for a long long time . It works and I love it ... need I say more ?
4 #### These work pretty good . On a warm to hot day with no or little breeze , they attract a fair amount of flies , but really only in a 5 to 10 ' radius where you put them . I still get lots of flies hanging around my patio outside that zone , killing about 50 a day with my Bug - A - Salt 2.0 Lawn and Garden ! ! ! ! They do smell though . My neighbor complained from the other side of my fence that my " garbage really smells " . Informed him it was the fly catcher I put several feet away from my cans .... and that I hope he was enjoying the benefits from my fly traps .... Have to keep them filled with water though . After a few 95 degree+ days , the water and goo inside evaporates and the traps are not as effective .
5 #### I needed a brighter bulb for the light above my GE range . I almost paid $ 8.00 for 1 . They work great . Each bulb is in a separate box . It 's overkill , but I will never run out .
5 #### I have tried several cordless drill / drivers in the past . Almost every time the battery would be dead or to little charge to get the job done . A regular corded drill does not make a good screwdriver because of high speed and no torque control . The DeWalt DW268 6.5 amp Screwdriver solved my problem . Thanks Amazon.com for the fast delivery .
2 #### These suspenders seem to be well made , with fairly heavy material and clips . They probably are good as work suspenders , where appearances are n't important . But , that 's not what I bought them for . I bought them to wear on my normal jeans as everyday wear . The biggest problem with them is that , as noted in their descriptions , the straps are made of 2 different types of materials . The front straps are not elastic , but some other material and the rear straps are elastic . The colors of the 2 materials are significantly different . The front straps are a much brighter shade of red than the rear straps . I 'd be much happier with them if all of the straps were the elastic material of the rear straps . If you 're looking for strictly work suspenders , perhaps these would meet your needs as they are .
4 #### " happy review warrior " obviously does n't have children , or he / she would appreciate the " lip " . This lazy susan is very well made , sturdy , and looks great on my table . My only complaint with this item , is that the lip is n't high enough . [ sorry happy review warrior ! ]
5 #### I love ice cream . Even when I 'm dieting ( like now ) , I make sure that I have some room , calorie - wise , for a little of the stuff . Despite this life - long affection , I 've never owned an ice cream scoop . I have a large , stout tablespoon reserved for the purpose which has always served me well . That 's all changed , because now I have the OXO . Two features set this one apart from the herd . First , there 's the handle . It is just the right thickness and shape to be comfortable in the hand while in use and is covered with the same soft , black , rubberized material that OXO uses in most of their other kitchen utensils . Secondly , the scoop has an unusual design , its leading edge drawn into a broad point . It is n't the usual hemispherical shape that most other scoops possess . The shape makes it easy to excavate the surface of your ice cream while in the container , even in the corners . Creating a nice round scoop to go on top of a cone , however , is problematic . You can do it by sort of rotating the scoop in the ice cream , but it takes a bit of practice . Clean - up is simple . Into the dishwasher in the silverware basket and you 're done . I 've washed mine this way about 40 to 50 times with no issues . I have quite a few OXO implements and always find them well - made and well thought out .
4 #### This is probably the best of the previous generation work lights . With the newer li - ion batteries and LED bulbs its outclassed on battery life and bulb life by newer offerings . But even the newer models do n't offer the flexible snorkel that this has . So even in a generation of higher tech options I chose to go retro for one of these Dewalt ... plus I already had the battery . My only disappointment is in the battery life , being a couple of hours .
5 #### I read a couple of negative reviews here of this tool , and Ican only conclude that they did not buy the same machine I did . Ibought mine when they first came out ( five years ago ? ) .... Everything was square and true right out of the box . Since I wear hearing protection with ALL power tools I can not comment on how loud it is . ( My ears do n't ring all the time , either . ) The dust bag , as is usual with all dust bags , does n't work and I have n't used it since the first try . The shop vac does the trick . It has worked flawlessly on everything from positioning slats in a headboard ( OK , I could have used mortise - and - tenon joints , but there were a LOT of slats ) to attaching edging to plywood , to table - top glue - ups . The only biscuit failure I 've had was when I tried to use it to attach the aprons to the legs on a children 's play table . Some places NEED better joinery ! I am a little confused about the other reviews talking about the machine dumping dust on your feet . Mine has a swiveling plastic nozzle that I direct to the side when I cut without the vac . It seems to work fine . Have they changed this design lately ? ... it , it seems like a bargain . The Lamello is unbelievably expensive ( at least for a hobbyist ) , the Porter - Cable seems like a nice tool ( that I have not tried yet ) , but the DeWalt seems like the value champ .
2 #### Works . Use more water than the booklet says to . My first pressure cooked roast came out like crap . [ edit ] Few months later , it 's total crap . Can barely hold pressure ... Just save your money and buy the presto one with the gauge , that way you know what you 're cooking at . This thing made alot of really crappy pulled pork . It 's at goodwill now . LOL .
5 #### Nice size and easy to hold on to . OXO is a very brand . Good quality . I will order more bowls .
3 #### Good quality , but it is so slender that I find it hard to hold . It will make a good letter opener , but I do n't think it offers enough grip to use for cutting cardboard boxes . There just is very little knife here to grip ! The blade LENGTH is OK , but I did not realize from the pictures how tiny it really is .
3 #### A little pricey for two crappy bulbs that die when you slightly drop your flash light . I love the Ryobi flashlights ( have two ) , so I 'll deal with the darn bulbs ! Fine , take my money !
5 #### In less than 48 hours of placing the trap it appears there was only one mole and he was caught on the second day . I had n't seen any evidence of moles in years and if another shows up I am well prepared to limit the damage to my yard .
4 #### good and strong and the lettering will not rub off
5 #### If you have Board buddies this is a great accessory . The track allows you to move the Buddies without remounting them on different areas of your fence . It saves alot of time . I attached a 1 " x 3 " x 3 ' piece of pine on the side of my fence and then mounted the track on top of that . I did n't really see a way to mount the track directly on the fence . I ca n't say enough about this product . It is a must have .
5 #### Oh yes , I confess : I was one of those guys who had bought one of the black $ 3.99 grips a few years ago . The jaws on them now wobble and the clamp jumps off on me while working . I tossed those and purchased the genuine article here . No comparison . Real tight and that classic vise grip look . Oh , I priced them at the local Ace , wow . The little dinky 4 " ones are $ 14.99 without tax . Also , the made in China jokes are now no longer applicable . Why ? The companies over seas have factories making the products at exact specs now . Our own government has signed so many " free trade " agreements that our U.S. companies ( with no protection ) are now facing bankruptcy or having to relocate . So they relocate . Anyway , high quality grips . A must for every person who keeps a tool kit in their cars and the 5 " is the perfect size to handle it all .
5 #### It replaces one that got lost . It 's perfect for measuring smaller volumes
4 #### I was looking for a nylon whisk to use in non - stick pans so as not to scratch them . This fits the bill . My only complaint is that it is fairly large to use in smaller pots .
5 #### Love the grip , this peeler is sharp and is very easy to use . Thinking about buying a second one to have around as extra
5 #### You can use it from the box , fine work , just fine , good tool .
4 #### I just used this to assemble some Gladaitor Garage stuff . It is pretty nice , and certainly better than using a traditional screwdriver . I ca n't say how long it 'll hold up since I just got it . But so far so good .
5 #### It 's a simple product that is made so you can buy it and attach easy . It 's white as expected and I could n't be happier for the price and the purpose it serves .
5 #### I needed a light weight ladder to do home repairs in my rental and in my home . The ceilings are 8 1/2 foot in down - stairs rooms . This is a life saver .. I especially like the flip down paint can holder which also has a 3 - hole tool holder for your hammer , screwdriver or what your using . That is nice . Its the perfect height for reaching the ceilings to put up ceiling fans , paint trim , put up holiday decorations ... I have used this for so many things .. It was price right even with shipping it was under 70 dollars . Great ! Thanks .
2 #### I am looking for a perc pot so I appreciate the input from prior buyers . Thank you to the 46 people who wrote to say in one way or another that this pot does n't stand the time test . We still have a perc pot from 1970 which fixes the best coffee in the world , I just ca n't take the aluminum leach and must buy a stainless steel .
2 #### I have been using this vacuum for months . Yes , it works well , but it is so noisy you may need ear plugs .
5 #### I love these sprayers . I have used these for over a year now and not one has clogged up or failed on me yet . I do make sure to clean them out with hot soapy water if I use pesticide or herbicide since they tend to leave a greasy film . In an attempt to repel deer in my garden , I used a raw egg concoction and the sprayer handled it ok . The concoction had marginal success with the deer which is better than anything else I 've tried ( I used a Ninja food processer to mix one egg with 3 cups of warm water , then strained the mixture into a sprayer . I would have added pepper but I 've tried pepper solutions before with no success )
5 #### I use my router a lot . Freud bits are durable and reasonably priced . I recommend them without reservation .
5 #### The advantage to this Goodyear hose is that it is made out of industrial grade rubber instead of vinyl . What that means is that when you are using it instead of being stiff like vinyl it remains soft and flexible , so it lays flat on the floor . This is especially a problem in colder temperatures . It 's great for coiling as well , it does n't fight you . The real frustration of using a vinyl hose is that it can stand up while moving across the floor , high enough to snag on things , or even pull something onto the floor . The hose is in a coil , then instead of simply uncoiling , the vinyl has a memory and wants to look more like hoops moving over the floor . This hose comes in 3/8 " which is the most popular size . The 1/4 " hoses restrict air flow , which is especially important over a 50 foot run . All in all highly recommended . The advantages are worth it even if it was twice the price .
5 #### I 'm using these as replacements for 75 watt xenon bulbs . They are just as bright and do n't seem that much hotter .
5 #### Nice machete . I carry one on my Rzr and when we go camping for clearing paths , dispatching snakes and the inevitable zombie apocalypse . It has more weight than the average " Walm*rt " cheapie machete . The only downside is that the sheath ( which is equally as nice ) is n't sold WITH the machete . It is sold separately .
5 #### New , sealed package , with high quality Oregon product - I tried to find one locally for close to the same price but I could not . I put it on a Poulan 4218 . Works great !
4 #### This is the ONLY oscillating sprinkler I 've had that did not stop going back and forth after a month or so . It is highly adjustable , and will pretty much water wherever you want the water to go . The adjustable range is really superb . HOWEVER ! I deduct one star because the water nozzles are soft rubber like material that will degrade and break after being exposed to the sun for a while . If they would make them out of hard plastic , or better yet , metal , I would happily pay more because then we would have a five star sprinkler .
5 #### Used these for years and years ... unfortunately they are hard to find attached to a sprinkler base or sled anymore . So we buy sprinklers with sleds , toss the head that came with it and attach these rain birds . ( reason is that most heads sold with sleds and bases do not work very long ! ) . Ca n't do without our rainbirds ! ( and the Amazon price is really good ! )
5 #### Easy on the hand - more comfortable to hold than wood or something smaller . Great whisking action inside the bowl - the large balloon really works . There is nothing to not like about this product .
5 #### Really work , I 've always used old socks , but my wife wanted me to have these , so she dieted them , and I 'm glad she did !
5 #### Just wish it was dishwasher safe but other than that cute and fun !
4 #### This same fence came standard on my 21 " 3 HP Jet bandsaw . I 've had it for over a year now and it has worked well for me . Granted , I do n't use my band saw a lot and I never had a fence on my 14 " bandsaw , so I 've nothing to compare it to except the Beismeyer on my table saw . It ' not as hefty as that , but is sturdy and accurate and for that price I think a good buy .
5 #### We love our pickle house , it holds a large jar of pickles . Of course it also is the great quality expected from Tupperware .
1 #### Just received my DW3178 blade from Amazon and see it is now made in China . Looked carefully on the Amazon site and could n't find where it is made . For me there are too many other choices to buy a chinese blade , no matter how it cuts . Also wish Amazon more clearly showed country of origin .
5 #### I like eating apples with peanut or almond butter , but I used to hate trying to cut the center out of each apple slice . This device has fixed that problem . I put the apple on top of a cutting board and then push the Corer straight through the center of the apple . It is large enough to get the entire core out of small to medium sized apples .
5 #### It works , what more can I say . I live in Puerto Rico & using this ( with the flowton of course ) has cut back on 80 - 90 % of the mosquitoes & flies that we have . Also is killing the winged termites !
1 #### The valve was working ok for a year , and this week a crack happened in the written part of the connection PVC pipe and sent water everywhere . I have it installed to control the water of the jacuzzi in an apartment building , and my neighbors got their apartment flooded big time . I 'm still working on the damage cost , but I already have over $ 5000 in bill to pay because of the damage . Next time I will buy a honeywell metal valve .
5 #### I had been buying off - brand bags for my ShopVac until I saw these on Amazon . These OEM seem better than the others I had been using . Finer , softer filter material keeps the dust down better .
5 #### Fiskar 's has offered many products that I have purchased and this # 7068 Composite Soil Scoop is another I am happy to have purchased . It is a solid cylindrical shape to reach into the tilled soil to scoop out a perfect hole for a planting . I plan to use mine differently as a birdseed scoop . Each use is ok though , if you would like to dirty up this nice looking little scoop go ahead as it can be cleaned up with soap and water and it should look as good as new . Another quality Fiskar 's product .
5 #### great ruler but they are a lot more expensive than they used to be and hard to find a good one . Quick S&H ... had it in a few days .
4 #### I read the reviews before I ordered . I could n't understand how it could be so cheap . Well I do now . No one actually says why iy is cheap . It is the material it is made of is like a cheap flimsy and it bends easily . BUT If you hang it up plug it and leave it alone it is five stars all the way . It looks good hanging there and is certainly worth the money it is being sold for now . No its not a high dollar neon sign but it is official licensed and looks just like the bates motel sign . Also note the bulb behind the vacancy part of the sign is a twinkle kind of bulb so the vancancy word looks to be shorted out again just as the real psycho bates motel sign looks in the movies . I think I got my moneys worth .
4 #### Longer than my original chain , had to crank the bar way out almost to max extension to fit , but otherwise worked fine .
5 #### Works like a charm ... kept my birdbath from totally freezing during weeks of Sub - Zero windchills here on the Great Plains ... no noticeable increase in the Electric Bill so I assume it 's working as advertised !
5 #### This works so great ! It 's amazing . We love it and use it all the time . I hIghly recommend this item !
4 #### I am amazed at how quickly this cooks . I prepared chicken breasts ( including trimming , marinating , and cooking ) in less than 15 minutes . This is a wonderful tool for the lazy , hungry single chef . Notes : 1 . ) This model is very , very tiny . The most you can fit on there is two hamburgers -- or a chicken breast sliced in half . 2 . ) It 's lightweight so it 's very easy to travel with , should you desire to put it in your car , camper , etc . 3 . ) It 's more difficult to clean that I anticipated . While the grooved top and bottom plate give food those nice " grill lines , " they are a tad difficult to maneuver around and clean effectively . I would suggest purchasing a handled sink scrubbing brush to assist you with the task . 4 . ) It heats up in an instant -- literally .
4 #### This is a good gun at a fair price . I 've owned other brands but none seam to last as long as the dewalt brand .
5 #### It 'll mar your wood up , but it will also take a any nail out . Even if the nail is missing its head .
5 #### Had this at a drive in movie and literally watched bugs fly towards us and then turn and fly away . Th other mom I was with went out and bought some for herself and her family as gifts ! I ALWAYS get eaten alive by mosquitoes so I never go outside if I can avoid it and have gotten very few bites this year . Refills can add up but it 's worth it if you get bitten like i do .
5 #### Works great for a dusk to dawn patio light we have !
5 #### Very very cute , and fast shipping . This got here before Amazon said it would- and that was nice . It 's pretty well made- I did not expect that . Did n't know quite what to expect , but my daughter is very happy with it .
5 #### Love this double Boiler ! It works great and clean up is easy . I highly recommend this item !
1 #### This product did n't last 3 years . The hook broke of with normal use . Sad for the cost of this .
4 #### You buy the whole kit but I only needed 2 pieces . But those 2 pieces solved the pressurization issue in the tank . Used to have to pump the handle a lot to pressurize the tank . Now it only takes about 1/3 of the pumps to pressurize the tank . And it 's wayyyyyy cheaper than buying a new tank or pump handle assembly .
5 #### I 've got a very small shop and a Delta contractor 's tablesaw with two cast iron wings weighing 250 + lbs . As soon as I assembled the saw ( by myself ) I realized I had a problem : mobility . After a search I picked the HTC2000 for its weight capacity and customer recommendations . It 's super . Assembly was a snap , and with the help of the assembly instructions , I got the saw on the stand by myself very easily . I heartily recommend this equipment for the amateur or the pro . At $ 55 , it 's nearly a give - away .
5 #### I think another reviewer says that this did n't fit on his 4100 model table saw , but I did n't have any issues putting it on mine . Well , I did have to install one of the brackets " backwards " in order to tighten the bolts that hold it to the table , but there were no alignment issues with the extension rods . I highly recommend it for working with larger pieces of plywood or MDF . KTHXBAI
5 #### This is a powerhouse router that I use exclusively in my router table . Almost unlimited uses in this capacity . The variable speed is a must with large , heavy router bits . Very pleased .
5 #### Returned- we chose natural sources- disposing of bodies did not appeal to us ! !
5 #### I use this daily to make espresso . So far it 's held up to the use . I was taught to only wash it out with water and not soap , because the coffee oils protect it and make it last longer . It gets some staining , but does n't affect the taste .
5 #### This is great , easy on and off and very stable .
5 #### Without a doubt the finest single action lopper I 've ever come across . Only the ratcheting type have more power and they are MUCH slower in use . Well done Fiskars !
5 #### My all - time favorite peeler ! What a bonus to get the paring knife .
2 #### I got two OXO Veggie brushes at the same time . I know OXO to be a great brand , so I was expecting nothing but the best from both of them . I tested both brushes on sweet potatoes , which I like to eat skin on , so intense scrubbing is required . The Natural Bristle Brush just was n't up to the task . Not only did it do a poor job cleaning , but it shed bristles all over the sink and my sweet potato . While the grip was made of material I would expect from OXO , I never felt like it felt comfortable in my hand . The other veggie brush I got was&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/OXO - Good - Grips - Flexible - Vegetable - Brush / dp / B00004OCL2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">OXO Good Grips Flexible Vegetable Brush</a > . Its handle was made of the same material , but unlike the Natural Bristle Brush , it felt comfortable in my hand , plus it 's done a fantastic job on everything I 've used it on , including the skin of a sweet potato .
5 #### SUCH A SWEET BLENDER AND STURDY TOO . I USE IT EVERY DAY . BOUGHT THIS ONE AFTER A PLASTIC CONTAINER ONE BUSTED IN MID STREAM AND BLEW OUT ALL OVER MY NEW KITCHEN AND NEW WINDOWS TOO .. OH WOW .. LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PINK BLENDER . WORTH EVERY PENNY .
4 #### This is a pretty good product . It 's the second pair I have . The first pair rusted like crazy over the winter even though I kept it in one of those big Lifetime boxes outside . So I 'm going to have to find a place inside this winter . I think the blades could be sharper .
1 #### Very , very disappointed . Kinks like crazy . Not worth the money .
4 #### Good Basic hedge shears for everyday use . Sharp blades . Eight inch blade is just the right size for about all your pruning projects . I use it to shape my hedges and shrubs . More precise that electric hedge clippers . These shears are not intended to be used on branches . Make sure you wipe the blades clean after each use and they will last a very long time .
5 #### Worked much better out of the closet than in but I have to re - moisten it more often . Great to kill bad bacteria in your gut .
4 #### It appears that after my unusually long shipping , I waited for a dissatisfying product , when manually operating this device , it leaks to no end . Will not purchase any more of these Birds .
5 #### She needed a tea kettle that was easier to operate with arthritic hands so we bought this for her . She loves it .
5 #### Cuts so easily ! This is a hefty tool , not a piece of junk like those one sees in the grocery stores . It cuts easily through thin crispy , regular , or deep dish pizzas with little effort . It 's weightier than most , so it does much of the cutting for you . No need to bear down hard . The handle is very comfortable and has a great , no - stick surface . Highly recommended .
5 #### very sleek look and amazing functionality . Wine opener is very easy to operate , comes with foil cutter , wine saver and a nice stand for all accessories . two moves operation , in and out , works even on very old corks . We have it sitting on the top of the bar because of its look , no longer have to hide your wine opener .
5 #### I am sure it is made overseas , not like the " old days . " But Stanley must be overseeing the quality as it is still there . Nice product ; very satisfied .
5 #### I love being able to bake up healthy tacos with ease . I bought one of these for myself and one for my sister - in - law . We both love it . I warm the tortillas up in the microwave or on an oven safe plate with a little steam , spray the taco rack with a little no stick spray , place the warmed tortillas on it and sprinkle a little Parmesan cheese or salt for fresh baked goodness . You will love this if you 're trying to cut back on frying , messy oil , and those expensive pre - baked store bought shells which do n't come warm and crispy out of your oven .
1 #### This light is just not bright enough and is made with that cheap Chinese quality that we 've all come to expect . Our daughter does n't even use it anymore . Keep looking !
3 #### I had difficulty working with the bowl . The bottom is nice heavy and does not slip , but the body of the bowl is a little to weak when you hang on to the handle .
5 #### I got tired of the filter keep falling down my Ridgid 10 - gallon shop vacuum ( not to mention the hose keeps getting pulled off the unit ) , so I ordered this Shop - vac on a whim . What a pleasant surprise ! Superior suction , much quieter motor and accessories that fit together like a glove ( including a locking hose to unit connector ) . This is a well - made basic shop vacuum at a very attractive price !
5 #### A must have - especially for a busy cook . I just made a meal that I normally do in the crock pot taking 6 - 8 hours to get a pot roast this tender . For days I need the roast in a hurry this thing is the bomb ! Total cooking time from lid on to fall apart tender chuck roast with vegetables and potatoes perfectly cooked - 1 hr . The meet still had a nice chew , read not mushy , but incredibly tender . The meet and veggies were incredibly flavorful . The only con to this device is that it is straight aluminum - no stainless steel coating . This makes cleanup harder and it stains easily . All in all a great buy for $ 50 .
5 #### Very nice set , love the rubber handles and got the matching measuring cups too .
5 #### I bought this cat paw after my old stanley got to wide at the claws and this is a beast of a tool . it is longer than a normal one and this gives you more leverage which is very nice . pulls gun nails out very easily . if your a framer or carpenter this will be a new favorite tool . also check out their flat bar which i bought before this , also a really good product .
5 #### It does exactly what it should . You jab it into the wall , then saw . It 's comfortable to hold , works well and is cheap so it 's perfect for some DIY stuff around the house .
5 #### This is a totally awesome tool and VERY well made . Made polishing my sailboat hull a lot easier than my past buffer .
1 #### This is a good saw . Its the third one I ve ordered because I keep thinking the next one will have a case . It says it has a case in the advertisement but I still have not received one . This is getting very frustrating . Does anyone know how I could get in touch with DeWalt ?
3 #### this worked fine for what I bought it for . to unclog a central ac drain . never figured out how to use the " torque device " just twisted the cable by hand . the carry tote is the blister pack that it comes in and it is impossible to open without tearing or cutting . overall , I am satisfied but not excited .
5 #### Often imitated- never duplicated . These are the real deal . The first time Felco pruners were put in my hands I fell in love . Everything else I have ever used has felt inadequate and sometimes junky . These things will last a lifetime . I bought these on Amazon because I lost my other pair a few years ago and was finally sick of using cheap crap while waiting for the others to turn up . I was tilling the garden shortly after ordering these and low and behold I tilled up my old Felco 2 's ! I was so sad . They had been buried in the garden for 2 years and were covered in crap . I washed them off to discover the damage . I quickly realized that aside from scratching the red handle during the tilling process and some rust on blades ( replaceable ) I was able to take them apart , clean , and oil . Now they work perfectly again . I was sold all over .
3 #### works well , the middle of the blades appear to be warped a tiny bit though , plus I had to do some modifications on my jet jointer / planer since they are not oem blades
3 #### Way over priced . It works fine , but I do n't think it is worth $ 185 + tax .
4 #### Installed easily and does what it 's supposed to do . Price was good just make sure it 's the correct size for your vacuum .
5 #### I have no idea about what these other people are writing about , I just installed the rear extension right out of the box and it not only fit great , , but it worked wonderfully .
5 #### multi - use and easy to store . trash can for tailgaiting then yard cleanup bag .
5 #### Works perfect . I ca n't find these in stores ! Perfect replacement for my Pampered Chef spreader .
1 #### This socket ' clicked ' ( worked ) twice before the unit bound itself up and would no longer work at all . Complete junk . :(
4 #### At times had a hard time finding these small vacuum bags for my shop vac , was pleasantly surprised when i found the size on here . Works as they should .
5 #### I love this tough , durable hose . The length is perfect for a large backyard & kinking is a minimum even in cold weather . It is easy to attach to the faucet & the water flow is great . An extra is the metal spiral at the faucet end to keep it from crimping where it hangs down . Much better than the plastic sleeves on other brands . The 8 - ply construction is tough enough to withstand the elements be they hot or cold . I 've had this hose for about 8 - 10 months & it is as good as the day I bought it . So Gilmour is my hose of choice for the future .
4 #### Really good blades , but coating wears off pretty quick . Still , for the price they are an incredible value .
3 #### Seems to work like any other trowel but not rusting .
5 #### Great size , easy to store , does what I want it to do . It can be used as a work table or vise . If I 'm in the shop , it is probably in use .
5 #### These knives are the best ! Henckles has started making some of their lesser quality knives in China , I avoid those . These knives ( Henckel 's 4 star line ) are made in Germany of high carbon steel . These knives hold an edge fairly well and are extremely easy to sharpen on a flat stone . If my review was helpful to you , [ ... ] below . Thanks !
4 #### Just installed these for about a month . They went in easy and seem to be doing a great job . I have not had them in long enough to see if they hold up but so far so good !
3 #### If this had been made in the US like my 40 - year - old one that it replaces , it would have received 5 stars . But I am really getting sick of seeing things getting farmed out to that country , and I 'm not going to hide my growing dissatisfaction over it . ( And I really wish I liked Case knives better , but for some reason , they 've just never been as useful as my original Old Timer - and , sadly , this Chinese copy is still faithful to the old one 's standard . I wish it were n't ; then I 'd have to get used to the American - made Case that is similar . )
5 #### Its a great dado blade for any price . It cuts great , has shims for micro adjustment , and has flat bottoms . Buy one before they raise the price . I bought one for my friend as a gift and after seeing how it performs I bought one for myself .
4 #### I had doubts about this , but as long as you follow the directions it seems to work ok .
3 #### The steam cap got melted very easily and the little rubber cap can be easily come loose and lost . Called up the company they cost $ 11 to replace
5 #### I 'm 23 weeks pregnant and did not want to push around a gassy , smelly , loud , dusty old mower . So today I purchased The Scotts 200 - 20 20 - Inch Classic Push Reel Mower and whipped through our front and back yard in less than an hour . My husband had put grass seed and weed - n - feed down a while back and we had to wait 3 weeks before we could mow , per the instructions . Add to that a very wet April and I had my work cut out for me . ( Doh ! Pun . Sorry . ) Our old mower often left the grass looking matted down and the grass blades shredded . We have a friend who has worked in the parks district for years and he swears that push reel mowers are the best way to go if you have a smaller yard . They cut like a scissor instead of whacking away at the grass . As the blades turn , they brush the grass upward , snip it , and you are left with a plush , clean cut . No more shredded brown tips and matted down grass . I truly enjoy using a reel mower , found it easy to push , and was so happy with the results that I keep walking out to our yard to have a look . I think it 's a much more peaceful experience and a lot more fun than our old gas mower . That thing will be hitting Craigslist first thing tomorrow !
5 #### Great tool , perfect size , feels good in your hand . Made in USA .
1 #### I bought several of these rolls for craft projects .. The 1st two rolls I ordered were fine .. Yes it shreads a lot but I could still work with it ... I just received my 2nd order of 4 rolls .. These rolls are a lot poorer quality then my first order .. The weave is so loose and open you can barely work with it .. AWFUL QUALITY ! Will never order again !
5 #### I own several Henckels knives and when I saw the price on this one , I grabbed it as quickly as I could . Great knife , great price . Packaging is a bit over the top but it beats cutting your finger off .
5 #### Second one purchased . Perfect for low lighting in the bedroom at night . Wife kept stealing it so I had to order her one as well !
1 #### Never reduce the fly population even though they kill a lot . Possibly bring lot from all over the hood .
5 #### Plugged right into my vintage lamp and it has been working great .
3 #### Really needs a gasket on lid . I do not trust it to keep insects out of food without also having the pet food in a plastic bag
5 #### I like the highly visible outside markings the best . There are lines for lesser measurements inside each cup also , adding even more flexibility of use to EACH piece of this set . All of the cups sit in a neat stack and snap snugly onto the ring to keep them together more securely if needed . I do think the set is bulkier compared to the old Tupperware design , but this set really " measures up " LOL !
5 #### This grill works great . I love the one touch ash disposal feature . Have purchased the Rotisserie attachment also , and I LOVE what these two peices of equipment do to my Roasting Chicken ! ! It will Rotisserie a small Turkey also , leaving it so jucy and tender . Will be using this for many years to come .
5 #### It is incredibly useful- for avoiding the awful bane of fractions and varying incompatible denominators . Fractions just should not be used at all , there is no good reason . If it was a great idea , we 'd use fractional cm too . I work in engineeering , from 0.001 " to 12 ft or so . This will be so handy . I was using a tape with fractional inches vs. mm on the other side , and just converting mm to inch.xx , but this will save that step . With judicious reading I should be able to get to accuracy similar to a 1 mm division . Metal case for longevity . Works just like it should . Fast delivery . Quality product . Plus it even says " Engineer " right on it , in case I forget . I did not find the markings to be blurry or grayed as of 5/2016 . Maybe they had a bad production run previously . How could it be better ? Mark it in Inches , 1/10 " one side , down to 1/50 " all the way down . Mark the other side in meters , cm , and mm . Maybe add some small special mark for each one foot . That would be all purpose .
2 #### It works as intended . It works when you get it on .... therein lays the core issue . Since i 'm not Octavius from Spider Man , fitting this onto a frame while tightening it is a Major Pain in the Chunk . When its on , its great . You simply wind the handle and you can squeeze that frame like the feared Kraken from Ulysses . It will creak for mercy . BUT there are design issues . The corner thingamabobs have a tendency to slip off . They do n't seem to grab the ribbon tight enough , so adjusting tension while doing the other 3 edges is an exercise in frustration . Getting the corners Just Right , then winding the large retractor a Goldilocks amount , THEN winding the red handle .... man - o - man . Its an OK tool . It does the job , but if you are going to do this more than once , make yourself a cramping jig . You will lose less hair .
4 #### When I first opened this carrying case the lid broke like a cheap shotgun . I went to Amazon and got a toolbox to put all my electric and soldering supplies in . This will be better for me in the long run . If the case is not really a concern for you as it is not for me , the gun will probably be a great addition to your shop as it will be to mine .
1 #### Way overpriced for what it is . Thought we were meant American quality but half of it made in China the other half in Taiwan , and no idea where the ring was made . Should have made my own is plenty of videos on the net how
5 #### If anyone knows about load breakers they know the standard breakers do n't come in pacakging and GFCI 's and other specialty breakers do . New and everything works great !
2 #### Very heavy . Measurements are only on one side . There could have been numbers that read vertically on the other side . Calling out 1/2 or 7/8 would have been nice . Stanley went cheap on this one . It 's rugged and grippy . That 's about it 's only redeeming quality .
2 #### I purchased this item to prevent ground hogs from eating up my garden . I followed the instructions and where the hose meets the " Scarecrow " it leaks . I purchased gaskets from the big box store and same results . We left it on leaking but the animals were not deterred by the water . The oil man got soaked and did n't appreciate it so it does function . This expensive item is now in the shed .
5 #### Works perfect and well made . What more could any apple or pear ask for ?
5 #### I own a BD drill and the charge cell die on in the middle of job . So , I check amazon for a replacement and found it . It was deliver two days later . I charge the cell and bam , it work . This is a good product hopefully it will last another 12 years .
2 #### the sound is horrific - I kept the hose and rigged it to fit something else - just could not take the motor pitch - it gets way too hot also . My noise cancelling bose headphones could not even cancel that pitch .
5 #### This is a super high - quality step ladder that is very sturdy , relatively light - weight and the perfect size for home use . The 300 pound rating makes it safe for even my generous sizing with a good margin for tools and materials .
4 #### This product really works . You must however make sure you do n't overdose your pond . The oxygen depravation will kill your fish . It happened once to me . The other thing is that it 's toxic to invertebrates , so snails shrimp etc . wo n't tolerate it .
5 #### Best bird feeder I have ever owned ! The birds love it and the rodents ca n't hurt it . Just use a good blend of seed and cut corn and watch the antics of the many birds that will come . Some hang upside down others jump around to find just the right piece of food . Quite entertaining and virtually indistructable .
3 #### I give it 3 stars because the metal extension tube is very heavy ( I have another MM but it came with a plastic tube ) . The metal tube pulls out of the plastic hose when ever you pull it towards you on carpet , even on my tile floors . Almost every time . Metal hitting tile really makes for a loud crash . But it has great ( supper ) suction and the pet brush attachment really works . I 've taped the tube and handle together which solved the detachment problem but it is still very heavy . I may go online and order the plastic tube .
1 #### NOT A MARSHALLTOWN ! handle is spot welded to the trowel base . it is a NU - PRIDE which is of dollar store quality
4 #### Works great . Could weigh a bit more to keep it from tipping . Excellent for lawn watering with a minimum of water that is not wasted by evaporation .
5 #### I have two desktop high intensity lamps - one I bought a few years ago , and one a recent purchase . The older lamp failed about 3 months ago , and I replaced it with the new one thinking the older one was finished . Then when the newer lamp blew a bulb I decided to get a set of these bulbs to see if it would work again . Replacing the blown bulb with a new one from this package took a minute or two ( being careful not to touch the bulb with my fingers ) , and the new lamp was back to working . So I decided to try one these bulbs in my old ( presumed dead ) desk lamp . After carefully installing the new bulb my old lamp was back to life . They are both still working , and I am delighted with this purchase .
5 #### This is a great teakettle . Nice looking , nicely balanced in the hand , and it even sounds nice ! ( Instead of the shrill whistle of an ordinary teakettle , when the water is ready in this kettle , you hear a nicely - tuned three - note chord which is actually pleasing to the ear ! ) I ca n't recommend it enough .
5 #### I 've yet to find anything that will stick to these . I use two for rolling out pie crust and cookie dough . I 've cut them to fit all my cake pans , baking sheets and casseroles . Makes cleanup a breeze . I give them as gifts , with repeat requests every Christmas . My in laws , friends and daughter swear by them . I clip them to a bulldog clip , then hang from a command hook inside a lower cabinet . Do n't use sharp knives to cut on top of these . They cut easily but otherwise last for years .
2 #### Could spin salad dryer . Also , the spinning mechanism extends deep into the basket of greens . Although all parts are dishwasher safe the spinning spring and mechanism do not come apart and retain water from the dishwasher so I am not confident enough to let that come into contact with my food . Previously I had a string - pull Zyliss where nothing touched the bowl full of greens and you could fill it with water and spin the water - filled bowl to wash the greens , drain and spin dry . I would not do that with this . Otherwise appears sturdy , but I 'm disappointed . I do n't understand why America 's Test Kitchen recommended it .
5 #### Tongs are the workhorse of a kitchen , and these are an exceptionally good version . They are stainless steel , have rubber grips , and are a good length . The ability to lock when the hook is pulled is a good one . The manual lock is much better than the kind that lock when you point them a certain way , even though this requires more than one hand to use it . The auto - locking type are always locking when I do n't want them to . The lock is really only useful to make them collapse for storage , and if you are putting it away , you probably also have both hands free . The length of this one is just right . The jaws spread larger than with smaller tongs , which allows grabbing larger items . It also gives you some reach , which is important when using them on something in the middle of a hot pan . I have a set of smaller ones that I rarely use , so if you only want one , this is the right one to get . The only negative is that the metal head can scratch nonstick pans if you are n't careful with it . Sean P. Logue , 2007
5 #### I generally agree with the other reviewers here about the quality of this vise . It is extremely well made and heavy duty , as well as reasonably priced . The 9 1/2 " mount pattern surprised me too . I was lucky and just * barely * had enough room . Amazon should update the description to include the required dimensions for stuff like this . Otherwise installation was very easy . But the best thing about this ( and all of Jorgensens products ) is they are made in the USA . If you are like me and are tired of buying stuff made in China , Jorgensen is your brand .
5 #### As the fact I 'm using an electric chainsaw probably suggests , I 'm not totally comfortable with using chainsaws ; I wo n't take one up a ladder for example ( even before my much more experienced neighbor sliced a tenon with his ) . So , I 'm hardly an expert . So , in preparation for Sandy , I took a reciprocating saw up a ladder to knock off the top ~40 ' of dead tree before cutting it up into manageable bits with the chainsaw . With the new Oregon blade it was like a hot knife cutting through melted butter compared with the reciprocating saw which was more like trying to push a bread knife through hard cheese ( do n't know what 's with the flowery metaphors --- I made the twenty words long ago ) . Heartily recommended .
1 #### I bought this pressure cooker just last month . During the 4th or 5th , I could smell something burning while cooking on low - medium heat . I turned off the stove and allowed the cooker to cool . When I opened it there was an inch of burnt matter stuck to the bottom . This happened a week ago and I am still trying all kinds of home remedies to get rid of the grime . I was well aware of the instructions , which said not to use too little water or the food will get burnt . I know I used enough water because I opened the lid the rice was completely and floating in extra water . I would like to return this item and use my money for something built for the job ! I will also be writing directly to the company !
4 #### Works .. quiet .. Generous SIX INCH POWER CORD ! really ? ! Really .. Longer normal power cord would have been a five star .. 6 " just messed with my head . wow just weird But it works ... REALLY WELL I just bought a second ..
5 #### Plenty of power and very easy to move around . I do wish the hose was a bit more supple but other than that " it 's great "
5 #### Many of the slow watering hoses on here are weeping style . That is , the hoses are porous and the water dribbles out . This gives you slow watering bu only where the hose is laying . I have hard soil and my thought was as the ground saturated , the run off would move down the slight slope and water the rest of the grass slowly . However , because the sod had very little root system this was not effective . It needs to be watered top down . This hose is exactly right for that
5 #### Works like a champ , I have this outside right by my porch and I can tell you this is one of the better zappers out there . This unit has an open flow design to it so there is no need to have to go out and clean it day after day , the bugs fall right through it and out the bottom . I reccomend this product to anyone looking for a quality zapper .
4 #### Bagged salad is OK ... sometimes . But when I really want the freshest and crispest salad possible , I buy my own lettuce and go through the routine of washing and drying the leaves with paper towels . This works , but it 's just too time consuming . This is my first salad spinner . As such , I have no other brand or model to compare it to . I 've used it many times , and it easily builds up enough speed to dry the lettuce . Also , it 's easy to clean , and I 've had no problems . Would I buy it again ? Yes , I would . It 's much easier and faster than drying with paper towels !
3 #### I asked for this for Christmas because of the large width of the pan . One of my favorite things to pressure cook is lasagne and this holds a 9 inch dish . A standard cooker only holds a 7 inch dish . My husband and son make short work of a 7 inch lasagne . I would n't recommend this for someone who 's never used a pressure cooker before . The instructions are very poorly written and it 's impossible to reach customer service with a question . As of Christmas their website had no information on it other than a phone number which went to an over - filled voicemail box . This is one of three pressure cookers I own , so I eventually figured out how the pressure setting works , sort of . Overall I 'd say the product is adequate but not great . It does what it 's supposed to -- pressure cook . If I had to buy another PC , I 'd look for a different brand with the same capacity and skip Mirro .
3 #### I often purchase OXO stuff simply because it works . I 'm not thrilled with this , however , because the zester works okay , but the little stripper is n't sharp enough ; it tends to bunch up the peel rather than cutting it cleanly . In order to work , the lemon must be just at the right stage . Too soft and it bunches up , too old and it wo n't cut at all .
3 #### This grinder tends to let beans get " stuck " above the burrs , not allowing the full amount of beans to be ground . Unless you are right there while grinding , and can give it a hit on the side to knock the beans down , your coffee will end up very weak . I have wasted lots of expensive beans using this grinder . I would not purchase another .
5 #### As a latino , I grew up in my homeland seeing pressure cookers in any kitchen and I love to make many dishes with it . Now that I am here in America , I needed one to cook for my wife . This does the job perfectly and it really saves you money since the cooking time is reduced quite significantly
5 #### So easy for mashed potatoes ! A must have in your kitchen !
4 #### Powerful stuff - be sure to not over mix , or apply while hot - this 'll scorch your plants .
4 #### Simple and effective whisk to use with my non - stick cookware purchased through Amazon . I had another plastic - clad one but eventually the plastic wore off the tines and the bare metal was hitting the nonstick coating so I had to toss it . This is is solid nylon so that wo n't be an issue here . The typical quality OXO .
4 #### This whisk has a nice feel and is great for preparing sauces . The length gives you a little more safety from splatters . It is well made and appears to be sturdy . I have downgraded this tool by one star since my original review . I have used the whisk a little more , and unfortunately , the handle slid off . I was surprised to see that it was glued on . I no longer have the packaging for the product , but I would caution you that this might not be a dishwasher - safe item . As for its look , heft and feel , I am still in favor of this item ; however , I will hand wash it from now on .
3 #### The tines on the fork were not as strong as I thought they would be . You ca n't mash things very well with this fork . I use it but not as much as the other fork I ordered which offers me more opportunities in the kitchen .
1 #### I have 2 of these and the brush disintegrates after a few months . the holder , though cool looking gets really nasty and the closing mechanism starts to rust . My brushes looked nastier than the toilet it was supposed to clean .
5 #### This a perfect extinguisher for small fires . I purchased for a sense of security in the event a small fire was to happen in my kitchen . I keep it under the cabinet in my kitchen .
5 #### It works . At this point how can I give it any less than five stars . We had some rats move into our Peacock pen / barn . I started using a rat poison bait station and had some results , found a few dead each day . I saw these and thought I 'd give them a try . Got one day shipping with prime and got it yesterday . Loaded the batteries , placed it along the wall in the barn ( it is fully covered so wo n't be exposed to weather ) , turned it on and waited . I checked it a couple of times in the evening and did n't see any action in it though I did see a couple of rats scurrying about the rafters . Woke up this morning and checked it .... sometime in the night ... kablaam! .... a six to seven inch ( body size ) rat had met its demise . SO .... this thing works .
5 #### The handle is much better then the handles on other whisks that I have . Makes it easier to work with
5 #### Diet Coke - aholing here admitting that I * may*actually be getting the correct amount of water daily thanks to these pretty bottles ! I have the smaller ones for my kids and they love them too throughout the day and in their lunches . No more juice boxes ! ! Empty calories are the devil !
5 #### This is an absolutely perfect size . It is not so big that you wo n't find a place to store it , but large enough to hold a bunch of angel hair pasta that would slip right out of the little holes in a traditional colander . It also fits over the sink so that I can pour the pasta ( or whatever I 'm draining ) right into it , water and all , and have the water drain into the sink . It does n't say in the description , but this is a double weave strainer . In other words , there are two layers of thin metal mesh to ensure even the smallest seeds and particles are caught in the net . It has a traditional soft black rubber Oxo handle , too . This is important when using it over the sink as it keeps it from slipping around when the water hits it . Nice !
5 #### I bought this for one project , arrived quick , worked as advertised and will work for many more years . now if we could just get dewalt to manufacture in the USA again and amazon to specify where things were made it would make getting products even easier .
3 #### I love the color . I use primarily for smoothies every morning , and it 's not very powerful . It gets the job done , but takes a little while to get started . If aesthetics over power is your priority , it 's perfect .
5 #### I really did not want to purchase ANYTHING , but I have an ignorant person in my neighborhood who just lets their dog do whatever it wants , wherever it wants . And it ususally picked my lawn because it is a beautiful lawn . I work hard to keep it that way and was so tired of cleaning every morning after this ignorant persons ' dog . So , after reading reviews of the scarecrow , I decided to get one . At one point I tried to cancel the order , but Amazon is sooo quick , it had already shipped . I am glad . Since I set it up , and have used it nightly , I have not had to clean after the dog or any animal . I tried to cancel the order because I felt I did not want to hurt any animal , it is not the dogs fault the owner is irresponsible and does not leash them . Then I realozed that it is just water , and most animals do not like getting sprayed , and it is not because they get harmed , but more like scared . I am sure if the dog got squirted once , it will not want it to happen again . Plus the Scarecrow makes a noise that also startles people , it startled me as I was setting it up . Now I have a few neighbors who want to purchase one because guess where ignoramuses dog is going now ......
3 #### I bought this to turn on a bug zapper outside 20 feet from the patio . I set it to On / Off at Dusk / Dawn and it seems to have been working fine , except a couple mornings I looked outside at 2 or 3 in the morning and the bug zapper was off .
4 #### I wanted a small grill to use whenever I wanted to grill , which is not too often . This grill is plenty for me
5 #### THIS IS THE SECOND HOUSE I HAVE PURCHASED . A LITTLE HARD TO PUT TOGETHER BUT FUN ... ONE NEGATIVE , THE PLASTIC LEGS THAT ARE ON THE FLOOR WILL EVENTUALLY GET WORN .. I SAND DOWN THE PART THAT GOES THROUGH THE HOLE , DRILL A SMALL HOLE THEN PUT A SCREW AND WASHER TO HOLD IT TO THE FLOOR . WORKS GREAT AND I DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE STEPS FALLING OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SEASON . ADDITIONALLY I DRILL A HOLE THROUGH THE MOUNTING POLE AT THE TOP WHERE THE CAP IS . THE PLACE AT 3 FOOT ROD THROUGH IT , THEN PUT THE CAP ON . THE BIRDS LOVE IT . LEAVES ABOUT A 1/4 INCH GAP FROM THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND THE CAP ... ALSO I PLACE ONE OF THOSE SCREW TYPE HOSE CONNECTORS AROUND THE POLE WHERE THE BOTTOM OF THE LOWER HOUSE SETS NEXT TO THE SET SCREW . ONE LAST THING I MARK EVERYTHING WITH SHARPIE SO WHEN I TAKE IT APART IT 'S EASY TO SET UP AFTER CLEANING ETC .
1 #### Instapure was like the first brand to make this kind of filter . It 's OK but it 's cheap . Connection to the faucet dribbles water even though gaskets are used . Water flow out the filter is n't smooth making it hard to fill a water bottle . Likewise with the flow out the unfiltered spout .... the water does n't even flow out perfectly vertical , it 's squirts somewhat to the side making you think there is something stuck inside inhibiting the flow . Filter works well enough though . Water tastes good . Update 10/2014 . The gaskets failed and it started squirting water everywhere . Tightening it more did n't help and I ended up stripping the treads . This thing is going in the trash . Instapure is not what it once was . Going to buy a Pur filter . Look for my review on that .
4 #### Nice and easy to handle machine with a strong motor , easy to clean filter and good accessory package . Overall this is a good little vacuum for cleaning stairs and car interiors . However , it has 2 problems . First , the plastic suction hose is cheap and kinks and collapses easily . It has no reinforcing , so you do n't want to step on it or bend it around a corner . Second , the hose is a corrugated pipe style with accordion pleats the entire length . This gives the hose a little strength , but it makes it very prone to clogs and things sticking in the folds . I have learned to check the vacuum suction each time I use it . If it feels weak , I need to take off the hose and shake it clean . In good clean condition , it works as well as any canister .
5 #### Planted it less than a week they were coming up so happy my cats will be too I will refer this to friends & family . Thanks so much Kim.they r growing so fast I will have to get a a bigger planter soon.after my friend killed all my plants I have replanted now I am waiting again and replacing seeds . I had gotten the wrong order they sent me new order I will plant when my grow lights get in 5 days they were easy to work with I did not plant all my seeds at once just a little at first on some seeds . Thanks so much luvthatboo
4 #### My first cake came out perfectly - both out of the pan and tastewise .
5 #### Flies are VERY attracted to this stuff ! ! I would recommend and purchase again !
5 #### It feel like its really heavy duty . I think it 's going to hold up for a long time .
5 #### Just bought a month ago and so far works very well .
4 #### The features on this gun are great , the front light is handy for trimming out the inside of a closet or other dark space , the exhaust is directed out the back of the handle so you will get less mouthfuls of dirt and dust . Although available i ca nt find a reason to turn on the bump setting ( its a trim gun , you 're not sheeting a roof ) . The front of the gun has a nice secure locking mechanism that lets you open it up to clear the eventual jammed nail . The depth setting dial is slightly annoying , its just forward of your trigger finger and the ( + ) and ( - ) indicators are on the down facing surface so when you forget what way is what you need to keep turning the gun upside down and on an angle to read the matte black on black plastic graphic of a nail head above or below a line . That 's a bit of a nit pick and i suppose a sharpie marker can fix this issue . The case is also real nice , and it comes with interchangeable profile tips if you 're into that sort of thing .
5 #### These fit over my old metal claps and protect the wood . They are SOOOO much easier than holding little pieces of wood while you tighten a clamp .
3 #### I odered 2 at the wrong length so they ate too short for my front amd back patios . I was inexperienced in knowing how to purchase one . But they seem to retain their shape , good condition amd hooks up to the faucet adequately .
5 #### Installed directly to my Dremel 8220 wireless . I can now have better control over my etchings , engravings , or magnet hole cutting for miniatures ! I had this from my old Dremel 4000 set I used to have , but I wore that whole thing out from poor maintenance .
5 #### Needed a replacement chain for my chainsaw . This one did the job . It cuts well and came sharp out of the box ..
5 #### This thing really works . It simply a piece of rolled rubber . I would say costs next to nothing to make but they get good money for it . Whoever invented this is going to make a mint ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### These work great at organizing my batteries . They allow me to remove them from it 's package that they were bought in saving me much storage space .
5 #### I have regular channel locks but the V - Jaw is a nice added feature . These I can tell will get plenty of use .
3 #### Hinge too stiff . My experience is stiff hinge when new does not loosen over time . It will only bind at which point it becomes a garbage .
5 #### With 40 grit this thing eats wood fast . Going down to 80 then 120 leaves wood very smooth and does it relatively quick . This beast is a work horse . Powerful so you better hang on when you pull the trigger . Dust collection works real well . Even better when I hooked it up to my dust collector . Kinda heavy but that works to your advantage . After using this beast for literally hours at one setting I highly recommend the Makita 9403 .
4 #### The printed instructions on this wire hanging flower pit leave a little to be desired , but I ca n't complain about the adjustability . The bracket part really does accommodate a large variety of ledges and edges . The holder looks unassuming when hanging over the fence , and is big enough for most medium plant pots . It looks GREAT with a flowering plant draping down over the edges . The black vinyl coating is nice and should help keep this from getting rusty too soon . It seems pretty strong , and the weight of a potted plant seems to stabilize things quite well . For some reason , my set came with four extra metal brackets , and a ton of extra bolts . I was n't able to figure out what to do with the extra brackets , which are metal , like the entire set - up . I will probably recycle them , unless I can figure out a reason to keep them around .
5 #### Very Fast Shipping ! Great quality as expected ! Awesome ! Thank You !
5 #### love it i do n't need to connect to other water hose.this what i need.good product so far.thank you , sofia
1 #### When people claim that things made in China do n't last , they must have been looking at this piece . While running it , one of the blades fell off . I tried glueing the blade back on but it did n't last . I was surprised to see how flimsy the blade assembly was . Poor .
5 #### Works well on my DeWalt portable table saw . Catches a huge percentage of the dust without using a vac .
5 #### This has to be the best pair of cutters I have bought in a long time . They cut the light sheet metal I was using and the vinyl siding that needed cutting . They cut the cardboard and the copper sheets . They are comfortable to use and they seem to be the first pair of shears I pick up when cutting differing materials I use in my home .
5 #### This is an update to my previous review . Only gave it 3 stars and said it wasen"t as good as a previous one . MY MISTAKE ! I did n't think to compare them on the same hose . Seems my water pressure is way more powerful in the front yard ( near the water inlet ) than the backyard pressure . It finally dawned on me to compare the old nozel with the new on the same outlet . Both nozels are of the same brand and both are equally good . For best results the pressure must be strong . I am completely satisfied with this product . Sorry for a previous bum review Amazon and Bon - Aire . Original Bon - Aire is 2 yrs old and works great . No worries mate .
5 #### Been using it for our pool for two months and havn't had a problem yet . Programming was easy once I read the directions and it has a lot of features we can utilize later as well . A very good outdoor timer .
4 #### I really get use out of this cutter . I make french fry hash browns . Skin on or off works very well . The only drawback is a bit of difficulty to track down some small pieces of potato that hides in the grooves for the side slides . I usually slice up a whole bag of potatoes at one time and put them in zip lock bags in the freezer for quick tators for any meal . Deep fried or pan fried they remind me of my time digging tators as a child on the farm .
1 #### Stuck and absolutely useless ! ! ! ! Try to contact the company but there are nonexistent ,
3 #### This is part of a Christmas gift so I really do n't know yet
5 #### Looks great , well constructed and does the job ! I just wish it would clean the toilet automatically :) Recommended !
4 #### Will wait on final review till hose goes through cold weather . So far I 'm happy with the hose . Has n't kinked up yet .
5 #### A previous reviewer noted it is a cheaper and gaudy feeder , but there are 3 to 1 more hummingbirds at this feeder than the other models I own . I 've had to replace the yellow bee guards after 3 years of use , but they are readily available for $ 5.79 here on Amazon . Dissembles easily for cleaning . I have an electric water boiling kettle and use boiling water to clean the parts . I think the hummingbirds like the flower openings facing to the side versus up . Here in Texas there are very few flowers because of the drought , so between my Mexican Firebushes and these feeders I need an air traffic controller in my back yard .
4 #### I changed out 2 dead bulbs with these and they are working fine . I 'm happy that I got 10 of these for less than the these 2 would have cost me at the local big box store . Now I have 8 more available for the future . I 'm happy .
4 #### Beautifully made combination square . But when I received it , I noticed the scribe was missing from the head . So , back it goes to Amazon for a replacement .
5 #### found out that nails play havoc on a planer ... As good as original quality ... Was like new after replacement . Be warned , they are quite sharp when you get them . So handle with care . I recommend it .
5 #### Got 2 of these to do my outdoor Christmas lights . They are quick and easy to setup . They lasted through the snow / rain / cold weather . Very satisfied .
5 #### It was not expensive and I did not expect a high end fixture . It was easy to install and is exactly what I wanted in finished basement . We have an L basement and use larger area and seldom need light on the small end of L. A pull chain light is exactly the thing to save electricity and provide light when needed . A similar model at both big box hardware stores would only install on a ceiling fan and would have required some serious tweeking on ceiling housing to install . I like this purchase and it exemplifies the reason I like Amazon . It has so much of what I want and ca n't find elsewhere for good price .
5 #### Very nice quality , I bought this to match my other oxo products . Easy to clean and the rubber has a good feel to it .
5 #### I love this fountain , as it matches the lion head plaques that I ordered . It 's made of a composite , so it 's not real heavy and should n't rust . It looks exactly like painted iron . It has a simple pump and light , also .
5 #### Very sharp , big , and heavy duty . Great in the dishwasher too . Love this pizza cutter .
4 #### Very good , sturdy clamps . I only rated them 4 stars because Rocklers surefoot is a much better design with equal the quality . Use galvanized pipe , same price & it wo n't rust or stain your work . Also for some homebrewed clamp pads take some scrap 3/4 " fir plywood , it 's relatively soft & does n't split , cut it into roughly 2 " x 3 1/2 " pieces . Then drill a 1 1/8 " hole towards one end & paint it with polyuerathane . Slip it over the pipe & screw it to the clamp faces from behind with # 6 x 3/4 " sheet metal screws . You 'll wind up with decent clamp pads that wo n't stick to glue or come off of the clamp .
1 #### I am an electrician of over 30 years . I bought a Checkpoint level some years ago because of the 30 degree bubble , the super strong magnets , the durable construction and because it was Made in the USA . It was by far the best torpedo level I ever owned . I replaced it after I lost my first one and the second one had MAJOR problems ( it says G3 on it ) . The level was VERY inacurate on every bubble , the bubbles in all of the vials were too small in relation to the lines on the vial which made it very difficult to read ( even if they were acurate ) and it was not Made in the USA . The only remaining good features are the durability and strong magnets , WHAT VALUE IS THAT TO AN INACURATE LEVEL ? NONE ! !
5 #### Big and have a good weight and feel when swinging it , splitting on one stroke .
3 #### ok , does not attract stink bugs , my main purpose for it .
4 #### Very good pliers , but I would prefer the handles had a standard old school curve to them instead of the turn up at the end , that is kind of uncomfortable .
5 #### Just what I was looking for . I have wood floor kitchen and the rest of house carpeting I am elderly and this little guy is real handy at sweeping my kitchen and spot vacuuming my carpet especially with having 2 cats in house . Hate dragging out my regular vac for small jobs . It does a really good job with floor and carpet . I have not had to switch out the spare battery as the power in one is sufficient for light jobs . The filter is very snug and takes a little practice to reseat itself so have to be careful when reseating so as not to damage the seal . I did purchase an extra filter when I bought the vac so as to have a filter on hand in the future . the ability to use this as a hand vacuum is nice . I plan on using that on my basement stairs .
5 #### Good set , we are using it for multiple purposes with our little oven and it seems like it made of high quality materials .
4 #### This compact lopper will cut any softwood you can fit into it . Hardwoods can be a little more difficult but it is the best lopper of it 's size I have ever owned .
5 #### easy and simple . no batteries and can see the numbers clearly
5 #### I bought this chime about four years ago which sounds real nice , good quality . We just had a bad snow storm with 50 mph winds gusts and the center string broke . The wood feather went off into where ever . Customer Service @ Woodstock Percussion sent me a replacement free of charge even after it was out of warranty . Will diffidently buy their products again .
5 #### This is a standard Siemens 2 pole 30 amp 240V GFCI breaker . A breaker must be made for the panel for which it was designed . For example , I have a Siemens breaker panel and needed a Siemens breaker . None of my local hardware stores carried this breaker . I am sure that some electrical supply houses do , but I am a DIY person and do n't have a license to shop at those locations . Amazon was a great choice for me . The price was high , but I needed GFCI protection for my application . This product is for someone who knows about electrical . If you have any questions be safe and consult a qualified electrician .
5 #### When you need it it can be there in 2 days without leaving the house -
5 #### I used this to repair an older Gilmour 2000 PPW , two gallon sprayer and it fit and worked just fine .
5 #### I was going to buy a smaller 21x3 , but found this Makita for not a whole lot more . I could n't resist - especially as I like Makita tools . On arrival , it appears that the unit I received had already been used . That made me pretty mad but I decided to test it out before returning it to Amazon . Hey , it was already used so no big deal . Well , I ai n't giving it back now . The only down side is that this thing is heavy . One of my projects involves removing a bunch of material from some walls . I do n't know how long I can hold this heavy beast against a wall though . On the other hand , horizontal - ish surfaces are super easy because the unit 's weight means all I have to do is keep control . You do n't want this to be your only power sander though . It works fast , but that also means it can cause a lot of damage in a hurry too . For example , a little slip and you 've rounded an edge rather nicely . It would be very hard to round all the corners evenly though .
5 #### THIS HEATER IS GREAT . TAKE IT SALMON FISHING EVERY YEAR FOR OUR LARGE TENT . I ALSO USE IT TO HEAT MY 1975 CARGO VAN IN THE WINTER .
5 #### This must have tool was a bit smaller than expected , but I love this little flat whisk ; excellent for making roux or butter based sauces the whisk effectively gets into the curves of a saucepan . Another well - made tool from OXO !
4 #### I would have rated the rain gauge a 5 but the measuring marks are impossible to read . I resolved this by coating the measurements with a permanent black ink felt tip marker , works beautifully now . I hope the gauge is indestructible and last as long time since I farm and use the rain gauge for making soil moisture decisions .
5 #### Good quality peeler . It is has a very comfortable feel in my hand , and peels various types of veggies easily . It 's easy to clean , too !
5 #### An outstanding little axe and small wood splitter . I got it for splitting 6 - 8 " and smaller sizes of wood and making kindling and it is nothing short of perfect for splitting and light chopping chores as it is a real axe . I use 3 to 4 cords of wood a year so there 's a lot of resizing done during the winter . I like it as it works very well one handed for the average man and easily adapts to two handed chopping for those of lighter stature . It goes through a chunk of oak like a dream and is so much easier to use than the full size 6 # maul . I work with gloves so my only addition was to wrap 3/4 of the handle with a layer of friction tape to insure a solid non slip grip .
5 #### As expected . Sturdy and not difficult to assemble . I assembled it alone and I 'm not a particularly handy middle aged woman .
4 #### I have three of these knives , the oldest of which is more than four years old . They are well constructed and remain sharp despite heavy use .
5 #### I 've been using Dremels for 30 yrs . This is a great attachment for precise work . I highly recommend it .
5 #### I have used these halogen bulbs as replacements for a number of years and found them to be a good option to buying the same bulbs , ( voltage and wattage ) , that are more expensive . I have not done any actual study to see how long they last but they seem to fair very well long term .
5 #### I 've been using these tapes daily for 45 years as a professional cabinetmaker . They are the standard by which all other tapes are measured .
5 #### just the size that I was looking for . Stays very sharp .. great transaction fast shipping . I love the knife very much
5 #### bought this for m y new dremel , have n't used it yet , but is a good value at a good price . Quality piece
4 #### Good stuff but far more expensive than purchasing at Walmart
5 #### expect it to be full in a week it works that well
5 #### Replacement bulbs at a fraction of the store price . Not frequently used in light fixtures so retailers seem to charge what they like for replacement bulbs . I stocked up with a lifetime supply .
5 #### A must have for any tool belt . Ca n't get better quality if you were willing to spend ten times as much . If you need to cut , clip , snip anything , these will do the trick without fatigue .
4 #### These do exactly what they say they will do for your pond , no complaints . They are much less expensive here than a lot of places I checked out . I would recommend these to everyone .
5 #### You can never go wrong with OXO ! The base and holder allow for a better grasp while mixing and the bowl itself is easy to clean .
4 #### Bought this one after BioLogic spreader came in broken box and a missing piece or two . It 's been a fine spreader so far . Have n't been real challenged figuring out spreader rates so far , though the mental math could be made easier if they included some Scott 's conversion tables . I like it fine so far
5 #### Like the title says , I found this pressure cooker to be just perfect . I have a 4 qt and a 8 qt one , they are both presto , same model , and I could not say one single bad thing about these cookers . Definitively worth the money . Also , you can use them as normal cookers , and they are almost less expensive than good quality normal cookers .
5 #### Super fast shipping and the item is as described . I 'm very happy with my purchase .
4 #### After 4 days my pond has cleared nicely . The bale of Barley Straw was placed near the waterfall so there was a constant flow over the bale . The bale has taken on a green tinge , I believe this is the beneficial algae growth on the bale . Please note that this barley straw will work mostly on string algae and not on suspended algae . I am also using a Pondmaster 10watt UV sterilizer which is also available on Amazon .
4 #### Decent purchase one broke fairly easily so hopefully the others are better
5 #### Worked for me filling small and big splits in a walnut table . Built it up in layers stainning as I went . Finished with layered , stained filler . Respectable finish .
5 #### I bought this timer to control my water heater . It works great saved me money on my electric bill already . It was easy to install right next to my water heater . I am a do it your self Woman and I was able to install it myself in about a half an hour with only one trip to the hardware store to buy the wire and flexible conduit that I needed to install . I would highly recommend this timer if you want to save money on your electric bill . It is simple and straight forward .
5 #### Gets the job done . No more stretching my other pliers to the max
3 #### Not very happy with the action on these -- they stick slightly after you close them . Perhaps not a great pressure spring , or it could have something to do with the locking mechanism at the top . I think I overpaid for what seems to be a cheaply made product . Next time I will go somewhere and try out the action before purchasing , instead of simply relying on the OXO brand name to be good .
5 #### After breaking two hammers , this should be the last hammer I 'll need .
5 #### Easy to clean . The quality of this pressure cooker far outweighs that of the electric one I had with it 's paper weight insert coated with flaking non stick coating . It 's great to be able to cook a great meal in minutes opposed to hours and the recipes are very good .
5 #### A great product and excellent quality . This replacement blade works better than the original . I will be buying this part again !
5 #### This works very well with my huge drill press . I can move it anywhere in the shop and its very handy .
1 #### Would not recommend popcorn popper ! When I initially bought it I used it a few times and kind of put it away . I have been using it for the last month and 1/2 maybe every few days and the knob that holds down the bar that rotates keeps coming off in the middle of popping . That 's my story and I 'm sticking to it . I wo n't ever buy this product again
5 #### Fluidmaster simply makes the best toilet tank fill valves . Easy to install . Easy to adjust .
1 #### My cutter blades on it chipped out already , not sure if it 's a fluke or not , when they were cutting they were awesome at first , but now not worth the money spent on them . I only clip copper electrical wire , the thinner stuff so was pretty disappointed .
1 #### I hate to talk bad about anything however the level I received was not true and was not able to callibrate it . I hate shoddy tool for I make my living with them . I wound up having to go to Lowes and purchase a new Mayes level to complete the job . verry dissapointed .
2 #### would n't get again , cheaply made and it seems not to give correct temp
4 #### nice points , very few knots in my bunch . A little soft ( pine ) but with care I 've pounded them into fairly hard ground . Probably wo n't last in the weather very long because their are pine , but for the price pretty decent . I ordered a second bundle .
5 #### These stands are of thicker metal and are constructed very well . Once assembled these stands are solid . I would highly recommend !
1 #### You might as well wrap them around your ankles because they 'll be down there in no time . And the pads are kind of narrow , they want to tip one way or the other if you 're not squarely on them . Wish I 'd never bought them , pretty expensive lesson .
5 #### Great pie server with cerrated side - very sturdy , washes in dishwasher with no problems . Overall very satisfied with the purchase .
5 #### I love this peeler . It fits perfectly in my hand and is so comfortable to hold . It almost makes me excited to have to peel potatoes .
5 #### Original Manufacture Item(make sure your chain saw is compatible),color match for chain saw bar as well . No instructions included so , unless your familiar with chain replacement , refer to chain saw users manual for instructions . With continued or heavy use , these chains ware out quite frequently , it is recommended you purchase more than one or , a sharpening kit . Excellent value . Highly recommended .
5 #### This is top quality , cost no more than common tools , You ca n't go wrong with this system ......... various handle lengths / heads , glad I found these .
5 #### Perfect for a wedding . But does need to be staked or it will blow over . Was just perfect for three people . Made the wedding .
4 #### This spatula is great , however it 's extremely thin . Be aware it might bend ( just like mine did ) .
5 #### What a clever little , tool , I use it for pie crusts to mixing home made pasta . Is mixes things so easily scrambled eggs are a breeze , improbably use this fork 3 - 5 times a week . Extremely affordable it 's many and diverse uses .
5 #### Unlike that blue crystal stuff , this bait really works . It reeks , but if that 's what it takes to knock down the fly population , so be it .
5 #### Just love this for steaks ! Grill recessed slightly below pan edge prevents most splattering while roasting ( not broiling ) steaks in the oven . This is all I wanted , and it cleans up great in the dishwasher . Fine product .
3 #### Will recommend buyers to buy it for the money it works fine for me .
5 #### Recommended by America 's Test Kitchen . Sturdy unlike the one I 'm tossing out . Read the directions to see how the handle can be pushed down for easy storage . Also note that it has a brake to stop the spinning .
5 #### Fast service . Product works fine . Well made . I was n't watching , but time synced within an hour while I was installing the clock .
5 #### ordered this cause every time I go to the big box , I forget to pick this up . Price was actually cheaper ! But the holder was cracked when received . It was packed loosely and this may have caused the grey cover to crack so I really can use the pack as a dispenser .
5 #### I would never believe that I would be feeding squirrels . I guess you should never say never . I had decided to feed the birds this winter and bought a nice bird feeder . Filled it with seeds and put it out in the yard close to the window so I could watch . Only to see my neighborhood squirrels handing off it . It took them a while to figure out how to climb the pole and out smart the other squirrel deterrent devices , but I had to face it and do something about the squirrels . I saw this bag of Squirrel feed got it and but it in a metal box I found in a pet store called a squirrel lunch box . Well that did it they are busy eating their own food and they leave the bird feeder to the birds . The big birds like the jays also eat from the squirrels lunch box .
4 #### I like it is cordless and reasonable suction and sweeping motion to clean the floor . I have 2 kids age 2 - 4 and it helps to clean the floor as needed . However , the battery does n't last too long , you 'll definitely require 2 to support longer use .
5 #### A very strong spray . The threaded nozzle proved very handy for attaching a gentle sprayer since I use this for gardening and not for cleaning .
5 #### I got these to replace vp100 VersaPak , Amazon had the best price and delivery was fast .
5 #### We 've owned several over the years . They do n't last as long as we would like , but it 's a small cost compared to having a pond .
5 #### This thing did an excellent job popping corn . There 's not much to say . It did n't even leave any unpopped kernels .
2 #### The description says that it has an AMBER lens . It does not , so I had to return it .
5 #### Great product . Smokes well , and makes for very flavorful meats .
5 #### Acquired a granite topped table saw that was missing its original casters , and tried a different ( cheaper ) mobile base . Saw weighs over 400 pounds and that was n't going to work . This base seems to handle the weight fine , and rolls around the shop much easier than the other . I would n't hesistate to put any of the equipment in my shop on this base .
5 #### I 'm a fan of this little thing .... when I can find it lol . It 's great for little touch ups and all sorts of odd jobs .
3 #### Not very sharp out of box , very disappointing , I will try to sharpen , not sure of the best way yet .
5 #### Very pleased . High fllow if you want it on all types of patterns . The shut off positions actually shut off , and the connections are well made so they do n't leak .
5 #### Absolutely amazing ! Splits wood with very little effort compared to my last one .
5 #### This is an amazing fork . It is very good quality and feels good in your hand . It is long enough to go thru a large roast . Very pleased with it .
5 #### Great . The print is clear and the slide is handy . The joints are a bit tight , and I am sure will move more easily soon .
5 #### Surprise gift for one of my sisters . Guess she likes it ....
2 #### Worked well for a while . I have it turning on at dusk off at sunrise during the summer . It lasted less than a year and now the light only works not the bug zapper around it .
5 #### This timer allows you to set a device to turn on at dusk and remain on all night ( then turn on ) , or turn on at dusk and stay on for 2 , 4 , 6 , or 8 hours . I like that you can limit the number of hours because this is awesome for a bug zapper . It allows for some cost savings , and saves the mosquito attractant so it does n't get used quite as fast . Works as works well , and is a cinch to set up . Literally a dial with the described modes , plug it in , plug in your appliance , and voila ! Definitely a very nice & simple product .
5 #### LOVE IT ! Just like mosquitos love me . This really helped .
5 #### I love making stir fry at home and fried rice , but with an electric smooth top cooktop , you just ca n't get a normal wok hot enough to make it close to restaurant quality . A commercial wok can see 800+F degrees , which will be tough to duplicate at home without commercial equipment . Plus , the house smells like a restaurant for the whole night . I bought this to use on my grill and it has n't let me down . The only downfall is that once it cools down , it takes a long time to heat back up . But that 's not the products fault , that 's just how cast iron is . But it gets hot , it 's getting more seasoned and slippery as I use it . It 's heavy too , but again , it 's cast iron ! This is a keeper and a wonderful tool in my kitchen arsenal .
5 #### they are not a durable as some of those in the stores but work better The only problem is you can not connect hoses to the end
5 #### This is my main mixing bowl . If you 're familiar with Oxo products , you know how good the quality is and this bowl is no different . I love that it stays put , even when using an electric mixer . The lip is helpful for pouring out batter too . Great bowl !
2 #### Time will tell , but it looks like an awesome hose . The end where you hook up the sprayer was bent , but maybe it was just from where it was wound . It has a lifetime guarantee and that is good enough for me . I also bought A Gilmore Spray Nozzle . Update 6/25/15 Does leak all over the place , it could be the end from where you put the sprayer on , but not what I expected . It is also very heavy . You need a special long nozzle to prevent your wrists from giving out or creating carpel tunnel . I wish I had of gotten something else now . I never did like the idea that the end was bent a little . It is still awfully heavy . Do n't like it .
5 #### Great price , and solid fell , not thin plastic . Needed when I upgraded my switch to a dimmer switch and needed this configuration . The color matches my switches perfectly .
5 #### Got to spray degreaser on engine to clean easy to move around under hood
4 #### Excellent router . Nice motor . The soft start is good . Not critical but the bit changes could be updated . I like doing things the old fashioned way and using wrenches to change the bits does n't bother me . We 've used this to turn large paneling bits . Most recently an enormous one that we had custom made . It handles it perpendicular to the grain with as little strain on the motor as could be anticipated . I 'm knocking a start for safety . I do n't like that the switch is on the top of the router . The top is proud of the switch , so if you set the router upside down , it wo n't hit the switch . Still I see our carpenters often holding the router against themselves as the use the wrenches to tight the router bits in place . I ca n't help picturing their bellies somehow hitting the switch and sending parts flying . With good safety practices those parts will be wrenches and not finger tips .
2 #### I loved this item because it reminded me of the balloons I would see floating overhead in New Mexico on a cool morning . Unfortunately the hummingbirds do not feel the same nostalgia . I had two different feeders . One in the back and one in the front . This one remained virtually untouched while the other emptied in two to three days . I even tried switching locations but it made no difference . My other feeder is the Perky - Pet 209 . The hummingbirds love it and I love how easy it is to clean . It comes apart both on the bottom and has a wide opening in the bottle part to get the gross gunk out which seems to happen more and more as the weather heats up . I make sure to keep it maintained and clean as I have learned that otherwise hummingbirds will become sick otherwise . Sad that my balloon floated into the Goodwill giveaway basket .
1 #### I recently purchased 2 more NeverKinks in Feb for me to use this spring as a garden hose . I 've used one of the 2 and got a dud this time . Water is squirting out below where you screw it onto the tap . This is the 4th NeverKink I 've purchased . It 's too late for me to return it since I bought it so early in the year . I was n't sure how to rate this since I really like using this hose for watering my garden because it 's lightweight and I did n't have a problem with the others I purchased . I did n't expect to get one that was n't made right . .
4 #### this puts a litle texture on the metal and is good for removing small bits of rust or debris before finishing if your not after a fine finish in need of sanding
5 #### My husband has n't had the chance to try out yet , but I 'm sure he will not have a problem with the chain whatsoever
5 #### Works great . I use it at my back door and keep it open with a fan blowing the fumes out when I use it to be cautious . But it works for me . Lazy man 's grilling .
5 #### I love this little tool . Works really fast so I can get my smoothies blended and off to work . I 'm going to order another soon so I will have a backup .
5 #### Very nice cleaning the grill . Probably the best I have ever used on the grill . Great product .
5 #### This is the best grater out there . No kitchen or cook should be without this tool ! Easy to clean as it comes apart , and it fits in a drawer nicely . Would highly recommend this grater to anyone in the market for a cool kitchen tool !
5 #### My pumps are attached to filter boxes , and that puts stress on this part . Sometimes I break them when pulling the boxes out of the pond for cleaning . This is an inexpensive fix which just takes a few minutes .
5 #### This product is great ! It lets you easily and quickly attach or detach it from your ladder . It could n't be easier to use .
5 #### While some of the early reviews for these spoons were negative , it 's my belief the early complaints have been addressed . I , for one , really like these measuring spoons . While it would be best for me if the sizes printed on the handles were a bit brighter ( as they often get dusty or messy when using them with many ingredients ) , I 'm pleased with them in just about every other way I can think of . What drew me to these measuring spoons first was this : they actually have a spoon for a HALF tablespoon . Look around - most do n't . To get a half tablespoon measurement previously , I 've had to measure out a teaspoon and a half teaspoon ... a pain in the neck when you 're dealing with repeated uses of that particular size . You also get a 1/8 teaspoon size ( and 1/4 tsp , 1/2 tsp , 1 tsp , and 1 Tbsp sizes ) . What I also like about these spoons is that they are comfortable to use , have a nice tactile grip , and their handles are long enough that your fingers do n't end up in the product . They are also easy to clean . All in all , a good set of measuring spoons at a very affordable price .
3 #### Purchased the 3670 G via Amazon . Just arrived and immediately plugged it into my Kill - A - Watt . The device shows amperage draw on anything plugged into it and it shows the Mite is only drawing 10amps . Either I received the 10amp model that other reviewers have posted about ( old reviews though ... two year old reviews ) or the mfg is lying about it 's capabilities . Having said all that , it 's a nice , simple , lightweight machine that really sucks ( in a good way ) , but I ca n't help but wonder how much better it would perform if it was truly the 12amp model . If any other reviewers have any advice , please post a comment .
2 #### I bought this at a department store , but it 's the same model described here . This knife is useless . It shreds English muffins , no matter how careful I am , which I use it for most often . Does better on bagels because they are more dense . Same with the " Artisan " rolls from the market . Have to be careful not to see - saw the blade back and forth as that spells disaster . The edges of the blade scallops are sharp as they tend to snag the sponge when I 'm cleaning it , even being careful to hold the blade very flat against the sponge , but this snagging is entirely the problem . I 'm going to get rid of this knife somehow and I already bought another one listed on amazon which customers claim can neatly slice a wide range of foods . That might be the real mark of a good bread knife .
5 #### I love this can opener , it opens cans with ease and dose not hurt my hands like a lot of the other ones I have bought .
2 #### These last a little longer than other oscillating sprinklers made by this manufacturer , but they too will quickly start hanging up . They are better made that the all plastic ( green ) ones , but have the same unreliable mechanism . If you seek frustration this is the way to go !
5 #### I bought this to make potato bombs . Works great . Cores pineapples too !
5 #### Very , very grateful for all your detailed reviews . Ironically , for once the cheapest & lightest is perfect for the small to medium trimming tasks ! Thanks to each of you for taking the review time . As a result , I bought the right tool for a lifelong gardener now Turning 76 yrs but still capable to do my own yard & gardens but without it wearing me out . These are perfect for your pre - teen & teen helpers to use also - clean cuts , no hacking , no need to use brute force for effectiveness . Great intro too for their own gardening experience .
5 #### I bought this to start my 19 year old daughter 's kitchen off . It is one of my absolute favorite kitchen tools . The reason is that it 's nice and thin and can get under pancakes without mushing the edges . It can flip grilled cheese without mushing the edge of the bread . All of my other kitchen spatulas just do n't compare for most things . It needs to be metal and thin in order to do the job right . And it has never scratched my nonstick pans .
5 #### Before buying these , I was not very confident with makeshift supports to level the ladder . If I were to add up all the time required to manually level the ladder with wood and stakes , it would make the 3 hour install of these seem like nothing ! Adding an $ 80 accessory to a $ 200 ladder did initially seem extreme . Now that I see much easier it is to use my ladder , I ca n't imagine having an extension without auto - levelers . Moving along the gutters on my uneven grade is so easy now . Just give the ladder a little lift so that it is level , let it back down and the legs automatically engage ! I must admit having to permanently modify my ladder and making precise markings / drillings did have me worried . The instructions were very clear and the template provided helped to foolproof the process . If you 're handy enough to have an extension ladder , I would assume you should be able to pull this off . This weeekend - warrior did .
4 #### I 'm using this cover for a Husqvarna mower with 11 " wheels in the back . It does a great job covering the mower and protecting it but it 's a REALLY tight fit over the back wheels . I 'm able to get it on and secure the clips , but I would n't be surprised if the extra tension will cause this cover to rip sooner than it otherwise might have . Having said that , I do n't think there 's any other options to accommodate the bigger wheels especially in this price range . If it were n't for the wheels , I would have given it 5 stars .
5 #### Great replacement filter for A / c heating systems . Keeps it so you do n't end up blowing dust & dirt all over the house .
4 #### Great dust collection , tons of sanding pads to use including generics , plenty of power and cheap .
1 #### Here is the 100 % no BS review of this product . This thing catches 100 % of the flies it attracts . Granted they do n't go in within the first second of smelling this product , it might take a little while but they definitely go in this thing . Quality wise I would say its built really good . After adding the recommended amount of water it take a day or so to really make the stench of a rotting body . Now the ugly ! Your neighbors will love you for buying this product , because it attracts all the flies in the neighborhood . Seriously ALL THE FLIES . Here is a rundown of how this product works . Day1- No smell yet Day2- Nice stench of a rotting body begins Day3- Flies start to show up and get caught inside Day4 - 7- More flys show up and get caught Day8 - 30- Now the real fun begins . By this time all the flies within the surrounding area know where you live , and are inviting all of their cousins to come over . At this time the dead decaying flies make Maggots in the bag . Next thing you know their is a butt load of tiny flies and big flies swarming around this trap . I will never buy this trap again . I ended up buying a Bug - A - Salt and love it . Kills flies plus you get to have the fun of shooting them .
5 #### I love the smell of high quality tools in the morning . Smells like victory .
5 #### Really good pruners . My hand does not get as tired while using these during constant pruning work . They really are sized for different hand sizes . Nice that the pruners can be rebuilt so one worn part does not force you to buy a whole new pruner .
5 #### Fits like a glove .... but then it should it is a Shop - Vac part after all . Why do I need to type all of these extra words.geeze .
5 #### I had really bad green algae this year . I used Pool Perfect first to get rid of it . Worked extremely well ( would rate it ten if possible ) . It is important to note that the chlorine level needs to be 5 ppm or lower before using it .
5 #### Great way to sift - super helpful in the kitchen .
5 #### Love them very cool , grand kids think they are great
5 #### I have the blue handled version of this tool . Same thing just made for cutting harder wire . It is very well made and has n't rusted yet although it is best to spritz these tools with WD40 ( the only real use for the stuff other than taking grease off of car paint ) to be safe . I have used these mostly for pulling nails that are hard to get at . I do n't use them for electrical as I find they are not near as handy and unlike the previous reviewer I can not easily cut 12 gauge romex with them - it is simply too hard on the hands to use them for this purpose . 10 gauge Romex would be out of the question . I also do n't believe that they are intended for cutting Romex and unless you want to stain and hurt your hands I would n't use them . To cut Romex , the proper tool is the Klein linesman 's pliers . That tool cuts the Romex without much effort .
5 #### My moms is a huge Betty Boop Collector and I gave this to her for Christmas this year . Just let her open it early and she was in tears because she loved it so much ! Thank you ! These are awesome !
5 #### Works great on my portable table saw and holds a lot of saw dust , saves a bunch of clean up time great up grade .
4 #### I replaced my original mini - prep with this item after the plastic housing on the steel knife split . The first one lasted about ten years , and I used it quite often , tho it was not abused . Love the handiness of this item , it stores easily with a small footprint , parts go in the dishwasher for quick cleanup , just the right size for smaller jobs .
5 #### It 's the quality you 'd expect from Nordic Ware . Really fun for making pancakes for kids . Non stick . Only issue is flipping the pancake over . They tell you to put back into the mold it came out of but that 's not always easy . I just flip it onto the griddle I use for the adult pancakes . I 'm sure you could use this for other stuff too .
5 #### This is the best grill ever ! We 've had ours for about ten years and it still works great . We decided to give one to our daughter & son in law for Christmas .
4 #### This accessory is a good add on for a dremel tool . If you do inlays on small projects , like jewelry boxes or just adding a grove to a small project its great . Tasks like these are just about impossible to do free hand . This makes the dremel act like a router but a whole bunch cheaper . I do n't use the height gage on the front so I ca n't comment on that . I always measure with a metal square if accuracy is needed .
5 #### Top quality product , not a cheap imitation . This is the best it gets and a great price ! Tks Amazon .
4 #### I have had this for quite a while now . This was a great purchase I have had others in the past with less than great long term results
5 #### This is a one sturdy heady duty clamp that any woodworker should have a few . I love them . Home Depot currently has a sale on these
5 #### Fiskar products are great and live up to their reputation . It comes super sharp and is easily refreshed with a few strokes of their sharpener . With a firm stance and a healthy swing I can split wood and do light limbing . I really like mine and recommend it to you .
3 #### The whisk does the trick but the handle is too small . I do n't know , maybe I have ( not ) larger hands than most . No , the whisk did it 's job , I just found the handle to be too small ; uncomfortable for me .
5 #### I already had the 8 - quart bowl and was satisfied with it for beginning the kneading process for dough . With that size I eventually had to put the dough on the counter for the final kneading . With the 12 - quart size I can do the entire kneading in the bowl and not have the counter to clean when finished . Plus it 's almost large enough for a Saturday night bath .
4 #### Bought this to replace a Ryobi CLEAR screw guide that brook after eight years of use . With the clear guide , I can see if the driver is engaging the screw especially when installing ceiling fixtures with slotted screws . Hopefully this will last as long as the old one .
5 #### My wife said " Oh no , not another peeler " but this one is by far the best and one of my favorite tools in the kitchen . The grip makes it easy when you have a lot to do . This is a high quality tool that you should enjoy using for a long time .
3 #### These will only last about 1 year then they get holes and are useless so yes they do the job and you can get them cheap they are not perfect .
4 #### Watch the price closely on these . They were $ 52.25 w / free shippping last week here , now over $ 67 . I will buy locally .
5 #### I have had the tool for some time now and have used it enough to give an honest review . Ca n't go wrong with this product . It is great to nail molding without using a hammer and leaving the dent marks .
5 #### I bought my first trap 20 plus yrs ago the house we moved in got a huge Flea infection in our basement , i tried Flea Bombs did n't work , So i said to myself its worth a try . It killed all the fleas Dead . I loved it . This Summer it happened again . but this time its even worse all the rain must of done it .. My basement is once again infested with Fleas . I bought 1 trap , it was helping but not enough so i bought another one . both in the basement . i ordered what i thought was refills and bought refills plus another trap . Today i set up the 3rd trap this time up in the house.after i discovered my puppies have flea so it in there room . i have 3 refills left so next week i have to order more . just in case i did try flea drops on my dogs , & cats , flea collars , & flea powder none of it working this yr . so I 'm giving a lot of baths this time around plus the traps . But i will swear by these traps 100 % They Do the Job without all these Chemical you put in your Home , Your Lungs and In your animals . But i sure wish you would put more refills in the Package It gets Very Costly I ve already gone threw 12 so far
4 #### My picky husband loves this cutter . It is very sturdy and works well . Gave it four stars only because it is a bit awkward to store without getting cut . Would have been better if it came with some kind of case or sleeve to store it in .
5 #### These are great . Had the old ones for years and I confess , they were occasionally abused . I took a sharpener to the blade and got a few more miles out of them before deciding I needed to break down and buy new ones . Works on branches that were surprisingly large ( sorry ! ) but I hope to treat these better than the old ones .
5 #### I made a mistake and thought I was buying it w the light but it was only the sticky pads . So ... I put a lamp over the sticky pads that I had taped to cardboard(the pkg cardboard cut up to size ) . It works like a miracle ! I bet I have 200 on each sticky pad ! They 're attracted to light ! Any light ! I am very pleased w the non toxic pads ! Even flys and mosquitoes have adhered ' nicely ' ! I had used diatomaceous earth on the carpet after I vacuumed and it kinda poofed onto the pads so I had to change them a bit earlier . There was plenty of room for more but they started being able to pop off ... so a new pad is down and already has several on it ! Love these things !
5 #### Has n't broken in the past 6 months , which is more than I can say for 2 switches that it replaced .
3 #### The flag itself is nice . It 's an outdoor flag and is holding up well . The flag pole seems a little flimsy . The flag pole holders are useless . They are completely insufficient . They all bent within a day to three days . If you purchase this set , go ahead and purchase sturdier flag pole holders .
5 #### Great rounding bit and very forgiving . Have use it on hard and soft woods without any trouble .
5 #### I have been building my own house now for the past 2 years , buying tools as I need them . I have several air - powered nailers . None compare with the ease of use the Porter - Cable brand offers . I particularly like the wide range of nail lengths and the depth adjustment capability . Many other brands have very limited ability to handle differing nail lengths . Adjusting the driven nail depth on other nailers requires adjusting air pressure or complicated affairs needing wrenches . The FN250A has solved these two issues nicely . I highly recommend it . Now , if they would only develop an interchangeable nailing head and nail cartridge rail . . .
5 #### I like this spatula . I got it mainly because I have trouble getting eggs out of the frying pan without them sticking . I use stainless steel . I do n't like to use the stick free pans . It is different than any spatula I have used as it bends a lot . Hopefully , it will last a long time . At first I was afraid I would break it because of the way the spatula bends .
5 #### I purchased this base for my 14 " Jet band saw ( ~250 lbs . ) . The saw itself has some protrusions on the back of the stand for stability , so I was n't sure how appropriate a mobile base would be . As it turns out , placing a piece of 3/4 inch plywood into the base , then the saw on top of the plywood , worked well ( bolt stand , plywood , and base together ... some hole - drilling necessary ) . The unit moves easily with no instability and when stationary is very solid . Another poster mentioned that when preparing to move the base , the levers ( moved one at a time ) that raise the base on to the front wheels allowing movement tend to twist the base , rendering the entire unit ( base and machine ) more unstable ; this is true . However , the plywood helps minimize this , as does actuating both levers simultaneously . This mobile base , from my experience , is steady , solid , and , well , mobile ... just what I wanted . 5 stars .
4 #### is what it says it is - tapered to match wood screws replacement bit with quick connect chuck sharp point for quicker start it also seems to last long , fairly durable I appreciate the convenience of being able to purchase this on amazon , keeps me from having to track it down in local stock I would prefer it was a tad longer for greater versatility , but I realize that length is related to strength / breakability
5 #### This bracket is perfect for my Flowtron Fly Trap Dominator
3 #### While this is obviously a quality knife , it 's not what I ordered . The shape is completely different from the picture . The shape of the received knife does not work very well for cutting small items on a cutting board .
5 #### Well , I do not see the spray " ready to use " version of this , but that is what I am using in this brand . It has worked great for me to keep deer off . It really does smell , but the smell diminishes after a couple days , but not so to stop repelling the deer . I like this brand because unlike Off Deer repellant which clogs up the sprayer and ca n't be unclogged , this one does not clog at all . It really does the job for me and has n't harmed any plants I have sprayed it on . ( Elderberry bush , nasturtiens , crape myrtle , viburnum , roses , ground covers , petunia , Beauty Berry , all are fine . It works for a couple weeks if you are watering the base of plants and not watering heavy overhead . If you water every day overhead then you will need to use more often . I ca n't say how often because I never ever sprinkle .
5 #### 1ST UNIT WAS mississing a part , and would not close , returned , and reordered second one put on , and it works fine .
5 #### I have noticed this whisk used in most of the cooking shows on the food network . I decided to try this whisk out . It is balanced . The handle is shaped perfectly , and the grip is great . I will be making awesome fluffy inlets for years to come .
5 #### These appear to work fine . The plastic is a little harder than I expected . Still they work OK , do not mare the clamped wood .
5 #### Amazing Hammock - so comfy and durable . Everything description says and more - worth the price ! ! ! Could lay on it all day with no blankets or pillows . 2 people fit comfortable with room to spare
5 #### We had a little trouble getting them set up ( we have 4 of them ) and the timer to work , but once my husband got the kinks out , they kept the deer out of the yard . My husband set them up in a row along the ditch at the edge of the yard ( their entry point ) and pointed them down so that the deer would get hit in the face . Just wish we had them before the deer ate so much of our garden . Next year I may get to harvest some string beans !
5 #### Cuts the grass like a champ . This was purchased by my wife because ironically , she wanted the exercise . We have a two acre lot that is relatively flat grass and weeds . I seriously doubt she 'll be cutting 2 acres with it , but maybe 1/4 acre for the small low rider dogs we have . Item arrived as expected . It was packaged well and looks to be very good construction . Very easy to assemble ( within 5 minutes ) . Great for the ozone since fossil fuels are n't needed . Just some good old fashioned sweat . I 'm proud of my wife !
5 #### my 3rd or 4th purchase of this worm castings . I would love to grow my own worms but it 's just so much easier to buy these .
5 #### My whip I use when making lemon pie and my old one the handle broke so I bought a green colored cheap looking one and thru it in the garbage when I got this . Works perfect for heavier recipes to whip !
1 #### these did not work at all . must be a flaw in manufacture ! ! !
5 #### For whatever reason , the house I moved into had an electrical outlet on a hall and this electrical outlet was about 6 ft from the floor . I knew I would never use that electrical outlet so I bought this lamp and it works great ! highly recommended and I still get to keep an outlet . it easily accommodates a CFL bulb and its really easy to install , just follow the instructions so that you do n't end up breaking the lamp shade . ( its made out of glass )
2 #### The cast aluminum base had a hump in the casting 90 degrees to the plunge travel . Do n't expect to get good results with a tool that references the base to a flat surface when the tool rocks back and forth on its base . Yes the issue can be resolved with enough elbow grease . Just apply spray contact adhesive to the back side of coarse grit sandpaper , and stick it to the flat surface of a cast iron jointer table . Then rub it flat , and reattach the somewhat less than sturdy aluminum base plate . I just do n't like having to do makeshift finishing work on a poorly manufactured tool . And no , I did n't send it back for an exchange ( not purchased from Amazon ) . It only took the better part of one day to flatten the base . It would have taken two weeks for an exchange , which may or may not have been from the same production run with the same exact issue . Who knows ? In summary I have been duped by advertizing to expect that tools with DeWalts name on them should perform reasonably well out of the box . This one did not . Being gullible is my own fault so I am only deducting three stars . Not because the tool did not eventually work well , but because although I paid DeWalt ; they did n't pay me to do their work for them .
5 #### I have used these blades for unconventional recip saw duties for quite a while now . I have trimmed limbs as large as 8 " off trees and even cut down smaller trees . The only limit after the length of the blade is the length of your extension cord and the breadth of your imagination . You will want to use a little slower blade speed to keep the blade from " whipping , " but on thicker wood you can speed it up . You will find lots of uses for a recip blade this long . Maybe timber framing ? I do n't know , but someday I 'd like to try it . Lenox blades are the toughest , best made blades for recip saws . The brief history is that they were designed for plumbers to cut through pipe and were once only available through plumbing suppliers . Not anymore . The secret is out and you can even get them from Amazon ! At the end of the day these blades have more teeth left than the crowd at a barroom brawl ! You can " kill " one , but it takes alot more effort .
5 #### Excellent lopper . Well balanced , good leverage , sharp . I maintain a section of the Appalachian Trail and this is my preferred tool for keeping everything that does n't need a saw cut back .
5 #### With a big , sturdy handle , this grater is not only easy to grip , but stays put while grating a variety of foods . There are two sides to offer a fine grind , or a course grind . I have used it for a variety of cheeses , as well as carrots , squash and other hard vegetables . It easily comes clean in the dishwasher , and folds for better storage .
4 #### This is my 2nd one -- my first one died after 7 years . For the price , it 's great . It fits in awkward closets . I wish the cord was longer and was retractable . If it had those two things it would be PERFECT ! I do n't mind that it 's lightweight plastic -- it makes it SO much easier to lug around the house .
5 #### Tried and true old technology , works to get the pests out . Always satisfying to hear the snap and check and see what s waiting .
5 #### Was a gift for my daughter and she loves it !
4 #### Sharp , and easily gripped to open cans . Sometimes it does n't grab right away , but it could very well , be user error . I love them . Great find ! Would definitely recommend .
5 #### Super great ladder ! Very sturdy and easy to move around from job to job . Seller was great ! Really fast shipping , arrived two days before the first day of the Amazon delivery estimate , came with a free ( American Lock ) padlock too ! Highly recommend the seller and the ladder !
5 #### If you are going to get just one mixing bowl for your kitchen , just get the OXO . This company really puts a lot of thought into all it 's kitchen tools . This one has a none skid bottom , so it is like having an extra hand . The bowl is easy to wash , and is a real winner .
5 #### I used this brush for applying oil base stain ( Arborcoat by Benjamin Moore ) on wooden ceiling rafters and some old Flood brand stain I bought back in 2008 and never used on a beadboard porch ceiling . It performed flawlessly ; from holding stains that were very runny and watery , to cutting in . It also cleaned up nicely and held its shape . Highly recommended .
4 #### Good pot but we were disappointed in the size - it says 6 cup but they are VERY small cups indeed . So this pot will be passed on for a Christmas gift and we will order a bigger one . We have used one like this for years and do n't want to change the brand .
3 #### I find it amazing that they can weave such thin wire ( 20 guage ) in this pattern without breaking the wire often . Of course I have not unrolled the entire 50 feet yet so I may have some surprises . As others have noted their description of a 2 " mesh is inaccurate . It is perhaps 2x4 . Had I not been forewarned I would have been peeved . But for my use , restraining a pair of older cats for a few weeks , it will work out well .
5 #### These are excellent bulbs . They are a good combination of compact size and bright output . Some LED bulbs try to over - achieve by cramming too many LEDs onto the base to impress the buyer , but they often do not fit the stock location in cars and seem to compromise quality for quantity .
5 #### OUTTA THE DOG HOUSE FOR A LOOOOOONG TIME SINCE I GOT THIS FOR MY WOMAN ! ! ! HAHA ;)
5 #### I must admit that I was somewhat apprehensive buying a thirty - dollar mandoline ; at a quarter of what other units cost , I was afraid I was buying a toy . Not so . This unit is excellent . The cartridge for thin slicing slices vegetables to a satisfying and surprising thinness ( cucumber sandwiches , anyone ? ) I use the thick - slicing cartridge , along with a dehydrator , to make apple and pear chips ; that is , dried fruit the consistency of a potato chip . The apples fit the guard and the blade very well , and the rubber feet keep the bowl from skittering all over the counter ( marvelous ! ) Better yet , the bowl can be half - filled with acidulated water so that the apple slices immediately fall into the water , and thereby never brown . It has been said before , but I will reiterate : the blade is frighteningly sharp . I asked my wife if she would like to try slicing an apple for the chips . She placed the apple in the guard ( there is a clever prongs - and - pusher mechanism to anchor the fruit ) and started sliding it back and forth across the blade . After several passes , she said " something 's wrong , it 's not doing anything . " She turned the guard over , and half the apple had been sliced away without her noticing ! There is almost zero resistance from the blade . BE CAREFUL ! All in all , I am very satisfied . This is a great unit at an even better price . Order one ; I do n't think you will regret it .
1 #### On the day I installed this I would have given it 5 stars , but I never got around to posting a review ..... and that was a good thing . About two months after I installed them ( I have 3 toilets , I replace all when I do one ) I started to notice one was starting to squeak as it was finishing filling up , and shortly after that the other two started . So it was back to the " FluidMaster " 400 , we had always used the basic FM fill valve , but the quality had started to slip and they were only lasting 6 - 8 months , there once was a time where they would last 3,4,5 years ..... but nothing is built well anymore . So we upgraded tot he 400 series . My advice , save you money , do n't buy a Corky .
5 #### Works great with the Diplomat 8800 zapper . Helps attract thousands of Mosquitos every evening to get fried by the zapper !
5 #### Good gauge for keeping the depth cut teeth at the correct height . The metal of the gauge is harder than the file so it does n't wear out quickly if you hit it as you 're filing the chain .
5 #### Very solid , good design . This nozzle replaces a similar concept version that was not well made . The valve on the old one was plastic and broke easily . The valve on this one is brass , as it should be . I 'm expecting this to last for a very long time .
5 #### The poles are studry and very straight . Hope they will keep the tall flowers from falling over once they flower .
5 #### Perfect for watering a range of areas . Works great on a large expanse of lawn , but make a few adjustments and it can be used to water a narrow flower bed . Adjustments include water volume , and width of spray . Super pleased with this purchase . It is all plastic - hopefully it 'll hold up to continued use . Very pleased so far .
5 #### This product works great , catches them in no time . You will be surprised at how many flies you really have around your home . The only draw back is these are not reusable so you will have to buy them over and over again . However you can close the yellow top and throw all away without to much of a mess . These are easy to setup and use , just add water and you will have you a mess of flies inside in no time at all . It is well worth the money if you do n't want to reuse . I am really happy and thrilled that my flies are just about gone . You do want to place it in a sunny place so the smell will get out to the flies . I would n't place it near a open doorway or window . IT SMELLS real BAD ! ! ! !
3 #### Not great . I was trying to replace some of the plastic sprayers I have lost in a move ... this seemed to get good reviews but really it lacks several things . The bottle seems smaller than the others , fine ... the " fan " nozzle is a joke . Spray distance is lacking since you ca n't do anything to really adjust ( fan ... or no fan ... or upside down fan ... those are your options ) . It works ... so 3 stars ... but I 'm going back to plastic next time .
5 #### The title of the post says it all , and it 's my wife 's favorite color , Purple !
5 #### The finest pruners I have ever owned . Solid construction and excellent cutting ability . If you have smaller hands , consider a smaller size but for me they are exactly what I need .
4 #### The ThermaCell device works generally as advertised . The two " issues " I have had are shorter than the advertised life of the pads and Butane bottle and effectiveness with just a slight breeze . I have purchased a second one as it does work but not quite as well as advertised .
5 #### Wow ! ! ! This heater works great and will save my bacon if there is a power outage - AND- there usually is during the Winter months .
5 #### After doing a ton of research , I decided to go with this circular saw . Paid a little more to get the one with the case , but well worth it . The saw cuts extremely well and glides through even the most dense wood . It is very heavy for a circular saw , but makes up for it with its power .
3 #### A bit flimsy but value has yet to be determined as well as durability
5 #### After remodeling my kitchen , my canisters that I had for years did n't do anything for the room . I set out on a search to find some that I would be happy with . Once I saw these Certified International Rooster Canisters , I could n't be satisfied with any others , the colors and shape just did something for me . They are now sitting in my special reserved place for them , the colors are vivid and adds character to my kitchen , I love them !
1 #### Sadly , I have to agree with the one star reviewers on this thing . It was cheap , cheap is good , but sometimes ( and this is definitely one of those times ) you get exactly what you pay for . Not only did this take ages to reach me , when it finally arrived it was packaged in an envelope and made so cheaply that it was completely flattened and ruined when some giant apparently sat upon it . I tried bending the thing back into shape but the cheapo hinge is broken and it will not close . There is no way this is stainless steel . I know because I bought this to replace an actual stainless steel tea ball that I had for decades and which had finally given up the fight . This one is bendy and definitely made of sub par materials . I threw it in the trash because I did n't want to bother with sending it back to China which would waste more packaging . I 'll just buy one locally and pay the few bucks extra which is what I should 've done in the first place .
5 #### I became very tired of re - purchasing hoses from the warehouse that would fall apart annualy . This is a strong , high quality and flexible hose , even in cold weather . I should have looked for the goodyear quality of hose a long time ago .
5 #### I normally do not buy this high of a priced paint brush , but have purchased a few smaller trim Purdy paint brushes on sale at Lowes and HomeDepot . I bought this one from Amazon to paint four large garage cabinets with a semi - gloss paint , and am very pleased . Smooth and fast finish with brush marks almost non - discernible , easy cleanup and no loose brush bristles having to be picked out of the painted surface . Well worth the price paid because of the superior finish .
5 #### Just what I needed for the small baking jobs . Washes clean and clear every time .
5 #### I am REALLY bad at replacing filters . I use my shop vac to vacuum my tile floored home . It was amazing breathing while vacuuming after changing the filter . There is not just a cloud of dust all over , which is very counter productive to vacuuming
5 #### We have several woodstock chimes and added this to our collection . We have it in a moderately breezy spot , next to the others , and enjoy a peal of tones -- almost a concert -- a few times each day .
4 #### It 's nice and sharp , but need to hold it just so for it to work easily .
5 #### I really like this . Not right for everything as it is a thin and flimsy , but sometimes that is what you need for something delicate . It could be used as a daily spatula but I have a thicker one I prefer for some things . Great for fried eggs .
5 #### Little things make big things . This one is great , we do everything with this item . My wife loves it and happy wife happy life .
4 #### This treats 16 rose bushes if you mix it according to the directions . It seems to be working well as my rose bushes are thriving .
3 #### The shears are sharp and have a great ergonomic design . My complaint : during their first use , the loop of the handle cracked with not much pressure . In my opinion , the plastic is of inferior quality . I will try gluing the pieces and hope it does not happen again .
5 #### Exactly what I needed to replace the ones I lost . Top quality made tool
5 #### The other reviews were n't kidding . This is the best and quickest ( manual ) log splitter I have ever used . Its amazing how easy this makes splitting logs !
5 #### Should be on the list of must haves for your dewalt router . Easy to use and if you have the hard case it 'll store perfectly in it !
3 #### If you hate removing the blade from your Lawn Mower and want to improve the edge a bit it will help . Certainly not a replacement for a true Blade sharpening but it will do in a pinch .
5 #### Very nice table when assembled ... however when you put this thing together you will notice that all the little screws , etc are in different bags ... they could make it easier by putting all the stuff for each assembly step in one ( 1 ) dedicated bag ... that way you are n't looking through and opening different bags at different assembly steps . This is my only gripe and its not a big one ... I really like the accuracy of this table so far ... haven't used it much yet . I paired mine with the Triton 3 - 1/4 HP router and a Freud 1/2 " nine piece bit set ... set me back about $ 1000 for the package but its well worth the money ...
5 #### I wanted to test various parts of my garden soil to check the pH levels as well as the N , P , and K levels . This kit makes it a breeze . The pills are conveniently labeled and the instructions make it simple to understand what to do . The colored indicators make it easy to tell where your soil currently is at and the instructions give suggestions on how to adjust the levels should you need to .
1 #### Came thrown in a paper mailer , loose with no padding . Plastic cracked ( of course ) and unusable . I have better things to do with my life than stand in line at the post office to return this junk .
5 #### Real score is 5++++++ For $ 80 , it is real bargain . Every woodworker and carpenter should have this one . Do not need to buy inexpensive and frustratingly bad ones from Lowe 's and Home Depot .
2 #### More expensive than the box stores but the convenience of ordering online made up the difference . However , when I got the " standard " plate , it was smaller than the one the builder used ( what in the heck is " standard " on these things ? ) and so it 's into the trash and off to Home Depot for what I need . Measure your current plate to make sure it 's " standard " before you order .
5 #### Great outdoor clock . I 've had mine for over 11 years and it still runs an looks great .
4 #### Just plain cool . Pretty easy to read scales . Only disappointing thing to me is that since it 's made of plastic , it 's really light and can get away from you .
5 #### people complaining about this tape not having a metal housing are Harry Home owner wanna be's,,,,ive been in construction for more than 30 years,18 of those have been as a licensed contractor,,,,ive been using Stanley tapes for ever,,,,ive dropped these on slab floors from setting trusses and have never shattered the casing,,,,the blade is the part that fails , and for the price of these tapes , its not a big deal,,,,do not get me wrong , even as a contractor using these tapes day in day out all day and abusing them , they last
3 #### When I bought the vacuum , I thought its blow feature could be a big plus but the feature turned out to be just a joke . I should 've realized the blow came out from the vacuum blower port is just a ventilation ... what should I expect . Otherwise , the vacuum is fine .
5 #### Exactly as advertised . Would buy again without hesitation . Works great . I did de - burr the inside edge of the safety relief valve hole ( in the lid ) , as the edge was sharp and would eventually cut the neoprene button that plugs the hole as it is removed and re - installed for cleaning .
5 #### Flexogen are consistantly the best hoses I have ever used . Any hose can be kinked , but the eight ply resists it while remaining relatively supple . For the few people who encounter leaky ends , my advice is to take Gilmore up on their lifetime warrantee . Few companies stand by their products as well as the Gilmore Flexogen . I am proud to support American workers .
5 #### I ordered a porter cable NS150A 18 - guage stapler for my husband on the 27th and received it the morning of the 30th . My husband has already ran 100 staples through it , no misfires , plug - ups or problems whatsoever . He is very pleased with the fast delivery and performance of the product and quite pleased with his wife !
5 #### Have had this popper for over 6 months and it works as good as the Joe Namath one I had for over 20 years . 3 minutes and a full bowl of popcorn is yours !
4 #### I bought this in 2004 and although I use it still , I really need to order a new one . It has many small cracks in the plastic now and some of the markings are really hard to see . It also has a few chips off the rim . I love how it works and its my favorite measuring device , but the plastic is a bit brittle . It started cracking a bit after a couple of years . Considering I still use it now after 10 years , I guess it held up fine considering that . Just looks really bad . The lid died very shortly after purchasing though . Its also a bit cumbersome to put in the dishwasher because of its shape so at some point I just started handwashing it . Overall its the best measuring device I have used and owned , I just wished the plastic was a bit more strong and less brittle .
5 #### I bought this so I could read in bed and not disturb my husband . It provides fantastic light that 's easy on the eyes . I love it so much I bought 4 more for my kids for Christmas .
5 #### Just what I needed to replace a blown bulb . So far it is great --- only changed out the bulb 2 weeks ago . Price was great too .
5 #### Keep Catching Fleas when it is not otherwise evident that they are around .
5 #### I use these drives on a daily basis and all day long , up to a 12 hour shift . And I use them in a Makita brushless impact gun . So long story short , I break them on a regular basis and need to find replacements as cheaply as possible . These fit the bill . Since I go through about 3 a month , I find the cheapest replacements I can find . Thank god for Amazon . And it has nothing to do with the quality of the bit . I use them and use them very very hard . That 's why the short life span .
5 #### As always these bags are worth there high cost Keeps dust down , highly recommended .
4 #### I do n't think we can quote prices in reviews , but I got a good deal from amazon . I used these blades to cut vinyl siding . I had over 100 feet of siding that needed to be cut into bundles of 16 " for trash pick up . That means that I made 80 cuts with it , through a medium quality siding . It cut through like butter . Now , just a tip for plastic cutting . You need to play with the various speeds on the Fein tool . There is a " sweet spot " where it cuts like butter . It is fast enough to cut , but does not melt the material . It worked great for my purposes , ca n't comment on other materials .
5 #### Great for non - stick cookware . Sturdy stainless steel handle . Useful utensil .
5 #### Brought for son in law one Christmas and have not heard any complaints .
2 #### Too big and cumbersome to be useful . If design were downsized a couple of inches , they would be perfect . Much too big for my salad bowls .
5 #### Just what I was looking for to snip some small leaves on flower pot plants . Perfect size for the fine snipping sometimes needed !
5 #### Great deal on these . Took a little time to get after shipping but worth the wait .
4 #### I am a huge fan of electric , and more so of this mower that makes dealing with a cord even easier . Gas mowers require so much more maintenance , handling , and are smelly and noisy . This machine is LIGHT ( I 'm 5'2 " and 7 months pregnant and I have NO problems mowing my lawn ) . Overall , this machine handles grass well , and cuts nicely . The one - step height - cut adjustment is great , it turns on and off without problems , and the flip - handle works great to keep the cord out of the way . The mower does bog down some in wet grass 6 " or more , but I have yet to find a machine that does n't have some problems with wet grass . Complaints ? I 've only had mine a two months ( maybe 4 - 5 uses ? ) , and the grip already has a tear in it . I agree with the other reviews about the flaps , but I know they are a " Safety " feature . ( These are the reasons why I gave it 4 stars ) I am very impressed with this machine and would STRONGLY recommend it for anybody with an average size yard , does n't like the smell or noise of gas mowers , and wants something that stores well .
5 #### These bowls are an extraordinary value - I did a double - take when I saw the price . You 'd pay twice as much for another name brand bowl that does n't have all the features this one does . I own both the 2 - Quart and 4 - Quart bowls . I 'm wondering what I ever did without them , because I use one of them almost every day . I really like the fact that they 're so deep , which greatly reduces spilling and spattering . And of course the best feature is the rubberized bottom . You can use a hand mixer and you do n't even have to hold onto the bowl ! It does n't move around AT ALL ! I really love the spout too . The 4 - quart bowl has just become my new " making strawberry freezer jam " bowl and I was delighted to be able to pour the jam into the containers without the mess I 've dealt with for the past 20 years or so ! It 's also a great bowl to use for pancake batter - I use the smaller one for pancakes . Just pour the batter right onto the griddle . Because the bowls are deep , they do n't take up tons of room in the fridge . For storage , just cover it with one of those Saran Wrap " shower cap " like tops and you 're all set . As another reviewer mentioned , this is also the ideal bowl for popcorn or munchies . I think that every kitchen should definitely have both sizes of this wonderful bowl ! You 'll love them !
5 #### Love the sharp tines which easily poke into the meat . Nice long stainless steel sturdy handle for durability . This is exactly what I was looking for in a cooking fork .
5 #### These are great little cutting boards . It comes in a pack of four . They do not slip at all because they have a non - skid bottom . They stay put on the counter . I love how thin they are yet they are tough enough to protect your counters from knives . I have been slicing vegetables , fruits , and even chicken . I like to use a certain color for meats and a different color for veggies and fruits . In order to get them to close you do need to get the latch part directly in the middle of the ridges on the other end . Then it will stay together and you can put it in the microwave to sanitize . Just put it in for one minute . I like that it is also dishwasher safe . These are handy and convenient cutting board mats . Very easy to fold up and pour what you just cut up into the pan too . I bought this product with a discount and I am very pleased with these cutting boards .
5 #### This pot is PERFECT for making homemade pasta for a moderate to large sized crowd . The heavy base and large capacity means when you plunge in a plate of still - moist homemade spagetti , the water keeps boiling , or returns to a full boil within a minute or so . Ours has stayed beautiful in our active kitchen for over a year despite constant use and frequent washing . This is my favorite large kettle . I can think of NOTHING wrong with this pot . Update : 4/2005 ( a year later ) - This is STILL the perfect pot for cooking large batches of pasta and two - chicken soups . Update 5/2008 ( 4 years later ) - Still looks as good as new , and works just as well . We 've given them as gifts , and they are always appreciated ! Update 9/2016 ( 12 years later ) - Still looks shiny and new . Just finished doing 14 pounds of apple sauce . Not a bit of scorching or burning . Holds its heat and provides even cooking across the whole bottom , even on a gas " power burner " on our stove . Definitely one of my better purchases !
4 #### I love using the Sportman 's Grill . It gets hot fast and temperature control is easy with the damper and two - position grate . I keep mine seasoned with pam and keep the water out by covering it with an old cookie sheet while it cools down . This grill is definitely for hardcore charcoal users . I can see where less experienced grillers might not be able to get good results . If you need a thermometer to cook a steak , this is not your grill . If you cam measure temperature by how long you can hold your bare hand over the coals , this grill is for you . I only gave it four stars because I do n't find it very easy to clean out . All of the loose parts have to be removed ( grill , charcoal grate , damper door , and the front door ) to get all the ash out . Also , I find the carrying handle is nearly useless . The grill is unbalanced so that if you try to pick it up with all of the aformentioned parts attached , it tips over and all the parts end up on the ground . Be careful .
5 #### These work well and stay sharp a long time . I have hundreds of cuts before these get dull and need replacing .
1 #### The only thing in this that should be there is sugar . The rest is stuff you should n't be adding to your feathered friends diet . This stuff is also three times the price of baker 's sugar from any old grocery store , four times the price of regular granulated sugar that takes a little longer to dissolve . This is a bad buy , bad for the birds and bad for your pocket .
5 #### I have been ripping some Africian Mahogany recently and using the stock blade ( Freud OEM ) on my Ryobi BT3100 and a Home Depot purchased 40 tooth Freud combination blade and it was a chore . I actually felt it was a bit unsafe due to the poor performance so I went looking for a new ripping blade . After much searching and fretting I picked this blade . Today I put it on and all I can say is WOW . It felt like cutting butter and the cuts came out amazingly clean . I also ran some 3/4 " Birch through and it came out much cleaner than my stock and combi blades . Highly recommended for Ryobi BT3100 saws for ripping and even plywood .
5 #### Really nice whisker compared to the metal one we replaced ( it was covered in plastic that wore off with time ) . This one is great and seems very solid and easy to use and clean .
5 #### I have been using this tumbler for around six years now ( time flies ) , and it is still going strong . Only " wear " is a few dings in the metal , and the seals have become stained brownish . I even throw it in the dish washer occasionally , and it does n't seem to have negatively affected it . This tumbler is perfect because it closes completely , so you can throw it around your car or toss it in a bag and never have to worry about leaks . It also keeps your coffee ridiculously hot . Plus , the sipping hole is deep below the top rim , so even on a really bumpy road , no liquid is coming out when if the top is off . Only on super - tiny - insignificant complaint : the black plastic base has holes in it , which allows water to get inside when washing . It will continue to drip for a while afterward , because the water is trapped in the base and can only drip out . Not as bad as it sounds , just thoughts for a design improvement . Buy one !
1 #### can not program precisely , wish I 'd gotten a digital one . It 's mechanical , plastic , seems rather flimsy .
4 #### While spinning a whole head of lettuce , the top of the lid , near the brake , cracked . I 'd owned the spinner for 9 months . My last OXO spinner lasted 5 years before finally breaking ; pretty disappointing . But , I contacted OXO , and after a couple of emails , they sent me a replacement lid . At first , I thought they 'd sent me an entirely new spinner ; the box was huge and there was tons of packaging . However , it was only a replacement for the lid . The replacement lid looks exactly the same , so it 's durability remains suspect . I guess I 'll start spinning less lettuce and maybe use less force ? The spinner itself works great . Greens come out dry . It 's relatively easy to clean , though the clear plastic looks dingy after a few uses . I 'm impressed with OXO customer service . I appreciate that they sent me a replacement part . Hopefully I get at least a couple years more use out it .
1 #### I jumped the gun and bought this without reading the reviews because Amazon had it labeled as a " # 1 best seller " . It is made in China and is totally garbage . It is soooo flimsy and cheaply made I can not imagine this lasting more then a couple of uses . Had I known it was made in China I would have not bought it and from now on will not really on " # 1 best seller " by Amazon as a basis for buying anything .
3 #### If you move the countersink up the bit , it will be slightly offcenter / wobbly . I do n't need a 2.5 " hole for a 1.25 " # 8 screw , so I moved the countersink up the bit . If you move the countersink further up the bit , the bit will eventually snap ; that took me two days . Had the same issue with the Bosch countersink set as well ; odds are , you 're not supposed to move the countersink unless you 're moving it to another bit . That said , works as expected . Replaced the bit with a $ 2 Vermont American 11/64ths , instead of the tapered Dewalt $ 11 replacement . In any case , the # 6 , # 8 , and # 10 come bundled in a three - pack at Home Depot that 's cheaper than I could find anywhere online .
5 #### i 've never owned a peeler before this . only used my parents ' growing up . This must be a sign that you 're interested in cooking and eating better when you need a vegetable peeler ! ! i would recommend to everyone looking for a peeler . the grip is soft where you hold it between thumb and index finger . The hole on the grip is just big enough to hang this if you want .
2 #### It just does not perform as good as older heads . Too many places where water pools instead of being more finely broadcast .
5 #### I JUST USED THIS WHISK THIS MORNING AND I AM OVER THE MOON ! IT IS BEYOND WONDERFUL ! I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO DOUBT THAT I CAN WHISK HEAVY CREAM INTO WHIPPED CREAM WITHOUT HAVE TO USE A HAND MIXER ! WOOHOO ! YOU WILL LOVE THE WAY IT FEELS IN YOUR GRIP . THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR A GREAT PRODUCT ! SARAH ROSSI
5 #### Works great , easy set up , does n't sound like a 747 . It has lots of power . The extra pet attachment is great for upholstry even without a pet . I have all hardwood floors so ca n't tell you how it works on carpets . I think it would need a power nozzle to be most effective for carpeting . One really nice feature is the telescoping wand . It makes it just the right height for comfort and then can reach those high , cobweb corners . The swivel nozzle can really get very flat for getting under low furniture . I also think the hose is a bit on the flimsy side , so I 'm careful not to let it crimp . That 's my only con .
4 #### I use this to hold spices I do n't want to get stuck in my teeth . Works great ! Revision : The normal sized spice bottles have a narrow neck that you use , so if you place one of the small , fatter spice jars in this , it will NOT return back to normal size . So what size you put in each slot , is what you 're stuck with . It does n't bother me , because I have so many slices . But just a thought
2 #### Illumination is too weak , even using the LED bulb , which should have been included as the standard bulb . I have a $ 25 3 C Cell Duricell flashlight which provides both 500 and 250 lumens and is far superior . . . and costs less .
5 #### A very nice product that has come in handy on those hot days , suprisingly it does n't warm up as fast as i thought it would . i would without hesitation recommend this product to a friend . great product , fair price and quick delivery - what else can i ask for
3 #### The item does what it is advertised to do attract mosquitoes but the adhesive that holds the strip into the zapper does not work . I have to use packing tape to hold the strip in place . They need to use stronger adhesive .
5 #### I love this sprinkler ! I bought a couple to have one as a spare because it was hard to find . The water flow adjustment and the width lever really help conserve water . Excellent product .
5 #### This balloon whisk , purchased from Amazon , is what I needed for larger and more weighty ingredients . I already had a small and medium size which I use frequently but knew that because I have severe arthritis in my hands I would need an ergonomic handle . It 's very comfortable , does the job and I recommend it for those with or without arthritis .
1 #### hummers do n't like the flowers , buy one with flat flowers
1 #### Waste of money and d cell batteries . Product is absolute waste of time and MONEY . Amazon should include a consumer report on such crap . I would n't recomment this crap to anyone IT DOES NOT WORK ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Good . Bit too big for 1 person house hold though
5 #### Oversized , strong , all pieces work well , easy to clean , nice quality , and I expect the set will last quite awhile . Very easy on nonstick pans .
1 #### Waste of money will never order any more plastic fittings , going to stick to metal ductwork and ground everything good .
5 #### These gloves are pretty durable . Really comfy and bright . Definately great for a beginner who s new to gloving . They came with batteries and 20 diffusers which i was not expecting . Its worth the buy which is all i 'm really trying to say . The delivery was great . Got it halfway across the country in like 2 days and it was standard shipping . I also recieved a 10 % off coupon with the order . Just a great buy and i will buy again from this seller .
5 #### very pleased . They do the trick as designed . Amazon says i have to write 14 more words so this is my sentence to do so .
5 #### I absolutely LOVE this . I have my picture framed and hanging in my Living room . Great picture from a great artist .
5 #### Better price than home improvement stores on an item that I seem to use for various projects . Solid quality .
5 #### Purchased this fan for a bedroom . I purchased a Hunter because my other older fans are starting to make a lot of noise . This fan is quiet and also does not wobble even on high speed . The glass globes are thicker than most fan light globes . I am pleased with this purchase and will be buying more Hunter fans in the future . The free shipping is a BIG added plus .
5 #### You would not believe how well these work . You can not go wrong !
3 #### Sharp - sharp - sharp . The force required either broke the food or got jammed until I figured out a solution . Place the item on edge to acheive the narrowest profile to reduce cutting effort . Cut large items into smaller profiles as well . Do n't attempt to slice last remnant -- you ca n't get enough traction . Rather , hand slice or turn on edge and be careful - careful - careful . The bowl does n't accomodate the cuttings of large stiff items as it hits the rim before being completely cut . Reduce the length or use the left edge which allows a little more length .
2 #### When you turn it one direction vs the other , it does not agree with itself , which means it 's off by a bit .
5 #### Some people look at this splitting tool and ca n't get past the ' plastic ' handle . The key design feature of this maul is that all of the weight is focused at the ' point of operation ' - where the splitting edge meets the wood , and not in a traditional wood handle . This means that this surprisingly light weight tool can do some heavy duty splitting . The shape of the axe / maul head is also well designed , and covered with a non - stick coating to reduce sticking in the wood . I used a conventional axe , and a ' monster maul ' before this . The axe is used for chopping and limbing only now , and the monster maul went on Craig 's List after I used this for just a short period of time . No tool will do everything . I still use steel splitting wedges and a sledge hammer for really large sections of wood . And I chainsaw ( ' noodle ' ) ugly sections with lots of knots or crotches . But this tool easily handles all of the firewood I normally split . This includes a variety of hard and soft woods up to 16 inches in length , split down to stove sized wood . I also have several friends who split wood up to 24 inches with this for outdoor wood burners ( OWB ) . The longer handle on this tool is preferred by most users over the shorter length handle on some other Fiskars splitting axes mauls . And the ' plastic ' ( really an engineered composite ) handle is guaranteed against breakage !
5 #### This is an OEM replacement for your poulan 18 " chainsaw blade . It was the cheapest I was able to find on the web . It arrived in the mail quickly . I would purchase it again .
5 #### These have changed my life on cleaning the staircases ! would buy again for sure !
5 #### I 've used this for several months and I find it to be a great sturdy spoon that I expect will last a long time .
5 #### This is an inexpensive but tremendously useful accessory that makes a great saw even better . Installed easily and works well . Fits easily with the rear outfeed support as well .
3 #### It does n't fully peel the garlic , it just kind of loosens it . It does n't save your hand from smelling like garlic , you still have to peel it by hand , but the skin is much looser and easier to remove . Honestly I 've found that there are n't very many instances where I need a whole clove of garlic perfectly peeled and intact . I feel like smashing it is quicker and releases more aroma and flavor than keeping it whole .
4 #### Its a crowbar people . You crow stuff with it . lol It could also be used for self defense or stirring cake batter . I use it to gain entry to vehicles i , um , " misplaced " the keys to .
5 #### Great price for this package of light bulbs . We 're delivered quickly and in perfect condition !
5 #### I recommend this can opener to anyone who opens more than five cans a year . The first time I used this device I thought nothing had happened . It is so effortless I thought it had not worked . One time around and the top of the can is ready to be lifted off . There are NO SHARP EDGES & NO NEED TO DIG THE TOP OUT OF the sauce or what ever . In fact one of the best things about this can opener is that it does not touch the content of the can . No mess to create food deposits and stain plus no clean up of the mess . A worthy can opener ! Every time I see a product that that has been redesigned and works my hat goes off to the designer and manufacture . This is a small step in the advancement of cooking chores but for me it is leap from the old super market .25 cent kind .
5 #### Ok , now I ordered this on a whim . I wondered if it were really froth I did n't like or steamed milk . It 's steamed milk . This little thing froths up the half and half I use in my coffee like nobody 's business . I think if I let it whip much longer I 'd get whipped cream . I did what one person said , which is whip the half and half cold and then warm it up about 20 or so seconds in the micro and then pour it into my coffee - yum ! ! I was thinking it would probably be good for speciality coffees , you could blend the liquor with the cream and then pour it into the coffee . Anyhow , for frothing / blending this little gadget is GREAT - only thing I would do different is make the wand a little longer .
5 #### this is a awesome cd it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this cd are Tracks 2 . White America 3 . Business 4 . Cleanin out My Closet 5 . Square Dance 8 . Say Goodbye Hollywood 9 . Drips 10 . Without Me 13 . Superman 14 . Hailie 's Song 17 . Say What You Say 19 . My Dad 's Gone Crazy if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
2 #### The picture is a close close close up to an area where the bamboo was magically tighter than anywhere on mine . I got it to hide my A / C from my patio and it does do this ... it does look cheap , but it is likely more attractive than an A / C so Ill keep it . Others though will be really disappointed . My better half has described it as tacky .
3 #### I bought this to spray Miracle - Gro on my garden . I use the powder and try to pre - mix , since using straight powder in the cannister does n't work . It works * okay * , but nothing special- and the adjustment options seem to really only do one of two things : use all the nutrient near - instantly , or barely any at all after 10 minutes of use . Sadly this is n't much better than the crappy all plastic POS that Miracle - Gro ships with their product . To be fair , this is designed for liquid mix so I will try pre - made liquid plant food and see if it works any better .
5 #### I 've been looking for a really good vegetable brush for awhile now and hip hip hooray I 've found the perfect brush . It has sturdy bristles , not to big , does the best job and fit perfectly in my palm . I 've tried a number of vegetable brushes before only to throw them out because their bristle have gone limp on the job after a short usage . I 've purchased OXO brand items before and have been very happy with the items . I can now say with full confidence that the vegetable brush can be added to the list of very dependable products . It does an especially fine job on potatoes and lemons . I 'm so glad that I chose this particular vegetable brush .
4 #### It 's a Dremel item . Fine quality . Not much to report . If you need it , just buy it already .
5 #### So nice and you can see how much is left in the container and do not have to go outside till you see it to the bottom , such a nice bird feeder .
5 #### Excellent heater . Use it in my 5th wheel when it gets cold . Rated for indoor use , but still keep a vent or two open . Fan sucks the life out of batteries , but works just as well with out batteries in my mind .
5 #### LOVE HOW SHARP THIS IS . It is sharp and solid . buy it .
5 #### I used these to do an outdoor clear finish on 2 benches I built . Also used them to put on the green crinkle paint for the iron work . Never lose a hair & clean up perfectly .
5 #### This is a great heater . It keeps my 10x16 ' uninsulated camp cabin warm , even in sub - freezing temps . I bought the propane tank adapter hose with this , and they make a great combination . The heater starts easily and runs quietly . You can turn the heater elements off and keep the pilot light going , so all you have to do is turn the knob the restart it . When using the hose , you do have to push down the pilot knob a while to purge the regular air from the hose . Then you can turn it off and back on the start the pilot . This heater was packed well and easy to set up .
5 #### I received the templet guide kit today . The kit was in good order and I was able to put the guide kit to work immediately by using the 1/2 " guide with a 1/4 " up spiral bit on my Freud 2000e router and a shop built shelf support jig . All performed as expected to punch shelf support holes in my cabinet sides . I did take the experience of another reviewer and torqued down the adapter ring with a pair of pliers to insure a secure fit . Probably a good idea to check all fasteners on the adapter plate periodically . I was initially put off by some of the negative reviews for the template guide kit but decided to order . I am completely satisfied with this product .
4 #### Do n't let it soak in water for more than an hour or clean in the dishwasher , or else rust spots appear . After hand washing , it is fine to air dry . Rust or tarnish spots are easily fixed with Bar Keeper 's Friend !
5 #### I 've had this Xtra Flex 2 LED Book Light for two years now , and I absolutely love it ! I 'm able to attach it to a book or to my Kindle ( 1st generation ) . Pros ---- - VERY BRIGHT White Light - Two Brightness Settings ( 1 ) On the brighter setting , it uses both of its LED lights ; ( 2 ) on the dimmer setting , it uses only one . - Phenomenal Battery Life The book light requires 3 AAA batteries to operate . My book light provides 15 - 20 hours of light before the light STARTS to be noticeably dimmer . The book light can provide about 35 - 40 hours of usable light before I have to replace the batteries ( I use 1000 mAH AAA rechargeable batteries ) . - Flexible Gooseneck The gooseneck is very flexible . It can be easily bent or twisted so you can adjust the height and direction of the light . It comes in very handy for directing the light on the verso or recto as needed . - Compact and Lightweight With a book in hand , I hardly feel the weight of the book light when it is clipped to the book . - Rugged and Durable The book light is well - made and has a rugged casing . Cons --- None . I honestly ca n't think of any ! The Xtra Flex 2 LED Book Light is both attractive and functional . Plus , it is very affordable and reasonably priced . You really ca n't go wrong with this one !
5 #### There 's not a whole lot you can say about this item , it does what it says and there are n't any surprises . While I usually like to save my five star ratings for things I really love , I just do n't know what they could have done any different with this ... so , it gets my coveted five star rating . Price is pretty good too ... I 'll buy more if they 're still around .
5 #### This is my second zapper . The first was left in the rain and got fried . This one I hope to take better care of .
1 #### it does not cut bread like other bread knives I have had .... it is not sharp
5 #### Sharpest peeler I 've ever owned . Speeds through a potato in seconds . The built in " eye remover " , while interesting is not as useful as a paring knife at removing eyes from a potato , but is an interesting concept . As with most Oxo products , this peeler comes with a sturdy feel and a great grip , preventing what could be messy or painful slips . Would recommend this highly to the amateur home cook
5 #### I am the author of a series of cookbooks and have used this OXO spinner -- after using many others -- for about three years . It gets daily use and has never failed us . It 's easy to clean and store and it really gets the moisture off the lettuce and other vegetables like beans , carrots and so on . I highly recommend this product for anyone who 's serious about making great salads .
5 #### I 've had two of these now ( packed one away and ca n't find it ) . It is the best pruning saw I 've seen -- very sharp and easy to use . I 've pruned fruit trees and ornamentals and it cuts fast and clean on each .
4 #### This is really no different than any other high grade or useful peeler . With that being said the one major difference is that this PEELER WORKS WELL ON IRREGULAR vegetables . What I mean is that those hard to peel curvy sweet potatoes . This peeler carves them up easily . Also I used it on a Jicama where other peelers have failed and this one did its bes to peel through . In the end it did the job .
5 #### This Porter Cable upholstery stapler is as comfortable to use , as it is to buy ; great price point . I did buy it with the intention of using it for attaching fabric to seat bottoms , and I have some early French provincial furniture that will need reupholstering . What I found was that it is usable for a lot of other things as well . I make cabinetry . In order to transport the finish pieces , I use the single sided corrugated cardboard , which is inexpensive to wrap it . These staples work great to attach the cardboard to the back seam of the cabinet . This stapler will take up to 5/8 " staples . I did n't find them here at Amazon so I bought up to the 1/2 " size . They are wider than the narrow crown staples . The stapler fires well without any misfires since I have been using it . It does n't have a safety plunge mechanism , as do the finish nailers . That enables you to get into tight corners whereas the tip is a lot smaller . The only downside is that it does not come with a case , and I did not find staples for it available locally . All in all it is a very nice tool . Highly recommended .
5 #### My daughter had one of these and it put my old parer to shame . I had to get one for myself . I ca n't wait to attack an eggplant !
5 #### I have two of these feeders and yes ... they are n't the easiest to clean ... but so far this is by far my favorite feeder , and I 've tried many . The hummingbirds love it , and with an ant guard on top it stays very clean . I bought a tiny bottle brush and bent it in a 90 degree angle , and it works just fine on cleaning the bottle 's tough - to - get - at shape . I too have used the saucer shaped feeders , and while the hummingbirds loved it , so did the squirrels . During the really hot , drought months , I would see squirrels hanging off the thing , emptying it of all the nectar . Who knew squirrels would drink that stuff ... but they do . They also broke the perch off in several places on the saucer model . So far , they have left this one alone .
5 #### This is commercial grade high quality butchers twine . The thickness prevents it from cutting into fish tissue as well as meats . A plus in the kitchen .
5 #### This is the only way to purchase toilet tank flapper . Get all your toilet tank flappers replaced at the same time , so you do n't have to return to purchase another for a few years . Excellent product , excellent product .
5 #### This really gets the job done . But , I would n't suggest putting it near the house or outdoor areas close to entrances . This will kill all the flies around for sure , but the smell will also attract more flies from far or further away so be prepared .
2 #### It is VERY HARD to set up ! ! ! Need a lot of muscle work . It was IMPOSSIBLE for me ! ! ! The seller should have made a note about it . Wanted to return but did n't want to pay the shipping fee . Not recommended for woman .
5 #### Tupperware makes great ice cube trays . They are made of durable plastic , like all Tupperware products . I have n't found the fill hole useful . I either overfill or underfill the trays , and it 's hard to get water into all of the slots . I fill the tray with the lid off , just like filling any ice cube tray , then put the lid on . The lid will be difficult to get on the first few times , but with a little use , it limbers up and works great ! The Tupperware covered ice trays keep my ice cubes tasting like ice cubes . I have ordered another set , as spring and summer are just around the corner ! Have n't tried it , but I think they would work great to freeze tea , lemonade , milk , etc . The only negative comments I can leave you with is the steep price , ... and that the fill hole is n't very useful .
5 #### I just started using it and ordered another one today . I am a garden person with many flowers all over the place . Nozzles are important to me . This one is by far the best I 've ever used . Reaches far and many patterns that I can choose . Nothing better .
2 #### It has not much magnets . So I decided to print out myself cliparts and get magnets and just glue them .
4 #### I still have a bit of difficulty pushing out the apple core , but maybe it 's just me , with having small hands ( you 'd think that would help ) but maybe I 'm just not " super strong " or something ... that said , it works , does the job well ... This review left by Alan 's wife , Susan , chief apple corer .
4 #### I love these little BBQ 's and I just replaced my old one after 15 years of faithful service . The thing I really hate about these is the igniter , which is practically worthless . The one on my old one lasted about 2 months before it refused to work anymore and I removed it and used matches or lighters . This one that came with the new one refuses to work right out of the box . I called Weber to complain and they 're sending a new one but I doubt if it will be any better . Like I said , I received 15 years of faithful , hard use out of my old one but come on Weber , make a better igniter ! I ca n't believe they have n't improved it after all these years .
5 #### A bigger whisk for bigger jobs . I use the 9 inch whisk more but have used this one for larger preparations of food and its a jewel as is the 9 inch whisk . So happy to have gotten both !
5 #### Very , very pleased customer . Like the short handles , 6 cups / set AND shaped for scooping . LOVE IT!9
3 #### We use these in an older Eureka vacuum in our garage for vacuuming our cars . They do leak a little but it is n't an issue when using them outside . Would not use them in a vacuum to be used indoors .
5 #### There is no substitue for the best , Greenlee is ok , Klein is the best .
5 #### No more leaks and drips . Easy to install and makes a great difference in using the sprayer . Quality parts .
4 #### I read some of the other reviews and only time will tell . However , for now the unit is performing perfectly I appreciate that the jets provide a uniform flow of water and are removable for cleaning . Thanks to others , I 'll keep the guarantee close at hand .
1 #### < div id="video - block - R2FEF7UJJB0AGY " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / D1H48yvxrnS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/91METmpznzS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;Very disappointing . I have had great success with the Victor mouse traps , but their rat trap only stunned and did not kill the rat it caught . I used a piece of meat for bait and had to tie it to the trigger to keep the rats from taking the bait .
5 #### Any of the Roudybush products are worth trying . They 're all great .
5 #### Fiskars makes very fine products . Fiskars 9921 Micro - Tip Snips are very sharp , smooth working and small . Perfect for trimming garden flowers and herbs . My wife loves it for deadheading her marigolds and zennias . I use it for snipping okra , squash , peppers and eggplant . Ca n't beat these micro snips , and you ca n't beat Amazon for great prices .
5 #### Does n't kink , so far . Well made . Good price . Only after its used for a year will we know how we like it . Easy to take on and off . Would buy again .
5 #### These are so cool , they were stolen out from under our trash can the third week we used them . Reordering because I really need them to push the can to the curb for collection day . Nice twist and lock action , study well made dolly .
5 #### Great strong bamboo , I used it as fence states . Worked great ! Fast shipping !
2 #### I think these will work just fine , but I gave it two stars because the side that showed in the packaging is nice and shiny , but the other side is rusted . I returning it for a replacement , so hopefully the replacement wo n't be rusted on one side .
5 #### America 's Test Kitchen / Cook 's Illustrated rated this the best Bundt Pan and I have to agree . Even cooking throughout and after buttering and flouring the surface , the cake slips right out . I 'm not even sure if I need to butter / flour for it to slip out ! Great heavy pan , not flimsy and uneven .
5 #### These work great and I do n't find the stench unbearable . The water evaporates pretty quickly ( about 3 weeks ) in the very hot sun and it 's then easy to throw in the trash . Reading reviews , I thought I would have to use a hazmat suit but it simply was n't true for me . I use in barn to keep flies off my horse . The key is to put a new one out before the old one dries out . When old one dries out , throw it in trash .
2 #### Very well built and sturdy but so far , after a month of trying , no moles . Located in Florida the soil is extremely sandy and loose so when we try to retain any semblance of a tunnel it 's just a pile of sand . Not sure if there 's any secrets to using these in sandy soil but we have stepped down tracks , found rebuilt and pushed part down and had it get pushed back up . Then we have set the traps , waited and waited , and do n't get a thing .... except more mole damage all around . You disturb the track at all and it all just collapses down . Any hints would be GREATLY appreciated . If we could eliminate some of our moles , or even figure out how to get just ONE , then we 'd be pushing the star rating waaaay up .
1 #### waited all summer for this to improve my water .. Had no effect . Finally gave up and took the plunge to a UV light .
5 #### Had a Presto Pressure Cooker years ago . It wore out and I could n't find any in my area . Then I found another brand and used it till it wore out . Went online and ordered a Presto Pressure cooker and love it . Thanks for the quick delivery .
5 #### Great quality item , perfect for daily use . I recommend it strongly .
5 #### It 's surprisingly hard to find a flat , sturdy nylon slotted spatula for nonstick pans . This one 's perfect !
4 #### I have had mine for 3 years now and love it . The assembly is minimal and the seasoning prcedure makes all the parts stay in great shape . I do a fair amount of smoking of meats ( weekly ) and it has been performing well . I have not modified it and manage the internal heat by using the right amount of charcoal and monitoring the unit every 20 - 30 minutes . Having worked with experienced Pit Masters , they all say the same thing . You have to pay attention to your fire , lift the lid as little as possible , monitor the temp , add more as needed . The only downside , true for all the water - smokers ( hence 4 instead of 5 ) is adding can be challenging but not impossible . Patience is required . Would I buy it again , yes . Most of my smoking is done between 200 - 225F , and it does from ribs and whole turkeys very well . Even smoked a meatloaf ! MMMMMMMMMM
3 #### Bought this item cheaper looking then the original one that came with pool . Fits a standard 10 ft pool . String part ripped plastic on sides not a quality product .
3 #### Really did n't except Starrett quality for $ 10 , but it is dead - on square . Mine did not have the black ruler as pictured ( that I wanted ) but can live with that . It is what it is .
5 #### One of my favorite tools . This has the best fit and durability of any professional electrical grade screwdrivers that I have used and I bust my knuckles less with it . Which is why I keep buying ithese . I have been an electrician for 40 years and I use these every day up to 600 volts .
5 #### Superior ergonomics and perfectly tempered steel . I 've been using these for 20 + years . I prefer the wood handles to the durasoft models . The wood is easier to clean . These are not the typical throwaway trowels most people buy . You 'll get many years of service from these
5 #### After using this item for months I am 100 % happy with it . As long as you treat the gasket with respect , like with any pressure cooker , the unit operates perfectly . It is amazing the cooking time these pots can do a job . I especially like The Rikon , its a very solid item , think stainless steel with good polishing . The cook book said to use the pot for browning before pressure cooking . This concerned me , worried the pot would warp or something , but it did a great job . Now use it for just browning at times . It heats up instantly and responds quickly to the stove tops heat settings . A great cooker .
5 #### One of my favorite outdoor things I own . Probably because I hate bug and this kills them all night long . My wife thought I was so country on the first night because I was simply sitting outside and listening to the symphony of snap , crackle , and pop . Within a week she was inviting me outside to come listen . I consider us normal folks but something about death being announced by the crack of a insect electrocution is soothing .
5 #### I purchased this to sow small seed , had n't used it yet , going to use it this fall to sow my turnips in rows . looks like it will work fine .
5 #### SUPERB ! Kept spouse busy assembling it , and fits the saw perfectly . Now the saw can be moved more easily !
3 #### Contrary to the other review , this product does work for me . I use it to spray areas on my patio that I do n't want my cat bring his kills to . My cat hates the smell and avoids the area ( and me if it gets on my hand ) . BUT , it wears off quickly , so it has to be reapplied every few days ( until the cat is trained ) . The rating is due to this fact .
5 #### Had to finally replace a 20 year + model that someone dropped . Was a little concerned by reviews as the quality seemed to have changed . When item arrived , I could see at once that it did not seem as sturdy as my old Stir Crazy . One of the reviewers said to heat the oil first with only a couple of kernels in the pot . When they popped , add the full amount of popcorn . That was brilliant ! Worked so well . Never had such results before . It may not look so sturdy , but it works so well . We 'll see if it lasts over 20 years . Still makes the best popcorn ever .
5 #### This stuff works good ! Diluted it with EVOO and applied as a lotion whenever I felt itchies ... idk what we dealt with , invisible mites maybe but we are still going through it . This is not a only cure ! U HAVE to do alot more other things to get rid of whatever this is but this is the best permethrim thus far .. the other ones in the feed store smell like you are applying gasoline ! This has a more woodsy scent kind of like cedarwood . UPDATE : DO NOT APPLY this ... I remember applying this a few times but I did n't use it for long and the ingredients can be really toxic to some . Ivermectin is the way to go !
5 #### Soooo much better than using a razor blade as a saw , which was better than using tin snips , which was better than using normal wire cutters .
5 #### Easy to use & easy to clean . Very well made & I love the color !
5 #### This trap is indestructible being made of zinc - plated steel and is of very high quality . I have caught mice with it but for some reason not as frequently with other types of live traps . This can catch several mice at one time but still needs to be checked at least daily or more frequently .
5 #### The birds will clean out your feeder in a few hours ! They love it !
5 #### I have had one of these before - which I got at a State Fair and used for many years . I made a mistake of taking it off my hose and leaving it on my back porch a couple of months ago , which is an area that has a lot of dog toys scattered about . One of my dogs apparently thought it must be a new dog toy with all the wonderful thick rubber around it . They are normally very good about not bothering anything that is not " theirs . " It still worked - sort of - I could not turn the spray adjustments very well . I finally realized I got over 20 years of use without any problems before it became an inadvertent dog toy ( I have dogs with powerful jaws ) . I would highly recommend it to anyone . It will last a lifetime , I 'm sure ( unless your dog gets it - then no guarantees ) .
5 #### This tea tumbler is a constant companion and now I have three . I do n't use the included tea infuser as I make my tea at home then pour it in the pre - heated thermos , which fits well in any bag when I go out . Does n't leak , easy to drink from . I 've had many thermos tumblers and this is by far the best .
5 #### Perfect for the Bible we used them on . Took us a while to get them all put on , but we 're perfectionists . But they help out so much when we 're searching for a book and they look great .
4 #### It seems to work fine . Was able to cut through a 8 in diameter basketball hoop pole with it with ease .
4 #### We used a couple of these for outdoor gatherings as trash cans . The 30 gal liners fit a bit tight so just upsize . I staked them down and they stayed firmly in place . The material seems pretty thick and puncture resistant . This bag can be used for a variety of situations : storage , camping , trash , laundry , etc I also like the customer support from Fiskars as they stand behind their products .
5 #### I had another brand and it was very clumsy and so hard to use .... the OXO spinner works effortlessly , and I love it .
4 #### Did the job . My only complaint is that the plastic was yellowed , which really came to my attention when , after installing it , the cleaning lady said she tried to clean it - she thought it was old ! !
5 #### I bought this for my wife for her&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Kindle / dp / B002FQJT3Q / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Kindle</a > . She had a reading light before , but it only adjusted up and down , not side to side . Her other light finally drove me crazy , because the tension screws pooped out and the head of the light kept collapsing into the screen of her Kindle . I was worried that it was going to break the Kindle 's screen -- plus it kept waking me up . She 's thrilled with this new light . She can adjust it in any direction : up / down or side to side . This is especially nice for the Kindle , because it eliminates the glare on the screen . Her one requirement was that the light work from batteries or AC power . That 's the really nice thing about this book light . The AC power adapter is n't too big , so it 's simple for her to plug it into the wall beside the bed . She can also use it for travel without the AC power . Excellent reading light !
3 #### What s to say ? it came on time , it fits my vac , its a back up filter for when the original get clogged
4 #### This item was a recommended " ... people also buy ... " when buying the Delta 50 - 359 12 - inch Planer Connect . They do not connect together . Each have the same OD & ID . Searched everywhere for an adapter or PVC pipe with the right dimensions ; no luck . Used Gorilla Tape . Works great .
5 #### Have split a fair number of logs with this ax now and am pleased with its performance . To split larger logs , you need to work around the outside , removing splits to get the diameter down small enough to split through the middle , but it works well ... am splitting stringy green to aged on the stump ( dead tree ) red oak . I did not buy the custom sharpener and have been able to use a standard knife sharpener to retouch the cutting edge . Keep it sharp . Take care not to get it into the ground where you will dull the cutting edge . I found many useful videos on U - tube about how to use this particular axe and they were very helpful .
4 #### I like this Quick Up very much . My only complaint is that it does n't hold a charge long enough to vacuum all my floors . I have back problems and I have found that using one of these small vacs is much easier on my back . It is light weight and does a good job cleaning , especially dog hair .
5 #### I never thought I 'd buy a push mower due to my bad back . I have a townhouse so do n't have a big yard , but its a decent size for a townhouse . I had a gas mower for many years and it finally gave out so I decided to get a push mower instead mainly b / c I was tired of having to go fill up a gas jug every few weeks , plus for the size of my yard , a gas mower is a tad overkill . Anyway , assembly was quite easy . Took me about 15 minutes or so working at a leisurely pace . Very simple installation . For the most part , you just have to assemble the handle assembly , attach it to the actual blade / mower part , and voila , done . I was pleasantly surprised at the fact its light weight . Looking at it , it seems like it would be much , much heavier , but its quite easy to pick up . The actual mowing is really easy . It cuts very well . Much faster than using a gas mower for my situation since I do n't have to worry about filling up the gas tank . I highly recommend this mower . Its actually fun to use too .
3 #### Not as much travel as i 'd like in the adjuster . It 's fairly loosey goosey when it 's not tightened down , which makes precision adjustments difficult , but do - able with a little finagling . For the price , it seems like they could have made it much nicer for very little extra money or effort . The dust collector comes off easily . Overall , it 's needed for a lot of work i do and does it well enough .
1 #### Looks , to me , as though all the positive reviews are based upon those reviewer 's accepting that the results are accurate , without verifying it . My verification process found this kit significantly lacking . I collected enough soil sample ( 2 cups for each ) to meet the requirements of this test plus enough to submit to a large State agricultural university in this region of the Country . Nurserys in this highly populated region send their samples to this university for analysis . These two cups were well mixed and were filtered carefully to remove organic material and other non - soil materials . I decided to test my soil , in the the first place , because the grass has been struggling for a few years . The university results showed that the pH was a full point ( that 's big ) lower than the results from this test kit and the other tests were similarly different . This test kit indicates that my lawn is fine and can be left as is . The university says , through their results and recommendations , that I better get this lawn some emergency care !
3 #### could not tell that they worked , but hey ( or should I say straw ) for the $ $ no regret in giving them a try .
5 #### Looked at several short ladders and most were cheaper but much heavier . As I have aged , I have come to appreciate " light " as important in anything that has to be moved . This ladder is a featherweight yet without a doubt is built better than any ladder this size that I have looked at locally ( the same one available on Amazon ) . I am at the weight limit of the ladder and it is very stable and sturdy . A short ladder for the home should tuck away somewhere . The one folds very thin . Add the lightness and you have an easy to use helper .
5 #### i had trouble hooking up the 10 guage wire . main thing is that it works and paid for itself in 2 months . i live alone , so i have mine come on in the morning at 730 for 1 hour and at 730 in the evening for 1 hour . i 've never been without hot water at any time . my 57 gallon water heater used to come on 5 or six times a day , even when i had not used any since the last time it came on . i do n't do laundry every day or dishes twice a day . it appears as if my hot water heater was responsible for 30 percent of my electric bill . my bill last month was 40 bucks . i do n't have electric heat , but , my pellet stove runs 24/7 during the winter months . purchased november 2012 . UPDATE ! AFTER LESS THAN A YEAR IT BECAME NOISY . STILL WORKS THE SAME BUT YOU CAN HEAR IT , KIND OF ANNOYING AT TIMES .
5 #### You 're not going to believe this , but ...... I bought this blade in 2004 on sale to replace the OEM blade that came on my Table Saw . This blade made perfectly smooth cuts on Oak , Cherry and Cedar without so much as a tooth mark : cross cut or rip cut . After about 2 years of casual use , it started to leave a fuzzy edge so I bought the WWII to replace it . I was not impressed- the WW blade left very subtle tooth marks ( on the same saw and set up mind you ) that were visible when holding the cut towards a light . Not drastic , but subtle . The WW required much more feed pressure and vibrated pretty bad when cutting . I cleaned the pitch off the Freud with a brass brush and blade cleaner , and it was back to normal . Freud blade cut with less vibration and less feed pressure than the WWII . While I was not impressed with the $ 100bWWII , I can recommend this LU82M010 blade all day long . It is very impressive for a $ 30 blade . This is a Triple Chip blade according to the Freud catalog . I also notice that the picture of this blade does not show the laser cut anti - vibration slots my blade has ( the long s - shaped cuts ) .
5 #### I have found the C33H-6 - 4R Starrett Combi Square to be a marvel of machining . The 90 & 45 degree angles checked out accurately . The finnish on the head was flawless . The slide mechanism was silk smooth - no jamming or rough spots . The satin chrome finnish on the blade eliminates glare and makes the blackened numbers and lines easy to read under all lighting conditions . The built in level was accurate and although I do n't use the scribe for my work it fits snuggly in its holder . No fear of losing it . I highly recommend this premium square .
1 #### Very disappointed it is tissue paper thin , you could go to lowes and buy a paint tarp for $ 6.00 and done as well .
4 #### It does kill bugs but I 'm not real sure about mosquitoes still trying it out .
1 #### I should have looked at photo closer . This in inches and I need tenths . It does hang out far before snapping . I bought it because when measuring patches along a highway and a semi goes by my old tape would snap . This one does the same thing . Retraction coil is horrible . I have to feed it in by hand until the last few feet when it finally takes over . Not worth returning .
5 #### great salad spinner , use it religously , easy to use , easy cleanup
5 #### Works great . I have wanted one for some time , but just could n't part with the money ... I wish I had done this alone time ago ...
5 #### This is a great blade ! Amazing smooth cuts in hardwood . I / m using it on my Makita 10 " compund sliding miter saw .
5 #### Would not hesitate to buy these first if the price is right . Pecan is tough to beat for a good smoke .
5 #### This thing is bulilt to last . I love this nozzle , it is very durable and works great . I did not have a leak for over a year now .
5 #### This sprinkler is exactly as stated - a long , flat , flexible hose that can either drip or spray . Nuthin' fancy , super functional , and easy to use . It 's flexible so I can target the water in any direction . I have several of these sprinkler hoses for my large yard ( 1/2 acre + of garden . ) Living in Seattle it only needs watering a couple months of the year . If we had a longer watering season it might make sense to install an official system . But with our rain these hoses are perfect for watering my beds . Of course this year we had no rain whatsoever for nearly two months . Having these sprinkler hoses was a life saver .
5 #### Been using these for 20 - 30 years ... I never broke one ... I just misplace them for awhile .. then one day they will all turn up again until I misplace them again . So cheap I just keep buying spares .
4 #### Fast shipping , priced right and highest quality hose . Serves as a buffer hose for a dripping water system and is exposed to the Florida sun . My last hose did n't last more than seven months . This one appears to be much more rugged .
5 #### Fantastic fork . Picked up a 10 pound ham without any indication might bend . Very sharp . Handle has some squish to it so you get a good grip . Very happy with my purchase . Did n't find any in store half as nice .
5 #### Great organic nutrient solution , looks like chocolate milk , plants love it during flowering ! ! ! Great price and came in the mail on time ! !
5 #### I have these on all my water hoses in the yard so I do n't have to go back to the faucet to shut off the water when I want to change hose heads . These a very good quality brass connectors too .
5 #### These shears are very light and sturdy and they cut well . Considering they are one of the cheaper choices out there , they are really a great deal . The little hole near the point for hanging on a hook is a nice design afterthought .
5 #### The Stir Crazy popper does a great job when it comes to popping most of the kernels of corn in a batch . I have always loved popcorn and am enjoying using this after years of microwave popcorn . I have been using coconut oil and different premium popcorn kernels and flavoring with different seasonings . The unit has been easy to clean and you can place the electric side of the unit inside the clear cover / bowl for storage . The cover / bowl is not very thick and I am concerned it would break or crack easily ... I might be wrong . But just in case I do not use the cover for serving . So far it has done the job and does not have a scratch on it . I would buy this item again and would recommend it to a friend .
5 #### Everything you could ever ask for in a salad spinner . Plain and simple . Way better than the last 2 I owned .
5 #### Not much to say other then it suits my needs . Price is good .
5 #### I use this regularly to dry lettuce before storing . Although it holds a lot , I recommend doing small batches and sometimes turning the lettuce and spinning again to thoroughly dry . It is a breeze to use and pretty amazing how much water it will spin off .
5 #### If you want a hammer forever this is the one . I needed a smaller version of the 16 oz that I bought back in 1966 for the electrical work I do to carry in my small pouch . Estwing cost a lot more than the wooden handle ones but you buy it for LIFE .
5 #### Nice but could you sell it in any smaller of a container ? This thing is literally an inch wide . What is this , a cloning gel for ants ?
5 #### concept is great . Mine has lasted six years so far . I love it .
5 #### Absolute bug killing machine . I have this set up on a timer at night and it draws in bugs you never knew you had flying around . It literally cooks them with the amount of current . The big ones really sizzle and smoke . Ten thumbs up .
1 #### I did n't realize how small a 4 quart pan is & there is n't room enough in this size to cook a roast , which is what I wanted to do with it . I sent it back .
5 #### This is a wonderful tool for the garden . It eliminates bending for those who have arthritis .
1 #### These items are useless . They are literally paper thin and utterly useless . I can not imaging any situation where this item would be useful . Place a planter on this " Saucer " and it will likely crack / split as mine did . Got this as an add - on item at a cost of $ 3.08 . It would not have been worth the $ .08 . Complete waste of time and money . And in addition , ordered 3 of these , each shipped individually in a huge box . WHAT A WASTE AMAZON . 1 star only since you ca n't go any lower .
5 #### Hencklels are the best knives . I pride myself on the sharpness and the quality of my kitchen ( and pocket ) knives , and Henckels can not be beaten by anyone . They also sell a knife sharpener that has 2 settings , a courser one and a finer one . All you have to do is drag the blade through it , no pressure on the knife , and it will make old knives new , sharp enough to shave the hair off your arm . This 6 " chefs knife is the best for everything , and I do a LOT of cooking and cutting , I know my knives . Out of 5 stars , I give this one a 10 . Thank you , Cindy
5 #### Cordless , inexpensive and easy to use and the floor is actually clean after my daughter is done doing her chores .
5 #### This lawnmower is perfect for our needs ! I really enjoy using it and teaching my boys to use it .
5 #### I 'm not a tool expert , but I do use this saw quite a bit . It is powerful , flexible , accurate and easy to use . I also use the DeWalt DW730 Heavy Duty Miter Saw Workstation , which I would consider an essential accessory unless you plan to permanently mount this saw .
5 #### Not much to say here . Bowl is well made , better than the cheap set I got in college at a big box store and still have 30 years later . This bowl is big enough to make double cookie recipes and pancakes for 8 when we have guest .
5 #### This Norpro Grip - EZ Granny Fork is a very handy kitchen tool to have . My only idea of a " Granny Fork " was a small 3 pronged cooking fork with a wooden handle but this is NOT one of those . I had never heard of the old " Foley Fork " that this item replaces until recently when I had seen Mz . Julia using the old " Foley Fork " on some of her Cooking DVDs- so I decided to find one and give it a try . The Foley 's are no longer made and this is the closest one can come to one now - a - days . This Norpro is very sturdy and well made . The long stainless steel handle and body are solid and the E - Z grip handle is comfortable in the hand . The fork is designed with uneven tongs,(so do n't think it 's defective upon arrival ) which are perfect for mixing and flaking items such as Tuna or Salmon and for the initial stages of pastry dough . It works very well for shredding cooked beef or pork for hot sandwiches too . I am very happy with this unique mixing tool ! It is one handy gadget that is swiftly becoming one of my favorite kitchen tools . Until I got it , I had no idea I needed it !
5 #### These are the real deal , solid metal . They fit great on the black pipes from Menards .
5 #### I needed a ladder to get in my attic crawlspace . This does a perfect job . Very easy to use and light to carry all over the house . Also used it to hang lights outside , was very stable . Amazon did n't package it very well by just throwing a trash bag around the feet . I guess this is why FedEx did n't want to just leave it sit outside ... So be prepared if you order it .
4 #### This little dynamo meets all my vacuuming needs . I am pleased with it . It has good power and its small size makes it easy to move around . The cord is extra long too , which allows me to change outlets less frequently . The wand is just a little awkward sometimes but the expanding length is great . I purchased the deluxe floor brush separately since most of my floors are hardwood . Good purchase .
2 #### Not happy with it , hose is way too stiff and it keeps coming apart . The suction is good however . Had one years ago and it was much better . Gave it away .
5 #### The idea of the Lightwedge itself , a sheet of high grade acrylic that spreads the light from small LCD lights across the entire page of the book is clever enough . It is clear and bright enough to read comfortably by without distracting a bedmate or a seatmate . Add to this a Harry Potter theme with interchangeable snap - on Potter emblems that allow a custom touch , and you have a great gift for that Potter fan in your life . If that Potter fan is the right age you might even lead to the extinction of trying to read by flash light under the covers .
5 #### I ca n't count the times I 've had to take time to scrounge up some rags and try to tie them or tape them to the end of my extension ladder , not to mention that time when nothing else was available and I had to put my socks on the ladder ends to keep from damaging someone 's wall paint . Now my ladder ends are better cushioned than before and I know the covers wo n't slip off or wear through as can happen with rags . My ladders ride on a roof rack on top of my van where they pick up whatever dirt and dust comes their way , so I keep a pair of these ladder covers inside my van and slip them onto the ladder when needed . That way I always know that they will be clean .
5 #### Needed this to finish our summer out ! Could n't find anywhere in our town ! So of course we look on Amazon , and there it is ! Just what we needed !
5 #### I 'm preparing to do a lot of holiday baking , and I do n't like washing my utensils after I 've gotten into a groove . Purchased some of these to have on hand . I really like the fun colors . They are good quality and will brighten up my kitchen , making holiday baking that much more fun .
3 #### I liked the idea , but it cracked soon after I started using it . Still usable , but not very durable if it is in the line of fire ( so to speak ) .
5 #### I needed this to hang a light I made . It was the perfect size , well made and would hold much more weight than what I needed it for . Easy to mount with the two screws it came with . Good buy .
5 #### Nice and bright , stays where you put it . The gooseneck is just right , it is about 7 " long . I would describe the light emitted as white or blue , not in the warm range .
5 #### The product was shipped promptly and arrived in only 2 days ! The crown stops work GREAT and allowed me to complete the cuts for installing crown moulding quickly and accurately . The brackets were square as shipped , and performed exactly as advertised . Two thumbs up !
2 #### not easy to use and very poor for trim edge
4 #### It 's a 15 ' hose . This is the second one I have bought . First was a gray neverkink , second was a standard green . Ends are not high end , but neither was the price . If you need a short hose , this is the way to go vs getting a 25 ' one , as you can buy a few if needed to get what you want .
5 #### It'sturdy , the handle is comfortable and it holds a lot of soil or mulch . It made my gardening much easier .
1 #### Great concept , poor execution ... this rack was so sloppy where it fit into the hitch receiver . Would have been great if it did n't have sooooo much play in it ! ! Would have been overly concerned with using for any sort of distance ...
4 #### This pressure cooker replaced a Presto that I liked but its loose handle and rusted screws made keeping it impossible . I am still getting used to this pot . I use it on an electric ceramic top stove . It takes a little fiddling until I can stabilize the temperature / pressure even using two burners , switching from the hottest to a cooler one . I think with a little more experience I will get the right technique . The long handle on the pot arrived loose and I was able to tighten it with a screwdriver . I do n't mind having to tighten it occasionally but if the screws rust in place like with the Presto , I will not be happy . The screws do n't look like stainless so I am concerned . This 7.5 qt pot is deep . I use a stainless covered bowl inside the pot and I have to use an aluminum foil strap to place the bowl in the pot and take it out when finished . However the depth might allow me to cook two bowls at once . This is a quality pot but only time will tell if the apparent quality is worth the price . The Presto cost 1/4 the amount and cooked equally . Hopefully the Kuhn Rikon will be more durable .
5 #### I gave this to my wife as a stocking stuffer this Xmas . ( She loves any accessory that 's colored pink . ) She says it 's extremely helpful to have a flashlight on her keyring to find items in her purse , or to light her keys at night . Even though this one is ' old school ' incandescent bulb technology , it 's still made by Maglite , and a sturdy , well designed , high quality product throughout . For a just a five dollar bill , it 's a bargain . I still use a twenty year - old 2 AA cell ' Mini Maglite ' flashlight when I hike or backpack . They 're reliable , and built to last !
5 #### I have had an OXO garlic press for at least 15 years , and I love it . This one I bought as a gift for a family member .
5 #### I have a lot of aquatic plants outside and was worried about the pots becoming a mosquito breeding ground . I sprinkled this in the pots and have n't seen any little squirmies . The bits are the best way for me too go as I did n't need a whole " dunk " for each pot and that would end up being expensive . I also sprinkled these bits in an area where I found some water had leaked leaving a temporary swamp . No skeeters there either .
4 #### itsto small only 2 ft see how itb does when tomatoes get bigger but I did get a good deal 54.00 $ not so bad light bulb included grow light
5 #### Great for many things , but indoor and outdoor gardening is my main use and I give it top stars for what it has done in the time I have had it .
5 #### Saved my self $ 100 with the mole guy and just bought a couple of these to catch moles .
4 #### While I have n't used it a lot yet , this hose seems well made , and is fairly kink resistant . What I really like about it is the ' full flow ' fittings . I needed all the flow I could get , and unlike some hoses I have looked at , the fittings are not a restriction . About the only trade off I can see , is that it takes an o - ring at the fitting , instead of the standard hose gasket .
5 #### Great splitter used it for a couple of month now . No issues
5 #### Great pair of pliers . Used almost a year now . Still like new . Would buy again .
1 #### Was n't very well thought out as far mounting the light bulb . Could not get my fingers around the bulb to screw into socket . Had to have 12 year old grandson put the bulb in and his finger were almost too big .... Come on DeWalt have your engineering people try to use stuff before you market it ..... Update : Found an LED bulb that will fit right here on Amazon ..... https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OB8K1C4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
5 #### I was hesitant to buy a clock online , since it 's difficult to determine the quality and readability of a clock from a description . I studied many clock options and decided to try this one . I gave it unopened as a gift , and the person was delighted . It is quite large and easy to read with large numbers and excellent contrast , and it 's made very well and has an attractive , classic design . It also has some amazing features like the ability to set and maintain its own time ! I did have to figure out that I needed to set the time zone , but once I did that it 's been spot on . If I saw this clock hanging in a display , I would have expected to pay $ 100 or more for it . This was the value purchase of the year for us !
2 #### < div id="video - block - R33DPHB89UD47 T " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / E1XJqG6uW4S.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/91FwkYI4NdS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;Update : I did a follow up video of my original review . A simple modification to project the airflow down further made a massive improvement . Anyway I say if you 're okay with making a modification , then this will be a 4 star product . But as is , you 'll find too much of the dust is not collected and goes into the main vacuum . As is , iit only deserves 2 stars .
5 #### A must have to remove the cylinder on the Kwikset locks . You can get lucky with practice with a screwdriver but this tool makes it much easier to deal with these locks whether you lost the key and need to rekey it or just flipping the lock around when the door opens opposite and the cylinder is upside down for your needs .
5 #### I have had this item for one year . I took some time for me to learn to use it properly , but once I did ... holy crap , what a marvelous grill . We , my wife and I , have used it to make just about everything you can grill . We use the recipes from the Weber website , and many of our own recipes and ideas . It has not disappointed us , and we do not expect it to do so . The heat is even throughout the surface of the grill , and the flame can be fine tuned for any job . We did remove the fold out flaps , as they were a little wobbly , and could not be trusted to hold much weight . If this item is purchased , take the time to learn how to use it properly . I guarantee you will * NOT * be disappointed .
4 #### It 's not obvious from the pictures , but half of it is plastic . I guess that 's how they keep the cost down . The slot where the blade comes out is entirely metal , so it should be pretty durable . I primarily will be using this for cutting insulation and opening boxes , so not a big deal .
5 #### I never bothered to have an apple corer before , but because I now snack on apples instead of candy , I have found the coring tool to be a nice thing to have . I just core the apple , then slice it up , and snack on the apple slices . Works great . Easy to clean .
5 #### It 's loud , but it dries my hair really quickly , and makes it really shiny and smooth . FULLY recommend this product ! !
4 #### The spinner works well . It does what it is intended to do . Takes up a lot of cabinet space though . If you have space to spare , I recommend it .
5 #### This light is nice and bright It 's sturdy and flexible and gives off a lot of light . Great for kids and adults .
5 #### Nice large size . Very comfy handle . Dishwasher safe . My old whisk had 5 wire loops that would jam into each other and bend funny ( piece of junk ) . The Good Grips 11 " balloon whisk has 10 wire loops that do n't come into contact with each other , allowing for more thorough whisking . The plug in the handle where the wire loops go though is heavily sealed , keeping it very sanitary . It 's really durable . It can whip up a half a dozen eggs in a big mixing bowl super quick ( that 's the most I 've tried -- I 'm sure it can do more ) . Also great for large gravy making at Thanksgiving . Other than discoloration of the wire loops ( after much use and dishwasher cleanings ) it still looks and feels new .
5 #### The standout on this is the main reason I bought it . Heavy - duty , contractor grade tape . It is built like a tank .
5 #### I love love love this product - have bought several for me and many more for gift - giving . Have used consistently for nearly two years and still love my original one . I enjoy cooking and baking ( breads , especially ) and I use this for EVERYTHING ( except for cutting on ) . I have cut some to fit all my baking pans and now happily bake away with not a care about sticking . I bought my first one at a discount department store but got a better buy here . A cinch to use , to clean , and to store ( nifty idea using the paper towel roll to store them . ) Nothing sticks . Good for up to 500 degrees . Amazing product . Way better than those silicone mats and much better than parchment paper . I have even tried quality parchment paper and the Kitchen Supply parchment paper side by side in a cookie bake - off and the KS won hands - down . A Best Buy , A+ . Buy at least two .
5 #### my old saw is like new .. It cuts like it used to ...
5 #### Have used off and on outdoors for a few months . Works perfectly and is fairly simple to set up .
5 #### This is a great vacuum for the price . We replaced a $ 500 Dyson with this and like it a lot better . The Dyson always smelled bad ( we have 2 short haired dogs ) . We hated the bag less design which means always we always need to touch and handle the dirt . This vacuum is smaller , lighter , and just as powerful as the Dyson but cost $ 50 . I added a telescoping wand and a sanataire heavier duty hose after about three months . My kids use the vacuum and abuse it so the standard hose was getting bent up and crimped . With the extra parts this cost about $ 120 . Have had it for about 6 months and still love it . The bags are really large and super cheap , no more smell and dirt handling . We have all hardwood floors . This would not be a good option for carpet .
4 #### It is not Dewalt , no ! Its a B&D and it worked perfect for me . I had completed several projects with this sander , and I was pleased with the quality of finishing job
5 #### Good buy for the price . Help me to cook in less time and its easy to clean . Good for home use .
5 #### You just ca n't find these anywhere anymore because of all these new useless code violations . I am just so happy to find this one . Most likely , I will buy another in about two weeks from this day for my other bathroom . Great product . Thanks
4 #### Cutter works as advertised : Fast , easy blade change , and easy clean up etc . I made a batch of Hash Browns with onions & peppers in a flash ! Neg : Must use no larger than medium potato . ( Really no big deal , just halve or quarter the larger ones . ) Have n't tried sweet potatoes ( have my doubts ) .
4 #### These bits do a good job at keeping the mosquito population in check . While I still have mosquitos flying around when I 'm watering my flower gardens , there are noticeably fewer of them . Some days I do n't even put on insect repellant spray and have not gotten a bite . That 's remarkable because I 've always been one of those folks who mosquitos just love to attack . While not 100 percent mosquito - proof , these will go a long way in controlling the mosquito population boom in your yard .
5 #### I bought this for a trip to the Hiddenite Emerald Mine in North Carolina this summer because last summer when we were there they required us to use plastic trowels when panning in the creek and the ones they provided were broken and worn down to nubs . This stood up to digging in a rocky creek all day by adults and kids . I 'm very glad I bought this .
5 #### Amazon has parts in bulk . Set lo mixture for highest RPM 's at idle and hi mixture for highest RPM 's at full - throttle . Repair Clinic and E Replacement Parts are VERY good sources for parts ! E Replacement Parts has exploded views .
5 #### I thought at first a masher was an impractical impulse buy but , now I 'm glad I purchased it now more than ever as I use it more frequently . I have mashed potatoes , chick peas , califlower , and the like to save time and energy . It has n't bent even under strain ! Good value for this masher !
5 #### I was worried , since some reviews said that the lids were too stiff to get on the container . They are very firm , but will most likely limber up with a bit of use AND I was able to get them on fine . The hold 2 Tablespoons of peanut butter ( a serving ) really well and I can get apple slices into them just fine .
5 #### not much can be said for this just well made
5 #### great can opener ! i buy cento canned tomatoes that were IMPOSSIBLE to open with the last 2 can openers that i had - very annoying . this guy does the job with no issues . love it
5 #### Works a lot better than the Sharper Image one we had
2 #### Its a novelty and we have only used it once , I actually think I like making the faces myself without the pan !
5 #### Compare to low price this is a great and quality item , I will order more In the future ! !
5 #### Its a klein , top of the line tool , buy the best and forget the rest , great little screwdriver
5 #### I 've had this saw now for a month or so and have worked the heck out of it . Solid saw . Great features . High quality . I 'd recommend this to anyone .
1 #### way too little ! it can not handle potatoes bigger than a the size of a small fist unless you cut it in half . If you like your long , that is not for you . but then , for $ 15 , you might wanna live with shorter fries , it that case it will do the job for you . PS : I was looking for another cutter , I came across with this one again , which I already own . I said " let me be cool , let me help some others save money for potatoes " . I did not realize I had already reviewed this product and gave it a one star . I think that is not a fair rating , it should have gotten zero stars . Save your money , buy potatoes instead .
5 #### Great bins . Very well made . Connect great to the wall board . Made in the USA . I use these for ammo reloading .
5 #### Replaced a Fluidmaster that , despite being relatively new , failed and would n't stop flushing even when float arm went all the way up . This only took 10 minutes to replace , required no tools , was dead simple to adjust ( very clever height locking mechanism ) , and the price is right . It 's significantly quieter than the one I replaced - even my kids noticed . Once the tank is full , the shutoff mechanism is instant and satisfyingly precise . I love that the float assembly is completely enclosed within the housing . Instructions are easy to understand , and if that 's not enough then there are great YouTube videos that show both installation as well as troubleshooting . Very happy with this purchase .
5 #### Works unbelievably well - a 2 pack gets me through the summer
5 #### I have only used this once so far but it 's very smooth cutting and I have always had good experience with Freud router bits
1 #### could n't get anything to clone . bought 2 containers . not as advertised .
5 #### not a direct replacement , but with minor modifications , it worked ..
5 #### Price is right , they work , and they last for years . An excellent solution for mole problems .
4 #### Not exactly as bright as I was hoping it would be , but still good for what I 'll be using them for . I am putting one in each of my IFAK 's . Price was good and since they are from Maglite I know they can be trusted ! ! ! ! Overall would recommend to anyone needing a small easily stored light ! ! ! !
5 #### This is my third one . Works well covering light openings and never had to use any adhesive . The fixture keeps it in place . A must have when changing any ceiling fixtures . Also . Give that extra upscale appearance .
5 #### Somehow I ended up with 2 sets of these and was going to return extra set but they fit perfectly and I will keep them and use on another ladder .
4 #### I purchased this biscuit jointer two years ago and have used it to build many tables in the time since . It is a quality built machine that is worth its modest price tag . The only fault I can find with it is that the dust port leading to the cloth bag tends to get clogged up . This is not a big deal though , as it is easy to clean out . I would buy this tool again in a heartbeat .
5 #### Have n't had a pressure cooker since the early 1970 's ! But now that I live at 8500 feet up in the mountains , cooking and/or boiling many types of food is a challenge . So , I bit the bullet and decided to try out a pressure cooker . I am single , thus chose the 4 - quart size . And I wanted stainless steel , of course ! I am very pleased and already have cooked numerous different food types with great results . Excellent product quality and as far as the rusting screws so many have complained about , either it is too soon for me to see this happen , or I do believe the screws for my handles are stainless steel or some non - rusting metal ( though maybe I 'm wrong ) . Anyway , if they do start to rust , I 'll just do like others and buy non - rusting screws for a few bucks and solve the issue .
5 #### RATS disappeared as soon as these items arrived at my front door .
5 #### These little garden tools are a must , especially for little old ladies like me with no upper body strength to use long handled tools . I like to kneel ( I wear garden knee pads ) when I garden and these tools are perfect . I ordered the ' basket ' to hold them all in and now I am looking forward to the spring when I can use all the tools I have purchased since I fell in love with the very first one . You ca n't go wrong with these products if you want to be in control of what you 're doing in your garden .
3 #### Does the job . the watts are a bit low for a number of soldering jobs , but for most things this is great . Price is good as well , so I am satisfied with it for small or typical jobs .
5 #### always using these for trimming and even cutting tree roots on stumps to make it easier to remove them
5 #### Well , to be honest " I " do n't really love this .. in fact , I could n't care less for measuring tapes , however my son - in - law uses this regularly and he does love it ! His quote " Stanley 's the best Ma , This will hold up forever , and I 'll be able to hand it down to my own son one day if we have one ! " He seems very happy to use this as often as he can !
5 #### An absolute necessity if you are using a tall extension ladder . I only wish that the " arms " were extendable / adjustable to accommodate areas with uneven surfaces ( i.e. a narrow inset window where the ladder needs to be centered on the window edge )
5 #### It does what it is supposed to do . Great product .
5 #### I 've only used it once but I love it so far ! Ca n't decide if it 's easier to use this or cut an entire watermelon . At least this way I ca n't cut myself
5 #### Easy install . I purchased this , and did n't regret it . Quick shipment too . I have no way of checking on the quality , but the price is right .
5 #### Just what I needed to convert my shop - vac to a larger hose .
5 #### Looks and feels just fine . What more can you say ? There 's nothing fancy about this item . I does what it 's supposed to do . I do n't recall the price I paid , but I think it was reasonable and about what you 'd expect to pay .
5 #### A gift for someone else . I think it is well liked , and used every day .
5 #### This is a great vegetable brush that really gets the job done . Easy to grip , does n't slip out of my hand and the bristles are nice and firm . I would definitely recommend this brush .
5 #### Started my sprouting project yesterday and already see a few " tails " so know the seeds are starting to sprout . So excited ! ! Had received an email from the seller following - up to make certain everything was going well with the transaction . GREAT customer service ! Very impressed and will absolutely continue doing business with them ... and recommend everyone else do the same ! !
5 #### QUALITY STAINLESS STEEL , EXCELLENT FINISH , HANDY RING THAT KEEPS THEM TOGETHER IN THE DRAWER OR IN THE DISHWASHER , YET EASY TO SEPERATE WHEN NEEDED . BEST OF ALL IS I CAN READ THE NUMBERS WITH ZERO EFFORT .. NICE , ,
4 #### For the price , this is an awesome vacuum cleaner . It 's loud , but it sucks up the dirt . The narrow diameter wands and low profile head ( or whatever it 's called ) make it easy to get under furniture and into tight spaces . However , this is the second machine I 've ordered , only because the hose on my first one got damaged , and it does n't seem to have as much suction power . I am going to contact Eureka about it . Still , it 's a great buy for someone who ca n't afford a fancier machine .
5 #### Good quality , plastic compost cultivator ! This is a great tool to use if you are in to vermicomposting ( aka wormfarming ) this is a better tool to use to turn the compost because it is much less likely to cut the worms when compared to a spade or a spoon .
5 #### This is very sturdy and will likely be my favorite " go to " knife in the drawer .
5 #### I have two of these . Accurate time keeping and they work without a problem . I have one in the garage and one on the wall of the family room . They synced without any delay and the temp / humidity appears accurate . A good looking wall clock . Just what I needed and want . Plus , by buying the limited packaging from Amazon , saved a ton of money .
5 #### I have have had these lights installed for over a year now and they still are all lit . Much better than the old style rope lighting with regular bulbs . I have these installed as accent lighting in my family room and they are on continuously . I would recommend .
5 #### After screwing and gluing my trim boards in place on a cabinet adjustment to fit a new fridge , I realized I had an 1/8th inch difference between one side and the other . A friend suggested a Japanese pull saw , and Amazon had this for a very reasonable price . In two days , I set my lines and pulled the blade to cut an exact and smooth line across the oak trim boards ( 1 " by 5 " ) and the backing support pieces glued behind them . The waste material was paper thin , and came off without chipping . Be careful ! The saw blade is very sharp ! I found the long handle a great asset in lining the blade straight across the cut line . Highly recommend !
4 #### I needed some inexpensive stakes and this fit the bill . yeah the green can come off on you so I wear gloves .
2 #### the feeder was p about 20 minutes , the suction cup gave out , the feeder crashed and burned on the patio , broken beyond use
5 #### This is a great BBQ turner . It is long , the handle is nice , and it is sturdy . What more could you want in a BBQ Turner ? We use it mostly for burgers .
5 #### This is a great little brush . I have one for scrubbing my fingernails and one for veggies . Works terrific on corn hair .
5 #### Great quality , exactly as advertised . Would buy it again if needed .
5 #### Does work great . This is a must have unless you are cutting very short pieces . I ordered both side and rear supports and use them religiously . An extra roller stand is next on my list for long pieces as I usually work alone .
5 #### I love Nordic ware and especially the platinum collection . I use this pan frequently and the cakes come out with ease always .
4 #### This product works great and is easy to clean . The only complaint is that the design could be a little more safety conscience , hence 4 stars vs. 5 ( be careful when you remove the cover , it can get hot ) . Overall you ca n't beat the price / performance ratio on this product .
5 #### These have just the look I was going for , colonial and handmade , and make quite a statement holding my outdoor solar lanterns !
2 #### This thing has scratched my floor so many times that I have since donated it to goodwill . The ground clearance is so low that if you have any tiny bits of dirt / rock on your floor that you did n't notice you will notice it for sure once you run the vacuum over it and see the scratch . I will say that I have kids and dogs and they track in more than the average amount of dirt .
5 #### Took a few tries to learn how it works but now that I figured it out I kill each mole within about 1 - 2 days of first seeing the tunnel . The trick is to find a tunnels they will use again and then just press the trap down over it so when they come through again and push up .... SNAP ! you have a dead mole . I 've killed 4 moles with this in the past couple months . Just ordered a 2nd one to help with this mole infestation .
5 #### works great on keeping fungus gnats controlled and killing mosquitoes
5 #### I have several of this tongs and recommend them if they have the metal center clip ( the plastic ones break ) . These 16 " ones are great for the grill were you do n't want to get you hand in the fire .
4 #### Based on the reviews of this valve I just bought one and installed it . For those of you out there who do not have a degree in Toilet Engineering take heart - I 'm good at two things when it comes to tools : swearing and throwing tools ... Last night just before turning in I flushed the toilet and heard a loud snap and water rushing . The arm which holds the arm and float ball had irreparably snapped ( plastic ) . The shutoff at the floor leaked so I had to shut off the main to the house . The " plumber " at Home Depot recommended the 400A. I had it installed in 20 minutes . Much to my surprise I eye - balled the height of the new valve next to the old ballcock and the water level was perfect first try . When I say eye - balled , I mean that I compared the two from the bottom of the flange which sits on the bottom of the tank to the hole where the water flow out of the valve . The other surprise is no leaks . I only " hand tightened " as the instructions said . If I have any problems in the next 5 years I 'll get back so right now it 's a provisional 4 star - potential 5 star .
5 #### My sister told me about this as I had bought one at the store and it broke on the first use ! When she told me about this one I was kind of hesitant but the reviews were good and then when I was making an apple pie it did do great and did not break like the 1st one ! Cleans up easy too .
5 #### Good additional tool for my Dremel 3000 using this flexible unit in small areas .
5 #### Original equipment replacement that worked fantastic . Like having a new shop vac .
5 #### This is the most amazing blade I have ever used ! I have n't been woodworking for too long , but I still know this is an excellent blade . I have used it many times to resaw and it has only been limited by my table saw 's power . Also , you really have to try hard to get this blade to burn . You can quickly pause while ripping a piece of cherry and there wo n't be any burn marks . Last , I must say that this blade makes excellent crosscuts as well . I have used the blade extensively and I used it today to cut miters for a small box . They came out perfect . I could n't believe it . I included a photo below . The flat top grind on the blade is also great for cutting rabbets , grooves , and splines . This blade puts my Diablo combination blade to shame . It cuts better in every type of cut - even across the grain . Would buy again .
5 #### I 've avoided getting a salad spinner for years because they take up so much room , but we eat so many leafy greens that it no longer made sense not to have one . I love this OXO spinner . It is attractive , and it works wonderfully . No more wet salads or trying to dry off veggies with paper towels . It 's easy to use ... the brake is genius , and the handle will lock down flat if you need to save space . I highly recommend it .
5 #### So far I love these hoses . I bought two -- one for watering my vegetable garden and the other for filling the pools we use for the dogs to cool off in . For both purposes , I wanted the lead - free , BPA - free hoses . The hoses are pliable , they fasten to the outdoor spigot easily because of the white bits to grasp when you twist the hose tight . Not one drop of a leak , even without the use of plumbers ' tape . I wish all my hoses had those . And so far , these white , white hoses do n't seem to pick up dirt so they still look new .
5 #### o nice to have espresso at home ! ! Very easy to use and makes wonderful drinks ! !
5 #### I got this nozzle to try a different nozzle for different reasons . You can never have enough nozzles for hoses . It works well , puts out great pressure and you feel like something is getting cleaned instead of just soaked .
5 #### Works wonderfully well with my older Long Ranger receiver . The switch for programming is tiny and hidden away a bit on the side
5 #### These are probably the best measuring cups I 've owned . I bought a set of plastic cups a couple of years ago and it was hardly anytime before the sizes began to wear off , even with hand washing . I had had a metal set of cups some time ago but they got separated and eventually were lost . These are much better than those were . The handles are very sturdy .
5 #### i have been using an old plastic trash can to cover my lawnmower for several years . I saw this item and had to have it . Now i can give my mower adequate protection from the elements .
3 #### This knife is a really sturdy knife , and it looks nice and blends with a steak knife set that I have . It 's a little tougher to get the cut started with this knife than with other serrated blade knives that I have . Since I 'm using this knife to slice bread , it sometimes mashes the bread a little , before it cuts through the surface . Once it 's through the surface , it slices very nicely . I was trying to upgrade from a bread knife that I already have ( which cuts extremely well , but is a cheap looking knife ) , but this was unfortunately not an upgrade overall . I prefer the cutting quality to the looks .
5 #### Purchased for school . Did n't hear any complaints ( and believe me I would ) so assume they are happy .
5 #### Great for planting plants you need to move around in your pond . The are a good size to sit on the edges if needed .
4 #### I had purchased several of the Sweeny solar version but my gardener kept damaging them during mowing and/or it did n't last more than a season due to its flimsy construction . Decided to try this version instead and is definitely much more solid . I 'm hoping it lasts through multiple seasons .
5 #### Great well made tool with a wide range of uses
4 #### I would have given this outlet five stars , but the fit is so tight that it is very difficult to unplug . This is the case with a variety of different devices , so the plug is the culprit . On the other hand , the tight fit seems to be accompaniment to a very good electrical connection . Even with a space heater plugged in , the plug stays cool to the touch .
3 #### The BBQ comes with one grill and one griddle , if you intend on using it as a BBQ , you 'll quickly need a 2nd grill to make the whole stove - top a grill surface . These grills are aluminum and while they move the heat very quickly , they also do n't carry it as long or as even as the iron version . The upside is that they 're lightweight and relatively easy to clean . One downside , upon my first use and being careful , some of the teflon already started coming off the top edges ... I seriously doubt they 'll last very long , so be extra super - careful and do n't let anyone near them with anything but a soft - plastic or heat - tolerant rubber .
5 #### The Lufkin Carpenters Ruler is the only one I found that was both accurate and well made . The price is right and the delivery timely
5 #### It repels no see ums and horse flies , ideal for the Florida keys
5 #### This feeder has defeated the Blue Jays and the squirrels from pigging out on expensive black oil sunflower seed ! What a pleasure not to constantly have to chase the " pigs " away . I feel so magnanimous in victory that I feed the squirrels peanuts . It took the Cardinals about 3 days to get used to the new feeder so be patient .
5 #### I used this fork today to help loosen the soil so I could pull up weeds . The fork is n't heavy , but it feels tough and it worked like a dream . I 'm very happy with this purchase .
4 #### Description is accurate , but almost impossible to handle with my big hands . Purchased quality and application per manufacturer 's description / specifications . If I had to do it again , I would not buy and op - out and buy the Stanley trim plane for around $ 35 .
5 #### I have been buying Freud bits to replace a cheap box set I bought . The Freud ones like this cut through wood like a knife through butter . Very pleased with the two purchased to date .
5 #### works just like grandma 's cast iron unit . teflon coating and aluminum base make it easier to use .
2 #### In contrast to some of the other reviews , I find this press harder to use than others that I 've owned . This is surprising given OXO 's typical track record in usability . In fact , the press that I replaced with this one was also an OXO and worked much better in terms of hand strength required . The reason I replaced the other model was because its coating came off in the dishwasher and it was harder to clean . This is the one real benefit for this model as it is far easier to clean than any other one I 've used . The one strange thing that happens with mine is that water will get trapped in the handle and leak in my drawer after it comes out of the dishwasher . It also leaves behind more garlic when pressing than other presses that I 've used which feels like a waste . In the end , I 'm going to go back to using my old press until I find one that is both easy to use AND easy to clean .
5 #### This is the only spatula I will use to remove hot cookies off the baking sheet !
5 #### Worked great . Popped it in and started it up . Was having vibration noises with my old string . This was perfectly quiet and auto release worked great .
1 #### Used it for 2 days and now it barely gets warm , I can hold the tip in my hand and holding down the trigger .
5 #### Best combination maul / axe I have found . Sharp , lifetime guarantee , great ergonomics . Another Fiskars product that is well worth the money . Stlii made in Nordic Country , the quality and innovation shows . I like the Teflon coating a lot , no more prying out a stuck maul , it is so well balanced , it is fun again to Chop Wood !
5 #### Heavy duty . I 'm replacing one that is lightweight just to be safe . Rugged construction
3 #### Works as expected . I like being able to carry it around and being able to hang it around other structures .
2 #### My husband wanted this grill because it had good reviews . After we got it one of the legs came pretty bent in but we did n't want to return the product already because we needed it for the weekend . Another downside is that the lid does n't latch on to anything so when grilling and the lid is hot you have to hold the lid in your hand . That s very inconvenient because you ca nt put it down since its hot so that leaves you only one hand to grill with . Pretty disappointed .
5 #### Bought it to clean ceiling vents in store . Works well . Pretty powerful for its size .
4 #### The only reason these are n't 5 stars is because I discovered the all metal ones . The all metal are my preferred connector - that said if budget or just an easy way to get started is what you are looking for - this is a great set at a great price . The hole GARDENA system is the best I have ever used . Working in the yard my whole life , I truly appreciate the speed , ease and comfort provided by the fittings . I have had arthritis for a long time in my hands . These are so easy for me whether it is 50 degrees or 100 degrees that I have forgotten what it was like before
5 #### You know the diagonal cutting pliers cut but if you have ever used diagonal pliers to pull out nails or staples you will quickly notice the difference the between the straight and curved cutters . The curved ones are a definate must have tool . It makes jobs involving removing staples and nails so much easier . If you need diagonal cutting pliers you should buy the curved ones . These are an excellent choice since they are Channellock Pliers . They 're guaranteed too ! !
5 #### I used Intermatic brand for several years , bought from Homedepot , but the store changed the stock to another brand , less attractive and probably cheaper manufacturing . I did not wire the switch box to have a neutral wire , so I need mechanical ( spring powered ) timer and I use the timer a lot . Mine lasted about 3 years . This one is beginning to get stuck and not winding down to off position . Probably the spring is getting weaker .
5 #### I love the angular Purdy brushes . They last and clean up well . As with any paint brush you should not let the paint ever reach the top of the brissles .
5 #### fits my chain saw perfectly and cuts through logs quickly .
5 #### Love it ! Keeps calculator where you need it and safe !
4 #### The brake is n't as good as my old OXO but it works .
5 #### Arrived quickly . What else to say ? If your looking for these , 'cuz they DO work ..... These are them .
5 #### Pros - Easy , convenient , second battery , more powerful than I expected , does n't scare the cat and wake the neighbors , great with dust , cat litter , and food particles , and comes apart easily for stairs . Also picks up decently on carpet . Cons - does n't get the corners too well , and you should n't run over coins and large objects . You might be able to , I just have n't tried it . Does n't replace the household vacuum for major cleaning . Buying one for mom as a gift . Hope it makes her life easier ! :)
5 #### This is a nice heavy pan for bread baking - yeast and sweet . It is easy to clean and I have been very happy with its performance .
5 #### Have a serious mole problem and had to bury this around several shrubs whose roots were being eating by rodents .... plants are now thriving and have tripled in size since using this method of deterrent .
2 #### The bristles are way too stiff for mushrooms . Maybe great for carrots and potatoes though .
1 #### Non - stick coating is just 1 thin layer , very poor quality . The coating surface has several rough small bubbles as well . It peels when I wash it before the first use .
5 #### bought this for granny so we can eat , guess what . . . it works .
1 #### Definitely NOT worth the effort , these bulbs DO NOT LAST and the low price should not be cause to try them out . Sorry , I have to find some better ones as my time is worth more to me .
4 #### Works well , just cheesier than I thought it would be . The little replaceable pads wear out fast and do n't always stay in place .
5 #### replaced another exact item when I broke blade after several years of use quality is still there excellent product
5 #### This hose nozzle lets out an amazing amount of water and looks like it could survive a nuclear blast . I 'm extremely impressed with the build quality and the functionality for washing dogs and my car . With my old nozzle , it would take a long time to wash the soap out of my dog 's hair . With this nozzle , the initial gush of water takes almost all of the soap away leaving them squeaky clean . Same goes for rinsing soap off of my car . It 's hard to imagine being excited about a hose nozzle but this thing is awesome .
5 #### I have the 6 QT and the 3 QT is a nice option
4 #### My first time with sprouts I used a little too much and had more sprouts than I could use but they were very tasty .
3 #### Well made but the package on muffin tin said oven safe to 365 degrees - I often bake at higher temps than that . Will be returning . Too bad , nice looking pan that would probably have been durable .
5 #### This , the standard to which others are compared , remains a premium contender even with variable , and LED - lit models coming out now . It 's small and powerful , with precisely ground guides for the vertical adjustment . One will note that even after Stanley bought Black and Decker , which had earlier bought Porter - Cable , this item remained in production , and will for many years to come .
4 #### The jury is still out on this tool . Yes the handle is poorly engineered , only held in place by a single screw into a plastic base ; yet I have had not trouble with it shearing off or breaking . I guess I am not gorilla torquing it . I am surprised with the low quality of materials and unsophisticated engineering expressed in a high - end tool make like Stanley ! Maybe they ll get the hint that this tool needs some tweaking . Other wise it has performed well to shape the Styrofoam landscaping on my model railroad project
5 #### I have two of these . They are my " go to " knives .
5 #### This mower has done all I ask of it . It leaves behind a beautifully groomed lawn whilst being quiet and non - polluting . Having said that there are a couple of things of which potential purchasers should be aware . There are probably more sturdily built mowers available but the price offsets this . Also , the American Lawn Mower Company has these machines built in China . If you have a small lawn and you do n't let the grass grow too long this machine should meet your needs and give you some exercise .
5 #### I replace these filters every month to keep my AC working efficiently . They would last longer , but I want my AC to run at top performance levels . Buying in bulk is a nice convenience .
5 #### Had a critter / garden issue . This worked great for keeping the unwanted out and was easy for me to handle . I 'm short , 4'11 so that was important . Be sure to wear gloves when handling it .
5 #### I was using my edger for a while before I noticed how many times I had to keep going over the same area to get a nice clean edge . I looked at the blade and saw that it was worn ; replaced it with the new blade and the difference was night and day . This blade cuts very nicely - one pass and done for the day .
5 #### i got two of these and I love them . I am constantly changing from a sprinkler to the nozzle and now i do n't have to go to the valve to shut off the water to change them out . ( or try to hold the hose kinked while unscrewing the sprinkler and screwing on the nozzle ) This valve is easy to operate and eliminates a lot of unneeded exercise .
5 #### Product was as advertised , arrived in perfect ccondition . Was actually a birthday gift for son in construction business . Functions as expected Will be used in daily work .
5 #### The absolute best liquid organic fertilizer on the market . It is expensive to use as it is not as concentrated as other liquid bloom fertilizers . My one exception to the " cheaper is better " gardening philosophy .
5 #### Klein hand tools are my personal favorite . As an electrician I use them every day at work . This is a good screwdriver .
5 #### Works as advertised , change them every 3 months and they have dust / dirt trapped in them so there 's that . yay ! filters !
5 #### I just love these micro pruners for keeping my garden plants trimmed . This year I did my tomatoes on poles and had to aggressively prune the plant for suckers . These pruners provided nice clean cuts that healed quickly .
5 #### Not much to say ... it fits well , has height adjustment screws and works as it should .
5 #### What a waste of time and effort buying trimmer line and rewinding it yourself . Just buy this and save yourself a lot of stress and aggravation . Unsnap the old one--------throw it away--------snap in the new one--------should take no more than 2 minutes
5 #### It works great . Picks up more then the others do and easy to figure out all the displays .
5 #### Bought this for my wife to use cutting up pallets for art projects and trimming tree limbs it works great and I prefer it to the elongated handle on the ones I use at work .
5 #### This 25 ft Stanley Faxmax has excellent ' standout ' which is primarily why I keep buying them . The tapes are quite durable , as well . I bought my first one 11 years ago , and am still using it , although it shows some wear now . Then bought a ' two - pack ' three years ago , and managed to leave one of those in an attic too far away to retrieve . I recently bought this " two - pack " at a great price , and expect these to last as well as my first one .
4 #### I purchaced this screw driver for small projects . Jobs that I did n't want to strip the screw or " over - drive " the screw . It is perfect for that use . The handle is comfortable and it holds a charge a good long time . The downside is the driver does not come with a case like the old Black and Decker drivers did and does n't come with exchangeable batteries . You can " replace " the battery but you ca n't have a backup battery charged up and waiting . Overall a very good product for fair price .
5 #### Bought as a replacement for the one I accidentally broke . ( The old one was a gift from my mom about 20 years ago . ) They work well and hold up for a long time if not attacked by a case of the clumsey .
4 #### Works well . Seems sturdy . Easy to clean . Removable strainer basket useful for other purposes as well .
5 #### I have no complaints about this great product . It 's large and holds enough salads for lunches throughout the week , also great for bringing large portions to a party / picnic . The bright lime green and clear plastic match my kitchen and looks great in the fridge . I really like that the push spinner button slides down and locks in place to save room in the fridge . It has rubber feet to prevent it from sliding around on the counter .
5 #### Works great . I purchased the burner to go with the Bayou class 42qt pot and basket . Jet burner for boiling is the only was to go . I also have the Bayou classic double jet for my 80 qt .
5 #### I buy pesticides and herbicides in concentration . i ve been using the pump action for a while and it was annoying . This thing works perfectly !
4 #### I love this hose real . It is simple and easy to use . However , these resin made products , among other products , do not last long in Florida because of the long hot sun in the summers , the resin has a tendency to break down . Consequently , I gave this item 4 stars .
5 #### This was a bad year for bugs . Our state DEP did not spray this year . So I installed this away from my house . It was great to be able to sit outback without worrying about getting bit . It came with a mosquito attractant which helped attract the little buggers toward the light . I could tell when the attractant was all gone .
5 #### I have had 2 of these for the last 12 years . Bought my first one at a department store so many years ago . I use in the Oven , Toaster , and Stove top . Use everywhere except the cast iron . Hand wash and they will last . My daughter had to have one so I needed a replacement .
5 #### Great company . Great product . Be sure to put a small hole in the opening cuz it comes out fast .
1 #### The only good thing about this grater is that it does n't take a lot of space , but after using it few times it cracked on the bottom .
5 #### Woodstock Encore produces exceptional products . This is my second set of Woodstock windchimes . I purchased this set for a vacation home . The chimes are tuned . The sounds from multiple chimes are harmonic . I have at both houses : Venus , Neptune , Earth , Mars , Mercury & Pluto . My only suggestion to Encore is to make a larger chime for even deeper tones . It gives my ramada areas very relaxing sounds .
5 #### Work well , smell horrible . Highly recommend these , just make sure to put a safe distance away from where you like to be because when the sun hit them , it makes the area smell like a dirty porta potty .
5 #### Keeps the right temp & is small - all that it 's cracked up to be .
4 #### Assembly is not too difficult . Once built it provides a good sturdy table that is easy to move . LIke that its not too heavy and the top and seat surfaces are easy to wipe and clean .
5 #### Much cheaper than buying the small packs , same high quality . It 's genuine Stanley .
5 #### We have been looking for a replacement can opener for a long time . The previous review were great and so I thought I would give this a try . It has wroked great everytime , and provides a slight rolled edge for safety . Should last for many years .
2 #### I will have to differ with others who rave on this . The loop that let 's you button the thing flat broke the first time I used it . After a reasonable amount of use , the spring started coming through the sides . Pricey for a less than well - made piece of equipment . Wish it could be tougher
4 #### This is an easy to use product that gets the job done . Just what I 've been looking for and the price was right .
5 #### This decal is my favorite item that I 've ever purchased . It does n't tell you in the ad that you also get 3 smaller birds , and about 4 - 5 misc decals . You can put these on different walls to create a theme and it looks great . The bird is pretty big so you 'll want it to be the centerpiece . The decals go on smoothly and easily and come off if you need to move or re - do it . TRULY A GREAT BUY ! !
3 #### Works well for the price . Recognize this is a lower end strength netting but does the job for the right price . Not sure how many years I will get out of it but it seemed the most cost effective option . So far , no deer or pesky animals have gotten into my garden - ca n't ask for more than that .
5 #### We found the 80D not much more to buy than the 1/2 acre 40D , and it likely does provide a wider area of coverage . It will use more electricity , but I intend to put it on a sensor , so it will run dusk to dawn . As others reported , we found a pile of carnage after the first night .... mostly mosquitoes . Read the instructions about locating and baiting .... ours is forty feet upwind of our hot tub , patio , and screened porch so the black light and scent bait draws bugs away from us , and intercepts those coming from upwind . Far enough away from food and guests to avoid the health hazards reported , and the " zapping " is not obtrusively loud . Ours arrived with a small plastic tab laying in the bottom of the tray . Investigating , I discovered a self - tapping screw had cross - threaded during assembly , breaking off one of four tabs used to secure the safety cage . This would not have easily been detected by Quality Control at Flowtron . I contacted Parts and Service . They had me email my Amazon receipt , and immediately sent me a replacement cage . Nice service !
5 #### I like the box so far ! If you 're looking for ultimate protection or safety for your items I would recommend Pelican or steel box cases . This is nice if you have some items you might not want other to be able to access , or just for storage . I personally use it for storage . The latching mechanism has the hinge on the bottom side . This is especially useful because when lifting up on the handles the latches can not be accidentally opened by upward pressure from your hands . This ensures the lid will stay latched down and keep what is inside , inside .
5 #### Finally , a workable set of tongs for my grilling . I believe these are the best available for the following reasons : a. They are very well made b. The lock makes the tongs easy to use c. These tongs look great , too .
1 #### Item came poorly machined . I am saddened by what Skil has done to Bosch .
5 #### I have had this double boiler for 35 years . My Mother had one prior to that for 20 years . It is the pan for everything . Soup , Rice , Cereal , small batches of pasta . The top boiler pan is for white sauces , chocolate , Hollandaise . Just do not use the top pan on heat or flame .
5 #### Loved the first whisk so much , I had to get another . Best whisk every . You ca n't go wrong with this quality whisk !
3 #### I have mixed feelings about this InterDesign sponge holder . I have many InterDesign products and I am always very happy with them . However , this one arrived cracked in the front :( I was able to repair it with Krazy glue but it did n't look very pretty . I happen to have some white spray paint on hand and I decided to spray paint it in order to hide the repair . I was ok with this because I my plan was to pair it with my Coleman water carrier that I use as a portable hand washing and dish washing station whenever we go camping , it is blue and white so it matched perfectly . If this had been for my house then I would not have been too happy . This sponge holder is perfect for keeping my sponge clean , on hand and off the ground while camping . I secured it to the water carrier using heavy duty velcro . The fact that it arrived broken clearly indicates it is n't very durable , which is why I gave it 3 stars .
2 #### My handle is not as nice as the older ones . It 's a shame to see even the Germans are getting cheap . The handle looks and feels more like it 's made in China instead of Germany . You can feel the difference with the steel in the blade between this one and my old Henckels paring knife . The blade flex 's easily with this newknife . My old one would take a hammer to flex it . Might as well get the " international " line or another brand before you spend that kind of money for a German knife . Glad I kept my 20 year old set .
5 #### This little guy is pretty awesome for camping . While most parks provide fire pits with some kind of grill , they 're usually rusty and gross . Plus , campfires offer pretty uneven heat . Firing up this Smokey Joe with some charcoal is perfect for some burgers , brats , chicken , or whatever when you 're camping . You can even toss a cast iron pan on top to fry your bacon and pancakes . A couple qualifications : you better dump out all your coals into the fire pit and wipe the grill out each time to ensure that you do n't have any hot embers left when you pack it up to go home ( keeps it clean too ! ) ; and pack some stuff around it because it 's a bit wobbly for travel . Of course , this can be great at home as well , if you just need a little grill , but do n't plan on cooking for a crowd or cooking anything bigger than a pound or two .
3 #### The attachment works fine , but use the included grinding stones for something else . Do n't buy Dremel chain saw stone either . They wear too fast and will mess up the cutters on your chain . Go to a saw shop and buy some diamond grinders for your chain size . I bought Stihl grinders for just over a buck each . Toss them after about a half dozen uses . I think a file and guide yields a better result . I use a file in the woods . But for quickly bringing all cutters to the same length , setting the depth gauge etc . , you ca n't beat an electric . Just be patient so you do n't mess up the chain .
5 #### Easy to handle , This tools are made out of some kind of paste , not heavy at all , and strong enough to do the job . .
4 #### This is a great basic vacuum . It is great for my small apartment . I have a low pile IKEA rug and it works amazing on it as well as my hardwood . I like how simply each piece just fits into each other without any buttons to get broken off . My only complaint that it has a little sliding piece to remove big debris before it gets sucked into the accordian part of the hose . That sliding mechanism is great , but it 's exactly where you put your hands when you vacuum . So , from time to time it opens and you lose a little suction and it has pinched my hand . That said , i can always slap a piece of tape on that part , because otherwise this vac is so good . Suction is really great . Ca nt beat it for the price .
3 #### If you do n't care about precision or accuracy , this will do the job . Kind of a pain to set up ( needs to be screwed to something ) . It 's not really something you should use on a project you want to be proud of ... but for the price and materials used , what would you expect ?
5 #### Bought this for the " Ridgid JP0610 Planer , 6 - 1/8 - Inch Jointer " . Works as described , easy to assemble , no problem supporting this tool and allowing me to move it into position when I need it and back when I do n't . Some reviewers complained about the plastic levers breaking , but with any mechanical sense you 'd realize that a little lift of the unit with your hands while you press the wheel lock lever with your toe works just fine .
5 #### Its a very easy to grip peeler and the blade is very easy to clean , totally dishwasher safe
3 #### Not my favorite feeder . Difficult to attach to the glass . The good part it holds a large amount of food . As a free standing feeder it works preety good .
5 #### Refurbished my grandfathers old sledge i received after he passed away . Installed easily with a little trimming and looks good .
5 #### I really like the design of the holder . It opens when you lift the plunger and the weight of putting the plunger back closes the holder again . Hands free , simple .
3 #### The product was ok . It is a little awkward to use on certain jars but it did work as expected
5 #### Recently we purchased these wind chimes to replace an old set and they are wonderful ! I was extremely pleased with the quality materials used and the care that the items were packed together to protect all of the pieces in shipping . We hung them immediately on our patio and loved the sound that they made , more song - like than some of the chimes you buy that give a tinny or clanking noise . These are beautiful , giving you a lovely melody whenever a breeze comes through . I could not be happier , both with the quality of the product or of the extremely reasonable value for this item . I would have expected to pay a lot more . This would be a very nice house warming gift or as a present for someone who loves windchimes . Overall , I have no complaints . First class product in every way !
5 #### Saw a YouTube video on what to look for in a tape measure and this one does it all . Nothing left to be said . It works !
4 #### Restored suction power of older Hoover wet / dry vac . Expensive . The fit was too tight to totally seat on my vac , but I suppose that 's better than it being too loose .
5 #### Liked it so much , I bought another ! ! I have one inside a chicken coop , keeping the Ladies cool during this hot weather . Another is in the garage , where we have brooders set up , for air circulation . Work well , and will buy again ..
5 #### This salad spinner is easy to use and it works great . It has a rubber ring around the bottom that holds it in place when you spin and all of the pieces are easy to clean .
5 #### Nice . Find this much easier to use than the big gallon sprayers . Use it for in - house and outside spraying . One container full generally gets the entire perimeter . Oh , re : pump suction ... I put a few drops of 3:1 Oil down shaft and pumps right up . Nice , small , functional . What more can I say ?
5 #### Bought three of these years ago thinking they might rust like the " cheapo " ones I had before .... Am still using the first one and it is in really good shape , no rust . The other two are still in storage .
5 #### I really like the thickness of this tape measure as well as its stocky and well put together body . Seems like a proper measuring tool for any job that you might have .
5 #### i got this from amazon at first but i returned it as it did not have the more powerful saw part . got one from the company that makes the modifications for a little cheaper . great saw that does what it is intended , cutting thick material .
5 #### Very well made and works like a charm when preparing pan gravies . Very pleased with it 's weight ; very comfortable in hand ..
3 #### It is , what it is . A small trim plane with changeable blade . Sturdy , and made by Stanley . I masked off the bottom & sides , took out the blade , and sprayed some yellow paint inside ( then put the blade back , obviously ) to make it more visible in my tool bag . If it came like that I would give 5 stars . My coworkers are all wicked jealous of my yellow trim plane ;)
5 #### These units work well but they are a tight fit to the ladder and do not come off easily . Other than that they are what I was looking for .
5 #### We have had this for 6 or 8 months now . Every time I take it out of the drawer I am grateful we bought this . It may seem strange to be so happy about a can opener but if you 've used the old school ones , you will feel the same way after buying this one . It does n't leave little bits of metal behind , it 's easy to use and easy to clean
5 #### working great . shoots water about 25 feet using my well pump .
3 #### Good for 3- 5 year olds not over in my opinion
4 #### If you do n't have a good flat bar , order this . It 's well designed with good leverage and simplicity in mind . No matter what the project is I always have one of these within arm 's reach .
5 #### A good heavy duty non stick pan , I make silver dollar pancakes in it plus and egg and sausage and make a home made egg sandwich . Works well , no stick , I do spray it first . I do not put it in the dishwasher , just use a wet sponge and wipe it clean .
5 #### I finally used them today . A very nice pair of pruning shears . Would recommend to anyone
5 #### Great price for a medium sized zapper ! Seems to do the job killing mosquitoes too ! I hope the bulb last awhile !
5 #### We have a few new expensive non - stick coated pans , and wanted to make sure that we really went out of our way to take care of them so purchased actually several of the Amco nylon serving tools , including the fork . They all work extremely well .
3 #### I just finished installing the timer . I purchased 8 feet of # 10 2 - wire with ground ( I only used about 5 feet ) . The water heater is wired to 220 volts . The problem with # 10 wire is that it is stiff and so hard to work with . The three timer terminals are small and there is just a small ridge of plastic between them so I had to twist the wires & make sure that the wires went in perfectly so there would be no shorting . The timer could have had a longer screws & wider spaces for the terminals which would have made it a lot easier for me - that 's why I only gave it 3 stars . Otherwise it 's just a timer that I use for 2 on periods , 9:30 to 11 am and 6 to 8 PM .
5 #### Great tool for my kitchen arsenal . Love to use it as a pastry blender when making biscuits , etc . It works wonderfully well ... a thousand times better than any hand held pastry blender out there . ( My last one broke ) . Clean up is so easy and it is dishwasher safe too ! This is not a cheap tool . It is excellent workmanship , really professional quality , and it is made in the USA . Am so thankful I bought this . I am going to get one for each if my three girls .
5 #### Two weeks in and we have significantly less mosquitoes . I hope I do n't have issues like the 1 star reviewers . I 'll amend this review if anything happens .
5 #### My wife loves this knife . She says that it is incredibly sharp , and it has already become her favorite knife . It cuts through everything . We are really happy with this purchase .
4 #### This does the job to kill algae very well . We had a lot and it cleared up all of it quickly with one application .
5 #### These work great , they go right through large diameter nails and screws . So far they seem to last a good long time ( much longer than the DW blades I was using that kept loosing teeth . I would definitely purchase them again .
5 #### This pull chain is just what I needed for a closet light fixture , but it is a little short so I purchased additional chain to lengthen it at a hardware store . I recommend !
5 #### This pizza cutter is somewhat larger and heavier than I had imagined . I'ts built like a tank and very sharp , cut my pizza like a knife . Very well built and reasonably priced . Oxo seems to make quailty items .
5 #### I was extremely pleased about the heavier guage of the wire than normally found in similar products . It appears to be very durable . It 's the perfect size for growing my mushrooms under my Gard N Dome .
1 #### I thought these would replace my spring clamps , which are sometimes too strong for small jobs . However , the Handi - Clamps do n't provide enough clamping pressure . I returned mine . I would recommend the Quick - Grip bar clamps , they are just as quick to use and can provide a large amount of clamping pressure . I use them on almost every project .
5 #### This really is roomy . Other reviewers say it is not . Worng . I pout 20 - foot heavy duty professional grade jumper cables with large clamp ends into this and there is still some room . I bought two !
5 #### Nice pump , low power . Metal housing and in and out threads.comes with nice strainer . Does nt come with a base.i zip tied some vinyl tube to the bottom . Nice and heavy . Long ac cord
4 #### I 've wanted these for quite a long time so was happy to receive them . Surely are helpful when working my polymer clay .
5 #### First , let it be said that I bought one of these timers at a local big box store , NOT from Amazon . I use this timer in my garage to control five separate 1 amp battery chargers . Prior to purchasing the Woods 50015 timer , I could not find a digital timer that would do this job for me without failing after a few months or so . I bought this timer in OCT 13 and it has been in steady use in the aforementioned application for over 15 months . I am happy to report that it is still working great !
5 #### Mower works well and is a decent price . We only use it for a small area of the yard near the swimming pool to avoid flying rocks etc .
5 #### Absolutely love this simple silicone spatula set . I use it for everything , getting mayonnaise out of the jar , scooping ice cream out of my Teflon coated ice cream maker , stirring sauces in my ceramic nonstick pan , and scraping out the last bits of gravy or sauce when reheating a dish . The ones with the sharper corner on them are particularly handy because they can be used very well as a spatula , while the other one that just has rounded edges is more of a stirrer or shallow spoon , which I generally only use in cooking . I like silicone because it is stable at higher heats and so I do n't have to worry about releasing toxic chemicals into my food or scratching my cookware . Though I received a sample for review , the opinions are my own .
5 #### This cover made the water so hot that it literally burned my arm . The water was hot for the first six or seven inches and then cooled . When the pump mixed the water , the entire pool was very warm . I live in the desert and the water was a FREEZING 65 degrees , after having the blanket on for one day the water was at 95 degrees . I had to remove the blanked to prevent algae from forming . I can only put it on for a few hours , where I live , or the water is just too hot . I 'm sure it will work wonders in more temperate climates .
5 #### I 'm 54 yerars old and have used this axe for about 4 months now . I 've split approximately 3 cords ( cords , not face cords ) . I 've split red oak , white oak , white pine , walnut , red elm , maple and hickory . Some of the wood I 've split has been up to 28 " in diameter . Of course I 've used the correct techinque by splitting off the sides and working it down in diameter until it 's done . The axe really makes the job easier than all of my old axes . I have to say though I still have to use my wedges and sledge hammer when I 'm splitting the crotches . I have split crotches with it , but it 's a pretty good workout requiring many hits . Overall the axe works well and has saved me time and effort while splitting wood .
5 #### I have several of these , they are a great length and lock closed . I use them for spaghetti noodles and grilling .
5 #### I have used the heck out of this popper and I love it . It pops almost every kernel . I hope they never stop making this popper . I give it a absolute thumbs up !
5 #### Fits well and with Velcro strap hold up well in wind.seems to be quality material so far .
3 #### Not impressed with this product , had to much trouble getting the tea in and closing the lock etc . Not worth the few bucks that I paid . Trashed it .
4 #### This little Foreman grill is perfect for 1 or 2 people . We use it mostly to cook salmon fillets or burgers , and it 's so nice to be able to do this in less than 10 minutes ! I 've also used it to grill mushrooms and onions , with great results . Cleanup is so fast ... I just pour some water on it while still hot , and the steam loosens everything up . I just wipe it all off with a paper towel . My one complaint is that it does n't have an on / off switch . I hate seeing that little spark when I plug this into the wall to turn it on . So , despite the excellent price and performance , I only gave it four stars
2 #### The reviews for this were somewhat mixed but good overall . In use , it actually kills many moths and few mosquitoes . When I searched to order a second attractant cartridge ( it comes with one , but there are slots for 2 ) , there were reviews for this product under the attractant that were less favorable than under the actual product . I am / was using the largest model .
5 #### An absolutely high quality , large superior potato masher that has the added bonus of being made in the USA . It as a cook 's dream and I feel a bit foolish being so excited about a kitchen too , but I am so happy with it ! It does the job well and is so sturdy it will last for years . I would recommend highly !
5 #### We love cooking with it and we are glad we ordered it .... makes my husband really happy !
5 #### Light to handle , very good response to metal objects . Will see more results when we go on vacation
1 #### Had to return it as it is not the right timer for my electric water heater . The case is too small for the # 10 wiring . Had to give it one star to publish the review which I can not review .
5 #### if it fits in the jaws it will cut it excellent tool
3 #### Based on some of the critical reviews , Black & Decker must have made design changes over the years . Some of the reviews are more than 12 years old . I bought an LE750 Edge Hog Electric Edger in 2015 and ordered this for a spare blade at the same time . It is exactly the same as the blade supplied on the edger . Some reviews seem to suggest that older blades and/or edgers had flats other shapes on the shaft , but that is no longer the case , In any case , if the blade or edger changed , it would behoove Black & Decker to make newer blades backward compatible with older edgers . The reason I only give 3 stars is the thickness of the blade . Prior to purchasing the Black & Decker edger I had a Craftsman for about 25 years , but it , and parts , are no longer available . The blade was much thinner on the Craftsman edger , and was made of very hard steel , resembling spring steel . It did not wear as fast as the B&D blade , and the spring - like steel alloy prevented breakage of the thin blade . The B&D blade is thick and makes about a 1/4 " ' trench ' along the edges where the Craftsman made a narrow cut that , to my eye , seemed neater . The B&D blade wears faster since it 's removing more soil and debris , especially along sidewalk and curb edges . As far as the blade being compatible with Black & Decker edgers , it should fit any LE750 Edge Hog .
5 #### So good somebody walked off with mine . Had to replace it . Have three for different homes . Key tip from a carpenter friend is to use same brand tape for all measurements .
5 #### 10 are a lifetime supply ( I hope ) as they never seem to break , just keep losing them , both to misplacement and to people who use them and want one of their own .
4 #### I have a GF Grill and love it when I want to cook something quick . It heats up very quickly , cooks evenly and without drying food out , but I caution people who think that cooking on the grill really reduces fat by a huge amount . As a lifelong " blotter " of fatty foods like hamburgers and bacon , I probably remove more grease and fat by patting a burger down with a few paper towels than drips off this grill in the cooking process . In short - buy it for the convenience and the quality of the product , but not as an excuse to pay less attention to the fat content in the foods you cook with it ! If you keep those things in mind , this is a good product for the relatively low price !
5 #### I love the flavor . I had some trouble with germination and rot , so I contacted this seller . They recommended the Easy Sprout Sprouter and I have n't had a bit of trouble since . I can sprout a half cup of seeds at a time with virtually no waste .
4 #### Seem to work , but I used paper spring clips to hold and add weight . But did work
3 #### Not easy to use . The cord is on the under side so you have to pick it up and hold it while you wind it . The cord is not long enough and the hose is a bit strange . BUT it works on hard wood floors and picks up everything . Plenty of suction .
4 #### Sturdy , heavy , and machined well . It 's easy to use . Mounting it to my bench was straight forward and only required one person , though two might have added some efficiency . Wish they had supplied a way to affix the bar - end caps - I ended up using some tiny wood screws , but it was n't as simple as it might have been had there been a pre - engineered method .
5 #### Fits my Weber Gold Series perfectly and helps know how hot grill is for cooking
5 #### I do really like this company 's router bits , they seem to stay sharp using them on pine and birch from Alaska
5 #### The handle is wonderful , very easy to hold , not to heavy , not to light . The blade is angled perfectly . Too small for a cake ( in my opinion , ) but perfect for cupcakes . Great buy .
5 #### Just got one of these today , it was my first time using one . I was looking at renting an edger but after looking at the price this would pay for itself after 2 uses . It did great , cut with minimal effort , work done fast . Assembly was a little tricky , the cords did not want to go into the handle to bolt it together . install the top section first then attach that to the bottom . Great clean cut . over all I wold HIGHLY recommend this edger
5 #### Love this ! Perfect cake results every time with Baker 's Joy spray with flour in the mix ! Even more perfect is the love of Jesus expressed in John 3:16 . Read it and be encouraged today !
5 #### Nice fit , durable , easy to put on big enough for a wicker chair , Reasonable priced
5 #### I have used this sander for near a year now and can say it is an excellent tool . The motor has plenty of power and variable speed dial makes for easy speed selection . I was initially worried that I would n't like this because I was used to a pressure speed switch , but once you get it dialed into your specific needs it works just fine . The only part I have had fail is the triangle backing pad . I almost exclusively use this in corners and the Velcro finally gave out . Pros : Plenty of power Easy to swap attachments Replacement sanding pads are cheap Cons : Exhaust ports are where normal hand placement is meaning your hands will likely get hot is extended use Overall an excellent sander . One year of heavy use has not killed it , hopefully it has many more years to come .
1 #### I have this same type from a different maker and when I saw this I had to have it . Purchased some at the end of last season and this season to be ready . Went to use them today and realized the clip that holds the bottom on to prevent all the contents from emptying , does not work . The clip does not have any tension on it to snap it in place . I went to check others and the same thing . So very disappointed .
5 #### Good looking plunger and works well . Yes , it does have an odor but not as awful as some reviewers state . Maybe they 're using a different rubber but no problems here .
3 #### Would not fit on my table saw saw dust port .
5 #### I just remodeled my bathroom and had alot of drywall dust to vacuum up after . These bags contained all of the dust and majority of odor . If you have a shop vac I would highly recommend this .
5 #### We bought this as a gift . Our friend is a popcorn lover and he said he uses it almost every other day . The price was very competitve and the popcorn maker works very well . He espically likes the flip over , easy serve cover / bowl .
5 #### great but do n't leave outside in winter or it may crack if there is water in it
2 #### Thought this would be squirrel - proof .... I was wrong ! Squirrels hang from it and chew out every last morsel they can get to . On the up side , it was inexpensive .
5 #### I love to bake cakes , so I 'm not sure why I waited so long to buy one of these . Works wonderfully , very easy to use and flexible . Highly recommend it !
5 #### no if ands or butts it does really work to keep the deer from destroying my trees
5 #### Great product arrived as described and fast shipping and excellent customer service ! ! ! !
5 #### Awesome . Works great for lifting up fond and making sauces .
5 #### I 've had this hydrofarm for nearly 2 months . I 'm currently keeping young venus flytraps , and pitcher plants under it . They are growing and venus is even flowering from the light . I 've grown at least 150 + separate seeds that have gone in pots together or etc . East & West Indie Grass , Lime basil , Lemon Basil,30 + types of flowers , Mint , Lavender , Mango , Avocado , 4 types of watermelons , Cilantro , Cactus , Sundew , and a ton of others , and more to come . My tallest plant from a seed is at least 2+feed since last month . I keep it next to a window for extra light as well . I bought a automatic timer for the light so it turns on at 6 in the morning till 10:30 at night . Just bought a heating pad with a dome from amazon , ca n't wait to see how fast they will grow in combination . I 'd consider a second one , Its a very nice clear light , good design , sturdy .
3 #### These fly traps works , infect they worked to good , I have all the neighbors flies , I do belive . I hung it near my front door , once the smell from the inside of the bag got hot with sun shining on it , this loud fishy smell came out of it , and I had so many flies until I through I was in the remaking of the Amityville Horror move , I 'm serious I had flies all over my house that bag could not contain them all , I had my son to come over and move them away from door , out by the trash bend and that 's where I left it .. I recommend this buy do n't put it too close too your doors .
4 #### my purpose was to stick it to indoor of my cabinet but it keeps falling . so now i have it in my stink .
5 #### This drill works great . I own two of them . I had bought one for myself , and then bought one for my dad . It has lots of torque to drill thru the toughest wood . And the handle makes it easy to hold on to .
5 #### Having read the reviews on this product , I was a little worried about the size of the unit and would it be too small for my large cables . Like others , I have long heavy battery cables . I took a chance , purchased two bags ( one for the truck , one for the car ) . Upon arrival ( good quick ship ) , I was pleased to see that I have ample room for my cable in these bags . I 'm seriously considering another bag for the large number of tie - down straps that are laying around behind the truck seat .... It would work perfectly ...
5 #### I use this habitually , every day in my shop and could n't imagine doing without it . When it 's misplaced , everything stops until i find it . Also makes a great pencil holder for the worktable or miter station !
5 #### I got lots of squirrels if anyone needs them . Works very well and they all survived the trip to town .
4 #### Very good hoses . This is one of those get what you pay for times . Buy cheap hoses you throw away after a year or 2 or just get these and be happy for long time .
3 #### These blades keep falling out of my saw so I ca n't truly rate them .
5 #### I purchased this little plane to be able to carry a small plane with me at all times when working in my shop or on an installation . I am truly impressed with how well it works ! This tiny plane works great !
3 #### its ok , but the tape is alot heavier then it looks , and the tape itself is of lower quality then the fat max version , i use this for working with 8x4 ply wood , and it works fine , but it wo n't last , most the other carpenters use fat max , but they do n't make a 12 foot fat max . but i do like that it as a pocket clip , where the 6 foot fat max i have is nice and light but it does nt have a pocket clip .
5 #### I found that this stand to be very stable for having three legs . I also found it to be easy to sit and work with . With the weaght of the saw it doe`s not move or is it easy to move if you want it in another area . Over all , I like it and would buy it again .
4 #### Wo n't catch all the sawdust , but catches an awful lot of it . Can be a bit tricky to put on , if you do n't have the table saw up off the ground , but not too serious . Bag is very large , which might or might not be a drawback for you ; on a upright table saw , this would be no problem
4 #### serves it 's purpose well . i like to go to Costco and buy their bulk chicken thighs and putting them on the rotisserie means i do n't have to watch them as much . as to non stick ........ i fill a five gallon bucket and let the thing soak . if you do n't clean it right away you are toast . on that note as with all grill baskets they are a pain to clean . i 'll buy the regular stainless next time and just use oven cleaner on it .
5 #### After trying to use the other kind of post hole clamshell digger , I had the opportunity to one like this and it makes digging a hole for fence posts a whole lot easier . We bought our own digger(this one)promptly . I highly recommend this for making all the holes you could want to make in your yard .
1 #### Husband / son loved this scoop . Claims to be dishwasher safe , though always took a long time to dry due to grooves in the handle . Then we realised that water was leaking inside the handle when it was in the dishwasher , and the liquid coming back out when draining had " interesting " food particles . Now I 'm looking for a one - piece metal scoop , even if it does have to be hand washed .
5 #### Great Blender . It does the job it was made for . Not overly priced .
5 #### Much cheaper than an espresso machine . Makes the richest most flavorful coffe ever !
5 #### Got this cooker about a month ago have n't stopped useing it yet do n't know how I got along without it for so long ... glad i did n't get an electric one I saw on QVC .
5 #### Good quality . I use it to turn my bug zapper on and off at night .
5 #### You add some water and it stinks . That attracts the flies . Put it in an area of our yard away from where you and the food will be . One the flies find it they stay away from your area . I love it . Lasts about a month . Pretty gross to dispose of but then flies are just gross anyway .
4 #### I 'm replacing the exact same dealiwhop that started to stick / not turn off after several years of use . Install was easy .
5 #### Effective , but do n't try to use it outdoors . That said , used properly indoors , the zapper is foolproof . Took less than a day to catch and eliminate the culprit . A little pricey , but better than old - fashioned traps .
5 #### The best pruner I ever purchased . Worked great and cut pretty thick apple branches with ease . It prunes and cuts , worth every penny !
1 #### Underpowered . This thing just does not perform . And now , after about a year of use , the cutting assembly is cracked . Replacement , with shipping , is about 1/3 the cost of a new blender . Here 's more junk for the land fill ! I replaced this blender with a Vita - Mix . It 's expensive , but it 's worth it ! Fast , powerful , and easy to clean .
1 #### Only gave this rating for the use for flies as it does not attract them at all .
4 #### I have many OXO utensils , and so far I have very few complaints . My previous whisk was a " dishwasher safe " stainless steel handle model - that fell apart after a few washings . This whisk seems very solid and well balanced - but I will probably hand wash it , just in case !
5 #### Could n't have asked for a nicer finish on the maple and other hardwoods I have run through it . Just do n't run painted boards through ; I knew better and did it anyway . Really dulls it up fast . Nice that they give you an extra set of blades and they are a snap to put on . Good machine !
5 #### Wow ... This little thing really shoots the spray up all over the trees . Much less work than a pump sprayer . Best replacement for the no longer made long nose Ortho tree sprayer .
5 #### Why in the world did I wait so long to buy this ? ? ? I have used the same old peeler for the last thirty years . It was quite dull and I just decided to get this one . Oh my gosh ! What a difference this one makes . You would n't think a peeler would make me so happy ! The little things really do make such a difference .
4 #### This is a fine , basic box fan . I do n't want the fan to be too quiet , and this one is n't . The low is low , and the high blocks out other noises . I use the fan both to move air into the house and to block out white noise , and this one does the trick . But it 's a basic box fan . There is no thermostat . The three modes are not particularly ' whisper quiet ' , as I 've heard other box fans quieter and less powerful . There 's a knob on the top with three speeds and two plastic feet to help keep it from falling over . That 's all . Which is exactly what I needed , for about the cheapest price I could find here on Amazon . It 's just not really what the description notes .
5 #### This hammock was very easy to put up . Just hook the hammock onto the Castaway L - STECWT Large Steel Hammock Stand - Taupe that we also purchased online . You can find us in our hammock any time the weather permits . Good product . Fits two people comfortably . Buy an oversized pillow to go with it and you will be in hammock heaven . We bought a Castaway B-3US Large Green Hammock Pillow to go with it .
5 #### We have used one of these for about ten years with great success . The tractor can even follow the hose around gentle 10 ' radius curves . The little ramp clips on the hose and has a folding ground spike to keep it from slipping . When the tractor reaches the ramp , it pushes a shut off valve on the belly of the tractor . Very simple and effective . Part of our ramp finally snapped off , but it still works . We 've never had a problem with the tractor . The adjstable spray wands allow you to regulate the size of the area covered . I suppose it can drag about forty feet of hose before it slows it down . That probably will vary depending on the depth and density of your turf and how straight the path is . You wo n't be disappointed ; this is a time - tested classic !
4 #### I have used the Farm Innovator C50 bird bath heaters for several seasons now . They work very well even into the teens in the typical cement bird baths with about 4 - 5 inch depth . In the REALLY cold weather they only keep a hole open about the size of the heater but that still gives the birds a place to get a drink ! They hold up well . The only thing I would like to see is a longer cord ( 1- 1 1/2 foot ? ) . This would allow the cord to hang over the side of the bird bath a bit more and still leave the heater well submerged . They do work quite well despite this " shortcoming " ( sorry about the pun ) . They are very well made .
5 #### This is one of the best items I have bought . Used as directed and my lettuce lasted for a week in the refrigerator . If I bought it again I would probably buy the small size as this one is rather large for my use and takes up a lot of refrigerator space . However it does what it is supposed to do and I do recommend it .
5 #### I hate kitchen mono - taskers as much as anyone , but I got tired of zesting citrus with our microplane ( for adult beverages ) ... This thing is way better and I wish I 'd bought it sooner .
2 #### I have found less expensive and higher quality products at stores nearby . The birds do n't seem to like it and I will be looking elsewhere for my next carton of suet .
4 #### This is a nice bowl . Stays steady on the counter . I see marks on the inside from a metal spoon I was using . Nothing to be alarmed about but I do n't use metal utensils with this bowl anymore .
5 #### very easy to use , and easy to get it , better than to go to home deport
4 #### a little smaller than what I thought it would be . great just the same . excellent quality . my mistake for not checking the size before ordering them .
5 #### Great tea ball . No worries about BPA or other weird things ruining your cup of tea .
5 #### Great for reading in bed when I am reading a traditional book as opposed to my Nook . It has good light and does not disturb my husband .
5 #### nice griddle , works fine and it 's not near as heavy as the cast iron ones . It cleans great to , so , a good buy
5 #### Light weight , but sturdy . I have the whole set , and bought this one for my mother who always comments on how much she likes the bowls when she uses them at my house . The set is a better deal but she already had one , and had requested the smaller one . Cleans up nicely .
2 #### Very sharp but only works towards me , not away from me . Very difficult to use .
5 #### My old edger needed a replacement blade - the old one was ok , but it was hard to push as I did the edging . I was also looking for a slightly longer blade . The new blade is about 3/4 " longer and really does a good job . It 's not sharp , which surprised me , but does a great job of cleaning out dirt and dead grass plus edging .
5 #### This is a well built teapot and it also works with my induction hot plate which is a bonus . the top os a little tight .
5 #### it does a very good job love it eazy to clean big bowl is wonderful can store salad in it
5 #### Handy for tomatoes and delicate skinned fruits / veggies . Cheap ! Nice quality for the price , I think you 'd be hard pressed to find better .
3 #### It helps to have the support for longer pieces , but it sags a little bit . I have NO IDEA what the notches are for , except to get trimmings hung up in it and in your way . But hey , it 's Chinese , so if it did n't cause us to take more time than necessary , well , they have n't accomplished anything while making commie products for " the enemy " .
2 #### It is too difficult to see how many tiny seeds are actually coming out of it .
5 #### These are awesome ! They are larger than a mini cupcake but smaller than a regular . Perfect size for a two bite cupcake . The pan is same great quality as its larger 6 pop over version and has same impeccable no stick finish . I made mini banana muffins and they turned out beautiful and good ! Easy to Clean .
5 #### What 's not to like about it . If you have an Edge Hog , you have to replace the blades as they wear out . I have a lot of sidewalk , which is what largely wears out the blade , so I usually have to buy one of these every other year .
5 #### Porter - Cable did a great job with this package . Everything you need is included , even safety glasses and the teflon tape ! The instructions are simple and very straight forward , which is great because this was my first ( and only ) compressor . So , details about draining the tank were very nice to know . The manual is quite clear on the steps to take when using the compressor and nailer ; starting , using and finishing . The compressor is light weight and easy to move around , which makes it simple to store out of the way and then bring it out when needed .
2 #### Yellow indented lettering poorly applied with black showing through so it 's not easy to read at a glance . Also the inch measurements do not line up with the beginning pivot point , so accuracy is compromised . Very cheap made in China item and I expected better quality from a Stanley brand product . I would return it but it 's not worth the hassle for me .
3 #### Overall , the light is bright enough to read at night . However , the battery cover is opened and closed by sliding , and held in place by two very small protruding pieces of plastic . These break very easily . Be careful when replacing the batteries .
5 #### Finally a stacked dado blade that does what it 's meant to do . I 've used several types of dado blades and I was never satisfied with either the cut , setup or quality . After reading the promos for the Freud SD606 & 608 , I plunked down the money to see for myself if it was worth it . Surprisingly , this dado set is worth the money for the serious woodworker who no longer wants to struggle with shims trying to get a snug fit , or the unattractive arc a wobble dado produces . The dado set comes with a large chart that shows which chippers to use for the desired width of the dado . The adjustment for fine tuning the dado also very easy . To explain it better , the following description is taken from the Freud website : " The Dial - A - Width Dado set performs like a stacked dado , but we have replaced the shims with a patented dial system and with our exclusive Dial hub , ensures accurate adjustments . Each click of the dial adjusts the blade by .004 " . The Dial - A - Width dado set is easy to use , and very precise " I 've used it to setup 3 different size dadoes and each time I needed only one adjustment after a test cut to get a snug and flat dado . There was no crosscut chipout on oak plywood . I must also add that the Freud SD606 6 - Inch Dial - A - Width Dado is pricey . However , the quality , accuracy and ease of use and setup offsets its cost .
5 #### I 've looked all over for tortilla shell pans , and found them on Amazon .. love them , they are perfect for making taco salad shells ... plan on getting more ! Thank you Amazon !
5 #### My daughter loves it she helps do the yard well she thinks she is helping me but she throws the leaves everywhere lol
5 #### I bought this as part of my DW618 router kit . I 'm a DIY , amateur level homeowner / hobbyist . Con : well , not a biggie , but the edger 's face was missing a set screw . I found a nice replacement at my local hardware store . As for the rest , I like this edger a lot : 2 sets of rods for attaching the edger to your router , the smaller , shorter rods thread into the larger set if you want a really big standoff . Previous negative comments about rods torquing and getting out of alignment when tightened down just do n't happen with mine . Setup is quick and simple : make a coarse setting using the rod set screws , then fine tune your distance with the guide 's ... ( drumroll ) ... fine tuning knob . Vacuum attachment is easily removed , I do n't like my clunky vac hose dragging along while I 'm edging ( personal quirk maybe ) . Edger face set screws use either a flat blade screwdriver , or a T-20 Torx bit ( nice ! ) , when adjusting the fence face ( wide or narrow , depending on what you 're edging or your particular bit ) . DeWalt seems to prefer Torx and Hex bits to screwdriver blades or Phillips , a feature I LIKE .
4 #### Thank goodness I have n't had to use it , but I 'm confident that it will work if I ever do need it .
4 #### For your JessEm table , or whoever 's they fit , these are necessary to keep your work stable . Period . All you need to know .
5 #### I love how the unsightly plunger is concealed in this nifty encasement . If it was n't I would n't have purchased it .
5 #### I have only had mine for 3 wks , but have used it daily . I did not level my ground , just picked a level spot . I did not use a ground cloth . Just set it up and got in . For 15 minutes a week I can balance chemicals and have sparkling clear water . The grandkids use it hard , and there have been no problems . I use it to cool off and relax after work . I am planning to get a bigger one next year and give this to my daughter . If I could give it 6 stars I would . We have never enjoyed something this much for so little money and work !
2 #### i had no luck with this . It is hard to get set and when you try to place it in the ground the trigger springs very easily causing you to have to reset it and try again and again . I also caught no moles i think primarily due to the locations i am trying to catch them . I do n't see any long straight runs like the directions and videos suggest as the place to put the trap . All i seem to have are short round paths ( which according to the videos are feeding hunting burrows ) i tried placing this in these locations with no luck . I am finding the P7901 mole chasers seem to be working much better . I have placed three of them and after about 10 days i no longer see any activity in the areas ( about 100 feet wide circle ) from these . Some people seem to have luck with these however so i guess it just depends on if you have the right mole runs to catch them in .
5 #### Excellent blade for the older DeWalt 9 " radial arm saws such as the 925 and MBF . Glass smooth crosscuts in hardwoods with no splintering or tear out on the bottom . For the 1/2 HP DeWalt MBC , the 8 " version might be a better choice , but for 3/4 " HP saws this blade works fine and given the scarcity of 9 " blades it 's impossible to beat .
5 #### I have arthritic hands and have difficulty peeling potatoes . This one works perfectly and makes the task easier on my hands . Also the peels do n't stack up on the peeler like others have done for me . Good solid feeling in hand .
5 #### I had read in a food article that this whisk was the best ... and now I see why . The handle is soft - perfect for long whipping sessions - like egg whites for royal icing . It also cleans off like a dream . I am happy with it .
4 #### I 'm a noob , but this stuff is hard to control . I have a nice mess to clean up . It sealed my door . Just sucks I have to go scrape it off now .
5 #### RAZOR sharp ! Make sure you use the blade protector when not in use . I got a severe cut to my finger when reaching into the drawer and running into it . But it does it job like no other peeler I had before !
4 #### It 's a great tool on a framing jobsite . It makes cutting 3X(1 cut ) and 6X(2 cuts ) very easy . The depth adjustment is a big plus as well . You can easily adjust for special notches and material thicknesses . The two drawbacks so far have been the lack of a ladder hook and the blade guard . The guard is shaped in such a way that it can sometimes get stuck on the material being cut . Overall I like picking up this saw to cut 6X material over the much heavier BigFoot .
5 #### Firm and solid grip . A little pricey but worth the extra money . Will cut through 1/2 to 5/8 inch material . Purchased with the felco F-919 Holster for belts . Perfect fit .
5 #### It really is common sense - if you are trying to keep something looking natural , USE something natural . The bottled chemicals , despite claims that they do n't hurt fish , do kill things you do n't want dead ! The key to affective barley bale use it to keep part of it on top of the water . It needs the air for proper decomposition . When it 's really working you should see white foam in your pond , like foam at the ocean where waves crash . It does n't help in one day , but over time , and establishes an ecosystem to invite amphibians to your pond . I have two ponds ; one about a thousand gallons and another about three thousand gallons ; both fed by pumps that let the water aerate over waterfalls . I tie the bales onto string and let them float . That way when they start to rot , I can easily pull them up by the string . I hide them by the pond under plants .
4 #### Bought this for oomur hand held rockwell saw , works great and serves its purpose , would definitely buy again
5 #### I use this timer for a low voltage electric fence in my backyard that keeps squirrels off of my corn feeder used to feed deer . I have to turn the electric fence off at night or the deer will not eat from it . Thus , this timer turns my fence off at 6:00 PM every day and turns it back on at 8:00 AM the next morning . Works perfectly and easy to program for that operation .
3 #### Maybe my imagination but it seems to make for healthier plants
1 #### Just did n't fit . Normally have some trouble finding gloves that fit because I have big hands . It 's not that these were the wrong size , but very poorly made . The ones that I recieved seemed to be factory seconds , or even thirds . Not an isolated instance , I bought two pairs right off , what 's the use of only one glove of a pair that fits . Not even close to being wearable the two middle figures are sized for children . Totally useless ... my fault for waiting too long to return them . I 'm out $ 25 bucks
3 #### The item has a good presentation and works fine in it 's mechanical dimension , but I expected to get less water over each leaf of lettuce . After 10 minutes of spinning the vegetables have a cover of tiny water drops that I wish this device could take out .
5 #### Easy to read , which is very helpful when cooking multiple things , and black and steel are current kitchen colors which looks good .
5 #### The spray wand seemed nice but unfortunately it did n't fit either of my sprayers so I had to return it . The return process went well so overall I 'm satisfied .
5 #### I have really used this easy to grip nice length fork a lot since it arrived . Since I cook in cast iron its can be used in the pan with with no fears of scratching . It has mixed up meatloaf with no bending of the tines , whipped eggs and mixed batters really endless uses . I am cutting down on my kitchen utensils , this study fork now stays in easy reach .
5 #### It is just the right size for the smaller baking jobs . I like that it stays put on the counter when I 'm using the electric hand mixer . The handle and pouring spout are a good bonus .
5 #### I use this with the tool whenever possible and it works great for drilling holes and cutting .
4 #### Great product . Works well when I do n't need to get out my huge mixer . Only wish it could go in the dishwasher . That ruins the whips . Overall I am very pleased .
5 #### works perfect . its a one for one replacement . I will buy another when I wear this one out
5 #### This is the old standard tape measure with a case that allows you to simply add 3 " for inside measurements - unlike the majority of tapes today that have oddball cases where you have to add 2 + 9/16 " or 3 + 5/8 " or some other off the wall measure . Plus because the back of the case is square ( not round or some other fancy shape ) you can more easily have a stable inside measure .
5 #### I SO LOVE THIS SWING ! MY 16 YEAR OLD SON STAINED AND SEALED IT AFTER MY HUSBAND PUT IT TOGETHER . THE HUSBAND HUNG IT AT THE WRONG ANGLE , SO WHEN HE WENT OUT OF TOWN , I FIXED THE ANGLE MYSELF ... LOVE IT . YOU WILL TOO . JUST BE SURE TO CHECK AND MAKE SURE OF THE ANGLE BEFORE YOU HANG IT . THE INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT CLEAR ON THIS MATTER .
5 #### I use these all the time since I make many cabinets in my home workshop .
5 #### It get the job done and it came with extra blade . Ca n't beat the price . Highly recommended for armature hobbies .
5 #### if you are familiar with the pro s line by henckels , you already know you are going to love this knife . if not , they are well made , well balanced , comfortable , and sharp knives ! i love the 6 " chef . i use mine every day , multiple times a day , and it 's one of the first knives i go to . it is definitely worth every penny . you will have it a lifetime ! you actually get really spoiled after using these knives , but you do n't realize it till you are using lesser quality knives at a friend 's kitchen ! buy it , you will love it .
1 #### I used this product to treat my approx . 1400 gallon fish pond , adding the appropriate amount daily over a 5 - 6 day period . I am sad to say that while my pond is n't any less clear , it 's certainly not any more clear . As expensive as this product is I was super disappointed by the results . I guess I 'll just keep searching for something that works :(
5 #### Dozens of doors -- it never fails . Handles all common backsets and diameters . Do order the smaller - diameter spade bits for the edge bore . The standard 1 " is a bit large for some lock fronts . 15/16 " and 7/8 " are available from boringjigs.com , Classic Engineering 's website . Also available : carbide bits for cross boring . The bits are actually driven by the drill via a quick disconnect adapter . You chuck up the adapter and then hook up to the bits , both of which have to mounted into the jig before you mount the jig onto the door . Get the adapter with the 1/2 " shaft . The 3/8 " shaft can do the job but there is a lot of torque cutting a 2 - 1/8 " lock bore and the 3/8 " adapter shaft can bend . The 1/2 " adapter shaft is very stout . This device works from the edge and one side . You do n't have to bore from both sides of the door . Also , bore the edge bore to full depth first . That way there is less material for the 2 - 1/8 " bit to remove and it goes faster . I like to use my 1/2 " Milwaukee Hole - Hawg drill . The two speeds and excellent power really go . High speed for the edge bore , low for the cross bore .
5 #### Works as designed , and the quality is very good . Ca n't complain . I would recommend this addition to anyone with a Explorer 2 burner camp chef stove
4 #### I think these are great blades , because I only been using the first one and it continues to keep on cutting time after time and not losing its edge . I 'm just a home - owner and not a contractor , so I ca n't attest how they will work in continuous operating , but for me in my usage they 're just great . Recommend .
4 #### I was glad to find this item on Amazon.com 's website . 1/4 " adaptors are so common but the sockets that use that drive only go up to about 1/2 " . Using this you can go up almost if not to 7/8 " which can be useful . Heck one day my dad and I were working in the basement of our house and he did n't have a 1/4 " adapter handy so WE got out this one and went to work . WHen I saw this I bought two one for him and one for myself .
5 #### Great clkck . Do n't have to worry about it keeping time . Looks nice .
5 #### I bought this to simply hook up to my dehumidifier for drainage . The hose is very thick , I had to cut it with a pair of tin snips . I do n't foresee any problems , works fine for me
5 #### This works very well . I like the non - slip bottom and the measuring lines inside the bowl . The handle is comfortable to hold . I was pleased that even with aggressive use of a hand held mixer , the sides did not scratch !
5 #### great quality , this super large set does stuff some smaller ones ca n't handle
5 #### < div id="video - block - R3UTE15A87ESP0 " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1C1KG2glvS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/71msplcEXKS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">These chimes are GORGEOUS . Not only are they beautiful to look at ( VERY large , beautiful copper / crimson color ) , their sound is just * perfect * . When I received them , I briefly flirted with the idea of finding a place for them in the house before I regained my sanity and put them outside . I just love them so much . We have these Neptune Chimes on our lanai , as well as a set of Westminster Chimes ( also by Woodstock ) , and the two are a lovely pair . The Neptune chimes are low and a little soft , but quite bright in sound . They are perfect for someone who wants a clear , low chime sound but does n't want anything * too * soft . They also chime liberally- not enough to make your neighbors hate you , but enough that the smallest of breezes will move them so soft chimes become the background music to your day . To me , they bring much serenity and peace . Just so beautiful . I 've uploaded a short video of my chimes ringing , so you can get a sense of the sound . I apologize for video quality- I used my iPhone for capture . You can also visit Woodstock 's website at woodstock DOT com to hear clear samples of all their chimes , so you can choose the best chime for you and your home . Enjoy !
4 #### We use this as way to hang out kids art and homework . Everyone that has seen it loves it . Note : Ours did n't come with screws . Fortunately we had some , otherwise my rating would be less for the hassle of trying to shop .
5 #### The best pan ever . Cakes literally fall out of this pan . Well worth the money
5 #### Can not believe the price for this 50 - pack as compared to local hardware store . Certainly wo n't need to buy more blades anytime soon . Great price and pleased with the quality .
5 #### I was needing a larger diameter hole base for the router and this one is nice . It not only allows for larger diameter bits but also allows me to view the work area . This is great even for working on inlays and close area work .
3 #### For the low price it is ok . The pump leaks and I am aware that the set may not last long .
3 #### these guys make great stuff . just about the most easy to use and comfortable stuff out there .
5 #### Great tool . very durable , really does a nice job . Had other models cheaply made , tines come off . this one is strong , no breakage , strips well .
5 #### As a new home owner with lawns full of weeds , I wanted to find an eco - friendly way to get rid of weeds . I bought the Weed Hound after reading the reviews here on Amazon . I have to say the Weed Hound is an ingenious device that is very effective in getting weeds out . Before I had the Weed Hound , I had to use a trowel and dig around the roots and pull out the weeds . This left 3 " to 4 " divots in my lawn . The Weed Hound did the same thing , but left only maybe a half inch divot , and was a lot easier on my back . I was easily able to pull out many Broadleaf Plantain weeds out completely with roots . My only complaint is that the device started jamming , and hitting it with my hand to unjam it started to hurt . This was after probably 1/2 hour of use . Despite this , I still was very impressed by the Weed Hound and recommend it as an eco - friendly alternative to chemical sprays . The Weed Hound is well worth the cost .
5 #### OMG what can I say except this is my favorite purchase ever . I really hope it annoys my neighbors because they never speak to me because these things really sound off in a little breeze because they are lightweight . It sounds like I live near a church
5 #### Works Great ! Allows for a complete flush . Had one before [ like 15 years ] but it broke and our Lowe 's no longer handles it .
2 #### Here 's a couple of things the pictures wo n't tell you : 1 ) The vise handle , track and pin and quite loose and plastic . Once you install the handles on the item you ca n't take them apart again as they are held in with pins you have to hammer in . 2 ) The area between the two ends on the vise planks opens only between 4 - 6 inches so you can only hold something that s between 4 - 6 inches wide 3 ) The alignment on mine was off by about 1/4 " which is a lot considering it 's supposed to double as a vise 4 ) Overall I 'd say this item is not really suitable for any kind of serious work . Might be good as a kid 's play thing
5 #### This is a great lamp timer which I have used for porch lights for years . It is easy to program and set via the inside current time dial while the outer dial is for the program pegs that turn on or off the internal switch . Nice unit for a nice price .
5 #### my squirrels eat this up . they love the corn best . I do n't know about the haters but this stuff works the squirrels love it they wait for me in the morning to bring food out to one day go nuts pardon the pun
4 #### saml is right . like 3 " long . it does work , but you need to tighter the clamp nut down with a pliers to ensure no blade slipping . perfect for small jobs .
5 #### It 's exactly what I needed and it looks good doing it 's job . It 's a great buy and well priced . I plan to buy another one as a spare
5 #### This bit is an absolute beast ! Used it to plane down acres of English oak , Tasmanian oak and some kind of Australian hardwood - of - doom that laid waste to my table saw blade . Used my router on a big rail jig for this job . It just went through it like it was butter - very satisfying ! It may finally be going a little dull but barely noticeable . I love Freud bits - a pleasure to use .
5 #### This is a wonderful bundt cake pan . I have been looking for a good one for several years . The last two I used did not work well . With this pan , the cake slides out easily . Just love baking with it . The cooling rack and cake pan cover work well also .
5 #### Works like a charm and the cast iron looks great .
5 #### well known brand name - comfortable handle grip - right sized . Price is great too .
5 #### Although this pan is thin , I love using it and my grandchildren adore the happy pancakes . I use a small amount of spray on cooking oil for the first batch but do n't add more ( unless I 'm making a double batch ) . I 've had no problem with sticking . I 've found that using two silicon spatulas makes turning the cakes very easy . I hand wash the pan because I suspect the dishwasher would cause the bottom of the pan to discolor . It washes up very easily too .
5 #### The perfect size to run through your garden as a cheaper version of a sprinkler system . Perfect size good quality very happy with the purchase . the price is nice too .
5 #### I just purchased 2 more of these because I loved the first nozzle so much . It 's high quality , & the selection of adjustments is perfect for any gardener . The heavy rubber exterior makes this very durable , & it does n't dent or ding when dropped on pavement . I also appreciate the fact that this has a 2 - way shut off . I love everything about this nozzle , & highly recommend !
5 #### Works perfect , turns outside street lights on and off at Dusk til dawn .
5 #### a high quality plier the best I have seen and used
2 #### I bought a set of straw bales last year that worked very well , deserving 5 stars . But my order this year is completely different . The bales are much looser , not densely packed like my 2015 order . The 2016 bales do not last even one third as long . I am very disappointed .
5 #### I like the unadorned simplicity of this one - piece pasta fork . No assembly required . It forks my pasta like it oughta !
4 #### The timer works fine , but time will tell . The biggest problem is a user overloading a timer . This one is rated a 1875 watts so hopefully it will handle the lights my wife connects to it . As long as she can stack another string in to an outlet , she thinks it is fine .
5 #### Contemplated on which router table to buy and ended up buying the bench dog . It will take you about 30 to 40 minutes to put this together and the instructions are good . The fence on this table is very robust , accurate , and easy to adjust quickly . I can make adjustments and square the fence up using a Swanson 's Speed Square in about 10 seconds . Saw dust collection works great with a standard shop vac and very little dust accumulates inside the cabinet . The MDF top is very durable , but easy to drill ( if needed ) and feather boards attach neatly also . The fit and finish of the bench , including the top quality plywood panels and door , is almost as nice as a fine piece of furniture :) Now , to quell a few myths ..... The cabinet does not amplify noise , it deadens it . Your router will not overheat in the cabinet either . If you 're going to run your router for longer periods of time , then it would be probably be a good idea to open the cabinet front door panel ocassionally . This table would be an awesome addition to your wood shop !
5 #### Have used these blades for 20 years with excellent results on my cabinet saw . Teeth remain sharp for long periods cutting oaks , cherry , maple , etc . I return my blades to Forrest for sharping .
5 #### The green just adds more of an aesthetic flair to it . I love it . I 've never had a problem with it , have had it for awhile . Oxo usually always stands behind their products , and pride themselves in making quality products in general . Though I 'm bias and am clearly an oxo junkie , I love this . I use it for herbs , salads , washing and drying fruits , veggies and even pasta . The rubber ring on the bottom of the bowl is probably my favorite part - I like it more than I thought I would . Would buy it again and again . It 's just made well .
5 #### These are by far the best loppers on the market . I ca n't find them in local stores so I bought 2 of them . I do n't want to be with - out a pair living on my 10 acres .
4 #### These are great pond filters . Well made and arrived in a timely fashion . Second one we have bought , first one lasted about 7 years of continuous use .
5 #### These are very small . However , they are perfect for cleaning up the small plastic yellow flowers on the feeders or the small openings that the birds drink from .
4 #### I was provided a Kembar 3 - Piece Silicone Spatula Set free for testing and review and was asked only to give my honest review , so this is what I found . What You Should Know Before You Buy : Attractive looking and nice quality silicone spatula set that worked well overall . Each spatula has a one piece style with a sturdy handle and silicone covering the entire spatula . There were essentially no seams . Has two different size standard shape Spatulas and a large Spoonula ( spatula / spoon combo ) . Silicone heads were safe to use with our T - Fal non - stick pans . Spatulas were fairly easy to clean , but scrambled eggs did stick a bit and had to be brushed for cleaning after sitting for an hour . Conclusion : Overall , this is a nice 3 - piece silicone spatula set . It has a nice style and a quality build . They were constructed to be a single piece for each spatula with silicone covering the entire utensil . I tested it out on various foods and they did quite a nice job . They worked well and cleaned up pretty easily , but did need a little scrubbing for some stuck on scrambled eggs that I used the spoonula for . I love a spoonula shaped spatula for eggs because it allows for scraping with the flat edge , but also allows for scooping out of the pan . If you are in the market for a nice set of silicone spatulas , this set performed nicely .
4 #### I was just looking for a basic thermometer / hygrometer , with fun colors , and numbers and dial big enough to see while in my pool . This just looked like one of those classic wall thermometers you see at community pools , and it is . The thermometer is to my surprise , quite accurate . The hygrometer was not , but I realized it could be manually " calibrated " , since there is access to the backside coil . After about four adjustments , the hygrometer has been within 5 % or so , which is perfectly fine . I 'm sure the thermometer could be adjusted in a similar manner , should it be off out of the box . The basic construction is exactly as it looks - cheap and light .
5 #### if this is not the best zapper I do not know what is , lowers the activity drastically
5 #### Splits wood easily and since the handle is n't wood it is forgiving if you miss the mark and hit the handle .
1 #### I have been using Fiskars Pruners for over ten years . My old ' anvil pruner ' was getting dull and I thought warn out so I purchased this one . The old one is all metal . The new one is of a plastic like material and boy was I disappointed when using it . I attempted to prune my black berry patch . Immediately , when I cut into a stem / stalk 1/2 " or bigger , I found that the " ratchet " feature was virtually worthless . It kept slipping and when it finally did work the blade thru , it failed to cut all the way thru leaving a portion of the stem between the blade and the Anvil . Then when cutting into anything over 1/4 " I found that the " anvil " blade did n't cut all the way thru the stem / stalk . Lastly , when the blade would n't cut thru the stem / stalk I would try to twist the handle to snap the remaining stem / stalk in to like I do with my older ones . However , the new Pruner simply allowed the blade to slide sideways preventing me from snapping the stem / stalk off . Overall a great design but the poorest of poor quality . This is supposed to be a pruner for larger , heavier cutting due to the ' ratchet ' design ! But , it 's pure junk ! Amazon immediately issued me a complete credit for my purchase price without any questions what so ever . Think they already knew something I did n't ?
5 #### I order the one sold by Amazon . It fits my 1 gallon Shop - Vac Micro Vac . The bag is white color and looks identical to the bag comes with my Micro Vac . The package says " Type A " with product # 90667 .
5 #### I have the big one at home and I am buying another one to use up here in the " country " . It is n't just a mixing bowl either - I rise dough in it ( yes , I use it for my sourdough too , plastic , if cared for properly , will not annoy your sourdough sponge . ) and I mix in it as well . It does n't make escape attempts during preps , it does n't hang on to smells , it is n't a temperamental , angry bowl with preferences and druthers . Now , about plastic bowls ; you should n't put them in the dishwasher or you 'll spoil the surface , you should n't chop nuts in them or you 'll leave places for germs to grow , and keep tomato sauce away from them or they will take on a color you wo n't like . To conclude I am ordering another one right now and I think this is a great product at a more than fair price . Just take decent care of it and you 'll have it forever . OXO is a winner with me !
5 #### This lamp attracted the bugs , as it should . Unfortunately the zapper did not work on my bug zapper , it was given to me and was well used . BUT ! ! ! ! The lamp worked GREAT .
2 #### Very disappointed ! Bought as a gift and had to purchase a different kind as this will be useless for anything more than a few feet away . Too much hassel to return it so I will just throw this in the glove box and probably never use it as the flashlight on my phone is ten times brighter .
5 #### I am very satisfied this set as it gives me all of the templates that I will be using in the near future It is a great variety to have on hand .
5 #### This is a superbly made drill . VSR is " Variable Speed Reversing " and the grip on the drill is great for large hands . I like the moveable front grip ; it rotates 360 degrees around and a simple twist of the handle loosens it allowing it to rotate . The chuck and chuck key are well made and overall , this is better than my Makita drills at less cost . Generously long cord . Tough drill .
1 #### I love Perky - Pet feeders , but they should be ashamed of themselves for selling this . They do not need artificial anything , especially food coloring ! All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil , and 1 part white sugar , let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool . If you are too lazy to do this , you should n't be feeding hummers . It only takes a few minutes , and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks . Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar , and small insects .
4 #### They work and it 's great that you can hang them up as the scent used to attract the flies is basicly a stench that seems to only get stronger over time . So hanging it as high or away from you as possible is really needed . But . the smell works at attracting the flies . * * * Warning - Some people will have a gag reflex from this smell . * * *
5 #### The best Bundt pan I have ever owned . Well worth the price , in fact I 'm thinking about buying a different patterned one . I have made 3 cakes so far and all have released beautifully .
1 #### Did n't work . My koi destroyed the bag and made a huge mess in the pond . By the way , you can get this at walmart about 50x more for only $ 7 ( huge bag ) at the Halloween department .
5 #### Excellent value / performance . Easy to assemble and strong . I 'm using it for a 180 lb bandsaw and it works great . Easy to move around and very stable . At this price , I highly recommended it .
5 #### A ton of baking goes on in our household and this bowl is a HUGE hit . The day in came in our door I have heard nothing but positive things about it . What we like : -They do n't call it " Good Grip " for nothin ! When you mix by hand or with a hand mixer , the bowl DOESN'T MOVE ! Best feature by far . -Pouring spout makes emptying liquid ingredients very easy . -Cleaning this bowl is a breeze . I swear there is a coating that makes even dried on messes come right off . No scrubbing . -Very good looking and fit well with our kitchen decor . The only annoying thing about these bowls is that they are not dishwasher safe . Not that big of a deal especially since they clean so well , but still if I had to give a critique it would be that . If you do a lot of baking OXO Good Grips are perfect .
5 #### This unit screws on to the front of the Dremel like a lot of Dremel accessories do . A touch of a little grease helps . Be careful though it is plastic and a little fragile
5 #### I could n't find one of these at any of the " big box stores " so I got it from here , which is better anyway since I probably would have paid more at the store I 'm sure . These wheels do n't wear down for a long time . I 've still got the original in my 500X and that 's after sharpening at least 100 bits many times over . In my opinion the grinding wheel is better than the machine itself , at least the 500X ( see my review for that if you wish ) .
5 #### It 's almost perfect , though . This sprinkler can be adjusted one of four ways . If you are looking at the sprinkler parallel to your feet , you can adjust it to the left or to the right . Or both . You can control how much you want it to oscillate each way , and that is extremely handy since I have to position it off - center in my yard . Additionally , you can adjust the width . This would be the distance the water would spray toward you or away from you . Unfortunately , this is an all - in - one setting . It would be great if those adjustments were separate , but I believe you can pay more to get that model . The fourth way you can adjust it is via the water pressure . This is an important one . When I first set one up , I turned the faucet all the way on and watered my whole neighborhood for about 15 minutes until I figured out that in order to get any water * in * my yard , I had to turn the water pressure down . My front yard is a very small area , so I have the water valve turned on less than a half inch . The back yard is larger , and I 'd say i have the valve turned on about a quarter of the way . I would say this purchase was a win for me .
5 #### Looks like the original . Good quality material . I can see my temperature now . Great fit . hope it will last for a couple of years .
5 #### I have the same exact life for over 10 years but the handle cracked a little bit so I ordered a new one I use it for everything and I love it
5 #### After shopping around for a nice - sized , sturdy , stainless steel mixing bowl , I finally decided on this one . It has a nice wide lip around the top edge for a good grip , a nice flat bottom for stability , and is much thicker than I thought it 'd be . I highly recommend this bowl .
5 #### Have n't had a chance to use the plunger honestly . But that 's good right ? The reason I bought it was to have a self contained , unobtrusive way of having this in the bathroom which does n't entail a mess on the bathroom floor when I do have to store it . It fits the bill for that .
5 #### I am so glad I bought this feeder ! We mounted it on the pole that came with it and within a day the squirrels were entertaining us with their antics . The bird feeder has weight - sensitive perches that close off the seed supply if a heavy bird or animal try to sit on it or , in the case of the squirrels , grab it from below or climb down on it from above . I have it set to the lightest weight . The squirrels climb the pole and reach for the perch , only to have the feed door slam down . They can scrounge a few little seeds but they ca n't break open the feeder and gorge themselves . It is so fun to watch them trying to figure out a way to get in ! ( They can see the seed through the glass ) . They try holding on with one paw and scratching at the glass , they try sitting on top and reaching down , and they try to sneak their heads up under the perch . No go . But good for a lot of laughs . The smaller birds feed easily . The big birds and squirrels clean up the ground . Finally , I love that this feeder holds so much seed at once . Nice feeder , lots of fun for everyone .
5 #### This folding picnic table is so convenient . When not in use , it folds up and we just lean it against the side of the house . It 's easy to open and close . It is also easy to clean . Highly recommend it .
5 #### These things are working very well for me . So much so that I think its creating my house as a hangout !
5 #### Well made , comfortable in your hand , especially when using a lot . We eat a lot of veggies , this was just what I needed . Does a great job quickly of getting your veggies clean .
5 #### Hey guys , you do n't even know , how many times this tool help me to improve my projects . Super easy to work with , helps to build nice and straight frames . If you are framer or builder contractor , this is tool for you !
5 #### I went to their website where I could preview listen to the various chimes . This set is so pleasant that I bought a second set for the front of my home . Between great quality and a good price , it 's a perfect compromise .
5 #### Great salad spinner . I have nothing but praise for this item . The brake is all right but I am never in that much of a hurry where I need to brake the spin . Just a nice little feature that most people never need .
5 #### Should wash all veggies from the supermarket , even if the bagged salads say they are pre - washed . This spinner does a great job . And , the outer bowl becomes your salad bowl . Very versatile .
5 #### This is a nice , large bowl . It is very sturdy and solidly made . This is n't cheap plastic construction . I like the spout for ease of pouring and the rubber grip as well . I recommend it .
4 #### Makes considerably better coffee compared to a drip coffee maker .
5 #### Outstanding filters for anyone who has a dust and/or animal dander / hair problem . These filters have reduced our allergy problems drastically since we started using them . It 's so nice to get a great price on them here , too , and have them delivered right to our door . How convenient .
5 #### Purchased this to use on the BBQ when I 'm smoking up my famous 3 lb meatloaf . Usually when I smoke a meatloaf I 'd use a disposable foil pan that I poked holes in for grease drainage , use once and throw away . With this item I 'll get good smoke penetration on the bottom , SIDES , and top of the loaf ! And of course , I 'll use this for many other things on the grill as well - I like the idea that I 'm not tossing things away after one use ! This item has a little " lip " on 3 sides , with one side without a lip . Item is not flimsy , it is a strong , well designed grill topper - NO SHARP EDGES . Yeah .... this is going to be a well - used item on my grill :) Peace , Love , and BBQ !
5 #### Love it - does it exactly what it 's supposed to .
5 #### I purchase two of these slotted spoons in order to replace two mismatched cheap ones that we had originally received as first home gifts . These spoons are used at the table when serving vegetables from the bowl . They look good , and as with most OXO products are well made . For cleanup I put them in the top rack of the dishwasher where they clean up fine . If you 're looking for a handsome serving spoon , these are the one 's for you !
5 #### Does the job perfectly ! And there 's lots of net to cover a big area ! Kept out the birds and frogs from my pond !
5 #### This is a pretty good hose hanger and it has the hidden storage for nozzles . It 's a good design and is easy to install . This is a good buy ! ! !
5 #### This diagonal cutter does a great job at cutting wires and removing fasteners . I use it to pull finish nails and staples on my remodeling jobs . It also works great at cutting wires when I am doing electrical work . It is a must have tool for a remodeler . Update 09 - 04 - 2013 : My Channellock 447 Curved Jaw Diagonal Cutting Plier is still going strong . It is one of the most used tool in my handyman tool bucket . It is a bit duller than it was when new but still does the job . If I lost it , I would buy the same one to replace it .
5 #### I have owned this same knife for 7 yrs . and my son has been envious all of that time . I bought this one for his birthday gift since he has been too lazy or cheap to get his own . I know he will love it because he loves using mine . This knife has very good balance , a comfortable handle , sharpens well and keeps the edge for a long time . Just great for chopping and slicing whatever foods you cook .
5 #### I ordered two of these , one for me and one for my daughter . We both love them ! They work really well , and the pump spinner takes alot less effort than a crank It 's large enough for a large salad - enough for a family .
1 #### We use this pan multiple times per week to cook beans . The pressure regulator has darkened and rusted and it no longer allows any steam to escape . This led to the rubber safety value popping last week , spraying our entire kitchen with boiling hot black bean juice . A lot of damage resulted from this incident . Without the regulator , steam escapes normally through the valve stem , it is not clogged . The regulator / valve opening must be defective . I tried scrubbing the regulator , no luck . It no longer allows steam to escape unless it is held in a tilted position . Be very careful when using this pan , always make sure steam is venting properly .
2 #### suction is great , but no beater power . should have spent more for a higher end unit .
3 #### I 've used this product for years . This one is a liquid . Much more difficult than the granular product I 'm used too . I applied this to my Roses and Mandevillea several days ago , and I 'm still waiting for the insecticide to kill the aphids . Daytime temps are in the mid 70 's , so it should work soon .
4 #### Our hummingbirds seem to like this , but have heard that red dye feed is bad for the birds ?
5 #### I have a Paslode frame nailer and have gone through a few batteries they seem to crack around the top of the battery which makes them bad and unserviceable . But got to have them to use the nail gun .
4 #### i installed these on a low - voltage recessed lighting system in my kitchen , on a Lutron Maestro MAELV switch . Dimming works well , there is no audible buzzing at all . Color is warm and comparable to the halogen bulbs that I replaced with these LEDs . Only issue is that 3 of the 10 bulbs had metal pins that were slightly too short , and would n't lock into place firmly in the fixture , so they could n't be used . The other 7 in the package were fine .
5 #### This popcorn maker was exactly what I was looking for ! It pops corn quickly and is extremely easy to use . I guess the biggest drawback for me is that the instructions recommend hand washing the bowl and the other parts inside . I would really love to put it in the dishwasher , but do n't want to ruin it so I 've been hand washing it every time . Other than that , I use organic coconut oil just because it 's supposed to be better for you than other oils . I use the same recommended quantities and it never burns or sticks . Sometimes a kernel gets stuck under the rotating arm , but the popcorn maker is smart enough to recognize that and start turning the opposite direction so that the nonstick surface does n't get scratched up . Love this popcorn maker and have been using it probably ever other day or so for 3 months now . Still works great and the nonstick surface is n't scratched as other reviews have stated . Not sure if they 've updated their materials or something , but I have n't had any issues ! ( yet ) Hope this helps ! Enjoy !
5 #### I purchased our 2 - person Pawley 's Island hammock and hammock stand about 17 years ago . We 've used it consistently and stored the hammock during the winter , while leaving the hammock stand to the elements in Michigan . It still is a great hammock and now I 'm buying a replacement from the same company . Highly recommended . Excellent quality .
5 #### It could n't have worked out any better I 'm satified.it worked quite well for the 5hp motor for my chipper . I did n't look any further go amazon .
5 #### A very strong clamp . I bought this to install on home - made jig I made to obtain a straight line on lumber with excessive crowns . Works Well .
4 #### Cheap as hell feeling , this might be a harbor freight special . Only good after 3 - 4 uses and throw it away . I 've only used these once so only time will tell .
4 #### I live in Florida : home of many bugs . This is safe for my pets and does a decent job of convincing ants to either go away or die ...
3 #### an ok planerbut not as good as dansk . cheese is thicker and does n't cut all cheese as easily as the dansk
5 #### Good and solid . Works well and easy to clean . great for larger items like wood spoons too . Also dishwasher safe .
5 #### Great sprayer . Do n't waste your money on some plastic piece of crap . Buy a metal Chapin and you will love it .
5 #### I have tried every possible kind of can opener and they all , for better or worse , ca n't compete with this one . The handles are comfortable to grip ( as with many OXO products ) , the opener sticks to the can while turning , and the blade makes a clean cut all the way around . Even the turner is large and comfortable so it does not dig into your hand while opening the can . So effective and comfortable , even my young kids can use it . Also , it can be washed int he dishwasher ! No more grimy grubby openers which can never get properly cleaned by handwashing . A must - have int he kitchen .
5 #### Bought this for my DeWalt 7790 RAS because I wanted the extra depth of cut with a 12 " blade . Hard finding a good 12 " affordable blade with a 5/8 center as this blade has a 1 " center I got the Freud BL7MCE9 1 " to 5/8 " bushing . Cuts and works perfect in my 7790 with no noticeable vibrations / wobble that I can tell . I may get another in the future for my miter saw .
5 #### My old one died and I needed a replacement . I found it at a local garden shop and bought it . When I found out it was $ 11 less on Amazon I returned the local one . I try to support local businesses as much as possible but 25 % more ? ? ! ! I do n't think so . It 's a great way to keep trees healthy here in dry , hot - summer Colorado . What 's weird is the feeder cartridges are cheaper locally .
5 #### I 've used bug zappers for years , I do n't let them burn 24/7 and have learned that I can disrupt the breeding of some insects by using it for three days a month , a couple months out of the year . They are indiscriminate killers and will take out many beneficial bugs when used incorrectly . Once you learn when to turn them on , or notice a hatch of gnats they work well . They will not attract blood suckers without bait . I 've found that cash works best , sorry bad joke . For blood suckers there are better environmental options but nothing in this price range .
5 #### Pretty happy with this cover . My main problem is a tree that overhangs pool . Leaves fall in often in mass . This cover makes it easy to keep them out . Fits easily over inflated portion and is easily put on by one person , inside or outside of pool . We will see how it holds up to summer sun .
3 #### It prevent algae so well that algae grows on it lol . My pond does not have alot of algae , but if Barley is to prevent algae , and algae grows on it , then it not much of a prevention at all lol Just found it funny . Anyway , wo n't not recommend . lol
5 #### I researched ( too much ) be fore buying this saw . Was considering the top ranked Milwaukee also . Ultimately , this saw has better adjust - ability , and is the only saw where you can adjust the shoe plate to parallel with the blade . I do furniture building and need a precise saw . Unlike some models , it has an extra long and square - edged plate for following straight edge guides . I found out that even USA based DeWalt recently switched to making their tools in China . Milwaukee is actually Chinese owned . With its aluminium base , this saw is best for furniture work I think . DeWalt has Nylon and Manganese base plates for more durable use cases .
1 #### Do n't bother . Bought them for Christmas lights but did n't last two years . Stored inside most of the year . And we did n't put lights up last year so we only got to use them for a month .
5 #### I absolutely love this chime . I enjoy the deeper sounds as opposed to the high pitched tinkling sounds . I though a chime would drive me batty while we were outside in the pool , but this is so soothing with such a clear relaxing sound . We also have the Woodstock Bamboo chime outside with this one and I enjoy the combined sounds . Even my twelve year old commented that it sounds like a song .
5 #### We use these at work to seal panels to airplanes . If you just squeeze and hold the trigger down you will make an awful mess . Pump the trigger a little at a time and this thing will sing ( seal ) for you . We use sealant 10 times more messy than rtv ( caulk ) . so messes are ugly . If people hate this gun then they do n't know how to use it properly .
5 #### Yup , just a cheap little timer for your hot water heater that seems to work forever . Does what its supposed to do and does it reliably . I recently replaced my on - demand heaters ( Bosch units that developed leaks ) with solar / tank heaters and added these into the loop . Only downside is that the On / Off switch on front does not override the timer . In other words , turning it to ' OFF ' today means that tomorrow when the timer reaches its turn - on , it turns on . I 'd prefer it just stayed off since the solar part of my hot water system works fine in the summer ... but it 's probably the way everyone else would want it to work and provides a nice visual indicator of where the timer is in the On / Off cycle . As far as money goes , I can actually monitor how much money I spend on hot water each day in this house and can report that this unit saves me 30 to 60 cents daily . That 's a payback of a few months - easy to justify . I 'm also of the belief that it might help the heater last longer but , no way to know that for sure . In the end , just nice to have hot water when you need it and know you 're not wasting your money the rest of the time .
1 #### These units are a joke ! A bad joke ! I have spent about $ 30 per mosquito trapped ( actually more ) . When the starter button came out , they offered to let me increase my investment to fix it . Run away and talk to a pest control firm . This was a huge mistake . I live in Tulsa , Oklahoma . Basically the unit does n't catch anything and it cost a tank of propane and a strip of octenol every month . Do the math . This is a scam .
5 #### I have used this model for years and it has always served me well . If I try to pry anything to heavy it will flex but not bend .
5 #### Love Weber kettles . They are the ONLY way to grill !
4 #### I bought it to save since and my impression was it would lay flat . It does n't . It 's still a great gater , very sturdy and pretty compact , but I expect OXO to be perfect always , so I 'm a tad disappointed this time .
5 #### I 'm still using Klein tools that I bought 47 years ago . Klein tools are high quality tools , made in the U.S.A.
5 #### This is a great trim hammer . Too light for framing .
3 #### I have this seed in one feeder and different sunflower seed in another . The birds do n't seem to enjoy this seed for some reason . I probably wo n't buy it again .
5 #### Great price for 2 Delta blades . These are good blades .
5 #### My son has n't used it yet but it looks like it is of very nice quality .
5 #### Excellent product ! My second one , the last one has lasted me well over 10 years and is still very functional . Purchased this one for another property .
5 #### This size blade difficult to find in big box stores . Pleased to obtain from Amazon . Blade is high quality and cuts smoothly . Would recommend
1 #### This , and the 27186 ( same receiver unit ) , have the same problem with lights going on and off at will . It 's real fun to have this happen at 3 am when you 're trying to sleep . The receiver is very susceptible to RF interference , which is what makes the thing go bonkers . There was no way I was going to take down the fan to muck with the channel settings , I just pulled the darn thing out and returned it . I replaced the remote with a Hampton Bay model that we 've used for years in another fan without any issues . The HB remote in the same fan I previously installed the Hunter in now works with ZERO problems , no more lights going on and off . Fit better in the canopy as well .
1 #### Less than a year old and one light socket has already failed . Initially it would go in and out depending on how you aim it , not it has failed completely . Light was mounted under the eave of my garage , well protected from rain and sun . Seems to be an internal wiring problem . I will be ordering a different brand .
5 #### rec;d one of these as a gift a while back - kinda laughed at it and thought maybe it was a sorta gag - gift or novelty item because I 'm a handyman . Well - turns out I really like it . I put it to use at home to hold a small tool kit ( couple screwdrivers , pliers , even a mini hammer ) . My family and I have really grown to rely on it because i can put those commonly needed tools right where we need them . Used a stray coffee cup that my wife would n't miss . Example - we have four kids and all their electronic / motorized toys require a screwdriver to open the battery compartment ! Well - this mug tool kit sits right next to the batteries in our utility closet . I ve since purchased more as gifts ( and one my desk at work ) . Reasonable price too .
2 #### Does not knock down flies on horses . I mixed normal strength , then double strength in a spray bottle for horses . The flies came right back .
3 #### It is messy in standing water but there a less mosquitoes in the area . I 'm still evaluating its total effectiveness
5 #### i have an omega juicer and if you know about juicers , the coldpress ones leave a ton of pulp which i do n't like . i got this just to strain my juicers and it works so much better than those cheap ones . the trick is to tap it on the sides not press on the pulp . never touch the pulp and you 'll have a super smooth juice . yum !
4 #### Basically , the same as the ' The Boss ' , model number 3670E , except it uses 3 AMPs more , and is less durable . The noise level is about the same , noisy . The bare floor brush width is shorter by about 1.5 " , from the one supplied with model number 3670E , which is no longer marketed . The hose material is thinner , and less durable . The suction is strong . After just 1 year 5 months , the power switch cover broke off , after a depression .
5 #### Parts all fit and fully restored function to my old sprayer . Easier and cheaper than going to the big box store and getting a new sprayer .
4 #### Works well , made well , has lasted well . Decent price and cleans up good not much else to say I would recommend .
5 #### Bought this from my grandma in the Caribbean so she does n't have to use a kitchen knife to peel her fruits and veggies and waste good meat from her fruits . She love it . It no . Slip grip is great and it peels smoothly .
5 #### OXO all around ( I have found out ) has excellent equipment . The rubber handle is perfect for whipping up food . I really like the perfect size of it too .
4 #### The new design is much better than the old one I replaced . It stores better and seem to fit more salad in the spinner .
5 #### Strong holder & I also use a twisty in case Mr squirrel decides to carry it away .. yes I saw this once ... thus secure on your branch .
5 #### So chic ! Tres bien We use this can opener for when we are n't using the full can . The opener separates the lid in a way that the lid can be pressed back on if you 're not using all of the food . Very easy to operate . I can honestly say it 's one of those tools where it is a pleasure to use .
3 #### It was what I needed but is a little too heavy .
4 #### This is a nice hose , way better than the one that came with my Ridgid vacuum . The attachments are just OK - you really have to shove them into the rubber end on the hose to get them to fit in tight enough that they wo n't fall off . The hose is very flexible and works great . Very convenient in the garage , you do n't have to constantly move the vacuum around to clean out your car . In my opinion it is too expensive , but I bought it anyways due to a detailer recommending it on Youtube and all the good reviews . I 'll remember the quality after I forget about the price .
1 #### Arrived with gross black streaks that wo n't scrub off and residual gobs of some kind of glue on some of the parts . I really do n't want to drink anything that comes out of this . I 've really enjoyed all of Bialetti 's more expensive products , but this is so cheap and nasty it should n't exist .
5 #### Worked without a problem and I made my cookies ! :)
4 #### Functions as advertised , but leaks small amounts of tea into the bottom of my cup .
5 #### A must buy very sharp it does the job If not sure check out YouTube videos
5 #### Exactly what I was looking for ! Well made and NO string !
5 #### IF YOU WANT A PERFECT CUT , LASTING TOOL . GO WITH FREUD , I HAVE TRIED LOTS OF " THE BEST " CUTTERS , BUT FREUD I HAVE TO SAY THAT THEY ARE THE ONE THAT DO THE JOB . I USED THIS ON MAPLE AND THEY JUST CUT AWAY WITHOUT CHIPPING , BURNING AND USED AGAINST THE GRAIN THEY YOU KNOW WAHT YOU ..
5 #### They catch literally hundreds of flies in just a few weeks . I swear by these . The flies creep in , but ca nt get out . After a few weeks , that WHOLE JAR IS PACKED WITH DEAD FLIES . These are awesome .
3 #### Feels pretty small in my hand . I 'd rather find a larger tool . It does work as expected
5 #### The quality of the cut is fantastic , especially on the large MDF base and crown molding I install with 12 miter saw . In addition the coating on the blade is excellent and has has not rusted despite being left on the job site for weeks at a time . The blade is also very stable and allows accurate compound miter cuts .
5 #### I love this flat whisk ! It works so much better than my full round whisk . I will never use any other kind . It mixes & blends better than any other whisk I have ever used in the past . Plus , this flat whisk is so much easier to store in a drawer !
5 #### What are these made from to be so expensive ? ? ? Okay , we got one and it is very nice and we have no regrets . Consider the materials as they say , since the natural fiber will decay . We got the synthetic and it is as soft as cotton , so do it . Very nice , and you should buy one . Bigger is better .
4 #### So far so good . Seems a little heavy in corn , but the squirrel 's have not filed a complaint .
5 #### The BEST birdbath heater ever ! This heater kept the water from freezing when the windchill was 25 below ! I have a rather shallow , traditional cement birdbath , and the water never froze . I highly recommend this ! I just bought another one , just in case ! My birds are happy .
5 #### I am using this to be able to connect my shop vac to the dust collection port on the table saw . I fits into the shop vac just fine , but like others have said , the 4 inch side is the same size as the dust port on the tool . Obviously this is meant to to the reverse of what I am trying to do here : getting a dust collection system into a 2 1/2 inch port . I just grabbed a little PVC and epoxy from the store and made it work .
4 #### I bought these when my son took my Colander home with him complaining that one cost over $ 20 at the store . They store easier than my old one did and the different sizes makes them more convient
1 #### I had been using the eletronic verion but this was advertidsed with more range so i bought two . i wish i had a picture the mole dug right up to it and around it !
3 #### The jury is still out as to whether this product really works on clearing up the dreaded string algae ( Spirogyra , just like the jazz band ) in a pond . Some years they work , some years they do n't . It seems like with a particularly rainy year , the algae is worse and I have a feeling this is because the algae 's spores are carried in the actual rain droplets , so if you keep getting rain , you keep getting spores . I think it helps a bit and I 'll keep using it anyway , but next spring will look into SAB Stream & Pond Clean , which uses beneficial bacteria to reduce the algae .
3 #### I really do like this light , but more so in theory . I bought another similar one that is rechargeable & if this one was rechargeable I would give it 5 stars . But the batteries only last so long . I love the brightness of it when it has new batteries because it 's wonderfully bright for working on hard to se projects or doing artwork . I also love how flexible it is for manipulating to whatever angle you need & that it clips on to things . But it goes through the batteries way too fast & therefore making it rather impractical . the blue color is really a teal , but that was fine with me , the color is pretty .
5 #### great , ca n't say enough good about this item . i use it all the time now and i do n't know how i got by without it .
4 #### I am happy I got this for trimming down a door to fit its frame . It was a slow process ( it took maybe 1 - 2 hours ) but much faster than using a dremmel and fairly cheap .
3 #### it is an interstate branded battery but it works fine so far , by the way love the maglite rechargeable flashlight
5 #### This Intermatic product is a very reliable mechanical timer . I have purchased 2 for bathroom fans . I have used these in the past with long - term , problem - free use .
5 #### SAFETY FIRST - The perfect mate to go with my Werner 16 Footer . WERNER LADDERS JUSTIFY THE HIGHER COST BY BEING STEADIER THAN MOST LADDERS . A PRIME EXAMPLE OF YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR .
4 #### It 's helping me to attract Oriels in to the garden in late spring .
4 #### Taking a sample of dirt is the hardest part of doing the test . The results are fact finding , , need to retest , to make sure the first test was positive .. come next spring .
5 #### Paslode has been making cordless framing guns for over 20 years and they 're still the best . this cordless nailer is still more powerful than the Hitachi or the Max . it 's more trouble to use both a battery and a fuel cell , than just a fuel cell , ( as with the Hitachi or the Max ) , but the power is worth it . also , if you live above 5000 feet above sea level , you 'll need Paslode 's high - altitude fuel cells ; ( at high altitude , there 's less oxygen , which affects combustion ) . i really like the feel and lightness of the Hitachi , but i still prefer this one .
1 #### Only because they do n't allow zero stars ! Tried a similar model , once and once only . It took 3 months for the slices in three fingers to heal up completely , and the slicer was thrown out . Should 've known better . Either get a Japanese model , like the chef says , or get a nice KitchenAid Mixer and Attachment Set , frequently on sale , and less expensive than the Emergency Room visit and/or the doctors ...
4 #### It does the job and my grandkids love it . They like to watch it popping . I would not have to store this bulky thing in my counter , it is not that pretty .
5 #### I 've used this bee and wasp killer before it really works . If spayed exactly on the Little kritters it kills them instantly . We also had some borring instects along our outdoor fish tanks just spray into the creave begone . I love this product and highly recommend buying to all looking for a perfect insect begonew
5 #### The two way swivel is great , and makes me very happy to own this peeler . Very happy with the way it handles and how well it works .
5 #### I like the handle on this whisk , it is protected on the whisk end by plastic so no water will get in there when washing . I 've had other whisks rust .
5 #### I love this spinner ! it is sturdy and easy to use :)
4 #### It helps my motor skills for crafting a lots with angle drill , cut , file and engraving miniature project . It 's great .
5 #### This gel seems to give me the best results so I keep using it .
3 #### I wish this was as effective as the fly trap but it has not been so far .
5 #### Very powerful suction , does the job well . It is NOT a * telescoping * wand . It 's just two shorter extensions , and all friction fits . This means that the extension assembly falls apart on a pretty regular basis , which is loud and annoying but not the end of the world . I bought a different , telescoping wand to replace it . Also bought a different floor brush based on other reviews , and I 'm glad I did . The one that comes with it is cheap and stiff and has almost no padding for use on hardwood floors . The thing that attaches to the hose ( that you hold when vacuuming ) has a crook in it that can get clogged fairly easily . I 've learned to always check the whole hose and assembly for clogs before assuming that the bag needs to be replaced . Really lightweight , which is great . The cord - wrapping mechanism is pretty much useless ; I just coil up the cord and leave it next to the vacuum . Yes , it 's loud . My cats do n't like it . But they contribute plenty to the messes I have to clean up with it . Overall , I 'm very happy with it . For the low price , I do n't mind having to replace the accessories , given that the vacuum itself is very good .
4 #### I make TV programs so I am somewhat visually oriented but the illustrations that were used as assembly instructions left a bit to be desired . If they had simply accompanied them with English I would not have had to assemble and disassemble it several times . Otherwise the gadget works just great and I love the propane starter . No more messy starter fluid and it is very fast .
4 #### I love this hammock , it 's beautiful , feels nice and is very comfortable to lie on . My first one lasted me 5 years until eventually , attacked by squirrels and the weather , it had to be replaced . The second one suffered a snapped cord right at the place where the rope goes through the wood . However , Pawley 's were easy to deal with and they exchanged the broken one for a new one , whole process took less than 3 weeks . I hope this one lasts longer !
4 #### I like these but I get confused on if I pull or push and I 'm pulling and pushing to open and close them all the time .
2 #### This did work to keep the deer away , until the natural vegetation dried up and all that was left to eat were my flowers . By then all my flowers were in full bloom . I think I got to witness the blooms for about a week before they were eaten . I had such high hopes , now very disappointed that this product did not continue to detour them . I 'm sorry I wasted my money on this product and all of the flower plants I bought . Maybe in a wetter greener area this product would work , where the deer had other green plants to eat year round .
5 #### ... who needs to leave home anymore? ... work from home and we love our home ... do not like to venture out to go buy little bits or large bits ... Amazon is making life a lot easier ... even our UPS drive is a Amazon Prime member ... ha ! ...
5 #### We use this vegetable brush daily . We bought it several years ago and it is still in great shape today ! With all of the stuff that is sprayed on veggies these days , using this makes me feel much better about the food I am feeding my family . It is very comfortable in the hand and is small enough to sit next to the sink and not take up a lot of valuable kitchen space .
5 #### Turns out that this thing is a perfect 90 - degree right angle . Awesome
3 #### The opening was not good - so it was hard to get staff out of the bottle . May be I did not use it regularly enough , but I did not notice any change in the mosquito amount around the house .
5 #### Quite amazing product . I added 3/4 " pipe extentions and bored an irrigation water well by my garden ......... got to 21 feet down then the rock stopped me cold .
5 #### Great addition to my Dremel collection . Very easy to lose some of these essential little bits . I am very happy to have a good supply .
5 #### I got this as a just in case , everyone should have at least one kinda deal . Ca n't say I fired it off and it saved the day but it fits perfectly under the sink ready to go . Box was beat up real bad when i got it , but quality packaging kept it in perfect condition .
5 #### The measuring spoons are not something new by any means , but OXO has made them better by adding neat features like ; rubber on the handle of each spoon , brightly colored markings , and easy removing of a single measuring spoon by snapping one off . This means no more opening a ring to remove a cup , or washing all the cups because you need to use one and got another dirty ; and you wo n't loose them because they fasten securely back to the ring . These are also dishwasher safe . The price of these are a little more than the plastic ones you get in the store , but you are getting a lifetime warranty on the product .
4 #### My son bought a salad spinner recently and was bragging about it that how it has made so easy to dry the lettuce and other fruits and vegetables . His is a small one . I try to eat lots of salad for lunch and this salad spinner has made it so much easier . I just put washed lettuce , spinach or Kale ; whatever I am using in the basket and spin them . They are not very dry , but there is no water on them and I can easily use them . I also put washed cut up vegetables to dry in there too . It is made up of good quality plastic and is a good big size . It will be very handy if you are having a big gathering and will be making large batches of salad . No more kitchen towel or paper towel to dry your greens or vegies . I like the green color also ; it is so refreshing and makes you want to have a salad . The bowl can be used for washing or soaking as well . It is very steady and the bowl does nt move while spinning . All is all it is a useful gadget to have . I received this salad spinner for free for my honest opinion .
5 #### Best garden hose I have purchased . Will never have to purchase another hose again , unless I desire another lifetime hose .
4 #### So far so good ! it has held up well after several uses .
5 #### I can not explain the hours of fun my roommate and I have with our magnetic words . After a bit of wine , the creativity really flows !
3 #### I have been using Mighty Mite Canisters for more than two decades . THIS one has some problems . As others have said , the Floor Attachment DOES fall off during use sometimes , but even worse , my floors have been scuffed by it . It looks like a classroom of children has used my laminate as a gym floor . Now when I " mop " the laminate , I have to follow myself with a magic eraser to clean the scuff marks the vacuum made . I called Eureka directly , and they said , " Return it to Amazon if you do n't like it " . I called Amazon to explain that the problem was with the attachment , not the vacuum itself , and Amazon was kind enough to issue me a $ 12 credit to go towards a universal head to replace the scuffer . AMAZON ROCKS . Eureka Vacuums ? Not so much anymore ...
5 #### The first time we got this was four years ago to keep Blue Herons out of our pond . It is a mesh that does not block the view of our pond and fish . It lasted four years .
5 #### As a roofer this is the best flat bar I have ever used . I lost this one a while back and bought another one but after 2 weeks I ca n't stand the feel of the others and have ordered another one . i will be more careful not to lose it again !
5 #### I threw this in my briefcase for emergency use . Small and strong . Perfect .
5 #### So far so good . Been using often for a month now . Still in great condition , sharp , and works well for trimming
5 #### < div id="video - block - R3SXKIAOY9Q5JQ " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / D16H6kuwVoS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/71a0qLqb3HS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;My husband and I have both used wooden axes and steel axes , this just blows all of them away ! There is just no comparing this axe to any of the traditional ones because Fiskars has taken chopping wood to a whole new level . They have redeveloped the axe head to make it not only chop through the wood , but also made it so the head does not get stuck in the wood . The shaft has been designed to become one unit with the head of the axe . There are just so many great features to this axe that there are too many to list , so we made a video ! Matt shows this axe in action as he swings at a tree . We absolutely love this axe and are very glad we got it . Hope this video helps you out !
5 #### I bought this auger based on reviews here . It worked like a charm ! I used a one man powered auger to dig some holes and , honestly , this tool was just as easy to operate . Does n't do well with large roots , but neither does anything else ! Highly recommended ! ! !
5 #### I love them , they keep my drinks cold for longer than I would expect . Even if I leave my drink in my hot truck it is still cool .I will be buying more !
2 #### Not made to cook Indian meals , buy other brand of pressure cooker for Indian cooking .
3 #### I was expecting a black hose as pictured but received a green metallic colored one instead . Yet overall build quality it fits the bill .
4 #### Using this bulb for 6 months now and have as good results as the more expensive bulbs . Still going strong might change it next harvest 2 more months . Dropped a star because it does not have as much Blue added to it like i have seen before . I have some " T5 " 2 foot fixtures with 6500 k bulbs along the sides of the plant to add some Blue color and more Energy to the plants . Blue light has more energy than Red light but the plants like the Red during Flowering BUT they still want some blue too(3to1 ) . Also added a 300 watt LED grow lite to Add some lumens without more Heat that also has a lot of Red . 750 watts total with no ventalation system ( 1 Fan pointed right at the bulb from below ) in a 2 by 3 closet . stays about 78 to 81 degrees .
5 #### I 've been using it for several weeks now and it 's exactly what I needed . It stays put and keeps my sponge off my counter top and out of the dish pile . It dries out while staying out of the way . It 's large enough for 2 regular rectangular sponges , or in my case 1 regular sponge and the drain cover for the garbage disposal .
5 #### I have never done pressure cooking before , but I love it . I can decide what I want to eat at a moments notice . As a result I am eating more vegetables because I can have them ready in minutes . Whole grain brown rice in less than half the time . Easy to use ! !
5 #### This holds the hoses great . I bought two of them for my backyard hoses which are both long and they are holding up great . The hoses look nice and tucked away .
5 #### These nestle really well . There are an awful lot of cups , but they do n't take up much room ( I hang them ) and clip off the ring easily .
5 #### They work great ... The pop overs puff up way over the pan ... beautiful .
5 #### My daughter was fork mashing potatoes I had to send her a duplicate of our home masher to college . Perfect and comfortable in your hand .
5 #### Excellent . Wish I 'd had this thing forever , when I think of the time I 've wasted trying to stuff prunings , leaves , and general gardening trash into a loose bag . It does require a 42 - gallon bag - the little 30 - gallon ones do n't fit , but with the right size bag , this thing is the greatest thing since peanut butter . Collapses flat , hang it on a hook in the garage , and you 're done . Well worth the price .
5 #### I bought these as part of my husband 's Christmas present he was very happy with them ! !
5 #### Good value for money . The quality was great and would buy this again definitely would recommend to friends . Definitely happy .
2 #### Just try to get the quick change to work . I dare you ! Not any better than a cheap standard utility knife .
5 #### Essentially , BOSCH was the innovator of jig saws and they still lead the way . I have owned Craftsman and DeWalt 's and used the Hitachi 's ( which I thought may be comparable , because they look similar , except for the color , and they utilize the same blade mount ) . . . no comparison . The BOSCH is by far the best . Its variable speed is accurate and makes an appreciable difference if you actually apply the correct speed ( as we 're supposed to ) to what you 're cutting . Both the top handle and barrel grip are irreplacable , anytime anyone has used mine , they get them too !
4 #### Sensor not perfect but works pretty good . You have to get it down in the ground as deep as you can and it still jerks itself out of place sometimes . Over all the most humane way to get rid of pests I 've found .
5 #### Used this clamp on a 56 X 18 inch frame and worked great .
5 #### I plant everything with mine and have so for many years it plants the seeds to close but everyone I know comes dig plant when they are big enough for their garden the I just clear them out
5 #### These are perfect for what I needed in my house under my potted plants . I have them all in ceramic pots with ceramic drain pans ... which of course soak up water and leach it onto the floor or whatever the pots are on . Hence my stained oak plant stand . > : ^ ( So , that 's why I got these . This fit perfectly under my larger pot and you can hardly tell it 's there . Sturdy too !
5 #### I really like this edge guide a lot . The only trouble is that the screws that mount it to the router do n't come with either the router or the guide , and it 's not a size that most people have in their shop . It seems to be a metric M5 . I had to go chasing around to find the right screws .
4 #### We 've had the pressure cooker for a couple of months now . My wife has used it about a dozen times . Sometimes you have to " fiddle " with the " locking pin " to get it to pop up . Occasionally , it also leaks a little water by the handle from steam , but is no big deal . Just seems to stop or evaporate after a while . Seems to be well built .
5 #### Nice clock for the price . Really big & easy to read .
5 #### These are great extinguishers . For those that do n't know there are 4 classes to fires . A , B , C and D. A is anything that leaves an ash . Wood , paper , cardboard , etc . B is fuels and greases . C is electrical . D is burning metals like magnesium . Most everything us useless against D class fires but then the normal homeowner does n't have D class materials laying around to worry about . As far as this particular extinguisher , I recently used one to put out a kitchen grease fire . Works great ! Some notes . Although I 'm not a 100 % certain but I suspect this is a PKP type extinguisher . That means that is will put out all fires for A , B and C fires but be aware it does n't prevent reflash . That means a fire can pop right back up if you 've not COMPLETELY put it out . Make sure that whatever you use this on is completely out after a few minutes . I was in the Navy and firefighting skills were a top priority among sailors so I understand different types of fires and extinguishers . I keep four of these around my place . Kitchen , shop , garage and car . If you ever have to use one of these , replace it IMMEDIATELY ! Even if it 's still " good " . $ 20 is cheap insurance .
5 #### absolutely great bowl . Non slip . I use it for all kinds of tasks .
5 #### Perfect replacement for my old rusted out warming rack . With this one I only put on the grille when I want to use it . The old one I believe wore out early from being in the grille all year for 8 years and hardly got any actual use .
3 #### Same as all blades you get for this tool . Too short of lifespan for the money .
5 #### These B stakes are so handy for my plants and I still have some left for future projects .
5 #### Why have I waited for long to get a flat whisk ? ! ? Is it weird to be that excited about a whisk ? This thing rocks ! No more snags on the drawer getting it out , no more bent wires . This whisks up better than any traditional one I have ever owned . This is amazing ! Great quality , nice handle . But it !
5 #### Worked fine in my old shop - vac . Hint : Placing a section of pantyhose over the white filter section helps keep the filter clean of the larger debris .
5 #### When this first arrived , I was a bit disappointed by how unsubstantial this little machine felt , but I 've just used it for the first time , and the second it hit the rug , I could feel a surprising amount of power . And the fully - charged battery allowed me to vacuum my two small carpeted rooms twice without losing any power . And when I emptied the dust cup ( which was incredibly easy to do , by the way , and your hand goes on the inside of the cup , while the dirt is stuck to the outside , so your hands do n't have to ever touch the dust ) I was amazed by how much dust it had picked up ! I have a small one - bedroom apartment with very little storage space , and this tucks away easily behind the closet door . Well done , Eureka !
5 #### bang bang bang ! makes tender meat ! works great , cleans easy
4 #### Since light weight and easy to use . I like it . I 'll like it more if there is cord reel with auto rewind . It has 2 hooks to wind it .
4 #### Works well but still kinks on rare occasions . Good strong end fittings .
5 #### What else does a person have to say , if you own other cookware by Lodge you know what you are getting . I have cooked on this sportsment grill 3 times already and I am very happy with it . We have a big gas grill but for small meals it is easy and fast . My daughter has her eyes on it and I will not lend it out , maybe buy her one . lol . The grandson and I plan to take it fishing with us to the stream .
1 #### I used this bread machine 4 times successfully , on the 5th time it malfunctioned , fried the electronics and it no longer even turns on ! I had to pry the lid open with a screwdriver because the plastic melted . It could have started a fire if I had not been home ! The customer service dept are worthless - they will only repair it ( ha ha ) . Best bet to return it from where you bought it .
1 #### The cloth material is thin and the clamp mechanism was hard to attach . There is a gap between the clamp and bag on one section where dust would spill out . Midway through a red oak floor install the dust port clogged and a huge pile of dust accumulated before anyone noticed the port was blocked .
2 #### I am giving this item 2 stars as the product itself is not bad for what it is however the company selling it is miss representing it . The part numbers K3A096 , K3A012 , K3A112 are Incandescent bulb flashlights however the Technical Details state the " Type of Bulb " is LED on the black and grey models . ( Thank you seller for making me do this research to find out why I received the wrong product twice . ) Details : Incandescent bulb flashlights : 2 Lumens 3.75 Hour battery life 20 meter range LED flashlights : 37 Lumens 1.75 Hours battery life 55 meter range If you are expecting an LED product this Incandescent flashlight will be the worst thing on the planet . However for when the original Solitaire Maglite was created it was a great product and should be viewed as such . Unfortunately it is showing its age and LEDs are much brighter .
5 #### Perfect size for hummingbird feeder ports . I have no idea of what else you might use these for . Great if you feed hummingbirds though .
5 #### I took this flashlight into the crawlspace from Hell for a job that had me in a nasty wet dusty muddy environment for six long days . It produced great light while taking a beating . About three or four hours of constant light on a single battery charge . It 's ability to stand up and point its head as needed was invaluable as it freed up my hands . I was so happy that I got this just before taking on this job . Just luck on my part . No plan . Anyone who wants to be prepaired for the dark could do a lot worse . Only weakness : the bulb is not an LED . That would be truely awesome in terms of light and battery life .
5 #### I purchased 3 of these bowls , two as a gift to a MD patient that has control and weight issues . Its as if this system was designed for those with disabilities and the rest of us get to enjoy the benefits too .
3 #### The cover works but the sting already ripped the plastic when you try to tighten it . Not as good as the one I had before .
3 #### Although the numbers look big and bold in this picture , we can not read it from a distance . It 's nice and decorative but definitely meant for a spot where you can read it from only a short distance - like 8 - 10 feet .
5 #### This soap dish is really lovely . It is well made . It would be a nice accent to any bathroom style .
5 #### This is a good small BBQ & can be placed in a box in your car for travel to the beach , picnic or camping . Because its not a deep kettle , it might not be perfect for foods that take a long time , but works well for burgers , steaks , kabobs , or sausages , or hot dogs . If you pre - roast larger items like beef ribs and do them on the grill for the last half hour , its also fine . I like the rectangular size better than the round small kettle size , and it carries pretty well , but also good to get a tinfoil lined sturdy wooden box for transport .
3 #### Well , let 's see . It is alright . We used it for the dogs nails and it did suffice until the battery became very loose and the unit did not work . Even after replacing batter I had to tighten the terminals for a connection to be made . When it does work , it is great for the dogs . We switched to a wired unit and we are much happier . Good idea , just needs a little re - inventing .
5 #### I have this on an outdoor fountain and it works great . Only been in use 1 month but it has survived several rainstorms and power flickers with no issues .
5 #### My three bulb vanity light fixture came with three 40watt bulbs whose combined 120watt output was too bright . Three 25watt bulbs emitted the perfect amount for detailed mirror examination yet not overwhelming the bathroom with too much light .
4 #### I purchased this guide for Dewalt 's new trim router&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/DEWALT - DWP611PK-1 - 25 - HP - Max - Torque - Variable - Speed - Compact - Router - Combo - Kit - with - LED - s / dp / B0049ZFUK2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">DEWALT DWP611PK 1.25 HP Max Torque Variable Speed Compact Router Combo Kit with LED's</a>&nbsp;and it works as advertised . The guide only works with the plunge base but that is n't a problem for me because the plunge base is more stable in my opinion . You should attach a wooden fence to the guide too to get more accurate results and so you do n't mar the piece you are routing . My only complaint is that I now need to find and purchase a hose and/or adapter that fits this guide and my shop vac .
5 #### Product is splendid value for the money , although I 'll admit I bought the name for I have known and trusted Monster products for many years . The product will handle ONLY coax , and has excellent response time and Joules rating . Sadly , I purchased it for my mother AFTER the lightning hit the tree across the street ....
5 #### This is the only fly attractant that I 've found that actually works . Do yourself a favor and just buy this .
5 #### This is the best hose I 've ever owned . Period . After 10 years this thing is still going strong . It 's been outside during it 's entire life . Never stored inside even in winter . It is relatively heavy but coils easily on my wall hanger . No signs of giving up either . I read where others had leaks at the fitting , etc . They may have run over theirs or got a lemon . But mine has outlasted every other hose in the neighborhood many times over . I 've even left it laying out in the yard with full pressure in it for months in the hot Texas summer heat without failure of any kind . I 'd buy this hose over and over again if I ever needed a new one . It still has the original fittings , has never been patched in any way and just keeps on going year after year after year ... I did n't know they make anything this good anymore .
5 #### These stainless steel skewers replaced some chrome plated ones that started to rust . I like that they are not round . Food turns over when you turn the skewer . You can scrape off burnt food and not ruin the finish . I also bought the 14 inch ones but do n't use them as much . It would be better if the ringed end was larger so you could hold them easier . Every Norpro product I bought has satisfied me .
4 #### The whisk is n't as big as I would have liked , but I love the rubber handle . OXO have great kitchen products . Thanks
1 #### Looks and works great , if only the other problems did n't render those points irrelevant . The plunger is designed with a flared lip on the inside that means no matter how much you shake it out there is still a whole lot ( 1/4 cup or more ) of water that is retained in the plunger head ... that 's right , the same water that just came out of what was most likely your waste filled toilet bowl . Yummy . On top of that , the rubber they used for this STINKS . So much so that the entire bathroom reeked from the rubber off - gassing smell . Thought perhaps that it was just new and that the smell would fade . No such luck . 6 months later I finally tossed it after being fed up with the intense rubber smell every time you open the bathroom door . Shame too because the canister designed to hold the plunger was both clever and attractive but it ca n't make up for the two fatal design flaws outlined above .
5 #### It measures stuff ... Not flimsy .. It is a tape measure anyone should be proud of .. I 'm proud just thinking about it right now .
4 #### It is a lovely serving spatula , but it is VERY stiff , there is no flexibility whatever . I do n't like it for cooking , or trying to serve from a deep dish . It works fine on a flat dish or platter .
4 #### Would be 5 stars , but the right hand pinkie is kinda turned like sewn at a weird angle
5 #### I had a Stir Crazy that lasted many years , this is its replacement and was exactly what I had hoped for . Good quality for the price and makes a good batch of popcorn .
4 #### not all spokeshaves are created equal -- Stanley knows how to get it right for a reasonable price .
3 #### I have a 1993 Grizzly cabinet saw . I bought this fence and had issues from the start attaching it . The installation guide is complete crap but what is worse is that rails were incorrectly drilled . I had to redrill and open the holes to get the thing to work . When I called Vega about the issues , the guy who answered the phone could care less . The parts look as if a drunk had manufactured them . During my use of the fence . The tail end tends to swing when you lock it , which throws off the measurement . So if you are wanting something precise , it takes you much longer to dial in the fence . Next time I buy a fence , it will not be a vega
5 #### Easy to use does a really good job easy to clean I would highly recommend it well made in the right size too
5 #### This is a pretty straight forward timer . Good basic design . The original one lasted over 20 years . I hope this one last at least that long . The white timer gives the bathroom a bit more updated look compared to the ivory one I replaced .
5 #### I had to come back and review this even though it has been a while since I bought it . I love this . I 've cut garlic in every way imaginable and was ' de - lighted ' at how well this works and at how easy it is to clean . I usually only do three garlic cloves at a time , it does seem to have a limit . I 've also bought this for my daughters . As critical a piece of kitchen ware as the orange peeler .
4 #### Works great , but it does n't keep the needles out , but hey what was I expecting . This is a lot of netting , and it can be slightly unmanageable . But it does it 's job and kept a lot of leaves out of my waterfall / pond . Funny the frogs liked to sit on top of it and could slip thru the holes .
5 #### Very nice clock and it matches perfectly with my brushed chrome cabinet hardware . The numbers are easy from afar and overall . Keeps perfect time .
5 #### As with all of their products , this tool is worth every penny . Almost all of my tools have the same color handles now , keep up the quality work ! ! ! !
5 #### Easy to install and seals much better than the original one ! A great deal !
5 #### There 's not much to comment about Channellock products . This is a good tool and it arrived in two days . I did n't want a large diagonal plier and this is as expected .
5 #### Needed an add on of a few dollars and this fit the bill .
5 #### I 've had this hooked up all summer . Works great and easy to program . No complaints
5 #### I was using pyrex clear glass bowls as a double boiler . Pot of water with glass bowl on top . Had trouble getting eggs set . Decided maybe I needed a bowl that would take heat quicker . Got a 3 and 4 1/2 quart bowls . Just what I needed , eggs set quickly on double boiler . Been using them for lots of things , popcorn , mixing stuff , they are lighter than the glass bowls we were using and handy . Love them .
3 #### I was rather disappointed in this product as my hands tend to cramp up when turning the lever ( ? ? ? ) . I have not had the product very long and it was getting rusty . Another thing to mention is that this hose adaptor is not very big , very small in fact in length whereas the one I have purchased since is longer and has a grip to it as well as a longer adjustment lever . I know that had I have returned it to Amazon , they would have refunded my money , but , instead I passed it on to my friend who does not suffer from cramping hands but who has become tired of walking back and forth to the far side of her mobile home where water spigots are . I purchased a 15 " length of hose , and I can stand far enough away from the sprinkler to adjust the water flow without it being necessary to walk way back behind mobile home to adjust it there . I found myself getting very frustrated because I would have to adjust up or down then walk back up to see if that is where I wanted it to be , if not I had to walk way back again . Sometimes it took me three trips to get it sat just right . I purchased an " arthritis friendly " hose adaptor on Amazon .
3 #### It 's okay . Not quite as sturdy as I was hoping . If you 're happy with a flimsy , very flexible whisk this is the one you want . I do love that it was coated as I only had a metal whisk which was not good for my pans .
5 #### This is my third and I use them all . I realized I needed a larger one for things like kale .
3 #### I have the feeder hanging in my view all the time . I see who comes to eat and I see what is left over not eaten . If I do n't put new feed in the feeder , it takes a long time for the animals to finish eating the corn . They have to be really hungry to eat that crap . There is way too much corn in the bag . Even the rats did n't want to eat the corn . Also it is very messy , because of all the left overs from the corn . I will not buy this again . ( Imagine ... we eat the corn that even rats do not want to eat . I presume it is because of too many GMO 's in it . Animals smell it .
5 #### I do n't have a whole lot to say other than I 'm happy with the quality , capacity , and performance .
5 #### Man are these sharp ! I must have some really dull tools because these clippers are the bomb . I ordered another one because they are that good . They cut rose bushes and small trees with ease ! I love these for pruning my mini cherry tree , my dogwood and my rosebushes !
5 #### Got mine at the local Home Depot for $ 19 . Opened and checked it in the store to ensure it was fully charged and there were no leaks . Looks sturdy and well built . I ca n't comment on whether it works and how good it works until I actually use it ... and this is one product I hope I will never have to use .
5 #### I like this bowl . It 's sturdy and the handle has a good feel . I also like the pour spout , which makes it good for making pancake or waffle batter as it is easy to use to pour into the pan . Before , I 'd mix in a bowl and then pour into a measuring cup to control pouring into the pan with fewer drips . Now I just use this for it all . I 've had flimsier bowls that felt like they 'd crack with any weight . This one does n't have that problem . It 's solid . I also like the measuring lines in the bowl , although I find they 're really only useful for the item to be put into the bowl .
4 #### Good blades , just wish they were maybe one inch longer . Then we 'd have a saw !
5 #### Life saver when putting my cabinets together . My friends have already asked to borrow . Just take your time when tightening to make sure everything is flush on the front .
5 #### If you lost one of your end caps then this is what you need . This time though I used silicone sealer to adhere the caps to the brace . Hope I do n't lose one again anytime soon .
1 #### It cleared up the algae but put my Koi fish in terrible distress . I thought it was quite disturbing watching the poor guys huddled in the bottle of the pond , refusing to attempt to get near the top of the water . They acted like it is battery acid floating in the foaming broth . I would have given it a zero if there was the option . I used less than 1/10 of the recommended dose .
5 #### 200 ppm 's of this in RO water is the best recipe I ve found for getting clones to take root . Excellent product . Do n't let the small numbers on the bottle fool you . This stuff is full of micro nutes !
4 #### Fits my saw just they said in the description . Does just what they said and takes place of a home - made support I have been using for about 10 years .
3 #### This product works but no better than a flat rubber jar opening gripper . Because another kitchen tool can be used I do n't recommend cluttering your kitchen with this tool .
5 #### the best spatula for cooking eggs on cast iron . It literally makes cooking as easy , if not better than , non - stick pans . What a great product ! I almost gave up on my cast iron , it would ruin eggs every time . Until I got this thin spatula . It slides under the eggs without breaking them or leaving behind any egg film stuck to the cast iron surface . It helped me find a deep appreciation for cooking on cast iron . two thumbs up .
5 #### We are using these blades in multiple sliding miter saws for picture frames . They cut anything from wood to composite and hold sharpness well . Cuts are almost polished . Silver Ice coating more durable than the red permashield .
5 #### This new model works great . All the power you need in the extra room , mud room , small shop and some house uses too . Love it
5 #### Great knife . Holds edge well ( hone rod about once a week for moderate to heavy use ) . Have owned for a couple of years , and other than the branding wearing off , the knife is still in great condition , however , we only hand wash this knife . Like it so much have bought it for my parents and in - laws .
5 #### This makes chopping apples SOOOO much easier ! Literally you set it on top of the apple , push down in one easy swoop , and suddenly have 7 apple halves and the apple core separated from them . You do n't even need to push hard , it just glides down , it 's pretty sharp . I love it so much I bought one for a friend too .
5 #### This is a sharp large disc , the design is ergonomically comfortable and very easy to clean !
5 #### I owned the shiny stainless steel model of this for at least 20 years until it sprung a leak along the bottom rim . I debated if I would like the Brushed aluminum model . I 'm so glad that I decided to get the Brushed , I 've had it for about six weeks and it is so much easier for me to keep clean and not fuss with keeping a shine on it . All - in - all this Tea Kettle served us well before and I anticipate this replacement will do the same
5 #### Great item . American made . Ca n't fix an amazing item . Good leverage , good screwdriver .
5 #### I do n't like countertop clutter and I 've gone through many manual can openers . This is the last and the best one I 'll ever use . Buy it !
5 #### I use this tool specifically for pushing in brake caliper pistons . They work pretty well and since they 're overly large , you get a lot more strength and leverage to push in some of the larger more stubborn pistons .
5 #### After my beloved Tupperward brand peeler broke , I purchased a few different ones before finally finding one I like , this one . Comfortable handle , sharp blade , works great .
5 #### If you need your bits to last many years in the shop ... great solution
3 #### I just spanned my first batch of lettuce using this OXO Good Grips salad spinner . ... I 'm not impressed with the torque it creates , it seems slow compared to the Zylizz pull string spinner it replaced which broke after 8 years of constant use . When pushing the knob it feels like it 's going to break - maybe I need to get used to it . In spite my doubts I will keep it because I like the way it looks , hopefully it will last for many years to come .
5 #### This mower has exceeded my expectations . I have a small lawn and did n't need or want a behemoth mower to cut it . The MM275 is perfect for my use and its power has been more than adequate . It is easy enough to start and use , and even though one must use an electric cord , I find it easy to maneuver . I think if you have a smallish yard and do n't let your grass grow two feet high or try to cut it when it 's soaking wet , this mower would be for you . I highly recommend it .
1 #### Waste of time . Put out 20 of these in a room where I had a mouse , and nothing for 3 days . Put down a plain old Victor spring trap with a dab of peanut butter on the trip , and had the little mouse in an hour .
5 #### These are wonderful knives , well made and balanced . It pays to buy good knives .
5 #### Read the reviews and decided to get this as I badly needed a new can opener . It cuts cans smoothly and easily . I had to use all my strength to open cans with the cheaper ones , but I love this one !
5 #### If you are a serious hot shellfish eater , these are highly recommended for digging out meat and then dipping into broth and butter . They fit the hand wonderfully unlike plain seafood forks .
5 #### The roofers forgot / neglected to put screening over the roof vents , and a rat appeared in my toilet one day . Having had the run of the house for several days ( despite the presence of two large dogs ) , I looked this product up . As the instructions make clear , rats are wily , and it took several nights to nab him , using dry dog food and nuts . Last night , when I went into the kitchen , I noticed an odd , dimly blinking light , which turned out not to be from my iPhone . No , it was the zapper , blinking atop my refrigerator ! Success ! No more waking up to the gnawing sounds from the kitchen . No more rat . Finis , expired , is no more ! Goodbye Rat ! Thank you Agri Zapper ! ! Ca n't recommend highly enough . Easy to use ; no noise ; no mess ; easy disposal of the deceased . And with Amazon Prime , got it in two days !
1 #### Leaks leaves all over . The seal or clasp that holds it together was poorly thought out . Even with a super cheap price , just pass . You wo n't use it anyways ...
5 #### Best there is that I know of . Super thin and flexible . Gets under foods without tearing them up for flipping .
4 #### Bought a soldering gun and the tip broke with in an hour and I needed new ones ca nt beat the price hopefully these do n't break quick .
4 #### These are decent bait traps for rats . Eventually the rats in my backyard started to get smart and have learned how to set them off without getting caught so I 've had to upgrade a bit ( I eventually tried some electronic traps which seemed to work better ) , but I was able to catch about 4 rats with these . I used a very small dab of peanut butter to attract the rats . All of the traps were functional and had no issues .
2 #### The Bessey angle clamp requires that you align all edges and provide pressure -- all simultaneously -- while you tighten the one clamping handle . It is less convenient than corner clamps with two separate clamping handles to tighten separately . Their large surface area provides solid alignment , even if it also makes these clamps more appropriate for larger tasks ( e.g. , over one foot per side ) .
3 #### I hope this one last longer then the first one I had . The flexable inner shaft broke on the first one . I hope to get more use out of this one .
3 #### This sifter works just as it claims to . Because it has caps on both the top and the bottom , it stores neatly ( no floury mess all over the place ) . It is a bit stronger - gauge metal than you might think from the picture , so it should last . The handle is very comfortable , which is of course what OXO is famous for . The best feature is that unlike traditional " trigger " style sifters , there is no hole in the side of the unit leaking flour while you are trying to sift . Nor is there any need to squeeze your fingers over and over , which is important if your fingers are prone to discomfort , such as from arthritis or fatigue . The product 's only weakness is pretty significant : it works slowly . If you want to sift two cups of flour , be prepared to shake it back and forth dozens and dozens of times . If you shake hard , it does sift faster , but then your hand and arm are sure to get tired . Like a squeeze - handle sifter , it can be used one - handed , and has that handy little scraper thing at the bottom to break up lumps . If you only sift occasionally , buy this product . If you sift many times a week , choose a product that will work faster , such as a squeeze - handle sifter or simply a wide sieve filled with flour and bumped against your other hand .
4 #### I needed to cut up a maple stump down to a level below the soil grade so it would start to decay . This blade cut nicely through this very hard wood so that I could remove chunks until I had it cut down enough to cover with surrounding soil . No more hitting my mower blades on that stump ; and no paying for a stump grinding process . I was very happy with its performance except that it did bend somewhat about half - way through the job . However , just the one blade completed the job and it was still sharp after it was done . I can still use the one blade for other " pruning " jobs around the yard even if it does n't work to cut straight lines . I subtracted one star for this , but this blade set was WAY cheaper than having a stump grinder do that job ! And I still have the rest of the package for future jobs needing a straight cut .
1 #### Something keeps tripping it as if catching something but nothing is ever found in there . Back to using Victor snap traps .
5 #### Had to get a new measuring tape because my sons and husband kept loosing the one we had at home . Now i have my own and they do not know where it is . LOL
5 #### Does the job , nothing special . but good for the price and size .
3 #### EDIT - I see some weekend warriors do n't know their facts . I use snips almost every day , read my link in the comments or do n't , but do n't try to tell people that casting is superior . It is cheaper , and that 's the only reason some companies prefer it . Back to the review - Word is that Wiss has switched from forging to casting , which is not desirable in this application . Whatever the reason , these do not hold up like better brands anymore . I 've seen several Wiss bite the dust on identical material which I chewed right through with my Midwest snips , also US made . Wiss is not up to the standard they once were . Additionally , the blades will not stay tight despite the nylon locknut , I 'm constantly retightening them . Chances are if you 're looking at a pair of these as opposed to offset snips , these would suit your needs just fine , but I 'd still recommend the Midwest version , about the same price , and they 'll be there when you need to cut something heavier .
5 #### But works great on potatoes carrots cucumbers and the such . Yes the product has a sharp blade and could be considered dangerous but so do scissors , knives and razors . Duh !
5 #### Love this bowl , as with all Oxo products that I have purchased .
5 #### Love my new cooking utensils , there are sturdy and well packaged
5 #### The filters help keep the machine running well . They are washable and can be reused many times depending on the type of dirt it 's picking up . I have used the machine without the filter but it does mean having to clean in the inside more frequently .
5 #### Besides myself being a Cuisinart snob , I will say that I would n't use any other product in my kitchen . This does a wonderful job on small jobs such as pestos , or making peanut butter .
5 #### Great quality . Easy to hold rubber . Will not get hot in the sun like a metal hose sprayer . The infinitely adjustable spray setting is nice to have . Although it does not produce a fine mist but i guess this is want , not a need these days . i just need to get that water on the dirt without it washing it all away and making a hole that i have to blame my dog later for digging . My dog is happier now because of this purchase . Plus it fills his water bowl up and will give him a nice gentle bath when the kids soap him up . I like this sprayer - my life is now complete .
5 #### I hope they never stop making these - this is the only popcorn maker we use .
5 #### Holy smokes . Best blade ever . I had to cut through 3 inches of subfloor - some rotten , with linoleum and a TON of nails . I had to pull up an entire kitchen floor , and cut it out in 2x2 squares . I had to use a couple blades , but man , I put them through a lot .
5 #### It 's nice to see an honest product for a solid price .
5 #### Ozo makes great product and this is no different . I just moved and could n't find my peeler that is why I had to buy th his . Now I own 3 and love them all
5 #### I use this thing daily and it holds up to allot of abuse . Extends well and easy to read .
5 #### I used to make dovetail drawers until I tried this bit . It is sharp , and creates a perfect matching joint for drawer corners to be glued up . So far the drawers are holding together and setup time for small quantity ( four ) was a real time saver compared to setup time for a dovetail jig .
5 #### Who needs a special tool to core and quarter an apple ? Nobody really needs it unless they process a whole lotta apples . But this tool works so perfectly and so quickly that it is just plain elegant and fun to use it . I see myself eating more apples ...
5 #### Works as advertised . Too bad they cost so much and last so short a time . Seems to last about 6 weeks running 24 - hrs a day . But sure attracts the mosquitos to the trap ( along with the bait ) .
5 #### This is the holder we got for the bulk chamomile flowers that we got on Amazon to make tea with and it works great . It did come apart once but it was easy to put it back together and it has worked fine ever since so we continue to use it and we like the hook that hooks onto the edge of the mason jar and the chain dangles down far enough so that the chamomile flowers that are in there can get saturated and the steeping is easy because you can just lift the hook and steep and make your tea as strong as you like . Just replace the hook on the edge of the jar and put the lid on and store it in the refrigerator . Pour a cup or glass when thirsty or just for relaxing or sleeping . We had a spoon holder with holes in it but the handle was n't long enough so this is quite an improvement .
5 #### This is a good mower and very light . I use it often .
5 #### All sorts of uses ... yard cleanup , fill it with ice for cooling party beverages , laundry hamper , trash . We love it . Very sturdy , too .
5 #### These worked great in the yard and barn ! Cut down on my fly problem a lot . Will purchase again . Realy fast shipment !
5 #### Had for a while now . Been working good . Only thing I had to replace was tips which I just got a few days ago .
2 #### When the item description said " USA " , I figured that meant it was made in USA . Low and behold , made in China . :(
5 #### It 's perfect . A little or a lot of heat fast . Safe indoors ( still use common sense ) After I 've timed the fuel consumption rates I 'll post them . The three way fuel delivery options are a great asset too .
5 #### I love it ! My mom cooked with a pressure cooker and I was looking for one that was not aluminum . I use it all the time . Would highly recommend .
5 #### . . .whether they 're being attracted for a mile radius . I did n't think I had a big fly problem . We had a few flies . We 're in a residential neighborhood in tropical Hawaii , not a horse farm or overly near a public park . Still , the trap only lasted a week before becoming filled up with what I estimate might be one thousand flies . FWIW , this trap works . It attracts flies to a smelly liquid trap where they subsequently drown . During the week I had it up hanging 20 feet from the house in a tree , no flies came into the house . I 'll take a break for a week , then try it again to see if the trap lasts longer and whether the fly population seems to have decreased . FWIW , take two , I developed a macabre fascination with checking on the trap every few hours to see how many more flies had been caught . Ick .
5 #### I ordered this stabilizer to mount on my DeWalt dw746 tablesaw . I had been using a DeWalt 5 " stabilizer plate with a Forrest WWII thin kerf blade . At 5 " in diameter , the DeWalt stabilizer effectively limited my depth of cut to about 2.5 " . After trying out the Freud 3.5 " stabilizer , I can honestly say that I did n't lose any noticeable performance , and I gained enough blade clearance to once again rip / crosscut 3 " stock . As an added bonus for the price , this product comes as a pair of stabilizers ! I only mounted one stabilizer on my saw ( on the nut side of the blade ) , and was able to mount the other to my radial arm saw and greatly improve its cuts as well . I highly recommend this set of stabilizers as a good product at a great price .
5 #### I recently acquired a deep frying and had extra potatoes lying around . I shopped online for fry cutters and most the heavy - duty ones are 4x more expensive . Since I do not cut fries often , I opted to try this one , even though it 's plastic . Well this thing cuts fries like it should . I do n't know how long it 'll last , but I 'm sure it 's long enough that I 'll get my money 's worth . The only ( minor ) complaint I have is the ability to cut potatoes into smaller pieces . Using the smaller blade cartridge , my fries still comes out larger than I want , but it 's not a big deal . Just wish I could get it to the size of McDonalds or In - N - Out .
5 #### This grill is great for someone who wants a Weber gas grill without a $ 350 - 500 + price tag . When bought with the Weber Stationary Cart ( $ 79 ) , it looks great on your deck and grills things very well . Since we wo n't be doing things like baking a cake on our grill ( I think my Dad 's $ 500 - 700 Weber can do that ! ) we just wanted a nice gas grill . This is perfect for road trips or leaving at home , as it can take either small or large propane tanks if you buy a hose adapter .
5 #### These are a really nice size and strong enough without being a big clunky stick . They are going into their second season now .
5 #### OMG ! ! First of all , the quality befits Farberware ! Then , it is the perfect size for my habit of adding more and more to my soups or chili ! I have a 10 qt . but 16 qt . is perfect . Who said bigger is not necessarily better ? ? ? In this case , for me anyway , bigger IS better !
4 #### This thing works well . The only downside is it is heavy . I suppose that means it is high quality ( that 's what i 'm going with ) . So if you do n't mind the weight , it is great .
5 #### This thing needs no review ( almost ) . Magnetic tip or bit holder , an extender to hold the screws or pieces you 're working with and the ability to leave something in the drill and still make quick chances to bit , screwdriver , reamer , etc . I love this one as much as all the other ones I 've either lost or given away .
5 #### Great size to keep in the car glove box , or in your pocket while working around the yard .
5 #### There are zero negatives for this as a camping axe or to carry around your property and do small jobs .
4 #### This is a nice little greenhouse and it served it 's purpose this spring . It 's not very sturdy so I wo n't plan on getting many years out of it but since I only plan to use it for a couple of months in the spring it should be good for a few years . My main complaint is that we really had to fight to get the top brace in place , there is very little give to it and it just seemed a tad too long , I got very frustrated with it and my hubby was ready to toss it when it finally went together for him . You have to go on line for instructions because they are n't included .
5 #### Best Pressure cooker in the world ! We have 3 of these in various sizes . And have been using them regularly over the last 10 years when we first discovered them . Top notch materials -- Extreme Swiss craftsmanship ! This is a lifetime purchase as long as you maintain it as recommended . Note : Prior to buying these , we went through several Presto / Prestige models .
5 #### Great chimes , always look forward to the wind to hear its beautiful sound . Great looking , well made .
5 #### I love this salad spinner . It 's easy to use and clean . It 's sturdy and you can fit a large salad in it . My toddler can even help spin the vegetables .
5 #### This blade has worked great for me over 2 seasons of use . It has cut perfectly and still looks pretty good . You 'll be happy with it !
5 #### I purchased this pump to replace one that had a broken impeller . This one worked as well as if not better than the one I replaced . The price was significantly less than other places I looked . Everything needed was included . Nothing else to buy .
5 #### I 'm not even sure what prompted me to buy this but I use it all the time so now I 'm wondering how I got along without it . I use it to wash rice and beans or anything else I want to strain the liquid from to make sauces . Under the heading of too much information my garbage disposal recently died and my sink has always been slow draining so I 've been using it to strain out the dredges from soaking pans . It 's disgusting but it helps keep the drain running . Fairly easy clean up .
4 #### I use this mainly to carry tools and hardware between the house and ( detached ) garage . I can load it with a hammer drill , cordless drill / driver , etc . It has various inner and outer pockets and dividers to carry hand tools and hardware . It appears well - made and heavy duty , good value .
4 #### This years batch of traps did n't remain as attractive to the wasps as last years , but still caught probable hundreds of yellow jackets , the quiet a few flies . I 'll probably by more next year .
4 #### definitely not as strong or heavy duty as a higher end vacuum , but functions well for the price .
4 #### We have several B&D tools and bought an extra battery to always have a freshly charged one . Batteries do n't last forever , and after 4 years of regular home use , it needed replacing . Our B&D tools are not broken and still in good shape . After taking the old one to the recycle bin , it was quick and easy to order a new one from Amazon .
5 #### This refill bottle is handy . The insect repeller works well . I do not get and ticks or chigger bites when I put this on my clothes .
5 #### Having finally retired my hand - me - down 1960s harvest gold Bundt pan , I decided to go for a larger and heavier pan . This pan was recommended by several baking blogs and books . I 'm completely satisfied with it . It 's a good , sturdy , even - heating pan that is easy to clean . The indentations are deep enough that cakes come out looking terrific . That it has handles was n't a deciding factor in the purchase , but , now that I 've used it , I realize how convenient they are . I 've used this with Crisco / flour , butter / flour , cocoa powder / butter , and Baker 's Joy . Each time , the cake slid right out of the pan with no sticking whatsoever . The only problem with it is that I now want some of the other shapes in the collection .
5 #### Works perfectly ! In love with how well it works . Amazong for a college dorm or apt .
5 #### I love to cook and the Popover Pan is a wonderful addition to my kitchen . I used the recipe for popovers which I found in Martha Stewart 's Baking Handbook . This is a high quality piece of equipment . It produces great results and the popovers literally fall out of the pan . It has a non - stick finish but I always use a vegetable spray or butter . Another plus is that it is offered at a fair price . This pan will give you many happy years of service .
3 #### ... the spring rusts . I own both the 12 ' ( for normal indoor cooking ) and the 16 " ( for grilling ) . I have used both countless times . They grip food well and you feel as though you have a firm hold of the hood too . In all the times I have used them , I have discovered two main flaws . The first flaw is the flexibility ( bend - ibility)of the " hands " , the part of the tongs that actually touches the food . If you grasp the food too tight , they bend . This means the they will not close tight without bending them back into shape . The second is the metal used in the spring . This metal is prone to rust and when it rusts the tongs no longer have their normal spring and often get stuck . My advice would be to spend a little more money and get a hight quality .
5 #### My daughter loves this measuring cup because you can measure just about anything in one beaker . Great product .
5 #### I really live OXO brand . These cups nest well and are easy to use and read . They replace an old tupperware set and a newer metal set . The tupperware set had one piece removed from the set because it melted in the microwave ( oops ) and the metal set was a cheap set that had the one cup piece removed because the handle fell off . My new OXO set is used constantly and has had no problems !
1 #### Please do not buy this . It works , but it 's suspected of killing whole colonies of bees . America 's bees are being destroyed at the highest rates ever , The National Resources Defense Council reports 42 % of bee colonies collapsed in 2015 , and before that , since the mid 90 's bee colonies have been in decline world wide . Is it just a coincidence that neonics are the most widely available pesticides in the world , and just happened to come into existence around the same time ? EPA research says it 's not : [ ... ] . If interested , see also [ ... ] The bees are struggling to survive a deluge of next - generation pesticides called " neonics " unleashed by multinational chemical giants like Monsanto , Syngenta and the German aspirin company , Bayer the world 's largest manufacturer of these bee - killing chemicals . One out of every three bites of food we eat relies on bees for pollination . Neonics are also used to treat seeds , to make them less susceptible to rot , but the dust that is raised kills whole colonies of bees living near by . We must stop this . Honey bees provide honey but also pollinate coffee , blueberries , apples , oranges , lemons , cherries and many more , 1/3 of the food we eat , are at risk and will become much more expensive if they must be hand pollinated .
5 #### MADE IN THE USA which is VERY important to me . This is a well made product and the price is great too .
5 #### This is a great all - purpose knife . It is n't too thick and it goes where you aim it .
5 #### I love the idea of a collapsible barrel and this Fiskars does the job . The hard shell bottom allows me to pull the full barrel along the ground without wearing holes in the bottom . In addition , it 's easy to fasten the toggles when you want to close it up . I highly recommend it .
5 #### Best ever ! Works great at home for clean - up after projects . It 's compact & light enough to take along in our motorhome with tools that store onboard . Plenty of suction to pick up sand & small pebbles . Replacement bags are easy to find at many stores . A great product !
5 #### Was looking at some of the real high - end tape measures out there before coming across an article that said these were as accurate as any , regardless of price . This one is dead - on per that article . I 'll be buying more of these and recommending them to all . Fits the hand well , solidly made and works just as intended every time .
2 #### So I got two of these from Home Depot and placed them at the farthest corners of my backyard . Day 1 , 1 or two flies . Day 2 , more flies . A week later , an almost full bag of flies . Great right ? Well first of all these things smell , like decomposed bodies , so if you place them anywhere closer than 50 feet away you will smell them . Secondly , I started noticing more flies on my patio door at night . That ai n't right , those traps are trapping all the flies , how could I be seeing more flies on my patio door , especially at night ? What I think is happening is that ( as many have said already ) , these things attrack flies from your entire neighborhood , and they also breed more flies . The big flies ca n't escape but the baby flies can , therefore increasing the overall population of flies in YOUR backyard .
5 #### What makes the Wide Chef 's Knife different is the sharp slope from the tip to the bolster -- and that 's also what makes it work so well for chopping or mincing veggies . Hold the tip down on the chopping block with one finger , and quickly rock the handle up and down . Before you know it , your onions , garlic , parsely , whatever , are as finely chopped as you could want them . Even better , the weight is balanced slightly forward of your grip , so the knife naturally moves right into the job . Less effort , less time , less hassle . Great knife .
5 #### We use these in our house to help control the dust , and they work very well . I purchase them on line because I ca nt find my size in the store . Does n't seem to be a big savings , I just have an odd ball size .
5 #### Love this strainer ! No more losing half a batch of quinoa down the drain ! The mesh is fine but not so fine the liquid wo n't drain out . No more getting quinoa , grains , rice or pasta caught under the lip of the strainer . I have tried many strainers , the is the best and the fact it rests across your sink , pot or bowl frees up a hand !
4 #### I received one of these ( the black version ) a few days ago and my verdict is that I am likely to use it when reading books at night . Brief overview : - 2 super - bright LED 's with lenses - light has more blue and very little red , or yellow ( think of a steady neon light ) - uses 3 ( THREE ) AAA batteries - 40 - hour battery life ( claim is made on the package , not verified by me ) - power supply not provided - relatively long , flexible arm - can turn on 1 or 2 LED 's - solid build - a bit heavy but had no problem using it with a paperback I will definitely use this lamp when reading books at night . I doubt I will ever use it as a flashlight or a work light unless I had no other choice .
5 #### Received timely and look forward to the pancakes , thank you !
5 #### We have found this Omni model to be much more user friendly . The updated design makes it very easy to change the filter , as opposed to the older Omni model . We 're very satisfied with this water filter and ordered a second one after installing the first Omni so when our second Omni filter fails , we will have this one on hand .
5 #### Feels heavy duty and works great . This is the first time , I 've ever used a plane before .
5 #### They are easy to use and are easy to open when you only have one hand . They are accurate to pick up small pieces .
5 #### the size is what is needed to scramble eggs and sauces . the quality is great . made Portland USA . if you buy this you will be happy . lies flat in drawer not like balloon type . proportions are perfect .
5 #### The humming birds prefer this over any other feeder I have had . The best part is it is so easy to be able to watch them with it on the window by my sink .
5 #### We purchased two of these hoses for our elderly mother , who still loves to garden , but found the heavier , kink - prone hoses difficult to use . This hose is lightweight and very pliable , does not kink and she loves using the hose to water plants and various porch and patio things . We would highly recommend .
4 #### Birds LOVE this natureal feeder . Very pretty to look at , especially when it gets wet from the rain . I was thinking about putting clear acrylic sealer on it to make it like that all the time , but have n't done it . A couple of the rails around the bottom edge came off so had to glue them back on .
5 #### Fits like a glove and what a difference in suction for the shop vac with a clean filter
5 #### THIS SURGE PROTECTOR ACCOMMODATES THE LARGE PLUGS , AND ITS NICE TO HAVE THE COLOR IDENTIFICATION AND THE LONG CORD WITH THE PROTECTION .
5 #### This is a great option for homeowners who do n't compost on - site , because it 's easy to bring this container to your car and dump it out at the green waste dump . Then it crushes down to just a few inches tall for storage in your car or garage . I put a bag inside to keep it from getting too dirty when weeding or dumping wet leaves into the container . The hard shell base makes it easy to drag to your car without damage if it gets heavy with weeds ! The 30 - gallon size holds a normal black 33 - gallon trash bag easily .
5 #### Bought as a gift to replace an old one . Love it !
4 #### The skimmer section is perfect . Have used item several times . Dislike the black section because the upper section bends and you lose control of the skimmer .... minor issue .
5 #### I 'm a single person who does n't need to can quart jars or huge loads . This canner is perfect for my small needs . Canner holds 5 pint jars and works a dream !
4 #### arrived on time have used some and it performs well
5 #### Ordered with other quick connector items to use with my pressure washer . Love the way it saves so many trips back to the faucet to cut the water off so I can switch out hoses . I ordered more of the same items to take to my folk 's place .
5 #### Love it - we own several , and have given many as a gift . Keeps the lettuce crisp and dry . Spin is the way to go .
5 #### For that price , ca nt beat it . Seem to last as long as the more expensive ones too . Very good value
1 #### Nothing compared to weber . Sub par smoke . What a difference quality wood makes .
5 #### I ordered this primarily bc it was cordless since I have handicap issues never expecting it to pick up like a regular vacuum . this eureka cordless vacuum is absolutely amazing ! it picks up as well as my dyson ball vacuum ! when I emptied the dirt holder it was packed ! I am so very very satisfied with the purchase . every time I use it i 'm amazed all over again . I wholeheartedly recommend this vacuum for anyone regardless of physical abilities or disabilities !
5 #### Superior salad spinner . Works better than the one I 've had for years , so I upgraded . Love the feature where the handle collapses to help fit it in a smaller shelf size . Spins really fast , really easy .
5 #### What fun ! I have always wanted a Salad Spinner and I am not sure why I wanted so long ? There is not real reason - do n't wait . This is smooth and so easy , glad I finally pressed buy ! Thank you .
5 #### This unit has done a nice job edging the sidewalks / flower beds in my smaller yard . Highly recommend !
5 #### I 'm never disappointed with the sound of a Woodstock chime .
3 #### These are the best sized and heavier weight pans for compact counter top ovens , but the finish comes off after several uses . This has been a common complaint , but Nordicware has n't done anything about it . I continue to use them at my own peril ... ( is that pepper or pan flakes ? )
5 #### Great item ! Exactly what I was looking for . Highly recommended ! !
2 #### Bought 3 of these and one split near the connecter after second use . Past date to return to Amazon .... Best to get these at local hardware store and keep recpt .
5 #### These are lovely . Meant to be used outside , but the finish is nice enough to be used indoors , too . Very sturdy -- two people could not bend one ( we tried ) . Even came with the screws to hang , so it was a snap to install four in less than 15 minutes . The 6 inch measure is to the OUTSIDE of the ring .
2 #### Everything in my order that was from OXO was well designed , but made in China . If I had known , I would have avoided it .
5 #### This zapper is made very well and really works as advertised , I have yet to find a bug it ca n't zap to death , including roaches . The dog 's nose is particularly sensitive to a zap , but he wo n't get close enough for you to do it again . So far same batteries have lasted for nine months , and zapper appears strong as ever . I would say it is well worth the money and gets there quick with Prime shipping .
5 #### I 've been looking for a new whisk for a while . After seeing a review for this whisk on one of the PBS cooking shows , I decided to try my luck . I have been very happy with how this whisk has stood up to de - glazing a pan as well as how easily I 've been able to integrate air into egg whites or to bring a batter together . This whisk was also very comfortable to hold , not only for my ham - sized hands but also for a kid 's hands as well . At this point , the only thing left to test is how long it lasts .
4 #### As other reviewers have noted , it works well but does get gummed - up and needs rinsing after awhile . Rinsing makes it too slippery to work ...
5 #### Love this measuring cup and all of the different units of measure that it has . I especially love it when I have to measure liquids in quantities between 1 - 2 cups !
4 #### Built quite cheap looks like it will break easy . However it works great
5 #### The ladder works well and is all I had hoped for . My only disappointment was when I saw the identical ladder at our local Lowe 's for an equally low price .
1 #### I ordered two of these mousetraps in August of 2010 . I chose the product because it was very similar to another brand I purchased months before . That product caught mice , but was made of plastic and after emptying the trap three times ( It caught five mice for me ) the little buggers managed to chew enough damage to render it useless . Unfortunately this promising metal trap is unattractive to mice . After five months with it in the same location I 've only caught two mice . I started putting conventional baited spring traps in the same area and I have to empty them every day , so I know the expensive metal traps are n't doing the job .
5 #### Super sharp , comfortable in your hand , and can different sizes of vines , branches , herbs , etc . Love this handy tool for my growing garden and would recommend this product to anyone !
5 #### I worked it so that I can see my reflection in the bottom and it does a remarkably good job for such an inexpensive plane . I was able to plane both across and even with the grain of some Cherry to the point that it did n't even need to be sanded . Good weight on it too for such a little thing . I liked that .
2 #### Do n't buy this set unless you ca n't get the stick and block separately . The featherboard is complete trash and should be thrown away immediately . I have n't used the stick , though it looks like you could make a longer and nicer one in a few minutes . I do , however , use the push block all the time and have found it to be very useful . There are certainly applications were it does n't work that a custom one would , but that 's always the case . I can recommend the push block , could go either way on the stick and just put the featherboard in the trash and back away . Buy the other two separetly if you want them and save [ $ $ $ ] .
4 #### Bought this and a few other zesters that we 're all metal . This one , by far , has the most comfortable grip due to the rounded shape and rubber . The cutting " teeth " are sharp and cuts zest easily .
5 #### Amazingly , this was installed unpainted and matched the ceiling perfectly .
5 #### Best gro fertilizer I have found . Great for indoors but it goes fast outdoors .
5 #### These are refillable with thistle and a funnel and gives your little songbirds some food of their own that the bigger birds do n't even try to eat .
5 #### For around $ 20 , I was n't too hopeful this would be that great . But really , the quality is there . No need to spend more on a cover , this one will do .
4 #### Pictured as promised . Easy assembly . A little light weight but placed against a post and anchored securely .
4 #### Do n't expect the same performance of their original designed clamps but if you ask me others that I have tried have also failed and this product despite its limitations has the upper hand , It works fine for less demanding projects that 's all I can say .
5 #### Came on time , as pictured , and undamaged . I needed a hose for my new dehumidifier , and this does the job .
5 #### So far so good , nice study handle and has n't broken yet !
5 #### These are measuring spoons ... not a whole lot to write about , but they work well , appear accurate . I like that have the rubber grips and they are easy to remove from their keyring holder thing . The cup part themselves are stainless steel which makes for easy cleanup and durability .
1 #### This tool may have some other uses that I do n't know of , but it is just too flimsy for icing cakes with anything other than whipped cream . I think it 's also much too short and narrow for the job , but that 's probably a personal preference .
4 #### In general , works as advertised . One of the " sets " I received was two female ends ! Watch for accuracy . I had already opened it . Overall , easy to use .
5 #### Channel lock makes some of the best pliers on earth . Will last your Lifetime .
4 #### BUT the plastic 8 oz bottle broke -- can I get another bottle -- no . 217 ? ?
5 #### I was looking for bypass pruners with a good locking mechanism , this one has been great so far .
5 #### It was easy to put the handles on and it cuts beautifully . I 'm a 69 yo woman and just sodded 144 sq ft and needed to have an easy lawn mower .
4 #### Black and Decker makes this part . It fits just fine . It works just fine . It wears out a little quickly , so I 'll buy another one .
5 #### Sprouts are the future . I predict as people start raising more of their own food their popularity will grow exponentially . DD
5 #### I see by the construction that it may be hit or miss with what you get ... But come on , it 's under $ 30 so why not give it a shot ? The one I got was in perfect condition , so yay for me . This hibachi is VERY heavy and traditional . It is made out of pig - iron so you can break it if you drop it or pour cold water on it . It also will rust ... so bring the grills inside when you 're done , clean them and give them a bit of oil and store them inside . I do n't mind a little rust on the rest of the hibachi . You can oil it down if you want but again , this is n't some massive investment so not to worry . - Keep in mind , this is a hibachi and if it 's windy outside ? It 's not going to perform very well . You can always make a wind screen if you want to hassle ... I just fire up the Weber kettle instead . Also , wrap the handles in foil to keep them from burning and do n't pile coal to the edge near the handles , leave an inch gap . - I 've made a ton of Yakitori on this with good results . But again , it is very weather dependent so wait for the calm days to break it out . - If this were to break or get stolen , I 'd buy another in a heartbeat ... In fact , for the price ? I might by a spare in case they stop being sold .
5 #### People who complain about this product must be trying to cut 1/2 inch branches with it because it is great for trimming bushes and hedges ; makes the job so much easier than with the heavy wood - handled trimmers I had . The minute I opened the box I went out and whacked down several spirea , red willow and other bushes ; if you want to trim thicker branches use the $ 75 Felco lopper and save this tool for trimming bushes and hedges with branches under 5 mm diameter , which is what it is designed for .
5 #### Great gloves for the home DIYer . I go through at least a pair a year - sometimes more . Especially if I am working with stone or pavers . Important tip - If you sweat , like I do , cut the wrist tightener off . Otherwise when you wipe the sweat off your forehead you may scratch your forehead .
5 #### WOW ! ! ! Surpassed my expectations . Thought I could get a bit of supplementary heat in my greenhouse now that it is getting cold . This guy rocks ! I ca n't believe that it heats the entire place ( 10'x20 ' ) so well . I 'm using the greenhouse a lot later this year and that makes me happy ! Also I 'm not all that technical when it comes to gas appliances , but the operation is very simple . It has been very reliable so far .
4 #### Santa Claus left this screwdriver in my stocking for Christmas . I want to thank the reviewer from Hamilton , OH for the heads up on this product 's design flaw . I will be very careful not to rotate the battery , and thus break off the recessed contact , when inserting it into the handle . That is why this rates only 4 stars . Otherwise , I find this tool to be a helpful companion to my 6.0 volt Black & Decker drill . Now , I do n't have to stop and change from a drill bit to a driver bit when intalling screws . It has more power than I anticipated , and its slower than expected speed is good for maintaining control in tight places . I 've used this screwdriver to hang electrical boxes in the attic , and run drywall screws into 1/4 " plywood sheating . I like having this power in my hand to grab screws at odd angles and run them in quickly when I am in an awkward posision and can not turn a hand screwdriver easily with one hand . Just remember to remove and cap the battery before tossing the tool back into your tool tote . Since there is no locking mechanism , the trigger can be pushed by other tools and run the power down .
5 #### I 've been using this for the last 4 days while I renovate part of the house . I like the tool . I set it up on a DEWALT DWX724 Compact Miter Saw Stand ( see : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004U4S7S4/ ) using two of the 4 supplied bolts that came with the Dewalt stand . So far I 've used if for framing and I ca n't imagine ever going back to using a hand saw for this kind of work . So far I 've made both 90 and 45 degree cuts .
1 #### Works ok but impossible to clean top even soaked in h20 and Clorox . White becomes brown .
5 #### My husband has turned cooking of pancakes in this pan down to a science . You use one large fry pan to flip the pancakes in once they are ready to be flipped . Both pans need to be sprayed with PAM so it does n't stick . Cook pancakes on medium heat or setting 6 out of 9 . They are ready to flip once you start to see bubbles on top . Spray your fry pan and have that heating at medium heat as well . Then flip into the fry pan and flatten the pancakes . Cooks perfectly . We did invest in a cupcake pen so that the pancake batter does n't splash everywhere . We use all types of batter for the pancakes . We even add a few bananas , honey , and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract to make the pancakes more flavorful . We make these once a week at least . My daughter definitely eats more pancakes than she normally would . We even take pancakes as snacks in the car .
3 #### Too much crap on the beaker . KISS . The beaker is too busy , and the print is small , not easy to see if you are lacking in the visibility department .
4 #### Interesting that the GrassGator web site sells this same pack of 4610 blades for $ 7.99 , and they ship it for $ 2.41 via USPS .
1 #### I just received my Martin House , unpacked it , laid all the parts out and started reading the instructions . I am not dim , these instructions are the least possible amount of effort a company could put into this . Bad schematics , 72 + parts and likely many more nuts and bolts . Re - assign the person that wrote the instructions and hand someone of average intelligence the unopened box and film it . Repeat that process while re - writing the instructions until it is simple . After reading how poor the pole is and that the house is n't Starling resistant I realized I got what I paid for , not much . I just watched a YouTube video on how to cut out the interior walls to really accommodate Purple Martins . In short , a lot of assembly required , no helpful YouTube videos and not really properly engineered for the bird , it just looks good . I am returning mine and spending more after more research .
5 #### This is exactly what I was looking for to store some grilling supplies on my deck . It has kept my charcoal and tools dry with no problems .
5 #### Not a comfortable as a full - fabric / padded hammock but I did n't expect it to be . It is still very comfortable , plus I can keep it up all the time and it wo n't kill the grass ( in my small yard , the hammock stays in one spot ) . It also dries quickly after it rains . I think the newer cord , while not as soft as natural cotton is fine and should hold up a long time . Get the pillow to go with it to top it off ! I lay out in the evenings and stare at the stars and get grounded and away from this crazy world .....
5 #### The batter bowl is very handy to use . Does not stain . I used it for jello squares and the color did not show at all when I washed it out . I bought another set for my daughter . It pours nicely too .
5 #### I installed this on a low flow well with 2hp pump , PumpTec and typical control box . I 'm pumping into a cistern , so there is a float shutoff also . Of course you 'll need to get your wiring right . I just put this in front of all the other devices mentioned above . I have been using an Intermatic old style mechanical switch which had a mininum on / off time of 1 hour which was draining the well during each on sequence . Now I can set the on / off sequences for 5 minutes a few times a day and never drain the well or activate the PumpTec . Fairly easy to program times once you understand the sequence .
3 #### Measuring cups are pretty self - explanatory . They are all attached to a plastic bar / ring , which is kind of annoying as the cups seem to slip off quite easily . Otherwise , the cups work as well as expected .
5 #### This is a replacement for my older lopper which finally gave out . Have used this unit several hours without any problems . Love the gear assistance . I would definitely recommend tem to a friend .
5 #### It was a lot larger than what I thought it would be but then again I was n't looking at the measurements for it . It works great .
3 #### Probably works great but the package and Amazon 's ad say it fits a Shindaiwa trimmer and there 's no metric , reverse - thread bolt to attach it to my Shindaiwa . I do n't want to spend a year looking for one , either . It could n't be too tough to include the proper 5 cent bolt and make everybody happy . Too bad .
1 #### These need to be sturdier and work better . One split open and the contents spilled out when my son dropped it only 2 - 3 feet while trying to hang it ( you should include wire or string , too ) and the other has n't caught many flies at all . About 5 in a whole week . It 's hanging in a stable !
5 #### I lost my caps several years ago . So I put tape around the ends of my extension . Not quite the same as the caps . I just finished painting the exterior of my house and the caps worked well and did not mark up any previously painted area .
5 #### I bought three of these balls so I could make different teas in stainless steel pots . I just made the Davidson hibiscus tea using the ball but did n't follow instructions other than poured boiling water over ball hooked on the rim of the pot . The Instruction said to use two to three spoons of the hibiscus tea ca n't remember if it called for teaspoons or tablespoons but to be on the safe side I used one teaspoon and brewed it for about three minutes and I love it . Supposed to be good for high blood pressure . I do n't have high blood pressure . I just like the tea . I ca n't imagine brewing it according to instructions as I believe it would be too strong for my taste but I 'm about to pour me another cup and am so pleased with the tea ball and did n't have any trouble using it . I will continue to buy amazons " Davidson 's teas using my cute , nifty little tea ball . My opinion of herb teas , which I call weed teas , has been negative . I use lemon grass tea when I poach skinless , boneless chicken thighs and onions wrapped in cheese cloth : and tied with twine , both of which I buy at Amazon but lemon grass in a cup is a pure - o - dee weed tea in my opinion I love the hibiscus tea I bought fromAmazon but do n't believe I will ever brew it according to instructions and perhaps be turned off by a strong bitter brew ..
5 #### must have for all wood workers . this is really well made . this is not harbor freight junk . i got this for one of our custom cabinet projects . works like a charm . already paid itself few times over with one job . highly recommend it .
5 #### We bought the pot because my husband got me a Nuwave Precision Cooktop for Christmas . However the Nuwave died after about 3 weeks of use . Sent it back but kept the pot . Needed another big pot that did not stick . Really enjoy using this pot , great for big batches of soup .
5 #### When I was apprenticing in a cabinet shop , we used the # 330 , My dad gave me one for Christmas in 1987 , I still use it daily . It fits my hand comfortably , the switch is right under my thumb , it is smooth , quiet and effective . You can sand flush to inside corners . I have used 1/4 sheet pad sanders by Makita , Dewalt and Black & Decker . I ca n't understand why anyone would want one , they are noisy , uncomfortable and vibrate . The # 330 is a truly pleasant tool to work with and one that will last for years of constant service .
5 #### It works ! This thing is magic when used under the right conditions . I was very skeptical at first but this thing actually works . It works best when it can create a " cloud " of protection around you . Since it emits vapors ( a tiny bit of smoke ) wind and walking about really hurt it protection performance . But , if you are sitting somewhere and the wind is calm this thing really works ! It emits a tiny bit of smoke with a faint smell but it 's not objectionable . I 've used it when hog hunting in the swamp . On the walk in I 'm totally covered by mosquitoes . Once I get to the stand I turn it on and place it at my feet . Within a minute 90 % of the mosquitoes are gone and all are gone in 5 minutes and remain gone until the pad has expired . I get almost 5 hours of protection from each pad which is a hour more than the advertised four hours . It even works in moderate rain . The flame is contained within the appliance so it 's not extinguished by rain but a very heavy rain can cool the pad to the point it does not emit the protecting vapors . I had given up on hunting during summer because of the mosquitoes until discovering this little beauty .
5 #### Nice to have a sharp blade again . Old peeler is 8 years old and is dull .
5 #### Heavy but good solid quality . Feels like something made in the 1960 's .
5 #### My dog was digging in our garden , which had to stop . I looked for solutions online and discovered this gem . After we put it in the garden , the digging stopped pretty quickly . It 's funny to watch the dog head to the garden to dig only to be surprised by the sprinkler ... Be careful though , if you forget to turn the silly thing off and get within range you 'll get a good soaking ! My wife laughed so hard when I got sprayed and practically broke my neck trying to get out of the way .
5 #### Nothing new . Same as my 12V light that never dies . Gets banged around nicely and works well . Focus feature could be nice tho . As said before- love those bare tool deals .
5 #### I sprinkle them in my birdbath , gutters , anywhere there is standing water .
5 #### Monster ! Yes , we used this for a 300 people event and was perfect ! Very fast .
5 #### Love apple wood , and this is cheaper ( with shipping ) than I can buy it locally .
5 #### I 've been using this clock / thermometer for several months without any problem at all . It 's very handy to know the absolutely correct time without ever having to set the clock , and to know the temperature outside before I even get out of bed . I thought I might have problems because the clock / display unit is on my bedside table , while the ideal location for the outdoor temperature sensor is about 80 feet away at the other end of the house , with five outside walls between , but the signal came through right away . Occasionally ( once a week or so ) I 'll look and the outside temperature is blank , but it always recovers in a few minutes . Other people have complained about not receiving the atomic clock signal from Colorado in the Northeast , but I 'm in Rochester NY and it comes through fine here . I only use the alarm to wake me up from naps , and it 's fine for that . If this were my primary alarm clock I 'd need a snooze button , which this does n't have . I 'm still on the original batteries ( 2 AAs in the outside sensor , 2 AAAs in the clock ) , even through the winter when battery performance should have been at its worst . Based on reviews of other Oregon Scientific products with similar functions , I half expected this to be an unreliable piece of junk , but so far I could n't be happier .
5 #### I got this for my girlfriend and I think I 'm going to get one for myself . The intention was for her to use the light to read while I sleep , but I 've found it to be so helpful in providing flat , even and powerful illumination that I use it even when I 'm alone ! The light really is very , very even with no fall - off or shadows within the beam . It easily covers facing pages of a hardcover book , and it does n't quite illuminate all of a textbook . The light stops pretty abruptly at the edge , which is a good sign - there 's no fade off . After so many years of using b - list , subpar book lights , I did n't think I could get one for less than $ 50 that would be any good . Totally wrong !
5 #### Easy to use . Better than electric can openers . Cleans well and not a hardship to open cans .
5 #### A great addition to any recipe . I 've chosen my favorite items out of each line to make a special formula I 've designed to my likes . This is the gold nugget in technaflora 's line . Trial and error , braddah . This covers lots of micro nutrients that are lost to other products .
5 #### The last pair lasted me 5 years of use . Great product . But like any other tool , do n't leave it in the rain .....
5 #### This vacuum sucks ! ! ! ! But like in a good way . Seriously though it 's really great and cheap . Go for it ! ! !
5 #### I wanted a non metallic tool when treasure hunting with my metal detector . This wo n't set off my pinpointer and perfect for loose dirt and/or getting debris out of the way on the ground . It 's light weight so easy to carrry . I 'd use it for gardening around the home but for me flowers are nothing more than something to aim for with my mower ... so really not used for the " proper " purposes !
2 #### Need to replace my old Nordic Ware Bundt pan and was really hoping this would work . Sadly , it is no where near as heave as my old one . The web site says this is the ' original ' and it is ' heavy ' . I find this hard to believe . It claims there is an extra large center tube , my old pan is bigger . The only bonus was the handles . I 'm not even going to waste my time baking with it . I am off to a professional baking store .
5 #### I really liked this pot , Holds quite a bit . lightweight , the weight of the stainless steel seems to be a good quality . I had bought another Brand a few years back and it was so Heavy ! I could hardly work with it when i needed to dump out the water .
4 #### The ground has frozen so I wo n't be using this until spring for metal detecting , but its got the right heft and length and angles that I believe will make this a very useful tool . I will be wrapping the handle with friction tape as it is a bit slender for my XL glove sized hands . Probably will drill a hole and put a loop of Amsteel on it for carrying .
5 #### This is my squirrel - deterrent . Cardinals love it . So do doves . It 's pricey , but keep in mind that it 's lightweight seed .
5 #### This is my first home espresso maker , and it turns out to have been an excellent choice . Now I have both a French Press ( different company ) and an Espresso Maker , and they turn ordinary ground coffee into better than what I could get at most coffee shops .
5 #### I have 3 of these cultivators , somehow they just keep appearing , and they 're really fantastic . I also have much more expensive solid stainless steel garden tools and the Fiskars , when used right , get the job done . I mean , for less than $ 2 , it 's hard to complain . Here 's what they 're good for -- moving loose soil , compost , leaves , etc . They 're not for digging in hard dirt or trying to rip out roots . They 're $ 2 garden claws that work better than your hands . I use them for moving soil around fresh plantings and working in my plant containers . For the hard stuff , I reach for the steel . Spend the $ 2 and get these if you have n't already .
5 #### This , in my opinion , is essential to the Weber Kettle grill . it has produced excellent roasted chicken and turkey breast . Now I 'm ordering a basket to cook vegetables and ribs . Amazon the only place to buy from , and the venders who sell through Amazon rock also . Highly recommended !
4 #### I was a little worried to order this axe for splitting firewood . In general , this is a very good axe for most of your splitting needs . The only issue I have with the axe is that it is not designed for driving splitting wedges and the metal of the axe itself is a little soft . I would prefer to have a axe that has much harder steel to retain its edge . Any little nick or ding in the blade will cause it to roll over and dull . I have to attempted to sharpen it yet and it still splits fine .
5 #### Short and to the point - I am much more impressed with the build quality of this leviton connector it is exactly what i needed .
5 #### Bought this for Mum for her birthday , and she 's LOVING IT . Great product . Well made .
5 #### Bought this to for storing items on the front porch . So far it 's EXCELLENT ! It snapped together easy , no special tools needed . Since it 's plastic , no worry about water & I have other Suncast products that have tolerated Texas sun for over ten years . Set this small storage bench in a hidden spot on my porch to tuck away a few loose yard items , without considering other practical uses . Mail courier has already used it to hide boxes & it has come in handy to set things down while unlocking the door .
4 #### Works great on cabinets . Easy to use and almost guaranties a good fit . Would recommend to a friend if they needed one .
5 #### Very nice quality skewers made in Italy . So much nicer than using bamboo skewer that need to be soaked , splinter , and burn . Flat sides make things tend ( but do not guarantee ) that things wo n't rotate on the skewer to make flipping easier .
5 #### Good all around measuring cup . I have trouble with conversions so this thing is a gem .
5 #### Needed a blade to cut very dense lumber in South America . Other blades required extremely slow feed on my Fire Storm table saw . Even then they would " burn " and leave VERY rough rips on CHANU lumber . Chanu is used for ceiling beams and it gets harder as it gets older . After chanu drys pilot holes for nails are required or the wood will crack / split . Tough stuff . The first time this blade was used on Chanu it cut like it was being fed pine 2x4 ! ! ! Was very pleased with the performance . My cheap saws have new life ! ! The thin kerf requires much less power and the saws perform better . The thin kerf wastes less material and is important to me because most of my rips are " free " lumber scraps from the lumber yards or from the " fruit box " fabricators ! ! ! Amazing but scrap " Nogal " ( pecan ) is plentiful , , see it used a lot for cooking fires . Would recommend .
3 #### Good reviews from others . But I have n't seen particularly visible improvements .
5 #### Herons . Love them or hate them . They are beautiful and I love birds , but I have a lake stocked with koi . Enough said ? The decoys , the gazing balls , and all the other heron - repelling devices are useless from the get - go or soon out - thought by the big birds with the big brains . I ca n't say the Scarecrow keeps them away forever but it minimally makes them wary ( one wave of my hand and they fly away now , while at first they just laughed unless I was close enough to heave a rock at them ) . This will more than make your investment worthwhile if you are watching a heron walk within range of the Scarecrow and see it get smacked with a squirt of water . A delightful screech and they are off ( for a while ) . Yes , I recommend this . Buy several if you have a lake and move them around for greater effectiveness . ( No doubt works well for other predators but I can not comment from experience ) .
5 #### Fair price , quick ship . Nice finish on screws . Pocket hole screws and jig make for a quick and hidden assembly of assorted frame assemblies and more . Be sure to use coarse for soft wood and fine thread for hardwood .
5 #### I bought this to quickly make stocks , and cook soups and vegetables . It really does work , and makes yum - yum foods quickly , when one does n't have the time to spend 3 hours making foods . I 'm impressed by the quality of the stainless steel , particularly the bottom , which is pretty thick . I do n't see any downsides to owning one .
5 #### Really controls the algae in my 25 gallon backyard fountain . Algae had been a problem , but no more .
3 #### The clamp is solidly made , works well , but does not support anything larger than 3 " in width . So if you 're making a cabinet door with 1x4 's as the frame , and mitered corners , this will not work for you .
5 #### This is my second one , my daughter ' stole ' the first one . We both love it A REAL MUST HAVE
4 #### I bought this tapering jig prior to tapering my first table leg . It was inexpensive , I was inexperienced , 'nuff said . The surprise came with its performance . Although I am confident that I could bend this thing in half if I was in the right mind , it does a really good job of guiding my workpiece through the saw . The adjustment feature is simple and easy to use , but the " graduated scale " is a bit hard to use accurately . To set it up , I simply adjust it by eye and then measure from the blade to the trailing edge of the guide . This trial and error usually takes no more than a minute or two , and the jig stays locked on my final setting for as many cuts as I need to make . Although there are nicer , more expensive versions out there , you can not beat the value for the money with this tool .
5 #### Makes the job a lot easier . Used to have to run 100 ' of extension cord from the garage then wrestle it around like an Anaconda all over the yard . Cord would come unplugged and I had to constantly be on my toes to not cut across the cord . Cuts a nice even line right where I want it and it has reduced the time I spend messing with yard work .
4 #### Gift for a friend - easy to assemble - should work well - but of course can not compare to a gas grill
5 #### I like this model , I am from Brasil and I am used to cook in a pressure cooker the food taste better .
5 #### Works very well . It builds steam / pressure in very short time hence cooking time reduces significantly . Cleaning it is relatively easier as compared to Aluminum one from same brand , Presto . I love to cook in it !
5 #### This little tool is awesome ! it sure saves time as in one quick motion it takes out the core including all the seeds . Great time saver and well worth the money . Easy to clean . Wish I had purchased it years ago .... highly recommend .
5 #### This is a very handy little system , it arrived promptly with all its components and took about 15 minutes to assemble ; it 's very well - designed with its ' locking mechanism for adjusting the height of the lamps as the seedlings grow , and out - of - season can be disassembled and stashed away very easily . I 'd recommend this to my friends , and am thinking about buying a second unit as this one is already pretty crowded with seedlings , which are happily growing BTW . My garden will be WAY cuter this year because of this dandy little doodad .
2 #### OK but took it back after one use . I used it to make mashed potatoes . Even though I had only a small amount of potaotes in the mill , they kept being pushed to the top and spilling over . I had to turn the handle several times back and forth before the food would actually go throught the holes in the plate .
5 #### This actually worked out much better then expected . Not only does it look nice and easily cover my well head , but it has held up extremely well to rain and snow and summer heat . I have also not noticed any damage from numerous line trimmer uses around it and a few bumps with the lawn mover . I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cover an ugly well head in the middle of their lawn .
5 #### It 's a whisk , it 's little , it works better than most . I will buy a larger version of the same brand . I like it , so far .
4 #### Slightly pricey , but you get what you pay for . The ergonomics of the product are well thought out . Can be used as an unwieldy but viable stabbing or slicing tool in the event of a home invasion .
2 #### These bend at the flat part very easily if you leave them hanging during installation .
5 #### This product is best suited for hand - carried or stationary use . If you need a container to drag around your yard as you perform your lawn & garden tasks , I recommend the hard shell base version ( 9413 ) . I use a 5 - gallen bucket and wheelbarrow to collect and transport my lawn and garden debris to this container ( 9405 ) . I also use this product as a garage and outdoor event trash container .
5 #### Update : I purchased this nozzle over a year ago , this is my second spring with the nozzle . It is still working very well , no leaks , no rust , no complaints . Note that I store it inside during the harsh New England winters . I had a number of nozzles in the past , but this metal Gilmour select - a - spray metal nozzle and has become my favorite and I like it better than my other nozzles . When it is attached to my hose it produces no leaks even when I leave the water faucet turned on . I have a very strong water pressure , and some older nozzles generate a leak even when I wrap every connection with Teflon tape . I like the springy feel of the handle as well as its ergonomic handle . I am attaching a photo under customers photos which shows the 5 spray options available on this nozzles . I use the wide - gentle - spray in the garden most of the time . The fine mist will be great in my herb garden . And strong spray worked well to get the winder grime off my car . This nozzle feels well constructed and has a nice pleasant to feel to it when you hold it . It has become my favorite nozzle . Ali Julia review
3 #### These are thin and flimsy . Used these for yard markers , and they snap with very little pressure .
5 #### Reviewed mixing bowls extensively before buying this brand . Great quality , not light - weight . Like it that it is brushed stainless inside . Just the right size for everyday , like cake mix , pancakes , etc . Thinking of getting other sizes .
5 #### great anti - allergen filters . my fiancee has allergies and this definitely helps !
5 #### IT IS JUST THE THING FOR WEAK HANDS . It is so easy to turn . I do n't need my electric opener now .
4 #### Very happy with the performance thus far . It 's killing a ton of bugs ! I just wish it was easier to clean , I just bang the bottom a bit to shake out all the fried bugs ... though I guess it would n't be easy to fix that problem !
3 #### I bought 4 of these , placed them randomly in the backyard hoping to be rid of the nasty flies that keep coming into the house every time we open the door ... after a few days I noticed each bag contains quite a few flies that fell into it , however , the bait that came w/ each bag really stinks over time as it sits outside in the heat ; now every time i go into the backyard it smells like a fish market . I need to start looking for another fly trap that 's non - poisonous , and yet wo n't stink up our yard ...
2 #### Honestly ... these are best used in a trailer park . The scalloped edge that goes inward toward the bed is just ... not attractive . They are good and flexable and quite easily bend around a sharp curved adge . I used a utility knife to cut the " ends " and it was n't that difficult but use a new blade . If you live north of the Mason - Dixon line ... good luck pounding these in to the ground , lol ! We had pebbles , yes pebbles , the size of a large marble that stiopped these from being pounded in . We finally had to just excavate to the depth we needed , set them in place and backfilled . I do n't think my remarks are a slam against the quality of the product as they work as described . I just think they look cheap , do n't pound in very easily and have some seperation issues between two pieces . If you were able to pound these in , it would still be difficult to do considering you have to hook these together before you pound them in ... you better have a nice sandy soil !
5 #### Finally bought one of these . I do a lot of remodel - renovations . A lot of custom trim work . Most of these places have n't seen maintenance in 50 years . I have to fabricate a lot of the millwork to match the existing trim . This bit will certainly help me with that . Thank you Freud . Now will someone tell me where I can get a Colonial - style 3 1/2 " router bit .
4 #### I bought this as a stocking stuffer for my daughter - in - law but may have to buy another for myself . If it a small and slim flashlight so wo n't take up much space in a purse . Will come in handy if out at night . Comes with a battery too .
5 #### I have discovered this timer is fully interchangeable with the Intermatic T104 . I currently have a T104 that bit the dust after about 5 years so I decided to try to save a little money and purchase only the guts only for my older timer but found it was actually cheaper just to buy a complete WH40 unit . Once I received the WH40 I realized it was almost identical to my T104 ... The cover on the WH40 has a cutout that allows you to manually turn the unit on and off without actually opening the box . Which is nice ! You can easily change the cover / door of the T104 to the WH40 by simply bending the little chrome hinge tabs straight , installing the new door and bending them back , As for the guts , a spring clip at the top holds them in place , simply push up on this clip , remove the T104 guts and install the WH40 's In my opinion it is much easier doing this than installing and wiring in the new box ... Took me about 10 minutes tops . As for the WH40 ... This timer seems to be working fine ... I will update my review if that changes .
3 #### It 's really almost too big a bird feeder and the perch legs are too short . Only little birds can land on the legs and they 're not likely to do so with such a massive feeder . It 's expensive , it 's difficult to clean because of the way the lid attaches to the base . The feed holes are too small as well . I would pass on this ; just too many negatives .
5 #### Excellent quality . We used the to make pony bead suncatchers so they 've even held up to being on our gas grill several times .
5 #### I love the ease of use on these shears , plus they are very quiet . I also bought a old fashioned mower , no more motors in this yard , just a great way to exercise .
5 #### Best pruners out there ! And not just for pruning . For biggish jobs and the most delicate deadheading .
4 #### I have a cheaper version that works just as well . This cost me twice more than that .
5 #### OXO makes great kitchen tools and this is no exception . These are well made and dishwasher safe . There are plenty of sizes to get the right amount of what you need for your baking . I highly recommend this , but if you want a measuring set with less sizes on it , the stainless steel one by OXO is nice too .
4 #### Pretty good so far . I have had a couple times so far that pushing the on button did not work the first couple pushes . I think perhaps that it is the sensitivity of the button itself . Make sure you push it square on and with force . It seems to work fine that way . Good distance to it too .
5 #### I know . It 's a plunger . But how many times in your life are ever going to have to make this purchase ? Why not get the best one , with smart design ? I chose this because it was n't much more than the highest rated plunger , which ... was just a plunger . So , knowing Oxo products are usually pretty good , I decided to go with this one . I 'm glad I did . It 's designed with a base that opens automatically when you reach for it , and that air dries the plunger when you 're done . Simple , nice looking ( does n't scream , " Hey , this is for unclogging your embarrassing biohazard ! " ) , and functional . Also , it seems to work fine with all types of toilets , even the new low flow ones . Definitely recommend .
2 #### The measuring labels ( 1 cup , 1/2 cup ) are printed on and wash off very easily , so you 're left guessing what 's what . Better to invest in a product with imprinted ( not screen printed ) labels .
4 #### Light weight , two settings for changing from hard surface to carpeting . I am pleased with this vacuum . Not difficult to assemble I did it in 10 minutes ?
5 #### Needed to go from 4 " d / c hose to typical shop - vac hose . This did the trick . Clamp 4 " on , and the 2 1/2 " port allows for the shop - vac end to make a tight fit and onto my tool ports .
1 #### piece of junk . do not believe the excellent reviews . I think they are paid ads .
4 #### Pretty expensive but seems like good quality . The stitching seemed a little loose but maybe it will tighten with use . I bought this for my dad so I have n't seen it since I installed it . I had a Pawleys hammock on his stand already but 7 + years of use had taken its toll . Hopefully this one performs like the last one .
5 #### This is my 4th 7539 in my shop . All 4 are still working good . I just have different apps in my shop
5 #### I purchased one of these for a friend and bought one for myself based on ease of use and the reviews on this page . Mine works great and appears to be accurate . As I buy more lumber from private sources ( ie neighbors , friends , auctions ) I 'll be a able to check moisture content .
5 #### Great knives , great price . Added to existing set , ready for prime time chef class and cooking beyond anyone 's wildest dreams .
2 #### When I made sprouts from them the sprouts had a smell to them . I read where this is common for Broccoli seeds but even when I rinse them a lot the smell was still there . I do not think this is a fault of the company but of the seeds themselves . However , you might like them .
5 #### This was super easy to install . I 'm a home DIY'r and this was pretty quick and simple . Probably only took about 10 minutes to complete . Seems like it might be better quality than the fluidmaster brand original part that was in my toilet to begin with .
5 #### It was exactly what I wanted . The delivery was fast .
5 #### These bulbs were larger in size than the original bulbs but they work very nicely .
5 #### I had one of these sanders before and loved it my hand s never got numb using this tool . Clamping the paper is a little different than others but to me it really does n't matter
5 #### I haven;t tried this yet but used it before and it worked great
5 #### I purchased this at home Depot . Price was lower . I am very pleased with the quality . My family really enjoys the table .
4 #### The weight was great but the suction is not . it works great on floors . not on rugs .
5 #### Now I have to wait to harvest ! ! ! It came as promised and we look forward to its fruit . Thank You
1 #### Do n't buy this . I should have listened to the negative reviews . They are right .. . . does not suction and slides down . I have tried everything to get it to hold to my stainless steel sink . So , after weeks of putting it back up several times a day I tossed it in the garbage .. . after all it did not cost very much anyways ! I am tired of it hanging and falling off . Goodbye terrible sponge holder and now I am on the hunt for another brand ! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Update . . .I decide to replace it with the StickerNizer . I am hoping my new sponge holder will work better than this one . The StickerNizer sponge holder has great reviews ! You can also buy a replacement suction part when it wears out .
5 #### Great Product for great price . Will be ordering once again . Added to my mels mix formula and also a handful to all my potted plants . dark black color and fresh .
5 #### I wrote a quick review for the OXO Measuring spoons as well . Pretty much the same comment . For the price , they ca n't be beat . They are light and easy to remove / replace and the markings are clearly and neatly written on them . The cups all have a marking which indicates a half measure as well which can be useful .
2 #### Maybe ok for hard floors , but it really does not work well for carpets . The battery charge does n't hold all that well either , and is not comparable to the old shark stick I had for 8 years . It was great for quick cleaning when I did n't want to drag out my big vac ... and carpet looked good . This does not lift the pile and makes funny zig zag marks . I will probably get another cordless and donate this .
3 #### there adequate for a bom but sometimes they " stick " and the you comeback 2 hours later and find your fan still on .
5 #### This high powered single jet burner is just what the doctor ordered . I have n't used it yet but have burnt off the black painted finished as recommended by some of the other reviewers . This thing is loud but it puts off plenty of heat for wok cooking which is what I plan to use it for .
4 #### Great idea by DeWalt . However , they are cumbersome to put on and the angles needed tweeking to get them straight . These will give you a false sense of security , though . I say that because I bought finger jointed paintable pine mouldings at a big - box store and all the dimensions were not perfectly the same from board to board ( different lots and manufacturers ? Dunno ) . But based on my assumptions , I was relying on the stops and not checking closely enough and ended up with troubles .
4 #### not much to go wrong here , except celo wrap was broken and one of the matching - color screws was missing . not worth the fuss to get corrected .
5 #### Recently I broke the handle off my doggie scooper which I had been using for a potting soil scoop while gardening . I replaced it with this one which is the best dirt scoop I have ever found . It is very durable and I even find myself using it in the garden moving dirt around .
5 #### Use it for cutting coconuts , and everything in between . Love the quality , feel in your hand , and ability to sharpen . Get one !
5 #### Great little caddy for sponges . the suction cups stay in place
4 #### My new makita drill came with the new nimh batteries which would not hold a charge for more than five minutes so I am switching back to the old style nicads which have served me well through many years of use . I have three of the batteries and they are great . I have two of the new type batteries and they are junk .
1 #### How can these be a number 1 Best Seller ? I am extremely disappointed in this item . Since they are a Fiskars product sold by Fiskars I am also very disappointed in the company . I was using them for the first time and found that I could n't cut a branch of 1/4 " without the cutters getting hung up . I even had a few such incidents cutting a 1/8 " twig . The cutting blade would bypass the branch being cut and leave a gap on the tool that you could see through . OK what should I have expected for $ 10.00 ? I was hoping for something that would last , at least , for the rest of this year and it 's now September 25th . No such luck . I 'll be replacing them tomorrow .
5 #### I have purchased several of the Amco serving pieces and they are perfect . You can use them on any type cookware and the handles are long and sturdy . I have several of the solid spoons and the fork from this series , and I love them all .
5 #### Worked perfectly to flip the lock over on the entry knob . Had been using the key upside down for so long , until I had to order a new knob and saw the instructions on the Kwikset website . In case you needed those instructions , you can find them here : http://www.kwikset.com/Customer-Support/Product-FAQs/Faq/50160000000HiH7AAK.aspx Otherwise , just go to the website and search " upside down key " and you 'll find them . They have a video too , but I just used the instructions .
4 #### I have yet to use this product ( thank goodness ) but hoping my experience will match the reviews I read if I need it break this out .
5 #### It is exactly what we wanted ; a comfortable kneeling pad , that is waterproof and insulates from the cold wet ground .
2 #### For the price this is a rip off . First , the " thin kerf " is five thou thicker and a comparable dealt blade , but I knew that going in and banked on the " legendary " clean cuts that are touted on the internet . Second , my first cut after installing : burned wood . I figured there might be some shmew do I did a couple more and kept getting the same result . My conclusion is this blade is not a horrible blade but is definitely mostly hype . Returning .
1 #### Bought these are couple of years ago due to Wiss reputation . I use them mainly to trim seal Tite metallic conduit after cutting it with a Sawzall . Worked good foam year or two but now the metal just goes sideways . Not a large investment will try Stanley or another brand . Not a fan of Wiss aviation shears any more .
5 #### Great whisk , easy to clean in the dishwasher . The end of it is a little bit big for mixing small things ( such as a single serving of eggs ) , but otherwise it works great .
5 #### What can you say about a switch plate cover . It 's brown . It covers the electrical wires and the nasty looking hole in the wall . It comes with two screws . It 's plastic . It does n't taste good .
5 #### I acquired an older Craftsman radial arm saw and put this new blade on it . Super smooth cuts and since its a thin kerf blade it cuts easier that a full kerf blade . Good buy for your RAS / Sliding miter saw .
5 #### Great quality , simple design , and easy to use ! It cuts through pizza just like it should . It 's just another one of the good quality OXO products I 've tried and own . I am very happy with it , especially the quality !
5 #### Fabulous little knife . An everyday pocket carry . Blades are surgically sharp . I plan to also buy the blue one !
2 #### My wife & I have owned two of these grind and brew units . Each of them stopped grinding beans after two years of moderate use - one pot per day . In our opinion , the quality of the coffee was very good , and the clean up was acceptable considering the wonderful aroma from fresh ground coffee that this machine delievered . The problem is the short lifetime of the machine . Twice burned , we will not purchase this model again .
5 #### My dog started off life living on the street in Taiwan so she is pretty much scared of everything , but the very first time we used this she just sat there and let me do her mani - pedi . When we used to use the clippers she would shake and squirm the whole time . This thing is great . It is very quiet . I have n't even run into the heat problems some people have reviewed . I can do all four paws in around 5 minutes and this thing was worth every penny I paid for it . My dog also has very dark nails so this is much safer than using clippers . I can tell if I 'm getting close to the quick since she gets a little more nervous so then I just back off . You can take off a very small amount at a time . The battery charger is also great . I just keep it plugged into the wall and I can easily pull out the battery and put it into the Dremel when I need it . I 've never lost power yet so do n't know how long it lasts . I guess it lasts long enough . Highly recommended .
5 #### nice size for the kitchen or the car . thank G - d have never needed to use it
5 #### I like it ! Use them for my pork ribs and port butt . Nice mild smoke flavor . And smells amazing .
5 #### I purchased the Breadman TR2200C Ultimate Bread Machine , a few months back . This machine lives up to the advertising ! I bake bread daily , using two machines . One is my ' old ' model Hitachi , and the other is , of course , my new Breadman Utlimate . The bread from the Breadman is consistently better in texture , cooking time and cleaning up time . I have experimented with many different recipes and have yet to find one that did not turn out to be a loaf of bread I could proudly serve to my family and friends . I would not ever hesitate to recommend the Breadman Ultimate to anyone who is seeking a quality bread machine .
5 #### I love this vacuum cleaner ! ! I replaced my upright very heavy vacuum with this lightweight more portable vacuum . This is easily carried up and down stairs . The only negative is that the cord does not rewind , and I have to pick it up to wrap the cord underneath the vacuum . It is a slight inconvenience , but , worth it .
5 #### This whisk is your typical size . It works well for larger pots of sauces , etc . Not good for needing to get close to the edge on a pot . There are smaller whisks that get closer to the edges . Overall , another great OXO product .
2 #### I bought this awhile ago . It was great , while it lasted . But then it started to break . The plastic piece at the ends of the arms is the failure point . First one side broke off . Since this is what keeps the metal part up , it made it hard to use . Then the other side broke and I tossed the whole thing .
5 #### Perfect for even making home fries . Had this for about a year now , and it 's still cutting like new . The construction looks flimsy put the slicer is actually quite robust . Sometimes the potato needs to be cut down slightly to fit threw the slicer , but not by much . But it can cut all sorts of potatoes from Russet to Golden , and makes thick or thin pieces . Also very easy to clean and the metal has n't shown any signs of wear or rust . The plastic body has n't cracked nor has the handle bent from any pressure . Comes with 2 different sized slicer grilles . One for small and one for large . Excellent deal for the price .
1 #### ... really , I did . I am a loyal Oxo customer and nearly everything in my kitchen is from either the Good Grips or the SteeL product line . I was really excited to use this on the fresh herbs I grew in my garden ... but it just flat out does n't work . It pains me to give an Oxo product only one star , but honestly , the thing is worthless . I 'd give it zero stars if I could . Even apart from the fact that the blades do absolutely nothing , it 's also extremely difficult to re - assemble it after you take it apart to clean it . It 's really just a big disappointment on multiple levels and it 's currently taking up space in my drawer .
4 #### I 'll admit that this is the best 1/2 sheet sander on the market and has been for 30 plus years . Simple to use , vibration free , reliable as the day is long and a high quality finish are all part of what you are buying with this model . So why have I given it a 4 star rating ? Two words , dust collection ... or lack thereof . For as long as this model has been on the market PC have still not given any serious consideration to how to effectively collect the considerable amount of dust generated by this tool . There is a boot PC sells as an add - on that fits over the base . However , unless your only sanding flat surfaces AND are willing to drag a vacuum hose around you can rule this accessory out . Something , anything would help especially with so much dust control regulations being imposed by various government agencies , work place safety boards , fire marshals and insurance companies . Other than that a great tool that will basically last forever . Highly recommended .
5 #### This is an excellent buy if you do n't have anything huge to cut .
3 #### I have a similar German made knife- It may be a Wusthof- can no longer tell the branding is rubbed off after 25 years , but I can say this : this knife is of lesser quality and lighter weight , although it is still a good knife . I would n't get this if I had a lot of kitchen work to do because the spine of the knife is actually a bit sharp and narrow and if you are holding it properly to chop it will become uncomfortable with prolonged chopping such as in a professional situation . Still a good knife , just a little light .
2 #### This blade does not measure a full 10 " in diameter . More like 9 7/8 " . If you plan to use it on a SawStop saw , you 'll either need to adjust the brake clearance whenever you use this blade , or know that the saw 's brake will have farther to travel to stop the blade in the event that you should need it to . I give it two stars because it might be a good blade , otherwise , but it 's being sold as a 10 " blade , which it is n't .
5 #### Have used it a lot myself doin industrial sheet rock 3/4 inch down to 1/4 and it hits it good . I leave the sheets on sides notch my blade in the mark I need and go . No need to flip and scratch other side bend at cut and run blade along bend . It does n't get any easier .
5 #### where have these been al my life ? I now have them on hose , sprinkler and water wand and powerwasher .
5 #### Bought as a Christmas gift and it was a big hit !
5 #### Best gift to the hubby ever ! ! His words not mine . This thing is great . You can put a couple chickens , a leg of lamb or even a small pig ( or half a big one ) . It cooks meat to perfection with smokey goodness . We use hardwood lump charcoal to complete the experience . I highly recommend buying that here on Amazon too . We have never had an issue with this in two years . Would make a great fathers day gift for those die hard charcoal grill lovers .
4 #### Using this as way to capture dust and shavings from my lathe . My concrete floor not perfectly flat so having issues to make the sweep evenly stick to the floor . Does help with cleanups , though .
1 #### This product is probably okay , but it was represented as fitting the Werner 22 ' adjustable ladder . It fits , but with considerable loss of height . This made it unusable for my purpose . When I contacted the vendor , not Amazon , I found that returning it included cost of shipping and a 10 % restocking fee and less than a friendly attitude . I will certainly avoid them in the future .
5 #### These are great bought several different packs for my fridge . Me and my husband have had fun leaving notes .
5 #### This is just what we thought it would be - a steel blade machete . My husband says its well made and will serve him well for brush or whatever he needs . We do know well have to watch it for rust so need to be sure its clean and dry after use but that s to be expected with steel .
5 #### Seems to work fine - get 's flies and moths . Ca n't tell about mosquitos ( probably too small to see their charred little bodies ) . But the mosquitos problem has decreased - might be a change in temperature , rainfall , wind or humidity . But I still recommend the zapper .
5 #### This stainless steel mixing bowl is a perfect addition to my kitchen supplies . My grandmother always had a large stainless steel bowl she used for so many things in the kitchen ... and I wanted one too that I knew would last throughout the years . This Amco bowl is definitely durable and I can see myself still using it 20 , 30 , 40 years from now ! I 've had it several months and there is a scratch or two from my hand mixer , but that 's to be expected . I have the 6 quart bowl too ... just wish I had more of the smaller sizes . Great for mixing up casseroles , cookies , shelling beans , sharing lots of popcorn , marinating meat , soaking a stained shirt .... the uses are endless !
3 #### Actually - never used it ..... seems to have been stolen from my garage . I will have to reorder to cover my fruit trees this summer ....
5 #### Quality nails , I used it on 3/4 hickory flooring with an auto nailer ( $ 120ish one ) . The only miss fires I had was when I hit the nailer to lightly . Otherwise these nails worked great . One note if you do not hit the nailer hard enough the nail will not go in deep enough . When this happened I used a hand held grinding wheel to cut off the nail at the tongue level . I think pulling the nails out would be impossible . Nails arrived on time and the packaging in tact . I liked these so much I repurchased when I decided to do additional flooring in other rooms .
4 #### Likes : Good quality . Easy to assemble . Perfectly packaged . Easy to move . Nice storage area under router . Dust collection works well ( I have it connected to a Fein Turbo II Dust Extractor ) . Came with two rods that can be installed behind split fence to join the edges of boards . I use my Dewalt DW618 and it fits just fine . Have not yet put a router lift in . Not sure if I will . It really is n't that big of a deal to change bits or adjust the depth of the router . Fence is straight and can be set up for near zero clearance . Quality materials . The miter gauge slot is an added bonus . Dislikes : The only issue I really have with this table is there is no external switch . You have to open the door to turn off the router . For the price , I think they could have included a paddle style switch on the outside of the table . If even for the sake of safety . I will add one ( Rockler sells a paddle switch for $ 30 ) . I looked at lots of router table options . My shed is my shop and space is at a premium so I knew I had to go with a benchtop model . At first I was leaning towards the Kreg . But the looks and reviews of the Benchdog won out in the end . This is a very nice table and I 'm very satisfied with my decision to purchase this over the Kreg .
3 #### I do n't really know how to use it . Tried it a few times when I first got it , burnt the bottom and stopped using it ever since . Hopefully I 'll learn how to work it properly down the road . A lot to invest into something I did n't really know how to use .
5 #### This knife is fantastic . I 've had mine for almost 25 years . I just bought one for my son . Pretty funny to see how much metal has been lost to sharpening over the years . I 'm getting ready to buy a replacement for mine , but I 'm not quite ready to give up on the one I have . The blade has stayed true , it holds an edge well , the handle has not degraded at all . It 's a true workhorse . I only wash it by hand . I might consider putting it in the dishwasher , but I use it so frequently , I could n't stand not having it available . Updated 03JAN2016 Yes ! I got a new one for Christmas . I thought I would retire my old one , but I 'm not ready to let it go just yet . So now I have two excellent knives in the drawer .
5 #### I have a cheap quality , thin aluminum bundt pan and every time I tried to bake in it , it burned ... This pan is the absolute end all for traditional shaped bundt cakes . The cake cooked evenly and all the way through , no rotation required , and I can not recommend this pan highly enough . No more burnt bundts . Coat the pan gently with butter ; sprinkle evenly with flour ; when done , leave the cake and pan to cool(approx . twenty minutes ) and the cake will fall out without any hesitation . Also , this is the BEST deal I have come across . Hope you have as many pleasant experiences as I have with Nordic Ware pans . Enjoy !
5 #### Awesome tool when hooked to my grinder . We have a steel gate on our fence . Previous owners did not maintain it , and it was badly rusted . This jewel cleaned it up very nicely .
5 #### Just what I was looking for . With this bowl , you can mix AND pour , for example , pancakes , cupcakes , waffles , etc .
5 #### Mashes potatoes and tofu like nobody 's business . I used to have a zig zag style OXO masher and it does n't work nearly as well as this bad boy . I 've mashed potatoes and tofu with it and it works great with both .
2 #### The quality of Klein screwdrivers has gone down alot . In a matter of 3 weeks the head is already worn and the rubber handle is starting to wear away . I used to go atleast 6 months before needing to get new drivers but I might have to change the current one sooner than later . Ask any electrician , stay away from klein for the time being . I might try greenlee 1/4 " drivers for now .
5 #### Just what I needed at a decent price . Great service , quick shipment and smooth , easy ordering . Will do business again for sure !
5 #### Pressure cooking is not new but these cookers really work great and are easy to keep clean . only reminder I would share do n't cook on high , take your tine and use median heat , word of CAUTION never , NEVER leave the pressure cooker unattended . Thanks Robert .
5 #### I got this specifically for fried eggs in my cast iron skillet and it works awesome ! Very thin and flexible , helps for sliding right under the eggs . Time will tell how the little spot welds will hold up . I ca n't imagine it 'll last more than a couple of years with moderate use , but at this price , I 'll just get another if this one breaks .
5 #### Even though this is a little small for our toaster oven&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Cuisinart - TOB-195 - Exact - Heat - Toaster - Oven - Broiler - Stainless / dp / B000PYF768 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Cuisinart TOB-195 Exact Heat Toaster Oven Broiler , Stainless</a>&nbsp;,I knew this when I ordered it because the correct dimensions are stated in the product details . It does a great job of reheating a slice of pizza or quiche and restoring the crunch to what would otherwise be a soggy crust . I must commend Nordic Ware for keeping jobs here in the US by not outsourcing to overseas manufacturers , and I therefore look to them first whenever I need kitchen utensils or gadgets . The quality of their products has never disappointed me and their prices are always competitive with other brands who chose to go abroad .
5 #### I have been using these for dust collection in my 16 gal Shop Vac while using a belt sander . I have sanded over 1200 sq ft of subfloor and filled up 4 bags . They work great for containing the saw dust and when packed full weigh about 15 - 20 pounds . There is almost zero dust in my shop vac filter when using these bags also . Buy them here instead of the box store because they are less than half of the price .
5 #### If you need to make some coarse wood cuts then this will do the job .
5 #### Original motivation for purchase was to clean the ports on hummingbird feeders ( and they are perfect for that ) , but new uses for these tiny brushes keep coming to light . The latest : these are super for cleaning hairbrushes of the Mason - Pearson style . They make it easy to remove the lint and hair that accumulates at the base of each bristle tuft and they are perfect for cleaning the surface of the red rubber base .
5 #### We have waited since December to put this thing up . My boyfriend of eight years has wanted one forever and we finally bought a house . Saturday night ( 4/16/16 ) we hung it up and there it went . June bugs and all ! He was upset because I told him we ca n't hang it right where we are sitting because it attracts the bugs to it and we do n't want them near us but you wo n't miss it when they hit even from a good distance away . It was fun to sit back and relax and not have bugs buzzing all around me . He is very happy with this and so am I. I 'm really excited to see how it works in the summer months when the mosquito 's get bad . I will update then !
1 #### I ca n't believe the first time I used these pruners , they broke ! Literally , on the third branch I was cutting ! It was n't even 1/2 inch thick though it states it will go up to 3/4 inch . I thought by buying a name brand like Fiskars , it would have some quality and integrity . Nope . Cheap China made product . Very disappointed . I read all the reviews on the ratcheting pruners and thought this was the one . I have a great set of Gerber 's , but this had the better review . Maybe I received a defective set , but it broke so quick . The material is not good quality , just cheap plastic . I would not recommend this product at all .
4 #### This is the 2nd HTC2000 I have purchased . Works great for my shop equipment . It has been some time since I purchased the first one . The current one is the same quality , I was glad to see .
5 #### I need to precisely cut wire and this tool is the best for that . The blades hold up after a ton of use and I have never had any problems with these . Others , well , cheap and either rust or the blades wear out fast .
1 #### Was the wrong sized key , even though I used the correct part number from diagram to order it . I finally found the right sized key in my stock after having sheared these keys twice and having to remove flywheel twice to correct . Chinese knock - off ?
3 #### The finish did n't hold up . I bought an electric one -- red like I used in Ireland and love it
5 #### Works so well and comfortably ! I have arthritis in my wrists and the screwing motion to insert the screw usually hurts ( for instance , when I use a handheld can opener ) but my grip on this is perfect and does n't give me any problems . Well made and simple - exactly what I needed .
2 #### It was bend when it arrived , and when I was installing it , it broke . Went to the store to buy another one .
5 #### rigid definitely grips pipes better than the off brands.worth the extra money if you use them often
1 #### The handle does n't stay tight ! I did n't even bother to try it . A defective failed product by Stanley
5 #### Good item , I also find them at Ace , Lowes , etc .
5 #### I have a very high pressure on my outside hydrant , so high that all other hoses I have used have eventually ruptured under use . Heat also contributed in that they ruptured during the summer while laying in the sun . I have purchased two of these , the first in July 2012 and the second a year later . So far there has been absolutely no problem with either hose .
5 #### Melnpor products are great . This lawn sprinkler is easy to use and more rugged than others
5 #### For a reasonable price these remnants proved fine for extending one pesky hose that was just a little bit too short .
4 #### This set is lovely and well made , however I wish there had been a picture that had given me an idea of the scale as I would have bought a larger set .
4 #### This bit works well once you know how to use it but the instructions that come with it are not exactly helpful , since they do not exist . Here is how to use it - Raise the top of the bit 3/8 " above the table surface this is the most important part ( this will require some trial and error so have some scrap handy ) - Run a straight edge along the recessed part of the cutter and set your fence along this line - Cut the drawer sides vertically using these settings - Cut the drawer front and back to a depth equal to the thickness of the drawer sides , if you want over lap like in the picture cut it even deeper . this is accomplished by placing the drawer front against the table and pushing it through the router . Finally wood magazine has a good article on how to do it just Google how to use a drawer lock bit
5 #### My log stack is about 4 ' wide . and 3 " wide . Works very well for what I need .
4 #### I wish this came with mounting screws but at that low price , this is perfect . It seems tough and was easy to install in the garage . It fits the hose just fine and it holds the whole length of it too . If you are looking for a cheap wall mounted solution here it is .
5 #### Not much to say except that they are good quality and they do the job they are suppose to . I use it to hold REVO parallel clamps to the work surface .
5 #### Got this as a gift for my foodie son - in - law . I taught him how to use my 30 + year old Presto pressure cooker on his last visit . They do n't wear out !
3 #### Hard to hold ant turns too easy , changing my spray pattern or shutting off when I do n't want it to . Heavy duty though . Bad design .
4 #### I do a good amount of camping and was looking for something waterproof , animal proof , and that I can jam pack into the closet so it does n't take up a lot of space . This was perfect ! It clamps down well , is a good size for my needs and appears like it will last a long time . I only have a few comments : - Why not square the bottom up with the top ? It would make stuffing stuff in here - easier . - No foam or rubber gasket around the lip of the box . This would make it pretty darn airtight although easy to add on ) - The holes for the locks were not cleanly cut out on my unit . Easy enough to fix - but I would have imagined this would have been addresses prior to shipping . Otherwise , its a small , durable storage box . What else do you want to hear ?
5 #### It 's a thermometer , it fits , it measures temperature and it looks just like the original . What more can I say .
5 #### It is small , carry in my tool bag when working around the house .
5 #### great item which keeps yoour work from gettinn marks on you wood i have been using these bumpers for years andb the help greatly
5 #### I love these wood chips . Pecan and Beech are my favorite . These 2 give anything I have smoked in my electric smoker&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/dp / B00TJ1OZRK / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Masterbuilt 20070115 BluetoothSmart Digital Electric Smoker , 40 - Inch</a > a wonderful flavor but not as strong tasting as mesquite .
3 #### As a potato masher it is up to the task , but if having really nice mashed potatoes is your objective then buy a good potato ricer like&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/B000OLA7KS / dp / B000OLA7KS / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">B000OLA7KS</a >
5 #### I have always liked Stanley squares , have bought them for years and will continue to do so .
5 #### Best axe I have ever used ! Worth every penny but you need to sharpen a bit first . Buy their axe sharpener for $ 10 and just roll this through it about a dozen times - takes less than a minute to do .
2 #### I love OXO . I thought they could do no wrong . But this apple corer / divider was a waste of money . We had an old stainless steel one without the handles , so I thought this one would work better . It does not work any better at all ! The apple gets stuck in it , and it 's a pain to clean .
5 #### I never open a bottle without using this aerator , it really does what it says . The taste is so much more intense , just as the winemaker intended . Get one , you will never look back .
5 #### I bought this router bit because it looked interesting and my credit card was handy , not expecting to be surprised . When the bit arrived , I put it in my Bosch router and WOW ! This bit skims through Mesquite like a regular bit would Pine . The result is a glass smooth edge that needs a little 400 - grit touch before spray painting . Time is money in a woodshop and this bit delivers ! !
2 #### it says for drinking water , but it makes the water taste bad .
5 #### I recently had a string of building projects , including a couple of sheds and a 1,000 square foot house . I bought four of these squares to have them around for anyone who came over to help . We only used them for scribing cut - lines on boards , so I ca n't speak to the complex angles some people use these for . However , for scribing perfect cut - lines on any board , this square is excellent . It 's light , can fit in the back pocket , and is durable . We must have dropped these 1,000 times , and they 're still as good as new . Note that this square can be used for cutting miter lines , as a protractor , as a 90 - degree line scriber , and as a saw guide ( held in place to guide your saw ) .
4 #### nice shredder - works well with hard cheese - I find if I put the cheese in the freezer for a short time it works best .
5 #### A winner as a cooking tool and a serving tool !
5 #### Love them ! Their easy to use . Dishwasher safe . A good investment . Price of the product is worth buying , We use all the time .
5 #### Fixed the leak in my toilet valve . Way less expensive than a new valve or even a new valve cap , and no need to replace the valve . I bought a couple extra .
5 #### It really works I have heavy clay soil I thought it would be a waste of time but I need help getting a hole in this ground . I use to use the old fashion post hole and it took forever to punch a 10 inch hole .
5 #### The Monster Cable surge protector is a great product . I bought 2 for each of my big TVs . Great price , great product and excellent timely shipping . Grab a few if you can .
5 #### This is the best $ 109.00 I have ever spent . I do highly recommend also purchasing the # F271803 hose for the quick connect fitting because this unit on the high setting will blast through the two one pound canisters . ( 4 - 6hrs constant use ) But hooked up to a 20 lb bottle , it will keep you toasty warm all day on the ice . I highly recommend this product . I do n't know how I ever went ice fishing without it !
5 #### I do n't need to clean up much pet hair . Was looking for a vac to replace ones I have had over the years made by Hoover - a small , commercial , light weight unit that I can carry over my shoulder . While looking for the next version of that machine on Amazon , I found this one by Eureka . It 's small and light weight so I can carry on my shoulder ( with a strap from the Hoover ) . It has lots of power , gets under and behind things easily , cleans out in a snap and stores in almost no space . In fact , the only thing this machine lacks that I liked on the much - more expensive Hoover is the length of the power cord . With the Hoover I could do the whole house moving the cord once . With this I move the plug twice . Otherwise , I am completely satisfied with its operation .
5 #### This mixing bowl is awesome ! Previously I 've been using stainless steel mixing bowls and the hard edge hurt my grip after rigorous chores like getting sugar and butter into a creamy texture . This OXO was heaven on my fingers . I ca n't say enough good things about it . Its nicely shaped and very sturdy . The bottom is curved so it definitely helped chores that require a whisk to get into those pesky corners . The white plastic seems non - stick . I used this bowl to mix full bottles of red food coloring for red velvet batter and there is no hint of staining on the bowl . Its very strong too . I can lift my brother off the ground but I could not compress the shape of the bowl even if I tried . The red measurement markings are permanent and easy to see , with markings for 8 cups total in 1/2 cup increments or 2 qts total in 1/4 qt increments , which are specified to be + /- 10 % accurate for wet ingredients measured directly in the bowl . In addition to a rubberized bottom , the bowl has rubberized feet . The handle is nicely shaped , sturdy , and angled perfectly to pour your contents without raising your elbow sky high . I call it the XOXO mixing bowl , for hugs and kisses .
5 #### I just did 30 minutes of pruning on 4 large Redbuds that I have been avoiding . Lots of branches everywhere , they were a mess . Well , the Fiskars did the job with ease and even lopped off an inch and a half locust branch with ease . I said over and over --- what a tool ! ! What more can I say but -- WHAT A TOOL !
5 #### Works well , wife has been using it every chance she has and kids love helping push the button .
4 #### Really a must have ! Great for both rabbiting and dados up to about 5 " from the edge . the dust port only works for rabbiting but when used works well . the device would have received five stars if it did n't make the router so unstable when setting down . After you make your cut the round dust port causes the router to tip over , once almost rolling off the bench . This would get a solid five stars if they included stabilizing legs . I 'll have to drill and figure something out . As for the intended use , it 's priceless ! A must have ...
5 #### This is one of the best made pie servers I have ever owned and the price was very reasonable ... it is made with heavy gauge stainless steal and it has no give at all .. this is a well made product ... nothing cheap about this pie server at all .. buy it .. you wo n't be disappointed
5 #### Keeps those pesky raccoons and skunks out of my yard .
5 #### Apparently everyone in my family loves to feed birds but me . I got this for my mother for Christmas a couple years ago and she loves it . I remember it as being somewhat heavy but it 's not like the birds are bench pressing it so I guess that does n't really matter .
5 #### Get 's the job done and it is light and easy to carry .
4 #### A good vacuum for stairs and car interiors ... not a winner on large carpeted rooms with pet hair .
4 #### I would give this a five star but the pan is difficult to handle . Those thin rails make it difficult to move in and out of the oven . Other than that this pan works great . I have been cooking various recipies and even the failures are tasty . I have been brushing the cups with butter or fat and the popovers just pop right out . This is a nice pan to experiment with . I am going to try shrimp and asparagus filled tomorrow . Oh yeah , you can fill popovers ; my favorite so far has been a prune in each cup . Anyway this is a fun little pan for experimenting .
5 #### Very good solid strainer . Well worth the money . Love OXO products .
4 #### We do a lot of baking in our household so we were eager to get our hands on this OXO measuring spoon set . We own other OXO products and find they are high - quality products . These spoons are another solid product . I like the in - between sizes , as our previous measuring spoon set did not contain all these sizes . The plastic ring is nice because you can just pull off whatever size you need , instead of taking all of the spoons off the ring . The only negative is that the size lettering is not easily visible on the black color .
5 #### Keeps the mist of your wood trim and on you . Bendable too .
4 #### This opener works so far . It replaces another I bought a year ago ( different brand ) . Each opener I have bought annually over the past five years seems to wear out ; and this time I looked closely at old vs new . The connection of gears seems to deflect over time , leading me to believe metals used are n't of high quality and so the gear connection just becomes impossible after a few dozen uses . I suspect this should just be on my annual Christmas list and get a new one every holiday season ...
5 #### This product works as advertised and is of good quality and will last a long long time . I am happy with the purchase .
2 #### Breaks every time I buy it . The only problem is buying a tapered bit from somebody else
5 #### I have owned one of these before and am on my second one . This utensil has been used , abused , dishwashed , handwashed , used for Playdoh cutting , cookie cutting , chopping , etc . for about 6 years . I am happy it lasted as long as it did . It works great .
4 #### I purchased this as a classroom vacuum , but ended up using it in the art studio . It 's light , powerful , and gets the job done . I would have given it 5 stars if the hose were better quality -- it 's thin and cheap and twists easily -- I ca n't see it lasting long at all .
5 #### What can I say ? It got everything that I need . From the price up to the quality , it 's perfect .
4 #### No problems with the bench , other than the clamping part could be stronger . Easy to put together , but go slowly and pay attention . I think I have installed something backward initially . Instructions could be clearer . I wish there were a different kind of removable " stop " available , as the hard plastic ones do n't grip your work well . Overall , I 'm happy with it , but it could use some improvement .
5 #### When the brackets arrived , I bought 5 treated wood 2x4 's and , within minutes , had a functional firewood storage rack that will keep the firewood off the ground and nicely organized . Liked the first one so much I bought 2 more .
1 #### While this sounds like a great product , and you would expect great things from Hunter , this is a BAD product . The fan randomly comes on in the middle of the day or night , for no apparent reason . We 've tried changing the remote to different radio frequencies , but that did n't help a bit . ANOTHER BIG PROBLEM is that if the power goes out and then comes back on , the light comes on no matter what . So let 's say you live in the country where every storm that blows through flickers the power . Yep , our trusty ceiling fan light will come on every time . Emails to Hunter confirm that this is " how the product is designed " . I do n't think it is a design . I think it is some junior engineer with no common sense . Nope , do n't waste your time on this product .
1 #### It is strange that the feeder instructions urges one to use Cardinal food -- sunflower seeds -- when I do n't believe it is large enough for a Cardinal to land on . " My " Cardinals have eaten the spillings from Chickadees but have n't ventured to try to land on such a tiny ledge . It is easy to fill and looks good . Our local squirrel has leaped upon it but slid off as it is apparently too small for it too . Even the Chickadees can barely keep their balance . ; they pluck the seeds and then eat them off the ground .
5 #### Just got tired of replacing my cheap $ 40 box store Scott 's spreader every year cause the cheap plastic wheels or axle would break . Bought this Earthway 2150 and have now had it a full year . Still performs like new with Zero signs of damage or quality drop off . The large rubber wheels and wide track make using this Earthway on hills or an uneven yards simple . The cheap Scott 's would tip over when half full of fertilizer on uneven lawns because of the cheap small plastic wheels and terrible center of gravity . Go ahead and spend the extra money now and have a product that will last a lifetime instead of some cheap garbage that costs more in the long run and has to be replaced every season .
4 #### This is great for loose tea or as I have been experimenting with , is cold coffee . Fill it full of medium ground dark roast , stir it around for 20/30 seconds in 8 to 10 oz of room temp water . Let soak for 12 hours or so , add ice and you have a great tasting cold coffee .... Sweeten to taste , but I do n't add sugar . Doing it cold , eliminates the acidic after taste and it has a great flavor . ( There are ways for volume recipes , but not for this review ! ) Obviously , when not making cold coffee , loose tea works great in this Tea Ball . I have six of these , so I have several making cold coffee and a couple for Tea only .. They 're great ! !
3 #### I was surprised at the size of this spoon . The length of the handle is just right , but the spoon part is really big . It 's nice if I 'm using it to cook heavier or heartier foods with , but if I 'm cooking pasta or something lighter , it 's kind of a pain . As for the product as a whole , it feels really good in my hands . It 's not at all heavy and it does n't feel awkward at all . It 's made with very good material and it 's really easy to clean .
5 #### I do n't do anything special with my shop vac besides simple garage clean up after a wood working project . These bags are priceless in keeping my shop vac clean and reducing the dust that it spits back in the air . The trap the tiniest particles , and when it 's time to empty out the container , it 's as simple as pulling one of these bags out and putting in a new one . No need to clean the interior of the shop vac . I love these bags and will never run my shop vac without one .
5 #### This is such a good looking salad spinner i would like to display it somewhere in my kitchen . It works beautifully and fulfills my every salad spinning need . Some people think it 's expensive , but it seems worth every penny to me .
2 #### Axe head broke during -14 below weather . Not recommended for cold weather .
5 #### I 'm very happy with this saw . The fine teeth cut clean in good trim stock and the aggressive teeth cut quickly in all types of lumber . The price was right for me . What more could you ask for ?
5 #### Love the foldable design ! Regular use to shred block cheese ! I am very hard to pleased given I take it very serious on how effective and efficient my kitchen tools are . This grater is sharp , quality , comfortable to hold and compact when folded . The best cheese grater I have had . Generally speaking , I do trust OXO products as they have rarely fail my expectation . You can buy this without a second thought .
4 #### Did the job for the old halloween costume . Plush and filled with beans or rice at the bottom of the toy . The picture makes it look like it comes on a cylindrical stand but that is not the case .
4 #### I have not used it very much yet , but plan to .
5 #### Well made , works a expected , good product , I would recommend if you need to grill small things .
4 #### This spray works , as long as you continue to spray regularly , like every other day . It 's easier than not to forget to spray . But it does work . I do n't mind the fragrance of this product , but I just hate to have to keep spraying my house all the time . The aerosol spraying is something I 'd rather not have to do to keep the cat at bey from peeing / pooing outside his box .
5 #### purchased this spinner to replace an old and wharped on , works like a charm . the spinning handle is very smooth and fairly quiet , dries veggies enough .
5 #### Works Great ! I use this on apples , the cut into slices , put peanut butter and granola / nuts on top - layer it with another slice of apple and create a healthy sandwich out of apples for my boys .
5 #### Top of the line ! They are light , strong , and have an unbeatable bight .
5 #### Bought in June of 2013 , so far it has been working out great for me . I have a decent size backyard with a nice 3 light outdoor light . With my fence and dogs I like to see where they are when they go out in the backyard and having this timer with light sensor was perfect for when it is dark outside . I normally have it on from around 9pm-1am roughly or whenever it is dark/ light . You just set how many hours you want it to stay on after it hits dark and forget it . Works great for my needs . It has endured the Michigan winter so far with all this snow , and is just hanging on an outdoor post next to the light . So it has gone through all the rain / snow , and heat from June through February ( time of writing this ) .
5 #### This is the second time I 've purchased this vacuum cleaner . The first one served us about 6 years before the quality of the product finally diminished . I could n't be happier with it . The new batteries last longer , too !
4 #### I do like this .. It does exactly as advertized and the rainbows it creates are extremely bright with very deeply saturated colors . They are static and arranged to make stripes that point inward around a circle . I"m not a huge fan of this forced form , but the result is a lot of nice rainbow patterns none the less . ( I guess I 'm still looking for that item that simply fills my room with a single large rainbow ) . This works very well to lay down a colorful rainbow base in combination with the Kikkerland Window - Mount Solar - Powered Heart Rainbow Maker .
5 #### Good product for the price . Made well . I bought several different types of these kitchen tools . I wish it came in a set .
3 #### This one is good , I do n't regret purchase , it does seem a bit rough at the machined edges in places , but that is n't a show stopper for me at this point .
5 #### Love this bar ! I bought this to just have around and figured i would never use it as I already had a flat bar , well i was wrong . I use this all the time around the house and love this bar ! Get a Wonder Bar and you wo n't be sorry1
5 #### Not much too this one . It 's cheap , cuts well , holds an edge well and does what a straight bit should do . ;)
4 #### i Bought 3 of them ( my reason for that is i keep losing them at work ) and all are about a 1/16 in off due to the loose holding tab at the end but that s a fairly easy fix great tape though . numbers are pretty easy to read as well as the marks . the outside is kind of a plastiky metal feeling material that s resistant enough for me to consistently drop it on the concrete floor at work and it to hold up . great tape .
4 #### Good stuff , but I found it much cheaper at Costco .
5 #### Bought it for my Dad to go with his old Estwing hatchet , no complaints from him so far and honestly I expect it to last a lifetime
5 #### Good for making peels for my fancy bar drinks , a lemon curl really classes up my keystones
5 #### I have a squirrel feeder in the back yard which helps deter the squirrels from the other feeders . I have baffles which keep the squirrels away from the bird feeders . The birds now raid the squirrel feeder to get the black oil sunflower seeds ! The squirrels watch so they know when I put this in their feeder . Kaytee products are great .
5 #### I love the birds that come to my outdoor feeding station . I have multiple feeders out , depending on the time of year , but this unit is mounted to cedar post year round . I never had much of a squirrel problem , however , wite wing doves will raid any feeder with a platform . They are locked out of this one , but the Northern Cardinals can still enjoy it . I do n't know what is best about this thing . The 11 lbs of seed it holds , the steel construction or the fact that it only feeds from a single side , so I can point it at the house and not miss a bird . ( Most of these weight sensitive feeders feed from two hoppers . ) I highly recomend this unit as the central piece of your bird feeding station . I have purchased over a dozen feeders , and none of them bring this entire group of features to the table .
5 #### I was going to purchase a small pack of these blades locally , but for a little more one can get 50 on Amazon . Consequently this is the best value for money out there . Blades are sharp and oiled for rust protection .
5 #### Terrific peeler . I had an older OXO peeler that I 'd used for years and it seemed be getting dull so I replaced it and it was definitely the right thing to do . These are terrific peelers but they wo n't last forever .
4 #### Great little zester , as I expected from OXO . My biggest gripe is that it is definitely biased against the right - brained among us ( left - handed ) , but as we 're also good at adapting we can still make it work . I also wish the channel knife was a little sharper , but that 's easily remedied with a metal needle file . Otherwise I 'd definitely recommend it .
5 #### I have smaller ones ( Fire Gone ) in the living area and this one being larger its in the cellar . All have warning labels FIRE CALL 911 FIRST lets hope they are never used .
4 #### looks made with good quality , a lot heat . But somehow I smells the propane that made me a bit sick . I open the window a bit to have fresh air . still like it .
5 #### I have used many tape measurers in past , this is by far the best ever on the market ! Highly recommend .
5 #### for a old guy trying to trim small trees , it works great , well worth the money
4 #### Works great for me . Been using it for my green house . Accurate also . This is for inside humidity , not for outside humidity , however the item can be used outside for temperature .
5 #### works as advertised . have had it for about 5 months with no issues
5 #### A tool that should be in everyone 's shed if you have trees or shrubs ! 5 ft long w / chain operated jaw . Prunes branches up to 1&1/4 in diameter w / one pull of the handle ( middle ) or ball @ end ! Adjustable cutting angle to accommodate esthetics . Will not be giving THIS tool away soon !
5 #### Good size of whisk , not too big and it 's sturdy . Definitely a very good quality . You get what you pay for .
5 #### I got a " Craftsman Workstation " ( Model # 22284 ) for a belt sander and other things but they did n't seem to carry the mobile base . The employee seemed uncertain if they stock it any more . It was the same design as this but with metal levers . This fit the base of the workstation just fine and could have been adjusted larger . Instructions and assembly were pretty clear . I would get another one if I need one again .
5 #### We were remodeling and needed a pneumatic stapler for house wrap as well as insulation . Arthritis is a bummer for using a regular squeeze type stapler . We are now madly in love with this stapler . No problems with jamming even after almost 10 K staples used . Does n't use much air at all to operate . We had to buy several new tools for our remodel . Hubby said that this tool made the most difference in our ability to finish the job as well as being the easiest to use . Did feel a little let down with the lack of a nice case for it but that was remedied with a trip to the thrift store where a suitable case was found . Minimal hand pressure needed to hold and fire this stapler . Does n't require pushing the tool against the material in order to fire it like a framing nailer or an electric stapler requires . On the other hand , hubby has learned that it will fire into flesh as easily as wood . Minimal damage to him with 3/8 " staples . Now we are fighting about who gets to use it next for other projects ! Initially hubby was a bit hesitant to buy this because of his experience with electric staplers and their problems with jamming . Wish we had bought this sooner instead of fighting with the cheaper electric stapler .
5 #### I 'm a bit of a geek about this stuff but this is everything you would want in a power strip . It 's got both cable and phone cord protection , wide spaced plugs on one side for off shape plugs and color coded plugs on the other side . It comes with little color coded tags you put on the cords of your appliances so you know what you 're unplugging when it 's time to change something in the entertainment center . Extra long chord is just icing on the cake . Will be buying more of these later .
4 #### What a fun way to decorate the fridge ! I gave this set to my teen for Christmas . We have all enjoyed making poetry with the magnets from time to time . I only wish there were more prepositions . Also , I removed the words " crap " and " sex " . A little pricey and I would recommend getting more than one set for a better variety of words .
5 #### Woodstock Encore produces exceptional products . This is my second set of Woodstock windchimes . I purchased this set for a vacation home . The chimes are tuned . The sounds from multiple chimes are harmonic . I have at both houses : Venus , Neptune , Earth , Mars , Mercury & Pluto . My only suggestion to Encore is to make a larger chime for even deeper tones . It gives my ramada areas very relaxing sounds .
5 #### Fits Porter Cable 18 Volt Flashlights and a lot cheaper than the supposed Porter Cable Bulbs . Stanley makes both product lines anyway .
3 #### First of all , this does work and I 'm happy with it . What I 'm less happy about is the potential for disaster if you are n't careful . If you get one of these , note that the solution moves from the ' clean ' side of the tank to the ' dirty ' side . The dirty side is on the side with the hose attached . So , as you use it , the weight of the solution makes the unit more suseptiable to tipping over if you pull on the hose while you are working . The result ? Disaster . The pump quicky expells dirty solution into a pool on your carpet . To recover , you have to right the unit and turn it off to reset the float . This seems to take forever as you watch the yucky dirty solution disappear into the subfloor . This happened to me on my first day of using it , which is why I only give this unit 3 stars . Some other quick gripes : unit was n't assembled totally correctly out of the box , although it was easy to fix . Small filling hole is a pain : take the top of the unit off and fill the tank directly . Solution bottle is too small ( think of it as a sample ) . Order some quality solution when you order this unit . Trigger to spray cleaning fluid can ' stick ' , so beware . Positives : Good price , simple operation , easy to access tanks , compact , and has strong suction .
5 #### I purchased these shears a year ago . They get daily use and have been holding up very well . They still appear new and they operate just as well as the day they came out of the box . Their edges hold very well , they do n't need sharpening yet . I use them daily and enjoy the comfortable feel of their handles . I 've had trouble with other shears cramping my fingers , but not with these . Their only downside is that it is hard to keep them in the kitchen where I use them most . My wife often " borrows " them and does n't seem to believe that they should be put back where she found them . She 's even tried to replace them with an inferior pair of scissors , thinking I would n't notice . In retaliation , I 'm ordering her another pair of these shears and hope that will encourage her to leave " mine " alone ! 6 months later -- Ordered wife her own pair . Maybe I can keep these in the kitchen ! She loves them too , by the way .
4 #### Worked well in yard - not sure how great a distance it actually covered as I purchased two to be sure my acre lot was covered .
5 #### I purchased one of these at a local store for one of our toilets that was hissing and decided to order a second from amazon for our second toilet because I was so happy with the first one . I have minimal handy experience and was able to install in in about 10 minutes with just a bucket and a wrench ( which I only needed to loosen the one previously installed ) . Instructions were clear and easy to follow and so far the product has held up nicely .
5 #### Milwaukee , again , has produced a superior product . The tool is very handy and really does work in tight quarters , although I use it for a lot of different applications . The trigger is one of the best I have used for controlling the speed of the drill . It gives you a feel for the speed and is very precise . It fits in your and perfectly and has never bogged down . Ever . It is a litle pricey but it 's a drill that is used a lot . In no way is it limited to tight quarters .
5 #### Excellent cable cutters for the price . Sharp , smooth action . When compared to the Klein cutters side by side you can see the differences in the production process and why these are cheaper but I do n't think it will effect the longevity of this tool . The Klein 's are probably more forgiving if being used outside there intention .
5 #### Easy to use and easy to clean ! Perfect for my Apple needs !
4 #### I bought this to help me see the lines when I use my scroll saw . Best thing I ever did . Good product for the price .
5 #### All I needed was an extension of about 40 feet to connect a soaker hose . I went to several bog box stores and found the same unit for around $ 30 . I returned home and ordered this one at more than 25 % less than the ones in the stores . however I did take the white hose instead of the green and that was not my best decision as the white color really stand out along side the foundation . This hose is actually for the transportation of drinking water and is actually an overkill for my purposes . The fittings are excellent and it absolutely does not kink .
1 #### I have used this garlic press for a few years , it is too small and never really did a good job of pressing out all of the garlic . It would expel juice and a few bits of garlic . It did not work well at all with unpeeled garlic . But , it was better than anything else . I used it today for 1 clove , the mesh portion through which the garlic is pressed broke in half , and one piece of mesh fell out of the press . I had really expected it to be stronger than that . I will try something different now . Probably the KUHN model , there does n't really seem to be a perfect garlic press out there , but the reviews for the KUHN look promising .
4 #### The shears are well manufactured and a great buy . I use mine quite often and the locking aspect makes them greater .
5 #### I bought two of these for our 38 ' 5th wheel trailer . They are just great . Very accurate reading and easy to see . I highly recommend this product to anyone seeking the best of this type product .
5 #### Our indoor garden last winter was full of gnats , which destroyed many of our young tender plants . Not what you want when you are trying to get plants established early for spring planting outdoors . We have been using this on our indoor garden for about one month in the plants ' watering solution , and we have not seen one gnat yet , and no mold on the top the soil either . Looks like a winner here !
5 #### I 've used this several times now . its a great size and manageable weight for daily use . Great for reducing cooking time for lentils , artichokes , potatoes etc .
5 #### Nice handy size . Cleans potatoes with easy . I think the bristles will stay in the brush for a long time . I have had brushes before they fell out on and stick to the potato . Comfortable to use . Very happy with it and the price .
1 #### After about my 4th one of these , I switched over to the more expensive , but so worth it Sportman Grill . This one is cheaply made and you food will fall onto the coals due to the adjustable slits being unevenly spaced .
5 #### It worked well for what I needed it . Used it ones to fix a hose that costs 500 dollars . Have not needed it since .
5 #### The Fluidmaster 400A Anti - Siphon Toilet Tank Fill Valve is either what you need or not . If it fits , buy it . My wife installed ours last night . It is inexpensive , easy - to - install , and will save you a ton of money from the plumber . All you 'll need are some wrenches you already probably own and about thirty minutes of your time ( if you are just starting on DYI projects ) . There 's little to say about the product . You are shopping because you know you need one . It is a good device . Anthony Trendl anthonytrendl.com
5 #### This size can be hard to find but not on Amazon ... They work as they should and the price is reasonable .
5 #### Great vacuum . Yea it needs bags but they are cheap . It has gobs of power and sucks hard . Personally have seen these things last 10 + years of daily use .
5 #### The grow light system came in excellent shape and a timely manner . I have just set it up and all seems ok .
5 #### Have n't had a chance to use yet but looks great for pricing .
5 #### About 3 - weeks and the pond was clear . Have to clean regularly ; about twice a week but it does great .
5 #### The Bosch DWM40L has saved me a lot of time on even the simple angles . I bought it for setting up angle cuts on my Dewalt sliding miter saw and now using it for all angle cuts . While installing an angled facia board on a roof peak , I slid the Bosch DWM40L into the slope of the roof line , divided by 2 and cut a perfect fitting joint without trial and error ! ! The price is right and the tool is quality built . Just wish I had the case to protect it . Ordered that 2 months ago from Amazon and still do n't have it . I recommend making several copies of the instruction sheet and keep them near your saw(s ) . The setups for crown molding require a few steps and if you do n't use the tool every day for compound miters on crown molding , you will become a little perplexed if you do n't have the instructions . With the extension leg , short outside corner angles are easy to locate . At first , I was n't sure I would need the extension but now I 'm glad I have it . I have even used this tool for conduit bending when working with goofy angled runs . Really does eliminate time consuming trial cuts and bends . Buy it , you 'll like it ! !
4 #### Bought this to replace the fill valve in the toilet . This was a great price .
5 #### seems well made , got it for the brute 32 g white trash can . holds up well even when the trash can is full of ro / di water .
4 #### These are ok but a little smaller than I expected .
5 #### This thing is big and heavy , that 's probably why it is wonderful for heavy duty cutting however if you have a lot of light weight demolition and cutting its weight may be a deterrent for extended use . I 've cut a quantity of 11 " X 12 " recovered teak beams with this monster , no problem , it handled it like a dream , no sign of fatigue or heating . The rubber cladding in front and the hand grip is comfortable although I wish some one had thought of an option of a horizontal handle up front . Set on the maximum speed with the swing action it can give a real agressive cut . One needs to be careful to keep to the same plane while cutting or the blade is history , also the wood needs to be wedged apart or weighed so that the kerf opens up as you cut or the machine can vibrate an elbow off . Use carefully .
5 #### I drink a lot of bulk tea , have a couple of these tea balls so there is always one available . Just the right size for my mugs to get the proper strength . Surprisingly durable .
5 #### We had been taking our knives to a local knife sharpener , but this machine actually did as good or better . It has already paid for itself . Love it .
1 #### I tried cabbage seeds and rutabaga seeds and this things dispenses several with each depression of the plunger . I tried depressing it part way but still get two or three at a time - it 's almost impossible to get one seed to come out at a time .
5 #### Great addition to your kitchen counter . This can opener is solidly constructed and can take on any cans . When you open a can with this , you 'll feel it 's a lot easier and smoother than it used to be . Feel it is worth the premium price .
4 #### Have relied on this to clear and keep clear or 1400 gal fish pond . This year the algae got ahead of us and it has been weeks of applications with little result . Water changes seem to help as much . Do n't know of anything else I can use which wo n't harm the fish ( Koi etc . )
5 #### awsome ! Love using this tool . It is amazing how it works
5 #### This has changed my life . No , seriously . Since I got this little contraption , I have completely scrapped my Starbucks habit - I do n't think I 've gone twice in the 2 months I 've owned my Bialetti ! I am very picky about how I like my coffee , and now I can make it exactly the way I want it for myself instead of spending a TON at Starbucks every day or so . I could n't afford a big $ $ espresso maker , so I decided that a country full of coffee - loving Italians could n't all be wrong and opted to try this instead . SO glad I did . I even ended up buying one for a friend later and it 's helped save her lots of Starbucks trips , as well .
5 #### I installed this on my vintage Craftsman table saw model 113.29920 . It arrived quickly and was exactly as described . The Vega fence has enough mounting adjustability to line up with the front holes . I had to drill two holes on the back of the table as there were none . It was as easy as that . I have no issues or complaints . It is 110 % better than the original craftsman fence . Move it to the desired dimension using the scale on the bar . Check it with a tape measure and it is right on and perfectly square . Love it . The perfect upgrade to my old trusty saw .
5 #### Price , I use it regularly , yet to learn to use it correctly but what ever little use i put it through - it was effective sharpening the plain Knife
5 #### With the warming pad and this most of my seedlings were up in 4 days . Really works nicely and esy to assemble .
5 #### When you have a need for this tool I have n't found a good alternative yet . It works well on almost every situation that I 've ask it to do . I am very pleased with it as it does what I purchased it for .
1 #### There is little good about this Presto 4qt Aluminum pressure cooker . It ... Can not keep the handle tight , I have to tighten it down about every other use . Can not form a steam tight seal , steam leaks out around the handles , making them hot to touch , and through the pressure stem indicator that is supposed to seal off ... it does n't . Can not keep the broth ( fluid ) inside from spewing out the weighted rocker pressure regulator even though the fluid level is well below the 4 guart level . Has no opposing handle ; so picking it up while hot and full is problematic when trying to move the cooker to a faucet to cool it down . In a word , we got what we paid for ... the cheapest and worst made pressure cooker on the market .
4 #### 4 because they are expensive . They work as intended and lock in place . No rust . It is slightly hard to clean the inside of the handles .
4 #### I love the OXO products , but was a bit disappointed when I saw how small this was . It 's hard to visualize until it arrives . I may have to order a bigger one such as the balloon whisk . I am not sure this one is going to really suite my needs . But , like all OXO products it is a clever design , well made product for the kitchen .
4 #### I have this Dewalt Rapid Load Holder with some of my Dewalt tool sets . I like that I can slide the collar back and release my bit I works well when I 'm changing to different bits . I read about a bit holder that has a collar that slides forward to avoid releasing the bit when overdriving the screw . I think it was a Milwaukee brand . If I were to buy again , I would look for a bit holder with a forward sliding collar .
5 #### Nothing fancy and nothing special , but the price is about half of the price at the big box stores . Works well for me .
5 #### These locking wrenches are great for holding punches.the grip is solid and does n't slip while hammering the punch into hot metal . I first saw these used at a blacksmith 's demonstration .
5 #### I have had this router for 12 months . It is table mounted with a lift and a fence on a long table attached to a table saw . It is attached to a dust collector which is a must . I rated the best dust book too . Yes dust , read it or breathe it ! I have had many routers in my 35 years of wood working this is a solid and heavy router . It is best if table mounted because it is too heavy for hand use . Plenty of power . Real quality . Adjustable speed , slow start . It even sounds like a power house too . Great .
5 #### Purchased this sander for use on my boat , which has many unusual angles and hard to reach places . The attachments provided with this kit are of high quality and perfect for reaching all these places . The sander does an excellent job in finishing the various surfaces ( fiberglass and teak , rounded and flat ) encountered . I am very pleased with his purchase .
4 #### My old grater has four sides and has been in my kitchen for 30 years . It has begun to show certain signs of wear . This grater is as good , but not better , than the old one . I expected strong metal areas , but they are not rigid . The video misled me . I 'm not sorry I bought it , but I do n't think I would do it again . The old grater was all metal , and could be dried in the oven as it cooled . The new one has to air dry , I would n't put the plastic parts into an oven however cool . I love the construction of this new grater , the styling and the way it comes apart . Those points have not turned out to make a difference to me !
5 #### Works well and actually survived the dish washer . Our old one rusted in the the dish washer . I 'd buy it again if needed .
3 #### Right after hanging this on a tree with screws , I saw the squirrels attack it . I do n't believe they were ever able to get any food and eventually they gave up . But they did bend the flimsy metal around the tray and it does n't open a close properly anymore . Also , it is way too heavy to hang from a typical shepherd 's hook used for bird feeders . The first one I hung it one was steel pipe and did not bend , but the weight being all on one side caused the whole thing to fall over . The " springy " shepherd hook hangers simply bend way over under all the weight . So I screwed it into a tree trunk . Now it is hard to get it to come apart to refill . You have to jiggle and push and twist etc until it finally lifts out . Putting it back in is not easy either .
5 #### They just do n't make stuff like they used to . After 20 years my can opener finally had it . Bought the same exact brand at Walmart and after 2 months it broke . Went back to Walmart and bought a more expensive brand can opener . This one lasted 2 weeks . Bought this one from Amazon , and so far it 's been more than 6 or 7 months and it is working like it should be . Very happy with this can opener . Definitely recommend .
1 #### Possibly one of the worst , cheapest , bad designs I 've purchased in a long time . It does n't work at all : slips off the jar and digs large teeth marks into the lid with the possibility of puncturing it . A true POS , I returned it immediately
5 #### I have not used them yet but I think they will work well when making Tortilla salads . The construction of the shells are non - stick and should work well . I would recommend these to customers .
4 #### Good quality , will be a hand down to my son .
3 #### Works great ! Decided to try to get em this year instead of paying someone n totally nailed it ! Update * used in early spring , nabbed the lil booger quick . Got one more still hanging around early fall now . Traps are rusted a bit n does n't seem to snap now . The lil s * * * jus digs dirt around it n does n't seem to set off the trigger . Super frustrated . Works great new but looks like later uses not so much .
5 #### Good addition to the drill set . So far , holding up well .
5 #### I was hoping to get another heavy Bundt pan with handles , and discovered that because the price of steel is so high they are no longer making the dark - interior heavy pan . So I gave this pan a try . It 's awesome - cleans up beautifully , much lighter and the result is equally has good .
5 #### Bought as a gift for a friend who saw mine . I 've had my locking tongs for about 10 years & they are as good as they were new . We get posted around the globe roughly every 2 to 3 years & these guys have been packed & repacked & cooked with in half of SE Asia . They have taken a battering with high heat cooking in a wok & they are still going strong .
5 #### This product is excellent for my portable Dremel Tool . Just install and you 're ready to cut into the plaster board with ease .
5 #### I ordered this product last week along with Algae Fix by the same manufacture , API Pondcare . In less than a week our pond went from pea soup where we could n't see our fish to almost crystal clear . Still waiting for the 3rd step " Ecofix Pond Clarifier " and excited to add it with other other products for ongoing maintenance for our pond . AND , I ca n't say enough about the customer care for API Pondcare . I was n't really sure which I should use first and how long to wait in - between products . They responded to my email question very quickly and helped me with a couple other questions I had . Used as Kayla @ API instructed gave a great results . Like many others I 've tried a lot of different products , some worked some did n't and some were pretty expensive . API products are less expensive that others and I feel really good that our pond will stay clear and balanced using their products .
5 #### Unopened relatively clean box and the parts inside were complete . This brand is almost universal , store bought or oem . Price maybe comparable , just no driving to the stores .
5 #### Definitely a good - sized tea ball to put loose tea leaves inside a cup .
2 #### I have apparently been spoiled by how easy it is to use traditional light switches . We bought two of these remotes and they were an absolute waste of money . They were a pain to turn off and on , the dimmer function was almost worthless , and they would occasionally turn themselves off and on too . The Hunter fans we bought are wonderful , but these remotes are awful ! ! ! ! If you are truly desperate for a remote , these should do okay . If you mostly want to avoid dangling chains , then do n't get this thing ! ! ! Instead , I recommend installing a separate fan control and a separate light control . That 's what we did . I bought this to control the light -- > Leviton R12 - 06633 - PLW Decora 3Way Slide Dimmer with Preset , Lighted Pad Option , White I bought this to control the fan -- > Hunter 27180 Three - Speed Dial Fan Control The combination worked wonderfully , should last a very long time , was easy to install , and was cheaper than this nonsense . Sadly I forgot I still had them and forgot to return them in time . At this point I 'm hoping just to give them away .
5 #### My daughter is in love with cows . She knows all the animals on it now . We keep this for going out so it keeps her distracted for a bit . It is great to put under the inglesina table seat .
5 #### Much sturdier than expected . This is made out of pretty solid plastic .
5 #### This set of four stacker system , with four compartments each , has greatly aided me in trying to keep my shop organized with the various screws , nails and brads that I use in my craft business . Each compartment is labeled and I know that the exact item that I am looking for is in the " screw " bucket . It has eliminated the boxes of stuff from piling up on the workbench . Better yet , when I go off to a craft show , I just take the bucket with me , and I know I have everything in hand that I could possibly need . Plus , when the supply of a compartment gets low , I know it is time to fill it up , rather than hunt through the various boxes on the work bench hoping that I have more . A great " investment " and time saver for me .
3 #### This is weak in 2 important regards . It flexes when you 're trying to grate something , especially harder vegetables such as carrots . Unlike a box grater , it makes a huge mess out the sides , grated vegetables do n't always fall straight down , they sometimes fly out the sides . I do like how the grater comes apart for cleaning , and how it folds flat for storage .
1 #### This blade is so thin it will not rip , it just tracks off and follows the grain of the wood . It would not even cross cut 5 stacked sheets of 1/2 " plywood . It cross cuts a 4x6 ok , but wanders a bit on 3x6 ipe .
5 #### I have these as well as Channellock 's smaller and larger ones . This is my go to set when working on drain plumbing . The forged construction , hardened jaws and deep adjustment grooves ca n't be beat . Made in the USA ! The only reason I had replace mine is I stupidly left them on the top of my truck bed and they fell off . I ordered the replacement the same day .
5 #### I have another no - name chimney starter that I bought a few years ago for around $ 15 . I 've used it for cooking dutch oven for a couple of years and it has worked fine , or so I thought . I recently purchased a&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Weber-2820 - Smokey - Mountain - Cooker - Smoker / dp / B00004U9VA / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Weber 2820 Smokey Mountain Cooker / Smoker</a>&nbsp;and bought this Weber Chimney Starter at the same time . It is MUCH bigger than the generic starter I 've been using , and the additional lift assist handle is great . The conical grate inside the starter allows the charcoal to get up to temperature much quicker than my old unit . I do n't know what I 'll use my old starter for now . From now on , it 's only Weber for me .
5 #### A nice product for our patio . Easy to read at a distance and the picture is perfect .
5 #### This is an excellent tool to have on the job . It is perfect when adding nailers for drywall when all you have is the bad left over studs . Also good for straightening studs that have moved or twisted since you framed up the project , not a tool you use a ton but needed when it comes right down to it , very handy !
5 #### < div id="video - block - R10WXKXPGC8KMA " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1G9hkVVxoS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/71pQNiz7jgS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;Dear people of Amazon who ca n't get the lid on : I made you a video . The lids fit fine ! They 're so tight because that 's the only way to keep them water tight so you can use them for salad dressings and things . You just need to use a little finger trick to get it on .
4 #### Works good , it 's just sometimes easier to get down & use the hand shears , but it works good in tight spots .
5 #### These bins are great . Much better than most of the junk that is out there . Solid
5 #### I have used this version of this Fishers axe , and I have used the smaller ones and they are just as good . The ergonomics are great and the fiber handle does not transfer all the shocks so its easier on your joints . Comes sharp , and is easy to sharpen like any other axe . Fishers has a lifetime guarantee .
1 #### We used it once and there 's a split in the hose . Replacement or refund is contingent on shipping it back . C'm on , how much is THAT gon na cost us ? We 'll just chalk it up to a lesson learned .
5 #### Just the right size for frying fish etc . Works like a champ , a great value .
5 #### I use the tongs all the time when grilling . I use this tool much much more than I do a spatula .
5 #### This Porter Cable sander is a proven tool . I have used mine on many projects , and it has performed very well .
5 #### Freud router bits are the best . I do n't buy any other brand unless Freud does n't make them . Had Sears brand , had to take it apart and switch parts to make cuts for rail and stile . Freud combined everything into one bit and it fits perfectly .
5 #### This sprinkler allows you to define a very localized water area and is really easy to use . I 'm thinking of buying a second one for the back yard !
5 #### My wife 's favorite whisk . Durable . Cleans well . Whisks well . I have 9 different whisks like this of different manufacturers and sizes . This is a favorite . It is a larger one for home use and typical pots . It would not be as good for a soup bowel to mix and egg for instance .
5 #### After reading the reviews on the 28 " splitting axe and some people saying they wished it had a longer handle , I bought the 36 " axe . This is a fine axe and works well but after using it , I thought I would try the 28 " . I found that the shorter handled 28 " worked just as well , is lighter and is much easier to control .
5 #### Just what I needed for the Mr. Heater I ordered . Great size , easy to hook up . Works great with the Mr. Heater .
5 #### Love these , I live in the country and have bugs come in house after the lights .
4 #### I wish i would have but a slightly large size but this is a great product and works like it should . I 've always found IRWIN tools to be of good quality .
5 #### A perfect balloon whisk consists of : Good balance , a good grip and a sturdy balloon ; this has it all . I 've had $ 30 whisks that did n't come close in performance . You do n't know what you 're missing until you get a whisk that does n't slide out of your wet hand whilst trying to get those stiff peaks ...
5 #### I bought this knowing cold weather is coming , and as I like to sit on my back porch and enjoy a cigar to more , I knew I needed this heater to help keep me warm . I have not used it yet , but I know from a smaller unit my brother owns and used last winter , this product will keep me warm and will rock . So there is that .... I like this product / company so much I also bought a portable camp stove , which I have used and enjoy . Look , the bottom line is that is you need or want a portable heater to keep warm during winter , then look no further than this heater . Again , my brother 's small heater made by the same company kept him personally warm while we sat on my back porch in Florida during some cold days , so I know that when I get the opportunity to use this unit , it will dispel the cold . If you are going to sit outside during frigid weather , what are your options ? I choose this unit , and I know it will do the job .
5 #### This is the DEFINITIVE solution to your bug problems . We have a creek running through our backyard -- plenty of flying insects of all kinds . After three days of continuous use , remarkably noticeable reduction in blood sucking , biting bugs . After seven days on , I only run it at night now . We can sit outside and have beverages , dinner , whatever , and not get eaten alive . Highly recommend ! !
5 #### Love my new , green Oxo salad spinner . Just one or two pushes , and salad greens are dry . The brake is a nice feature , too . We 've used this also to store salad , and to wash & drain fruit . Best spinner we 've ever had .
5 #### What can I say - a quality driver with a great grip and a precision fit . This is the only driver all the maintenance guys at work use . Got some for home use and chucked most of the old junk I had .
5 #### I was surprised that a smaller whisk works better than a larger one when beating a couple eggs . The soft contoured handle gives better control as well .
5 #### These stops are perfect for easily cutting big crown moulding . They allow you to set only the 45 degree inside or outside angle without having to set the compound miter needed for crown moulding . It does this by propping the moulding against the fence at a 45 degree angle , and the results are excellent . The moulding doe not lay flat on your mitre saw . Why set two separate mitre angles when you can use only one 45 degree angle and be totally successful with crown ? ? Highly recommended .
5 #### As with most OXO products , this is top of the line . Works beautifully , dishwasher safe , great quality , and makes a nice gift too .
5 #### I have had many pools ... this is perfect for just me on my floaty . Does n't take take long to heat up . The Intex brand holds up very well ... one pool went for three summers ! I have considered stocking up . I could n't be happier ! !
5 #### Definitely spend the extra money ... it 's TOTALLY worth it ! I 've had so many different types of coffee makers , including this style of stove top . Given that it 's your coffee every morning - spend a little more and get the best . This is no - hassel , none - drip , no hand burn - I 'm getting a 2 cup version as well . I wasted my money on all the cheaper versions .
5 #### Great product , easy to use and a joy to use . Gets greens quite dry .
5 #### Been using Milton products for years because of the quality and workmanship . Never had a single problem . Well worth the price .
2 #### As a framer / carpenter , I have found that the quality of Stiletto tools has gone down , perhaps from being made over seas . Had a very negative experience dealing with customer service on the repair of a fiberglass stiletto also . Was sent a replacement which was missing the magnet and then failed after a few months of work . So disappointing , when the company used to have a desirable product on the site .
3 #### Ok , but suction does n't last . This is my second one .
5 #### Love these things . They 're my gardening buddies and they are so , so easy on my hands .
5 #### Great replacement bulbs . Local big box store has 2 bulbs , halogen which cost ~$7 , or LED which cost ~$11 . Purchased 2 of the LED bulbs , which promptly stopped working after 3 months . Purchased these for the cost of 2 of the halogen bulbs , and they work as intended .
5 #### Keep you stove top Clean with this one . I needed something to keep my greasy spoons off my Glass flat top stove . This came in hand . I did not like the double rested spoon holder you can find online that looks like something i do n't need to see right next to my food .
5 #### Good gloves . Right thickness of leather , durable enough to get work done .
5 #### Beside my OXO Angled Measuring Jigger , my Emsa Perfect Beaker Measuring Beaker is probably the most - used tool in my bar . I bounght mine six years ago in 2007 . Though it lives on the bartop , it see 's very frequent use at both bar and kitchen . I 've gone through a lot of alternatives , including the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Kolder - Original - Mini - Measure - Multi - Purpose - Measuring - Glass / dp / B002OOVB0S / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Kolder Original Mini Measure , Multi - Purpose Measuring Glass</a>&nbsp;(which had ' markings ' that could n't survive more than a few months ) , and a series of other ' Bar Measure ' glasses ( likewise could n't hold on to their measurements ) . But the Perfect Beaker just keeps steaming along . It 's dead - accurate , for the mixology fan . It 's tough : The markings are still perfectly readable and unfaded after six years , even with a lot of trips through the dishwasher . Good stuff !
2 #### Not very powerful . I 've only tried to make one thing so far ; and it really lags in power . Really disappointed .
5 #### This blade makes for a great marking knife ! I love it and highly recommend it .
5 #### Great little toaster oven broiler set , fits perfectly in my toaster oven .
5 #### had it now for like 2 years , getting wet , sun , abandone .. but still works
5 #### This is a really nice quality cover . For the price you 're paying , it 's VERY thick . I was expecting a piece of plastic , but this is much better quality than you get in the stores paying $ 60 .
1 #### It 's made in China , but would probably be fine if it fits your drill . It really does n't fit mine . I have a 3/8 Black & Decker 4.0A drill that I 've had maybe 20 years . It just barley fits the chuck , that is , tooth engagement barely exists . I 'm better off with my old chuck key . Nothing on my drill says " Model Number " but one of these numbers may be helpful to you : DR200 Type 1 9932 - F Also , it fits really loose in my other drill a Black & Decker 1/2 " drill with numbers : DR600 Type 4 200224 - 47
5 #### Dependable INTERMATIC . Have used four INTERMATIC 24 hour timers in our business location since the early 1990 's and have only " just now " had to replace one of the original four timers - almost 20 years of use . This replacement timer seems to be identical with the original timers , looks to be of the same quality also - wiring format is also the same . Trust the INTERMATIC name for good timers .
5 #### This order was a terrific bargain ! The product is excellent . The results are good . I 'm very pleased . I would recommend to prospective buyers that they ascertain their needs first . I should 've gotten a 6qt size . Unless you 're apt to prepare fairly small meals the 4 qt is small . If you cook for one or two and do n't make large meals this 4 qt is ideal .
5 #### WOW I could n't believe how big this feeder is . Awesome quality as well . Seen a few birds flying around it this morning and checking it out . Have n't landed on it yet .
5 #### Too cool . Great looking too . I love that I can have the analog look with the convenience of radio control .
5 #### I was pretty skeptical when we ordered this . Well , that 's over . Now , instead of dragging out the HEPA machine with the stiff cord and scaring the wits out of the dog , I now virtually run around the place with this Eureka to the same effect and the dog sleeps through it . Good machine . Lightweight , maneuverable , holds a charge for about 30 minutes . Great for quick pick ups , carpet or tile .
5 #### Nice deep bowl and nice , large handle ! Especially love the rubber bottom to hold it steady and in place while mixing either by hand or with a mixer . THANKS !
4 #### Will never buy a lawn mover without a bag again . Mulch does n't look good on the lawn . Also , automatic cord roller would be great . But for the price it'a good thing .
5 #### LOVE it .. Very comfortable , sturdy , well made and clean design . The wires have just enough flex but they are n't all over the place . I keep it with my OXO batter bowl and together they have to be my favorite kitchen tools . I ca n't say enough positive things about it , just a perfect tool for the job .
5 #### Could n't go wrong with this hose . Previous hoses always had kink problems . This is much better even when the temperature drops in the low 40 's .
5 #### Great quality cookie cutters . They come in a nice storage tin . I 'm glad I spent the extra money to get this brand . I would buy again and I think I will be buying more sets like this in different shapes .
5 #### I sprinkled a few granules in each of my bird water bowls as well as my planters . I live in Tucson and the mosquitoes here require very little water to survive . In one day 's time I noticed a reduction of mosquitoes . By the end of the week no more bites , no more mozzies sneaking into the house . Needless to day , I m delighted . The product claims to be safe for animal water so I felt OK putting it in the bird water . The birds do n't seem to mind and I have n't noticed any problems with the birds .
4 #### The product does what it says it does , however , the nail head sits on top of the split , magnetized strike face , and MUST span the split , in order to be held by magnetism . You may have a problem with very small headed tacks .
5 #### I started using it right away and just love it . it cuts great and is very quiet to the point you do n't even know its running . fast shipping too .
5 #### An apple corer makes eating apples surprisingly more tasty , easy and fun , and the OXO brand seems to never miss in making great products at good prices .
3 #### Did not work well with my electric weed - eater . I do not know if it was the string or the device .
5 #### Where can I purchase this product in quantities of 10lbs or 20lbs bags . ? Great product !
2 #### This was not what I was looking for . I was looking for a tea infuser that I could infuse the tea and have it be leak free and still be able to sip from it . The ones from Teavana have this capability , but I did n't want to spend the money to get one from there . I guess I 'll have to fork it out to get what I need though .
5 #### Really nice sharp and easy to use . Perfect hole and countersink every time . Then you can install a wooden plug in the hole to cover up the hole .
5 #### I love this salad spinner because the pump action of the spinner spins out the water without making the bowl shake like mad . I owned a hand - cranked spinner for years and it would shake and rattle while spinning . I also love the clear bowl for fridge storage because I can see at a glance what greens is being chilled in the fridge . The rubber grip bottom also holds the bowl steady while spinning . I can see why there were so many great ratings for this item . Buy it now !
5 #### The best insert for a sabre saw that eliminated tear out when ripping plywood . Leves a clean edge with no tear out on either side of the piece .
5 #### I was nervous about ordering this because of some reviews which said about clasp issues or tea coming out . However , I have not had any of thesep problems . Simply put in your tea , close and steep . When down just steep another cup or wash it out . It 's that easy ! Excellent product .
5 #### what else can be said- cool and quiet - and it does n't scare my dog also it is light weight and easy to carry
5 #### This replaces a hose reel that replaced a hose reel . The reels lasted about a year and then broke . I still have two reels on the house but I know they will also break and when they do this will be what I 'll buy for replacement . Simple . cheap .. holds the hose nozzles too .
4 #### Good , but BIG - probably best for people with gigantic refrigerators !
5 #### GREAT UNIT . PRIOR ONES WOULD MAKE LOUD NOISE WHEN THE WATER IS HEATING .. THIS ONE IS SILENT . AND WORKS REALLY WELL
5 #### I use these for outdoor landscape lighting . I expected some failures since the price is so good but have not had a failure yet . The bulbs have performed admirably as I do not recall having to replace any of these bulbs .
5 #### OK ... sooooooo .... one of these for $ 17.00 but TWO of them for only $ 20.00 ? ! ? ! ? ! ? S O L D ! ! ! ! ! It 's a 25 ' Stanley FATMAX ..... X2 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
4 #### It 's a flat bar . It works . Nothing remarkable about it . What do you expect ? It 's a flat bar .
5 #### I used the thin kerf Freud blade today on my old Craftsman 10 " table saw . The blade cut through the 8/4 mahogany with ease and left such a fine finish that it will just need a light touch up with a smoothing plane .
2 #### Its a beautiful pressure cooker . 2 cups water full pressure in 6 minutes Two things I do n't like about it . 1 . The over pressure plug has a lot of vertical movement . I would prefer that the over pressure plug is as far away from my face as possible . I personally feel the need to wear safety goggles . My main large gas stove burner is in the front left corner . To aim this over pressure plug safely away from my face would require the long handle to stick out over the front of the stove where it could be easily knocked off the stovetop . The long handle would have to be over the counter top aiming the plug & steam to the right or over a right sided burner aiming the plug & steam to the left . I 'll try using the medium size burner so its over pressure plug is further away from my face . 2 . The long bottom , base kettle handle has a single screw to secure it . It moves side to side when the screw is fully tightened .
5 #### Fits my old vacuum cleaner well and does the job . Happy .
5 #### I set it up the evening I bought it . I found that a mouse was caught the next morning . Reset it before I went to work . Got another one after I was back ! After Zapper killed 11 of them , I declared my house is rodent - free ! How can I tell ? I scattered some dog food around , all of them were still there days later . I did n't bother to figure which one was mouse and which one was rat . But , some of them were quite big . I have a tip to offer . After several kills , the Zapper may get the smell of the dead rodents . The remaining ones wo n't come in any more . You have to clean it up using vinegar and dish detergent as documented on their web site . Those stupid rodents will come back in again .
5 #### Great little cooker . We are glad we got it . Be aware though that being aluminum , it will get a darkened stain to the inside when cooking items like potatoes . It heats quickly , vents like a cooker should and works beautifully .
5 #### Sturdy , nice feel to the handle . Stays cool even when left in a boiling pot . Does n't flex when stirring hearty items . Stylish look . Comes out of the dishwasher nice and clean . Intended to use it as a serving spoon , but use it for lots of purposes . Update May09 Still love it . I focus on value shopping - does n't have to be cheap , but must deliver value that justifies the price . This delivers .
4 #### if you vacuum up extremely fine dust , like from cement board or sheet rock dust , the standard filter does not work well . These little bags are the bomb for that type of application . You still want to use your standard filter for anything that might escape . The only drawback is you 're only able to use a portion of the maximum capacity of the vacuum . These are U shaped in use and do n't extend the length of the vacuum , so you get maybe 50 % capacity , if that . Still , for extremely fine dust they work well .
5 #### Could n't find them locally anymore - first bought them at Bed Bath & Beyond years ago . They are light and flexible . Love to fry my eggs with them .
5 #### In the past year we have had three pizza wheels break on us . I finally got tired of my husband replacing them with cheap ones and went with my trusty Oxo . As all Oxo products this is very heavy duty , stands up well to heavy use , cleans very easily in the dishwasher . I can see this one lasting us a good long while .
5 #### I have n't used these yet as they are for a gift , but I trust Dewalt as I have used their products before . ,
2 #### Action works well enough , but the blades only cut if you use the very tips . I expected better from Fiskars because I have several other Fiskars hand tools .
5 #### It 's a tea ball . What else do you want to know .
4 #### I always wanted a belt sander but never had an actual need until I started a shop workbench consisting of a 2x4 laminated top . Once everything was glued and dried , I pulled her out of the box , attached the dust bag and adjusted the belt tracking on medium course sanding belt and let it rip on high speed . I was pleased at what quick work the sander made of smoothing the laminated top . Only light pressure was required for the sander to do its work . The sander fit comfortably in my hands with very little vibration . The dust bag was able to capture some of the dust being generated but just as much went airborne . I guess this is to be expected with any belt sander though . The variable speed came into play when I need to smooth some uneven edges on the cabinet carcass . By dialing the unit down to a medium - low setting I was able to control the amount of material being removed safely . Keep your eye on the electrical cord as I found out the hard way it can be grabbed by the belt and yanked up into the sander .
5 #### This is a very handy little knife . I use it for paring , slicing , and everything . Henckels is the best , no question .
5 #### I first saw the Bialetti being used on the Netflix show One Day at a Time . It intrigued me , and after combing through tons of reviews , I decided to give it a try . I wanted something that is capable of making good espresso without having to pay a steep price for an actual espresso machine . As soon as I received my Bialetti I washed it out and used it . I was so excited and pleasantly surprised with the espresso that it made . I purchased a handheld electric milk frother with this Bialetti , and have made myself lattes almost every single day since my purchase . It is fairly easy to use and does not take too long to brew . I did have a bit of an issue with taste after washing it out with soap to remove some very visible coffee stains ( you 're only supposed to use water ) , but I brewed espresso a few times , discarded it , and was able to get the taste I loved back .
5 #### This is the second Flowtron Insect Killer that we have purchased and they are very effective . Our first was a 1 acre model which we used at our cottage in Maine . Now we are back in Arizona and low and behold we are being pestered for the first time with mosquitoes in the desert . Watch out mosquitoes the insect killer is being installed tomorrow . Just hope the neighbors do n't get upset with the snapping and buzzing during the night because we are declaring war against these pesky insects . You ca n't go wrong with one of these insect killer lights in your yard .
5 #### Works as advertised . Be nice to have multiple inputs . Slightly pricy but it appears durable enough to last a few years .
5 #### Best line of pipe wrenches money can buy . It stays tight where it seems like all other brands of pipe wrench slip around and the jaws open up .
3 #### It is ok product . Not that sharp enough than I have expected . When you cut a hard stem of flower , it does n't cut clearly . It leaves some parts . That is a problem .
4 #### It was just what I wanted and works great . It replaced one I had used for many , many years and lost .
5 #### This little light fits in my Leatherman pouch nicely . It is not overly bright , but does focus by twisting the lens end . It is much better than nothing and very small . Quality is very good .
1 #### Did not work out of the box . Have had these in the past , without issue , but this was a defective unit .
4 #### Makes bending boards a lot easier . I just wish the parts were a little wider so you could keep the handle off of the face of the deck boards easier . Otherwise , you scrape the top of the deck board and on soft wood , cedar , you can see the marks from the handle
4 #### I prefer this type of handle for a potato masher to the sideways ones . I wish the sides were a thicker metal , but I think it will stand up to the test of time , it seems pretty heavy - duty . Love the material on the handle !
5 #### Good grip , simple to use , grates well . What else is there ?
5 #### I purchased these to help with changing the PH of my soil so my pink Hydrangeas would turn blue . They work perfectly .
5 #### Much sturdier than other hibachis on Amazon . Grills steak to perfection . Easy to clean . Add that it is made in the USA , and you have charcoal perfection .
1 #### I ordered this because the description said it would fit the reel mower I have . Had I not thrown out the packaging , I would have returned it ..... it 's not right .
5 #### These are very basic fixtures but for the price they can not be beat . My brothers - in - law installed them in my storage room where I needed more light . They must have been easy to install since there was no angry expletives coming from the room during installation .
5 #### So far so good . I had a similar pair a few years back but lost them . Then lost the replacements . They cut nicely , and seem durable
4 #### Great tool and well made . Makes cutting PVC pipe a breeze .
5 #### Perfect size . . . perfect utility ! As to the longevity / integrity of the product , I can not yet speak . I bought it to whisk 2 eggs in a bowl for omelets , & find it perfect for that task . Thank you !
4 #### I would have given it 5 stars if it were n't so large . I have large hands for a woman and still find the 7 1/4 " length and large circumference hard to hold . I gave it 4 stars because it works really well ! It is sharp and I can peel as fast as I want and it keeps up . Peelings do n't get stick in the blades and they come off cleanly . It 's so sharp that while getting used to the size , I accidentally took off a bit of thumbnail . I 'm more careful now and have gotten used to gripping the large handle while peeling veges at a blazingly fast speed .
5 #### Do n't think I 've met an OXO product that I did n't love yet . They are basic things that you need for your house , but for some reason it seems to be so hard to find quality products for these basic needs . I was so tired of paying good money for things that would end up breaking / cracking / leaking within a year . OXO always delivers . Yes , they are a little more expensive , but since they last they end up being cheaper in the long run . Just a standard strainer , but it does all the things you expect it to do without breaking , leaking , etc and the quality makes me believe it will last years upon years . Very thin mesh , but large sized strainer . Perfect for smaller things ( quinoa , thin pasta , etc ) , but can still hold a good quantity and fits very easily over the sink , pots , mixing bowls , measuring cups , etc . We use our colander much less now as this can strain most things in portions needed for cooking for 2 , is easier to handle and easier to clean . I also use it to shift flour .
5 #### its honestly amazing the things you can buy online these days . haha i live in a place where these would have cost me probably 30 dollars plus for the same amount if i would even be so lucky to find them anywhere . i am using them to start seeds and also later down the road as compost tea .
5 #### Building a corner cabinet with a 45 degree face was a snap with this bit . Clean , fast cuts , even in Red Oak .. I will look for Freud Router Bits over Rockler now that I 've tried them .
5 #### Excellent can opener . I have tried so many hand openers and have difficulty turning the opener . This one turns easily .
5 #### This is the BEST manual can opener I 've ever used ! Pierces cans so easily I had to make sure it really did ! Great on those small and rectangular ( sardine , oyster , anchovie etc . ) cans too . The the large handles make it easy to use and easy on your hands and fingers . Built solidly and it looks like it should last forever . Cleaned up great in the dishwasher .
5 #### Lovely wind chime , very melodious . Well made , would make a very nice mother 's day present ....
3 #### ITS OK BUT THERE ARE NO HOLES IT DRAIN RAIN OR ? ?
3 #### This still inside the box somewhere in the house . I been trying to find it to test it . I know is good and I will use it when need to .
4 #### The removable bottom is very convenient . Some of the crust ingredients do leak out so it does n't stay completely clean , but its slightly raised edge makes it a great way to move the quiche / tart without danger of breaking it . I cut the quiche / tart on the bottom plate and it did n't scratch . The finish on the pan is supposed to be ' easy release , ' although not non - stick . The only reason I did n't give it 3 stars is the pan is not very deep .
5 #### Well made and lasts a long time with a little T.L.C. when cleaning . I have one that has lasted years , which to me is worth plenty . Thanks again , Bill T.
5 #### This was a gift to a professional chef , and he LOVES it . Will be buying him more Henckles !
5 #### I 'm not a professional chef by any stretch of the imagination , but I do understand the appreciate of quality kitchen tools for when I 'm cooking at home . But no matter of what level of cooking you do , it 's hard to get around the value of a sharp knife : It 's simply easier and safer to use . It 's worth noting that a steel wo n't actually sharpen your knife . It 's similar difference between combing wet hair and cutting it : A steel " hones " an edge , which basically straightens out the microscopic " fibers " on a knife edge ; " sharpening " requires the use of a stone or grinder . So , if you knives are n't sharp , it 's best to have them sharpened and then to maintain that edge with the steel . So , as a non - pro , I wanted a steel that was reasonably priced and could be trusted to not damage my knives ( all Henckels Professional series knives , a total indulgence for a home cook , I know ) . So far , it has worked wonderfully . After sharpening my knives , a few swipes against the steel is all it takes to keep them cutting neatly and precisely .
5 #### This is very nice grill . I was able to put it together in no time , and it is the perfect size for my deck .
4 #### These trimmers are nice but after close inspection it 's really a cheap built product but works great , hopefully they will last a while .
4 #### It fits ; it looks good . What could go wrong ? Used it to incorporate an electric timer switch . Be careful not to over torque the screws and crack the plate .
4 #### This is an excellent knife , I have owned more than 20 in my career . ( there must be many homeowners who own them now because of my absent mindedness ) I would only say there is one knife better than this . It would be the Craftsmen knife of the same design because the Craftsmen is made of aluminum and weighs less and has a sleeker feel . If you ca n't get to Sears this knife is the next of kin .
5 #### These chips are the right size for smoking . What can I say ? The smoke whether wet or dry and probably add a little flavor to what I being grilled ( I have not used nearly half the bag so I moderate my opinion of these chips . ) So far , I rate them 5 stars .
5 #### Love this bowl with the handle . It 's perfect for making waffles and it does n't slide all over on the counter because of the rubber bottom . I find that the more products from OXO that I buy , the more I like this particular company . I 've yet to be disappointed in any of their products .
5 #### I have not used this router bit , but , I intend to very soon . Meantime , it sits on my shelf waiting for a good workout in making picture frames . This router bit is a beautiful piece of work . I recommend it to everyone without reservation .
4 #### The lettuce leaves got dry and it is nice to have something to both clean and store salad greens in . The only negative was that the lid is n't easy to put in place . You have to line everything up perfectly before it will sit properly on the container and basket .
5 #### Great product from Dremel and quite useful . Great shipment time .
4 #### This is a replacement to a hammock that I had for five years . I left that hammock out all summer every year and it finally gave out because I bleached it and ruined the fabric . This hammock is very nice and comfortable but it is a little saggy . I have it strung beteween two trees and it almost touchs the ground when you sit in it . Spreading it wider or raising it is not an option due to the position of the trees . It seams that the ropes are longer on the ends than my previous hammock . I wish there was a way to tighten the tension . But all in all its a nice hammock , just have a lot of room to hang it . We 'll see how it holds up over the years .
5 #### Great quality tool that I 've used numerous times to duplicate angles for wood , flooring and tile projects . Easy to operate and has held up just fine in my tool box for nearly a year now .
4 #### I noted another reviewer commented the fork was quite sharp on the ends ; boy was he right . The two ends are almost like the end of a knife , very sharp and dangerous if you are not careful . The plus side is they go into meat easily with little pressure . The main reason I purchased this item was for the rubberized handle which is hand friendly . It looks and feels like it will last a long time ( the handle ) ; the main steel is stainless and fairly heavy duty ( it wo n't bend easily if at all ) ; all in all , this is a quality item . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is the chance you could be stabbed by the tool if you were careless ; it 's kind of like a knife , be careful with it and it will serve you well , be careless , and you may have two puncture marks on your body , and they wo n't be vampire bites .
5 #### Arrived quickly and at a great price ( including shipping ) . I 'm using this with my Worx compact circular saw and it works great . I would recommend .
4 #### Nice tools for the professional or hobbyist ! Should last me a long time . Not thrilled with the case they come in . A bit difficult to get the tool in and out .
3 #### Satisfied with price and shipping . No hummingbirds came to drink it though . My smart wife made clear homemade nectar and it was then a hummingbird party .
3 #### I bought this to use on our back patio and roof top deck for our summer globe lights - I love it because you can plug it in and leave it and plug in in inconspicuous spot , however if you use the timer feature and set it to go on at dusk I find it does n't actually go on until dark which is a bummer as I 'd like it to go on actually at dusk especially in the summer since it gets dark so late here in the pacific northwest . So - I purchased the one with the remote control instead which is fine however I would prefer the automatic features available with this one ... turning itself on at dusk and off 4 hours later would be perfect for us . I will use this one for our holiday lights since it gets dark so much earlier in the winter . Update : : this no longer works . Not sure why however I think it 's from the rain getting inside . Total bummer I 've only had it a couple of months .
5 #### I have several whisks that I like and use quite a bit . I like this one for gravies etc -- it really can reach in the edges of cast iron skillets nicely . I have even used it to stir thick grits on the stove top to keep them from getting clumpy . Pretty nice -- glad I bought it !
2 #### So I thought flexible would be good but it 's SUPER bendy . Picking up scrambled eggs was sort of annoying . My pancakes only worked because I made them smaller instead of normal sized . I would opt for a non flexible spatula instead .
5 #### Just received vacuum today and it is so powerful , love it ! I have a dog and 2 cats , all of whom shed tremendously , and hardwood floors throughout my house . This is the first vacuum I 've had that actually works at picking up pet hair , dirt , dust etc . perfectly ! I would always have to sweep floors in addition to vacuuming , which was pointless . It is also really easy to use and move around . It has a really long cord , which is helpful so that you can clean larger areas w/o re - plugging it .
5 #### This is a great lightweight saw . It cuts through pressure treated lumber quick and effortlesslyon 2x4s but not much larger size boards < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Skil - HD5510 - 6 - 5 - Amp-5 - 1 - 2 - Inch - Circular - Saw / dp / B0000223FJ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Skil HD5510 6.5 Amp 5 - 1/2 - Inch Circular Saw</a > . I use it for 80 % of my cuts .
5 #### The most important pneumatic fitting to not cheap out on ! ! Buy good female ends . These are good .
5 #### Love this outdoor clock ! Just what we needed on the porch . Once we put a battery in , it was so great how it set itself to the correct time .
5 #### These flaps work well in my toilets and they are inexpensive . I recommend them .
5 #### These pots are great for seed starting and propagation they hold their moisture well and their form . It 's just a three step process , sew seed , grow , then plant to the garden or larger pot . These peat pots break down naturally and actually help add amendments to your soil . They fit well into growing flats where you can cover them with plastic wrap or a dome to help germination . I also buy warming pads to help the process . But you do n't need all of the accessories to have success with these pots just sew , grow , and plant .
5 #### Great addition to the plunge router ! First project was some fluted columns . Worked like a charm ! I highly recommend this attachment !
5 #### I purchased one of these last year and used it this spring for tomato and pepper seedlings . The ease of use and amount of light provided by this item was amazing compared to an old plant light I 'd purchased many years ago . I just ordered a second one and will give my old light to a friend . Since I had a lot of seedlings , I draped a mylar sheet over the entire thing and it reflected the light wonderfully . I really like how easy it is to adjust the height . My old light only has 3 static levels and you have to maneuver the entire light fixture on the arms from one setting to another . I 've already purchased 4 bulbs and expect the two lights to serve me for many years to come .
5 #### We bought this so that we can locate arrows when they overshoot the target at the range . The range we practice at is basically a very large field and the targets do not have a backstop . Arrows are almost impossible to locate because of the soft dirt and grass . This device is sensitive enough to locate the metal point on a carbon fiber arrow buried 3 to 6 inches under ground . This metal detector has paid for itself already just by locating our lost arrows .
1 #### So the instructions are clear that you MUST NOT breathe the vapors , but in order for it to work the instructions also say that you have to be within about 7 feet of the device ... so you have to be in the vapor cloud , but you can not breathe it . Should I run in and out of the bug ' protection ' area while holding my breath ? My head hurts because I am so confused ... Oh ... and its flimsy and cheap - like I got it out of a gum ball machine or cracker jacks box .
4 #### Works well , but I 'm finding it somewhat difficult to clean . Sometimes bits of potato skin are getting stuck in the bristles and I have to try and grab them with my fingers . Just rinsing ( even with detergent ) does n't always work .
4 #### They 're Channellock , they 're well made , they cut 10an well ... if they were an inch longer ( more leverage ) they 'd be 5 *
4 #### This is a pretty decent quick square for the money , but more money could definitely buy you more .
5 #### Works as perfectly as old aluminum ones , but it 's stainless . The biggest reviewer complaint was that the non - stainless screws rusted . The screws that came with ours are stainless so maybe they paid attention to the consumer ! What a concept ! Am thinking about a couple of accessories like the perforated tray that sits above the rest of the food to keep some separate , though so far we 've only used it to cook black beans . And yes , we still soak them overnight before cooking .
5 #### Love this pot ! So versatile , it had become the workhorse in my kitchen . I 'm notoriously bad at planning and prepping ahead of time so crock pot cooking never appealed to me . This pressure cooker has become indispensable in my busy schedule . I have two . This taller 6 quart one and the shorter wider 8 quart one . Though I love both , I use the 6 quart more . It is lighter , easier to handle , takes up less stove space , and better for soups -- especially bone soups and broth which I make several times a week . The 8 quart has a wider base and is better when I need to brown meats first . I bought one for my mom and she loves it over her Fissler Vitaquick . The plastic handle on the Fissler wore out very quickly and is loose and does n't lock well . She also replaced the rubber gasket and the new one does n't seal as well as the original . Now her Fissler pot can not achieve the pressure it used to ( after just 3 years of use ) .
4 #### The product itself , meets the advertised comments . However , when we rec'd the product the bag looked like it had been sliced open , leaving far less than the 10 lbs we paid for . Will look for this product locally to avoid paying for less than advertised .
5 #### Got these for my toaster oven . Perfect size for a half dozen biscuits or two servings of shrimp or fries , and I never heat up the kitchen with the big oven ! The little rack is especially nice for oven fries or mini meatloaves since grease drips down in the lower pan and out of the food . Very reasonable price too . Cleans easily with a wet paper towel or in dishwasher .
5 #### Easy to clean , they love the perch , does not leak . I do " burp " it from time to time . Not sure if I have to , but it is located in an easy to reach place .
5 #### This brush is wonderful for cleaning produce like potatoes , carrots , and celery . It 's easy to grip and has a nice stiff brush . An added bonus is that it is dishwasher safe , so I can place it in the dishwasher to keep it clean and looking nice .
5 #### Easy to handle and so light . Great for those hard to reach places like under fence wires , beats using hand loppers ! I am worn out just about the time the battery is run down . :) Adding to this review ... just came in to order a chain for this saw . Hot and sweaty ... August 14 2011 still running strong . Love this little chainsaw ! ! ! Often saw stuff bigger by cutting wedges or doing what I call a beaver cut . :)
5 #### A great ladder -- just the right size and weight for me . I hope to be able to use it for many years .
5 #### Works perfectly on my Makita 2705 ( 10 inch portable table saw ) . The Makita wo n't take my 8 " dado , so I had to downsize . But this works perfectly well , cutting as deep as I need for hobby work .
5 #### This makes lining up cabinets a breeze . I loaned them out several times already and everyone says the same thing - it makes hanging cabinets , especially uppers , much easier . I remodeled my kitchen and these allowed me to both pull the cabinets together tightly as well as flush at the face . After getting them flush / tight , you drill a pilot then pop in a screw and you are good to go ( mount to wall of course ) . Great tool for the money , for a DIY'er or pro . You could get away without using it , but why would you want to .
4 #### These blades cut great . Nice clean cut on veneered products such as the side of a cabinet , etc . Only downside , and maybe it 's just with my Festool jigsaw , when ran at high speeds ( cutting ) these blades make the worst high pitched noise you 've ever heard . I ca n't even explain the sound but if you do n't plug your ears it will literally make you brain dead . You can feel your ear drums resonating in your head ! And again , maybe it 's just my saw or my ears but it 's painful . If I am only making a 5 " cut with this blade I will literally walk off the job site to my truck and get my ear plugs . It 's that bad . Other than that the blades cut great !
5 #### Wow . This is heavy , solid and big ! It feels geeky to get excited about a salad spinner , but after a lifetime of cheesy salad spinners , including an indestructible but lightweight small Oxo , I was n't expecting something so heavy duty . And it like to spin and spin fast . Impressed by the mundane here . Embarrassing . So there . That 's my first salad spinner review . Hopefully my last , as well .
5 #### My second . I accidentally threw the first out with the last potatoes I peeled - lol
5 #### I 've been in the market for a mid - sized knife for a while now . My 10 - inch chef 's knife is too clumsy for some tasks , and my paring knives are too small . Enter the Henckels 6 - inch utility blade . The first thing I noticed was the wood handle -- I much prefer wood to the newer rubbery handles . Also , the heavy back - weighting made it feel quite steady in my hand : I liked the balance . The blade itself is sturdy , shaped like a small version of a chef 's knife . And -boy!- is it sharp ! This makes trimming small cuts of meat and vegetables very easy . I highly recommend this knife .
5 #### I am happy to choose this , quality and price are perfect .
5 #### Nice , fine grater . Almost a zester , but not quite . Quality OXO product .
5 #### I have some outdoor lighting on my patio . I want my lights to turn on at sunset every night . This timer is perfect . It 's inexpensive , water resistant , and the light sensor works as expected .
5 #### Love these . I bought 2 of these , one for my cats food and one for my dogs food . My dog eats the Purina One Vitality 7 + and I buy her the big 31 lb bags here on Amazon ( same size kibbles as regular dog chow ) and I can fit the whole bag in there plus another 10 lbs so basically these will fit 40lbs of standard kibble sized dog food in one , With my cats food since they are grain free , the kibbles are super tiny ( about the size of a dried pea ) and I can fit 60lbs worth of their food in one . I plan on buying another one just for cat litter as well . One thing I did do with mine to make them more " moisture " proof is I bought ultra thin weather stripping and put it around the door to keep a more air tight seal
5 #### This is really clever - put the garlic clove in the sleeve , roll it on your kitchen counter , and in a few seconds you have a nicely peeled garlic clove . The skin stays inside the sleeve , which you rinse under the faucet . Whacking garlic with a knife is all very well if you have servants to remove errant garlic skins that have gotten stuck on the floor . If you do n't , then this sleeve is better - and in the long run it costs you practically nothing per clove .
5 #### I was unable to find any ready mixed grout locally . Now that hardware stores are pretty much extinct , the big box stores keep elimiating products like this . I needed to re - grout several areas in both bathrooms and this performed as expected . It dries quickly . I would suggest wiping any excess material off before it hardens , otherwise it becomes difficult to clean off .
1 #### The measurement on the ones I got were not right . They were shorter than advertised .
5 #### Excellent product . Used it for a craft i was working , gluing 5 different layers , dries like one solid peice of wood even as i chip and carve away .
5 #### I have used this for 2 seasons . Works Great ! Recently stopped and the algae started to grow ... and safe for my koi !
4 #### This length blade is difficult to find in my area . I have used these before and they work great for thinner sheet metal
5 #### Nice for small handed people ; very effective for making guacamole . Would be a nice gift for someone who likes to cook .
1 #### Granted I 've only used this on the deadbolt cores and not the knob cores . However , for the deadbolt core , one uses this piece of metal to pry a c - ring off . Fingers or a screwdriver could do the same thing . It 's a wire c ring . Let 's hope when my knob fails this tool will actually be important . Until then , I keep it in my toolbag to add a little extra weight so I can get stronger lifting it around .
5 #### I brought this to go with the broom part and I love it so much that I want to order the other parts that you can hook up to this pole .
5 #### I had purchased netting previously that was thin plastic ? After some time in the sun , it would break easily . I remember reviewers for this product stating that this netting was strong and it was ? braided ? . If I remember correctly , there are several strands for each line , so , the netting is indeed strong . I highly recommend this netting to keep leaves out of the pond but more importantly , for my application , to protect my koi from Herons and Racoons ! It 's been doing a good job thus far of protecting our fish !
5 #### This is the best maul I 've every used . I burn a lot of elm and locust , which are extremely tough , twisted , fibrous woods . This maul splits the dry stuff effortlessly , and can tackle the logs with some moisture with a little bit of effort . It is far superior to the traditional heavy maul that I had been using . The long handle is great for me ( I 'm 6'3 " ) . At first I was concerned with the light weight of the head , thinking I really needed something with more heft . Well , I ca n't argue with the results : this sucker blows logs apart and the light weight makes it easier to swing for a long period of time . This is a well - built , lifetime tool . It 's well worth the investment if you split wood regularly .
4 #### High quality . Easy to install and setup your PIN . I wish it came in solid black though . It has a brushed antique look to it in spots where it 's slightly brass colored in certain spots . It 's not noticeable until your up close to it though so I decided I could live with it .
3 #### Grate is actually quite flexible , not stiff enough . Then the need to press harder caused it to break after a year or so . Will not be buying this again .
3 #### I 've tried many recipes and many pans for popovers , including a cast iron pan . But this pan and Martha Stewart 's recipe are a never - fail combo . No more popover " muffins . " The popovers grow very tall and perfectly crispy on the outside , moist on the inside . Five years later : the popovers stick to these pans after a few years of use :( . I 'll have to try another brand !
5 #### Klein makes great handtools for homeowners or tradesman , after using these for a couple months I finally tried to cut one too many nails and the tip broke off . After being denied warranty exchange by two of the local electrical supply houses in town I called Klein support . They were extremely helpfull and explained that I should try Home Depot , well I did and they exchanged them on the spot no questions asked .
2 #### This sprinkler worked well for two weeks , giving a nice even flow of water . After that , the plastic connector piece to the hose broke off . Based on this experience , I would not buy it again . If you do buy it , be careful with the connection to the hose .
5 #### What can I say ? They are vacuum bags . They work . Cheaper than buying from the store ( if you can even find them ) .
5 #### Perfect for wood carving . Good quality . Will use it on hard wood and soft wood in the near future . happy
5 #### This works so much better than silicone and goodness knows plastic !
5 #### The rubberized bottom and well designed handle and pouring spout , make mixing a breeze !
2 #### I do n't like the snap - together feature ... Not crazy about these ...
5 #### These are a dream to use . Purchased two just to try them out . After first use I purchased two more . I had to trim maybe half an inch from each side to fit into commercial 13 x 18 pan . So far have just baked cookies , they slide off easily . The sheets do seem to " stick " to the bottom of the pan , kind of like a plastic stickee but I did n't mind this . It keeps the sheet in place when having to rotate half way through baking . Clean up is a breeze , no staining as far as I can tell .
5 #### I use it all the time . I do a lot of wood art and crafts . I love the short tack time and the final cure strength .
4 #### Since Drill Doctor discontinued the Classic models this is one of the few remaining parts that is available . They also have a 100 grit wheel and a left handed chuck , but that 's it . They have a trade - up deal to the new models but if your classic model does the job for you -why not just keep it ?
5 #### These work better than any other pair of shears I 've used
5 #### This was a gift for my husband . He really wanted these for grilling outside and he has loved them after a couple of summers of grilling now . We also have a smaller , silicone tipped version for inside use that we love . OXO Good Grips are all solid and we love the pieces we have .
3 #### I do n't really know if this works but I used this in a ditch that constantly has standing water in it over the summer to try to reduce the amount of mosquitoes . It seemed to help but I tried several other remedies at the same time .
5 #### Excellent for keeping a straight edge while working with my router .
5 #### These are so cute and tiny and easy to hold , I 'm sure they 'll be great for pruning small bushes . Made well too .
5 #### For years I have made Cranberry Nut Quick Bread for gifting during the holiday season . While I was ordering the juicer , I saw this & decided it was time to stop adding a chunck of flesh to my breads & get fancy ! This worked like a breeze !
5 #### Good twine , I 'll be using this when I 'm going to be roasting meat .
5 #### These work great for tiny places you normally ca n't get into to clean .
5 #### Works like a gem and way cheaper than most stores .
5 #### Bought one for a 325 pound band saw and it works great . So , i bought another a week later for a 6 x 48 belt sander . If i need more mobile tool bases , i 'll buy more . These are very adjustable , they fit , they work , they are sturdy . Not toy quality by any means .
4 #### Good product . I wish it was like the old ones , made out of metal , would have been heaver , but much niver . Now its some plastic cheaply painted , ends up looking cheap and bad . But its not , works great , sounds like sometthing is loose when you shake it on the inside , but maybe it just comes like that . So far i can measure stuff , simple .
3 #### I like the feeder , but our squirrels must have a high IQ because they have found several ways to still get the birdseed .
5 #### I wish I knew why so many people did n't get any relief with these electronic chasers . I 've used two different brands in two different yards and they worked perfectly both times . However , something strange happened this past weekend . Laying right next to one of the chaser was a baby rattlesnake . As one reviewer noted , the electronic sound does resemble that of a rattlesnake . Not sure if junior was thinking it was Mom or a competitor . And while I 'm glad the moles are gone , if I ever see another rattlesnake , I 'm taking these devices and throwing them away !
5 #### This will work with Porter Cable 18v flashlights and its a better price than if you order the Porter Cable bulb alone
5 #### This one works ! I 've been in the electrical business for over thirty years , had numerous " dykes " that worked OK but the well known " Cherry Rivet Cutters " are the ones that work the best . If you 're looking for side - cutters that wo n't let you down , these are the ones . ( There are other brands out there so just stick to the name - brand ones and you ca n't go wrong . ) These cut cleanly and seem to last forever ; no pinched conductors that have to be cut again and due to the thickness and angle of the jaws , you will have these for a very long time without having to sharpen them . Awesome cutters ! )
5 #### Work great ! Reviews were right they are sharp and get the job done without crushing the plant .
5 #### Did the handle rip off ? Yes . Did the bottom drop out ? Yes . But both happened after 10 years of hard use ! I just ordered another one .
4 #### I use this mainly for framing . I like the weight and balance of the hammer . At 20 oz it handles most framing needs . Not an ideal hammer for " dirty " work , but I use my 160z general purpose hammer for that stuff . Estwing makes a great hammer and this is no different .
5 #### I love anything made by OXO and this peeler is no exception . Its quick and easy to use and I love it for peeling everything . I also like to use it for making thin ribbons of cucumber and carrots for salads .
5 #### Great finish nailer . I still have and use my older one which I purchased years ago !
5 #### I can not say enough nice things about this corn popper ! It is hands down THE best corn popper I 've ever used . We give these away with a bag of organic non GMO popcorn as a gift ! I love , love , love it ! We keep one in the camper , and one at home !
5 #### I love this axe - I 'm about 6'2 " and the handle length feels perfect for me when splitting a log that is sitting up on a block about 1 ft from the ground . It is very solid and feels well made . The handle is very comfortable with or without gloves .
5 #### Not much to say about this self releasing collet with locking nut : it locked the router bit down properly when tightened and released the bit with loosened . This is a nice feature as I did n't need to tap the side of the router shaft before the collet came loose .
2 #### This is a n overpriced product based on what else is out there in the market place . The single t5 bulb is insufficient for any but the smallest growing system .
5 #### Nice quality plastic . Handle is good . Very happy with this tray .
5 #### It 's a salad spinner , it works great , there is nothing more to say
1 #### I used this product in a pond with 8 goldfish in the 6 - 10 inch range , some plants , oh and thousands of tadpoles . I went light on the dose because I figured it was easier to just add more if needed . I sprinkled the fluid in at the waterfall , and in a few other spots . Low and behold it did n't remove the algae , but boy did it do a number on the tadpoles . The goldfish do n't look too pleased either , their behavior is odd to say the least .
3 #### Advertised as 1/4 ' and up . Very difficult to achieve 1/4 " , assumed that the 2 outside blades together without any shims would be 1/4 " . Not so . Otherwise quality is very good .
5 #### I have been using this whisk almost daily to make pancakes for my family . It has held up very well in the dishwasher . It works great as a whisk . I love it !
5 #### The walkway is a very nice construction and looks great . Seems like good quality , but time will tell . Holding up well in the rain so far .
4 #### Great for cutting off early buds or flower stems . Fiskars does n't necessarily have the toughest / highest quality products out there , but they have a top notch warranty . I buy their products since they have such a great warranty and customer service that I do n't need the need to spend more on other brands . I know if I break the tool they 'll cover it no questions asked . Fill out the claim and send a picture with it .. good to go !
5 #### This tool mixed up my soil very easily this year . Used it with a short handle and the longer handle , easy on and off !
2 #### Gave this a try and ended up going back to using my fingers . Trying to get this to only let out 1 or 2 seeds at a time is nearly impossible unless the seeds are large , which most of the veggie seeds I use are not .
5 #### This little contraption is the coolest thing that Dremel has ever produced . It works well with my Dremel 200 . Just keep in mind that this is for very small projects or designs . It works well for my needs . And for the price , you really ca n't beat it . I love it !
5 #### Wow , I had no idea that this 25 footer would be so hefty . It certainly will do the job for me , but I 'll need to make sure to hang onto it so it does n't fall on my foot and do any damage ( smile ) .
5 #### I really like these as they work form dusk ' til dawn . Other types of these timers have trouble knowing when to turn on and off . Some others I 've had have stayed on long after sunrise which defeats the purpose of the device .
4 #### Good popper . Air poppers are better and easier to clean up then this one as you have to use oil . I use coconut oil .
5 #### Worked as a great replacement bag for the Harber Freight 3 - In-1 Electric Blower Vacuum Mulcher labeled Portland
5 #### Just as described , fits perfectly on either of my Unisaws , one from the 70 's and the other twenty years newer .
5 #### These are even cuter in person ! If you love cupcakes , you will adore these !
1 #### I 've purchased many oxo products in the past and I have always been very satisfied with them . I am sorry to say this one is the exception . After only one use the handle split when I went to pour out the contents . I even tried to glue it back together but it would n't hold so I now have an overpriced measuring cup .
5 #### These are easily my favorite bowls on Earth . I will continue to buy them until they do n't make them anymore !
5 #### works great for raccoons . its big enough to catch two at a time .
4 #### Does the job , and does it very well . The only reason for 4 stars is : the blade mount keeps turning around while you 're tightening it , so you kind of have to have 3 hands to do it . Or help yourself with a knee :)
5 #### My $ 7 tractor supply co. version of this wrench has stood up to about 5 years of hard use and abuse . I have high hopes for the klein brand . A little heavy , but feels solid . Adjusts smoothly and does n't wander or lock up . So far so good .
5 #### This thing is great for sucking up all the animal fir . Really happy with it .
5 #### One of the things I love most about Oxo is that it 's not a company to rest on its laurels . Even when they have a perfectly great product on the market , they look for ways to make it even better . And with this latest version of their salad spinner , Oxo has done it again ! I had the previous version for more years than I can remember -- the darned thing was bulletproof . And I 'd still be using it now if a clueless house guest had n't stuck its spinner top cover in the bottom rack of my dishwasher with the wash cycle set for extra hot water . As you might expect , the plastic warped and that was that . I was concerned that the new model could n't measure up to the old one , but to my pleasant surprise it was improved in every way . The plastics throughout look and feel to be of higher quality , the appearance is far more attractive , the new compact design takes up less space in my cabinet and the spinner mechanism works as well as ever . What 's not to love ? ! So bravo , Oxo , for once again being the company for which great is n't good enough . Thank you for taking the time to read my review and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision !
2 #### Very disappointed as it only made the water worst - followed directions and could n't believe how the water went green after such a short time - it never turned green before using this . Wasted money .
3 #### It did n't work in my mini pond . It sunk down in couple of days .
4 #### Excellent bathroom fan switch . I noticed they are no longer made in the USA . Hope it lasts as long as the domestic models .
5 #### Works just fine and the extra 2 ' in length is very useful in reaching around the shop . I just clamp the hose directly to my Dust Deputy . Paul
4 #### This is a really good peeler , and I am really happy with it , my only complaint is that it peels a little narrow for my taste .
4 #### These are well packaged and good sized chips with a nice smell .
5 #### I 've been a fan of Freud blades ever since I bought my first years ago and have been going back to them time and time again . I have a Freud on all my saws and they all seem to work very well . They last a fair amount of time even after running countless board feet of hard maple and veneered plywood .... and that ply can be tough on a blade . For the price they seems to be tough to beat . This particular blade resides on my table saw and has been a great addition to the smaller 1.75HP motor .
5 #### I purchased this to replace a faulty head that came on another unit . It works perfectly .
5 #### This was a replacement for my previous OXO tongs of this style . This is a smaller size than my last one and I quite like that . It fits well in my kitchen drawers . It gives me the dexterity I want when grilling small items like shrimp while being strong enough to handle larger items like a big slab of tri tip . My old one was discarded because the locking mechanism failed . It did n't last as long as I would like ( forever ) but I did n't feel like it was unreasonable as I use the tongs very frequently .
5 #### The first lasted over 30 years , so I do n't expect to see problems with this , either . From a quality control standpoint , it 's round and rolls easily , the whit paint appears to be of good quality , and the bearings fit nicely over the original shaft . The grease zerk is just a little too far inboard for access via a straight grease gun nozzle - you 'll need one with a slight dogleg or a flex hose . Its price is a nice bargain . Disappointed ( on principle ) that it 's of Chinese manufacture
5 #### This is awesome ; if you like this sort of thing;which I do not enjoy - however my husband does . And , he said this axe made all the difference . He said it was weighted right and easy to swing - but with a good workout . And , the handle was easy to grip and did not get away from him or slip . And , because the handle is ovalish shaped ; the hand can grip it better than if it was round . Highly recommend for all you lumberjacks .
5 #### Lifesaver for your fish . This device really works ! herons do n't like to get wet ! You can set the spray radius and sensitivity , so it just monitors the pond . When anything comes into that perimeter this thing makes a sound like a rattlesnake as it starts spraying water left and right . The heron flies off fast ! Not sure it deters raccoons , but my pond is raccoon proof . You just have to remember to turn this off before you walk past it , then turn it back on . Our first one developed a leak after the second year , so this is my second one . Love it !
5 #### Best few bucks I 've spent , hours of cheap entertainment . Bugs have been bad this year for some reason , so time to wack 'em with the big weapons . This ai n't your Walmart bug zapper , this is a GOOD one . Quality build , and an incredibly satisfying ZAP noise whenever one of the pests goes to meet the Maker . Hilarious . It has definitely cut down the population of the skeeters . they are still there , but probably 75 % reduced from previous . FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS : -Place AWAY from where you set out -Don't spray it with water ! ! -Cleat it off with a light knock & compressed air from time to time
5 #### Excellent product . Easy to install , attractive , and it switches without a hitch . Seems rugged and likely to be reliable for a long time . The ones I installed replaced two 23 year old Intermatic timers . One of those was dying ; the printing on the timer plates had also gotten pretty hard to see .
4 #### Does exactly what it is meant to do . Plain and simple with easy leveling adjustments .
5 #### Great can opener ! Very sturdy , cuts well , fits nicely in hands .
5 #### I built my all in one woodworking bench system with nine doors with this set . It performed flawlessly Good tools produce better results .
5 #### Great pliers made in Meadville , Pennsylvania USA . High quality and reasonable price . Bought 2 pairs . Difficult to find hand tools made in USA and not China or Taiwan . Highly recommended !
5 #### I need a fast shot on some days for a caffeine lift . This is perfect . Its kind of cute to ... LOL
4 #### The knives are very sharp , well machined and do what they 're supposed to do . I have 2 quibbles with these Delta replacement parts . First is that the price is pretty high for the product , but I guess that 's what you 're going to find with an OEM replacement part . Second thing is that they could supply these with a sharpened edge on both sides so that you could just flip them over when they need replacement . I recommend using a&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Rockler - Magnetic - Jointer - Jig / dp / B004AJYQIO / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Rockler Magnetic Jointer Jig</a>&nbsp;(or equal ) to set these knives . The jig makes the process go much more quickly .
5 #### Awesome little Spud . Opens enough to undo even the largest regulators and hose fittings . Keep it , a pair of welpers and maybe a tape measure / soap stone on me at all times
5 #### This is effective ! I 'm in deer territory and sprayed plants twice , once in late fall on a warm day , another spray at beginning of year during a break in the cold , snowy weather . The resident deer have n't nibbled any of the sprayed plants . I 'd use this again next winter .
5 #### Kinda hard to go wrong with this one , you know what you expect it to do , and it does it .
5 #### As with others , I just wanted the guts of the timer to replace a pool timer . It was cheaper to buy this than just the guts .
3 #### The product is fine - it 's basically just a big tarp to put under the above ground pool . Its nothing special but the price was fine . If you get the right size tarp for a better price at another location , just go with that .
5 #### About 5 years ago I got into cooking stir fry a little bit and found that cutting carrots , onions and many other vegitables was quite a chore with the cheap selection of knives that my kitchen was stocked with . I had to get sometimes near paper thin slices of various ingredients and there was no way even the best knife sold by Target could stack up to the task . I went to a real cookware store and purchased this knife and the 14 " sword like knife for starters . The first slice through an onion I knew where the extra money goes , some of it is for the name , but the rest is all quality . These knives will amaze you with how well they feel with their perfect balance and with a little work , you can get the blade sharp enough to shave with . When I held the 14 " knife balanced on a tomato and just pulled , the weight of the knife sliced through it with a clean stroke . The 10 " chefs knife I picked up as my 3rd addition and find it excellent for slicing , for dicing I prefer the heavier knife though . Cut all the coke cans you want with your Ginsu , but leave the real jobs to a real knife .
5 #### Sharp , clean , no hassle cuts through 2 / O welding cable . All other wire sizes below 2 / O is like slicing butter with a hot knife . For the technician on the go with many wires to cut this is the solution . Bright blue color makes spotting it in the tool pan very easy .
5 #### No more messy sticky cooking . Love these mats ! We are making more cookies for the kids and they do n't complain lol
2 #### Does n't hold a charge very long at all , weak , noisy , bottom - heavy , and too wheezy to blow anything away except a pile of dead ants , and dry ones at that .
3 #### It works OK but a lot of tea gets loose in it . I 've found another infuser to primarily use . This is now my backup one .
5 #### I mistakenly purchased the strips that go inside the flea traps . So , I will update this review once I have tested the product in actual conditions . But I can say it 's a very good value for the price .
5 #### This shop - vac dry filter are nice I would get it again that 's about all I can say thanks
4 #### Definitely adds to the usability of the saw . Easy to install . Would have given it 5 stars , but it droops slightly when fully extended . It still offers improved functionality / productivity for the price .
5 #### Love my superbar . This thing pry 's up whatever you want . Use it on pallets for reclaimed wood . Works great
5 #### Rock solid , classic . Wirecutter points to this as the best which was good enough for me .
2 #### Seems to not be as bright anymore - will turn on kind of bright but then dim . At furst i thought it d be too bright , now its not bright enough to even see properly if all other lights are off . Also , the clip / battery assembly is huge - i wish it was more low profile . I would and probably will try a different reading if i were to do it again
5 #### My husband and I received the Screwpull as a wedding gift , but if we ever lost if , we would n't hesitate to buy another one ! I have always had a hard time with traditional corkscrews ( eg . twisting the screw in crooked , so that the cork is sure to crumble ) , so the addition of the Screwpull to our home was most welcome ! This device is wonderfully easy to use -- uncorking a bottle of wine takes little more than a second or two ! It comes with a handy foil cutter , which removes foil neatly and cleanly , so that the screw has no trouble getting into the cork ( wax - topped corks are no problem ! ) We have a friend who thought the Screwpull was so great , she insisted on opening the wine whenever she was visiting ! This is a perfect gift for the wine enthusiast .
3 #### I have most of my hummingbird feeders on the windows of my house so I gave this window feeder a try while it was around ten dollars . Hummingbirds like the feeder and found it instantly . However , there 's no way for me to add an ant moat to the feeder , and ants found the feeder on my second story sun room window within few days . The base does not come apart for ease of cleaning , so you 'll need to soak it with vinegar to occasionally clean out black molds since there 's no way for you to reach all the nooks and cranny with your fingers or brush . I have it attached to east facing window ( no harsh afternoon sun ) , and I 've been careful with the back plastic clips ( which are known to be fragile ) and the feeder is still functional after a year , but if you have ants around your yard , I 'd look elsewhere for other window feeders . I still use it because hummingbirds seem to prefer it , but I have to keep rotating on different windows to deter ant trails , .
5 #### Just as described . Good product at a good price . Highly recommend .
3 #### Works ok bur not as heavy duty as I expected
5 #### I purchased this on behalf of our Activities Committee ( a Senior 's highrise ) and it fits our needs perfectly . We like that a cup can be set nicely under the spigot . Very well made . Experienced again Amazon 's wonderful service !
1 #### I love OXO products for the most part but this product just is not well designed . It does open larger jars but it is clumsy and difficult to use . My husband and I have arthritis and I was hoping this opener would open twist off soda or water bottles that always seem to give us trouble . The opening is way too big to accomplish that so , back it went to the supermarket . I had hopes this OXO product could solve our bottle opening problem but since it does n't , I am rating this only one star .
5 #### Wow ... is all I can say . The suction on this thing is amazing . It was literally sticking to the floor . I will say that the attachment at the floor made me fear it would put marks on my wood floors . I tested a small area and it did n't . I would have just preferred a softer bottom . I had a bottom with fuzz / bristles on it that I switched out for certain floor types . It stunk a bit that it did n't come with two different attachments , one for rugs and one for hard floors , but I 'm still very happy with the vacuum . Came with two bags . I plan to get another bag that you can just empty and reuse . Not sure if it is here on amazon or not .
5 #### One of us needs to show how easy this product is to store . The main 90 section slides into the cross bar allowing this to be stored flat , taking up very little shelf space .
5 #### These actually work . It does seem to take a day or three to finally start really attracting flies . Word of caution . Put them well away from the patio , front , or porch doors or the area where you spend time . They do smell like , uh , well , like fly attractant if you know what I mean;- ) They reek ! Also remember , they attract those pesky flies in your area , but I think they can attract them from miles away also , LOL . Worked for me .
5 #### The brotform is very useful with the soft doughs created by " no knead " bread recipes . It encourages the dough to rise higher than it would if it were just left on a flat surface . Check the internet for tips on flowering or otherwise lining the basket before use . After my first try , I got the knack of it and am pleased with the results . It is also great with regular kneaded doughs . This is a high quality basket at a very good price .
5 #### Adjustable so that when the triangular hook is pulled out the tongs stay closed . That 's great for hanging up after use .
5 #### I had been looking for a doulbe broiler for sometime and finally found this one . It is a very nice one , too ! Thanks !
5 #### i got this for my husband as a gift . he loves it . we use it over New Years mostly to make a special Dutch dessert . he says it is exactly like the ones he is used to in Europe . came on time and has lasted a long time .
5 #### I bought a six foot 3/4 inch pipe at the hardware store . It was threaded on both ends , so I figured that I would cut it in the middle and put pipe clamps on each end . The reviews for both the Bessey BPC-34 and the Jorgensen 50 Pony clamp were good , so I bought one of each . Jorgensen 50 Pony clamp * Pros : Heavier duty screw , tighter clearance between clamp and pipe , heavier duty tail stop , heavier - duty design overall Bessey BPC-34 * Pros : Slightly lower cost , plastic clamp covers , slightly better foot design * Cons : Finish is adequate , but a bit rough I believe that the Jorgensen clamp is better built and offers better value . If possible , it would be nice to see some of the design elements of the Bessey included in this clamp and even better finish , although between the two I prefer the Jorgensen and believe that it offers better value .
1 #### I purchased this to go with a circular saw I purchased on the same Order . This does not fit on the saw I ordered ; I always check , and did n't see any type of information to indicate this product would not fit on that saw . Amazon needs to pay more attention to the accessory items it offers when you purchase an item , to make sure the products assigned to individual ID numbers are compatible .
4 #### I am making my first foray into loose tea . This tea ball is an well - made inexpensive infuser with a sturdy hook and chain . It works in the smallest tea cups and the largest pitchers .
5 #### I bought this to rout 3/16"deep grooves for shelf standards in some cabinets I 'm making . I 've run a good 30 + channels through birch plywood and the cuts are smooth and the router does n't seem to be working hard at all . Great bit !
