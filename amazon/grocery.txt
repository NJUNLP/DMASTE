5 #### If you like strong tea , this is for you . It might even be a little too strong for me .
5 #### Love the tea . The flavor is way better than the regular Lipton black tea . Definetly worth the money .
5 #### I have searched everywhere until I browsed Amazon and found it ! This is the tea Lipton should be selling on grocery store shelves . The stuff I last purchased is just awful , and nowhere near as good as I remember .
4 #### Tea made with Lipton Yellow Label teabags is much better than tea made with regular Lipton teabags .
5 #### I love this tea ! Okay , I 'm not a high falutin ' tea snob , but I first enjoyed this Lipton yellow label tea when on a trip to Singapore , and whether it was the room service , the company , or the country - it left such a favorable impression on me , I search it out whenever possible . Maybe it 's the same as the USA 's white label Lipton tea , but the yellow label tea appears to me to be smoother and more mellow . I would highly recommend it - give it a try !
5 #### Discovered this tea at a local Med . Rest .... a great tea , have been sharing with friends . Everyone likes it and will be ordering more . Thanks Amazon for carrying this tea , otherwise not available where we live .
4 #### Well I bought this tea after being in Malaysia for several months , mostly to try making teh tarik without using loose tea as we did several times . I failed with regular Lipton black tea , thought the difference must be because of Yellow label . That turned out to be wrong , the problem is the condensed milk which is clearly different in Malaysia than what I 've been able to get in the U.S. I would say the taste is marginally different than regular Lipton black tea , if you had me do a blind taste test I 'm not convinced I would be able to know which I was drinking with a reliable success rate . I ordered 4 boxes and the packaging was sealed well , but it has this unmistakable dust - like taste that is ruining the tea . Edit : I 've gone through 2 boxes and only the first had the dusty taste . The others are fine , and pretty much taste the same as regular Lipton black tea
5 #### We really like this tea . It is definitely different from the regular yellow box of 100 that I get in the stores . You can tell the difference when you drop them into hot water . They sink much faster than the regular ones . In the end , I think they have a somewhat stronger flavor that is good . I plan to keep buying these .
5 #### Hard to find in the U.S.A. Exactly as described , good quality .
5 #### I make the best brewed iced tea with this yellow label Lipton tea . I make it by the gallon using the same amount as regular loose teas . I only add 1/4 cup of sugar per gallon . This tea has quickly replaced soda and tastes even better . After opening , I transfer the entire contents into a glass container ( not plastic ) with a metal screwed lid to keep the air out . We love this tea and hope Amazon keeps carrying it .
3 #### I have recently started drinking hot tea again ( since my childhood when Grandma made us hot tea with milk & sugar ) and have been trying different types and brands of tea to find my favorites . I ca n't speak the tea lover 's lingo ( full - bodied , smoky with hints of arsnic , etc . ) but this tea is decent . I use it mostly to make iced tea but I drink it hot occasionally too . I have been completely spoiled on Dilmah tea & now any others seem inferior . Lipton Yellow Label is definitely better than PG Tips ! I initially bought PG Tips and could never make a cup of hot tea that did not have a bitter after taste . I thought it was my brewing technique until I tasted better teas . I probably wo n't buy more of this tea since there are so many others out there to try but I plan to use up the rest of what I bought . If anyone wants some PG Tips let me know & I 'll send it to you for the price of shipping ! !
5 #### I like pretty much all of Lipton 's tea ... I just do n't see any difference from this tea to all the other types on Lipton loose teas .
5 #### I was watching a youtube video about buying tea in New York and there was a guy from somewhere in the Pakistan , Afghanistan area who went to tea shops serving their ethnic choices of tea . In one of the shops they prepared I think it was called Kashmiri tea , I watched them put the ingredients in and they used this box of tea . I liked the final product . I tweeked the ratio of ingredients to my liking . Long story short , this tea is potent and I think only best for hot tea .
3 #### it was ok , but it did n't taste like the Lipton of my youth that i loved so much . Maybe Iv'e just become too much of a tea snob !
5 #### Great taste use it for cold brew - works great . Excellent flavor-- I cold brew and mix 1/2 tsp lemon juce with THM sweetener blends - great ! ! ! !
5 #### Best tea for my single cup coffee maker . I purchased stainless steel single cup reusable . Make fresh tea every time . So much better than tea bags .
4 #### Good tea . Way better than baseline Lipton tea . The baseline Lipton tea is more of a powder , where this tea is in a granular - form . It brews much better / more efficiently . It has a really deep ( almost chocolate - like ) flavor . Much deeper / more potent than their bagged tea . I usually prefer Lipton teas , however , I did not give it 5 - stars because while it is good , it is not as good as some others ( Tetley , PG Tips , Taylors and Peet 's , now Mighty Leaf . Orange Pekoe tea is considered ( in the U.S. ) as a budget tea and not a premium tea . This Lipton tea is priced accordingly .
1 #### This tea looks like coffee grounds . Brewed it once and threw it out .
5 #### My second favorite tea ! Drink lots it 'll make your day better . It 's not for tea drinkers who like weak tea . It is dark and rich .
5 #### Half yellow label and half black tea brewed in a French coffee pot works perfect for my taste
4 #### Less bitter than the Lipton black tea sold in most US supermarkets
4 #### Good tea flavor . Not the best I 've ever had , but it is good , and the price is very reasonable . I am happy with this tea as an addition to the various teas I keep .
3 #### The tea is wonderful . I ca n't find it in any regular store near me . My only problem , and it 's a big one , is these were to be gifts but that is very hard when there is a big price sticker on the front of the box .
5 #### I wrote the review for this tea for the other regular liptons great stuff , blends well with flavored creamers less bitter holds up well when strong taste good with various water and various brewing methods and strengths a good everyday drinker I will buy again , and again , and , again ....
5 #### This is the best flavor tea for iced tea I have found . Add a little jasmine tea or other flavoring . Most pre - flavored teas are too strong flavoring . Use this tea with a small amount of valilla or other tea , and you can get a great iced tea with just a hint of other flavor !
5 #### this tea is the bomb , for the real die - hard industrial - strength tea drinker who likes their tea indian or middle eastern style ( especially when sweet , though no milk for me , please ) . clear , robust , flavorful , it brews up a lovely red liquor in less time than it takes to find your favorite teacup , and is also a great base into which to blend more expensive teas ( kusmi russian evening or morning tea , for example ) for special occasions -- like this beautiful may morning 's breakfast on the porch . if i were an ancient egyptian and i were leaving instructions for what to put in my tomb to supply the afterlife in amenti , i would ask for this . lots of this . amen .
5 #### This is NOT the regular Lipton 's Tea sold in the USA . This Lipton 's Yellow Label Tea is what most of the rest of the world drinks when they drink Lipton 's . It is not acidic as is the regular USA version we all know ( IE : no pucker / dry mouth ) . It is bold , but mellow -- sometimes with a hint of smoky flavor . We first drank this while living overseas , I love this Yellow Label tea . It is very good made as hot tea as well as iced . Very good with milk or cream . I have purchased this for years and will definitely purchase this again !
5 #### We discovered ' Yellow Label ' tea while in S.E.Asia . It was strong , consistently fresh , but never bitter . The tea comes as tiny rolled leaves ( ie : balls ) . Even after brewing it remains as balls-- easier to get out of the cup than leaves .
5 #### suits my taste perfectly . it is a robust black tea . best if you buy the loose tea rather than the tea bags .
4 #### My husband and I enjoy this loose orange pekoe tea . It has a more committed flavor than the tea bags , which we 're happy to have .
1 #### I bought this because I miss the taste of the Lipton tea I grew up with . When I was young , Lipton tasted so pure , and you had to hurry and take the tea out of the hot water before it got too strong . It also had more of a clear , astringent quality . Hard to explain . So I have n't had that experience in a long time , no matter whether I buy the bags or loose . Has Lipton changed since I was young ? ( I 'm talking 1960s-70's- maybe later . ) I 've noticed a lot of food items have changed quality since then and have used cheaper ingredients and / or you get less . Anybody else remember a difference in the old Lipton ? I thought buying the loose from Europe ( which I think this is ) would be better , but it 's not .
4 #### Glad I have some now - this is tough to find at the local store . Makes a nice cup of tea - if you know what you 're buying you 'll enjoy this , if you are used to loose leaves or little bags filled with powder then try a smaller size first to see if this is what you like . I love it -
5 #### I like a full bodied cup of tea and this fills the cup perfectly -- I have already ordered this product over and over again -- Amazon has a great price so give it a try I know you 'll like it -- it is very rich , full cup of tea .
3 #### Now as sweet and fragrant as the regular Lipton Orange Pekoe tea bags sold in the supermarket . I was disappointed .
5 #### been using this coffee for years and love the taste
4 #### i did not realize it was so full of sugar and powdered cream ... which i would not use i would sometime like to try one without sugar and powdered cream .... more healthy that way as i thought this Organo gold company was all about health
5 #### enjoy this coffee and have not been able to buy from Organo .
5 #### The Oregano Cafe Supreme is a really wonderful cup of coffee . My two favorite coffees are the Norwegian cooffe and Oregano Cafe supreme . In my travels around these are the two coffees I have enjoyed the most . I actually take them with me when I travel .
5 #### I love the one in the black box and all of the benefits . More energy . Great taste with non diary creamer . No sugar necessary . It is worth the price . Actually I used the black box . The gold cafe supreme was not suitable for me .
5 #### I have both the red and green curry paste . The green is milder . I use both of them in variety of dishes and often spice up soups and stews that need a little zing . It is so convient to have them in the frig .
5 #### I live in Puerto Rico and can not find Thai food here , let alone ingredients . I bought this and the red curry paste too . I had never made my own curry before , but with the help of this , I made restaurant quality curry ! There is quite a bit of product in the container , so it will last if refrigerated . Watch the shipping costs from outside vendors . They will not combine shipping in some cases .
5 #### Use very sparingly unless you love very spicy food ! Super tasty !
5 #### I LOVE this curry paste . It beats Thai Kitchen hands down , I bought that recently in a pinch and I was SORELY disappointed . This container is HUGE and will last you FOREVER . Seriously , I have this in green , red , and yellow , and one container will last me several years . It may be different for you depending on how often you make curry . The ingredients for this paste are clean and are whole30 and paleo compliant . The flavor is amazing , and I usually only need about 1 tbsp of this paste to deliver all of the robust flavor I need . This container is about the size of a pint of ice cream , but not as tall . But yes , it 's large . The paste comes in a sealed plastic bag inside of the plastic container . I just cut a corner off the top and squeeze out what I need . I store the rest folded up in the plastic container and keep it in my cabinet with my other spices . I can not stress enough how wonderful this stuff is and how nothing compares .
3 #### Has good flavor , but flavor should be stronger . Spice is stronger than flavor .
5 #### Absolutely LOVE this ! ! ! It 's spicy but sooooo flavorful . My hubby is a try curry fan ( he 's a brit ) and he LOVED this . Once container is enough to make 4 - 5 good sized meals . I wo n't buy any other curry paste again !
4 #### I love this stuff but you got ta be really accurate in how much you use . I like my soups spicy but I have made it too spicy and salty by adding too much . This will be a staple in the fridge tho .
5 #### This comes in a sealed plastic bag within the carton , cut it open and squeeze or spoon it in the lidded container . I have made several curried soups , vegetable and chicken dishes and am so pleased with the intricate flavors . This Mae Ploy brand has more heat than other green curry pastes I have used . Fabulous flavor and a generous amount , fast delivery and a good price .
4 #### I like it , but it 's definitely more spicy than I was anticipating ! Once I use up this green curry , I 'll probably try the red .
3 #### be warned this is very spicy .. don't use the recommended amount on the package.use much less .
5 #### Did n't expect that homemade green curry can taste this professional .
5 #### Actually very delicious , especially with meat and vegetable cooked in coconut milk !
5 #### This paste is authentic Green Curry Thai paste . I wish it came in a larger size . I 've used most of it already and need to order more . I 've used it in numerous styles of green curry dishes from meats to vegan and it always turns out " WOW " delicious ! . If you are pondering this , think no further , you wo n't be sorry with your purchase if you love green curry . I store this in the refrigerator between uses and it has lasted for months without issue .
5 #### Easy to make Thai dishes now with green curry at my fingertips . Excellent flavor . My guests are always begging for recipe . It 's so easy . A couple of Tablespoons and you can transform your vegetables and meats into a family treat !
5 #### Very hot . Use just a tiny bit in soups - adds a bite - too much , and it overwhelms the soup .
4 #### The 14 oz containers are a great value . Good flavor . Mae Ploy seems to be a bit salty / heavy on the Fish Sauce . So I chunk up a couple potatoes and put them in the curry as it simmers , and that absorbs a lot of the salt . This curry paste has a bit of kick , so taste it first before adding your own ginger , galangal , or hot chili peppers . Lasts for months in the fridge , no worries .
5 #### I absolutely love this curry paste . I just got a new shipment of green , red and panang . It lasted from June of 2015 . Kept in its bag and original cup in the fridge . Green is the hottest and all have very distinct and different flavors . It 's easy to whip up a tasty , authentic dinner , usually with cubed chicken and eggplant or zucchini , carrots and bamboo shoots . I like it hot , so I use a good amount . If you do n't like spicy , use very sparingly but be prepared for less flavor . Serve over cooled Jasmine rice
5 #### This is good stuff ! But if you ca n't take the heat , like my family ca n't , just use 1/2 of what the recipe calls for . Then it 's the perfect amount of heat and spice .
5 #### Def the best of all Mae Ploy 's curries . Very easy to make very good Thai food now .
5 #### My favorite . Keeps in your fridge for ever . Flavor is spot on . Exactly what I ordered . This is the one to buy .
5 #### I 'm so happy for this brand . I have not the patience to make all my own seasonings for all the curries , and these pastes have been a headache saver . I do n't have to store spices that will go bland with this . Just keep in the back of my fridge and it 's ready to use when needed . Not being a huge fan of Green curry previously , but knowing I love this brand , I got this for a recipe . It 's fantastic . Probably my new favorite . We make a noodle soup dish with veggies and it comes out tasting like my favorite soup : Tom Kah . But without any additional ingredients . Very much recommend all their flavors , but this one is spectacular all on it 's own .
5 #### By far the best pasted I 've used , even better if you purchase lime leaves to add to the mix .
5 #### Best green curry paste . A little goes a long way . Unless you want to burn your mouth out , add in small quantities . Has a great flavour !
5 #### Tastes great , authentic . Comes shrimp curry , friends loved it .
5 #### I have always made my own curry but it is pointless to spend all that time when this goodness is at my fingertips . I used to spend hours cooking down the spices but this just needs chili oil and some coconut cream and you are ready to go . I highly rec buying a jar of the kaffir lime to sprinkle on top .
5 #### I bought all three flavors . It is super hot and concentrated flavor , making it very economical to use . Most recipes call for 3 tablespoons for a four person dish , but I can only withstand one taablespoon in a full recipe . 14 oz is a lot of curry paste . I have had it in my refrigerator for one year and it is still good and strong . With so much spice and heat , it will not spoil .
2 #### This brand is ok if you like it really ( REALLY ) spicy . But it 's so bland that you have to use a lot of it . By that time it 's too hot too eat and still does n't have a lot of flavor that I 'm used to in the traditional Thai dish .
5 #### Love this and the Red Curry . Very simple to make . Put about 2 tablespoons in a pot with tablespoon of Oil , heat it up and stir then and add whatever meat and veggies you want with about 2 cups of coconut milk . I can have a meal in about 15 minutes .
5 #### I was glad to find some Thai " green curry paste , " since we 've moved to an area with far fewer Asian products available . In the past , I 've had the powder ( " phuket " ) , and frankly , I 'd rather have it in that form . One thing I thought was odd with this product is that it comes in a plastic bag , so you need to squeeze it out into the jar for storage . The paste is really thick , so it 's a minor chore . I guess the plastic bag is more secure in shipping than if they covered the inner rim in plastic , like so many other companies do .
5 #### Good yellow curry paste , flavor is excellent ... Small container a bit pricey
2 #### My husband likes it . I was not too thrilled with shrimp paste but decided to try it because there is no gmo soy or canola like the other new variety I was considering . I usually buy miews flying pan or marions kitchen . It is waaaaay to spicy . Especially for western pallets . I love spicy food but we used 1/4 of recipe on package and still unedible to me . My husband has a cast iron stomach , I still will order med hot to hot at ethnic restaurants just fine . I did not like the spice seems to be red chile in favor and not curry spice . I also found this very oily and do not know why .
5 #### Somewhat hot if you use as much as the directions suggest ( you will need a magnifying glass to read the directions ) . Very good paste for curries .
5 #### This is the real deal . Authentic and delicious . Not a lot of fillers like some brands . It 's pretty much solid spices . Just be aware that it is pretty spicy , unless you only use a little .
4 #### We followed the cooking directions carefully , but the curry did n't turn out so well . It was 1 ) super spicy , 2 ) extremely watery , and 3 ) no flavor . Quite disappointed . I 'm sure we just need to tweak the recipe a little and adjust to taste at our next attempt at perfecting this dish . Despite the disappoint , this paste is really authentic and smells so good . Our entire apartment smelled like heaven as the paste was slowly bubbling on the stove . Also , it 's much more expensive on Amazon - I found the exact same thing at my local Korean market for about $ 2.50 .
5 #### We love it ! Awesome , strong , curry flavor . Best one we 've had so far !
5 #### This stuff is HOT . But it has serious flavor , too . I find I want to eat it more than once a week . Start out using a quarter of that suggested on the label . I will be a MAE PLOY fan until ....
5 #### Love this product a little goes a long ways taste so good I made a chicken and coconut Thai soup today !
5 #### Really good green curry paste : we think it has a good balance of green curry elements . Combine this with some coconut milk , add whatever else you want ( garlic , ginger , nampla , kaffir lime leaves , lemongrass ) and you are on your way . Great to add a nice Thai element to other dishes too .
5 #### We only use Mae Ploy curry pastes , and green is definitely our favorite . We also get panang and yellow , which are also 5 - star , but we just prefer the green over them . Has the best ingredient list of all the curries . This jar probably makes 20 huge batches of curry or more , each of which feed our family of three .
5 #### Wonderful Curry - love it . This helps me to make Green Curry as good as , if not better than any Thai Food place !
5 #### This green curry tastes so good and can not go wrong . According to the instruction , I have to use Coconut milk for the base instead of regular milk . I m too lazy to drive to asian market to get the coconut milk and it is expensive like 3$. I used coconut oil to stir fry the vegetables and curry then I pour regular 2 % reduced fat milk and It really works . The flavor is soo authentic without weird smell . The consistency is good and it goes well with any vegetables . I put broccoli , carrots , mushroom , potatoes . If this is too spicey or too saulty for you , put eggs and stir really well .
5 #### The best curry paste out there . A little dab will do you and it keeps in the fridge almost indefinitely .
5 #### I love it , a little bit goes a long way so I freeze it .
4 #### I have Mae Ploy Yellow Curry and Panang Red Curry Paste and I love them . So , I thought I 'd try the green paste . I do n't like it as well as the other two , but it is tasty and very hot . Next time I make it I 'll use less than a tablespoon . I like hot and spicy curry but this made my eyes water ! A tip , though , is to eat applesauce as a side with this and it definitely cools down your mouth .
2 #### It was bit expensive . Chinese market was a little cheaper.lol
3 #### I have tried this twice , but failed to make delicious food . A little bit disappointed .
5 #### Never cooked curry before . This makes it so simple . I just follow the directions . You need to experiment with the amount you use for the amount of heat you want . I use a heaping table spoon ( silverware , not a measuring spoon ) of the curry paste for one standard size can of coconut milk , and about a pound of meat or shrimp . It 's hot , but not crazy hot . I tried 2 heaping tbl spoons the last batch , and it was way too hot for me . I suggest using a simple soy marinade on your meats , and I give a partial stir fry to mine , to give it a little color , before adding it to my curry mixture . Gives the meat better flavor I think as the curry does n't have time to penetrate it . I use light coconut milk , so I let it reduce to thicken up before I turn off the heat . Add sugar and to taste until you get it where you want it . Just as good as the Thai restaurant I eat at ! I think I 'll try the Panang next .
5 #### So many flavors . I ca n't begin to tell you how much I love all of mae ploy curries . I should ask them for recipes . Basically its a plastic lidded container about the size of I wanna say two and one half yogurts . It has a bag inside that you pull out and inside that clear bag is the curry . Its all mashed in there . I cut a corner and take out a little at a time . Having the spices mixed and its a paste makes it nicer to make a sauce and marry this flavor to anything . Veggies love it that are steamed , scrambled eggs , rice pasta and even fish and meat .
5 #### Could n't say a bad word about this product . The taste is phenomenal and saved me a TON of TIME in that I did not have to make it
3 #### Beware ! Lots of hot spice . Use just a teaspoon and adjust slowly . Personally I prefer the Thai Kitchen brand whivh hss more lemongrass and less heat .
5 #### This paste is a bit mouth hurting hot , but once I figured out the right mix , it was great . You can not beat this for making green curry dishes of any kind . I may even use this in flavoring some rice .
5 #### I have tried all the curris from Mae Ploy ( excluding the Panag ) and various other curry pastes out there . Mae Play is a solid and affordable curry paste that keeps . The Red has more heat , but the green has more spice . The Yellow and Matsaman curry paste do n't really have any heat to me , but do taste good as well . For a holiday treat , substitute eggnog for coconut milk with the green curry . It is super delicious ( just be advised your GI tract WILL hate you later for doing so )
5 #### My cousin dorsher loves green curry and Mae ploy Is his favorite he does n't need cookware just a spoon because he thinks its pudding , I tried to cook this for him with some dog noses but he screamed at me . " DORSHER TO DUNGEON ! DORSHER TO DUNGEON ! " I guess he feels like he 's in a dungeon when offered real food ? Oh well . Mae Ploy Green Curry Paste .
5 #### I love ethnic foods and to cook them . I recently purchased another product which was a major disappointment , so I was back to the drawing board . The reviews won me over , and free shipping , so I ordered one of each , red and green . Tonight I used the green for the first time and WOW ! It made me look like a gourmet international chef - it is so incredibly good ! It was definitely hot , though , which is fine with me but I was glad I had the coconut milk base . This is excellent and I will keep this on hand always .
4 #### Along with a can of coconut milk , this marvelous Green curry paste is the foundation for a fairly authentic Thai meal . Follow the instructions -- starting with a little oil , fry 2 - 4 tab . of the paste for a few seconds to bring out the flavor , add the coconut milk , meat and veggies . Toward the end , add sugar to taste and , for tartness , add either fish sauce or lime juice . Enjoy . Depending on the time I have , I augment the sauce with kafir lime leaves , basil and fresh garlic and/or ginger . But these additions not needed , but give the sauce a bit more zing .
5 #### Being newbie to THai cooking , these are great addition to my kitchen . Its tastes really good for vegetable and chicken curry .
5 #### This curry paste makes a delicious curry . I just fried up some chicken and vegetables and added coconut milk to this for a delicious dish . Quite spicy , so if you 're looking for something mild , look elsewhere
2 #### I had really high hopes for this brand . I used to use Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste ( check my review of it ) but they changed something so I 've been on the look - out for a substitute . This had great reviews and a decent price so of course I gave it a try . I 've only used it once , but it was MEGA - salty . Now , I 'm a person who puts salt on bacon . It 's actually rare that I think something is too salty . I also made it with boxed chicken broth so maybe that added salt put it over the top ? I 'm gon na try this again soon using less paste and a reduced- or no - sodium broth to see if maybe that reduces the saltiness . I 'll write a follow - up at that point . I REALLY want this to work ! !
5 #### Excellent strong green curry taste ! My husband finished his bowl and said I should open a restaurant ! Great product ! I will buy again !
3 #### If you know what you 're doing , ( by which I mean , you know how to enhance a curry to draw out subtle flavors ) , this is a fine product . However , used alone , it 's not going to create a dish that blows your palate - mind . It 's good , yes , but it 's very basic . So , using it and creating a great curry is going to take some finessing . If you 've shopped locally , you 'll know this is a terrific price . Just be prepared to have plenty of essential other ingredients available to make your dish really sing .
4 #### Had n't had green curry before so I bought this to give it a try . Turned out really good and I loved the heat level I got using 2 Tbs of paste . I ordered the red paste too but have n't gotten to try it yet , but if it 's as good at this paste it should be way better than what my grocery store carries .
5 #### I find myself using this in much more than intended when I purchased it - tomato soup , rice dishes , in a sauce for vegetables , you name it . It occasionally gives me shivers , I kid you not . I keep it in the freezer and after several months it seems to be staying fresh as well as not turning into a solid chunk .
5 #### I 've used this a lot recently in some of my chicken dishes . I do n't use a lot , I do like spicy foods and a little goes a long way . The plus is its in a bag and you can squeeze out what you need .. Yes I will buy more
5 #### I 've purchased different curries in the grocery store and was never completely happy with the flavor . I read a recipe that recommended this brand and after using it I can see why they recommend this specific brand . Great flavor - I purchased all 3 - Green , Red , and Yellow curry paste and have enjoyed all 3 types .
3 #### I like other styles of Mae Ploy curry paste , but the green just does n't work for me . Overwhelming garlic , no heat , and very bland . I would not purchase this product again .
5 #### Because of Mae Ploy Thai Green Curry Paste , green thai curry has become my signature dish . I am always being asked to make it . Remember that it is very spicy so a little goes a long way . The flavors in this paste are complex and varied and make for a delicious curry . We are living overseas ( not in Thailand ) so I am happy to see that it is available on Amazon !
5 #### Everyone who has had the opportunity to eat this loves this - I like this a lot with green and yellow zuccini , carrots and bamboo shoots with thin sliced turkey breast . Living too far from any real good oriental restaurants is no longer such a bummer ... just came back to order more ... price went up a bit but it 's still well worth it . I see some complaints about too salty - I do n't think it is salty and I do NOT use any salt when cooking nor do I eat any salty snacks so my taste buds would complain if this was too salty . Too hot ? The way we make it , it 's at most medium hot while the flavor is excellent ( not diluted with coconut milk) ... the hot sensation goes away very quickly ... we love hot food - almost to a point of burning lips , eyes and nostrils hot but this is medium hot . Maybe it 's less hot for us because we use a lot of veggies and eat it with white rice which always turns down the heat .
5 #### Curry has officially become my FAVORITE food over the past year . I ca n't believe I waited 35 years to try it . We went through all of the grocery store curry pastes and never could find one that had great flavor and spice . Mae Ploy knocks it out of the park ! We always have 3 or 4 of these in our fridge & pantry . These make super yummy curry with or without coconut milk ( we 've recently started using chicken stock instead of coconut milk to cut down on the calories ) A definite MUST HAVE for curry lovers Add some&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Mae - Ploy - Sweet - Chili - Sauce-25 - Ounce - Bottle - Pack - of-2 / dp / B00016UX0K / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce , 25 - Ounce Bottle ( Pack of 2)</a>&nbsp;to your pantry too !
4 #### My only complaint about this product is that sometimes it is difficult to squeeze just a very small amount from the bottle into the mixture to be colored . I do n't do massive amounts of baking , and I find that sometimes it is really hard to get a very light color when adding this product to very small quantities of mixture . However , the colors are very bright and I was very pleased to find that the color is evenly distributed throughout the mixture . I thought this product was a little pricy , but after trying it out , I do believe that it was worth the extra money . The product seems of high quality and it shows in my cooking whenever I want to add some color to things .
5 #### This are so much easier to use than the Wilson paste colors . Colors are vibrant , and do not taint the frosting like some colors can . These are simple to use , and do not make a mess . My only complaint is that I did not find these years ago . This is a must have if you decorate often !
3 #### The gel food coloring is great for ALL colors except black . It appears to be black and then when you actually squirt out any of it , it is instead a dark green . This was highly disappointing as I bought this pack entirely for the black gel coloring . Otherwise the other colors are as advertised and very vibrant .
5 #### Does the job ! I switched from Wilton for making hard candy . Ateco works better and blends quickly during boiling process ( no stirring ) . For one batch of hard candy I 've found that 2 drops ( not 1 , not 3 ) is perfect .
4 #### If you are looking for deep saturated colors , these are the ones for you . I had to use more than I expected while coloring white fondant but the colors were nice and bright and the farm cake turned out beautiful ! Caution , wear gloves as these will stain your hands .
1 #### This product is no where near natural / organic - I only wish I had seen the other reviews before purchasing ! It contains all the things I did not want - which is why I was looking for a natural alternative . They need to have an ingredient list on here to avoid this ... I am " returning " item . I am trying to avoid my children 's exposure to yellow 5 , red 40 and so on ... I do not understand how they can still make these things knowing what they can cause . This may be fine for someone that does n't read labels or care what their kids eat - but not for my family .
5 #### I really think this is a great product . I was leary of buying it over the internet . Worried that it might spill , or break open and get all over the other products I ordered . They work great and you really do n't have to use a whole lot of the gel . I bought it purposely because it came with black . I needed just a little black coloring and this safed the day . Great product .
5 #### I use these to color my macarons . Very vibrant , only need a touch and they are good ! The fold and mix really easily into the warm egg meringue .
3 #### I did a search for Natural ( non chemical ) food coloring . This is the first thing that shows up on the list of items . However , they are NOT natural food coloring . Loads of Red40 , which my daughter ca n't have due to ADHD . More of a fault with Amazon listings than the product or description , but I thought others should be forewarned .
5 #### These dyes create awesome colors for kids crafts . I have used them to make finger paint , paint , play dough , and salt dough . Another reviewer stated that they are not natural - this is CORRECT . They are definitely artificial dyes . I tried making my own dyes , and when that fell through , these worked great in a pinch . You only need a couple drops for really vibrant color . And they are pretty easy to clean - do n't stain after they 've been made into whatever craft . Good product for the price !
5 #### Works perfect . Made strips and pepperoni sticks , Just wish it held more meat .
4 #### Easy to use , and more importantly to clean after using same . Everything comes apart for ease of cleaning . Recommend product .
5 #### I had no idea that lean hamburger could be used for making jerky . This Jerky Works Kit is amazing - makes it so easy !
4 #### Inexpensive . Makes uniform strips of jerky . Dismantles for easy cleaning . The included seasoning packets make great tasting jerky . I wish it held a larger amount of meat though . For a pound of meat , you will have to reload about 3 times .
5 #### The Nesco American Harvest Jerky Works has made jerky preparation a snap ! The homemade jerky is comparable to the jerky sticks you can purchase in stores . The process is simple ground meat of your choice , spice and cure . Load into gun and choose between two shapes flat or round . Dependent upon your food dehydrator you can have jerky in a matter of hours . Replacement spices and cures can be found at most larger department / retail stores . Thanks Amazon.com for recommending this product !
5 #### My fave cough drop . I always keep a stock at home . Specially in cold season . It 's hard to find this flavor in any store .
5 #### Great product ! I 'm using them for the throat , but not for cough . My throat 's been dry and scratchy , especially after singing and these little guys have helped ! They are a great second choice to the original natural herb drops from Ricola ! !
5 #### These tasty lemon drops are saving my teeth . I have a dry mouth and because of that was getting cavities frequently . My dentist wanted to do a cleaning every 3 months . I suddenly realized after using these good tasting drops with excellent ingredients I have n't gotten cavities in 2 years . I 'm so grateful for this great product that is composed of healthy ingredients . It 's also saving me money .
5 #### I do not produce saliva due to an auto immune disease and the sugar free Ricola help with that . I especially like that they 're sugar free
5 #### Sugar Free - 19 Ea / Pack of original Ricola Herb Drops . Very good at throat soothing without all the un natural medicine taste of so many other cough drops . Made in Switzerland of all natural ingredients . Same formula for over seventy five years . Menthol , 4.8 mg , color ( caramel ) , extract of Ricola 's herb mixture ( elder , horehound , hyssop , lemon balm , linden flowers , mallow , peppermint , sage , thyme , wild thyme ) , peppermint oil , starch syrup , sugar . Here is some of the nutritional information . Per drop : 17 kcal , carbohydrate 4.1 g , sugars 3.2 g , sugar alcohols 0 g , other carbohydrates 0 g , fats 0 g , fiber 0 g , sodium 0 g , vitamin C 0 mg . And and FYI they do contain gluten if that is of issue to you , or those in your household .
2 #### This stuff is expensive , does n't stay soft & loses flavor quickly . I could deal with all that if it worked but I just do n't think it works any better to relieve dry mouth than regular sugar - free gum .
4 #### I have to start a course of chemotherapy ; and my dentist recommended this gum to me to chew during the months I am on chemo . I am impressed with this gum because of its way of using natural enzyme protection to relieve dry mouth and protect your teeth from decay during cancer treatment . Oh yes , it 's true -- the gum loses it mild mint flavor pretty quickly -- after just about a minute ! However , if you want to protect your mouth during chemo , it certainly could n't hurt to at least chew this gum some of the time . It beats getting cavities . At 44 I still have no cavities and I 'm not about to start now ! You do need to chew two pieces of this gum at the same time . One piece will be too small and you could accidentally swallow it , I suppose . The two pieces of gum have a total of five calories , so do n't be concerned about that . It is sweetened with xylitol . Overall , this gum can save you from dry mouth and tooth decay during a course of cancer therapy such as chemo . It may work well if you need radiation therapy , too . It 's not a fun type of bubble gum , ( how I wish that it were ) but it does what it sets out to do -- protect your mouth from decay during a course of chemo treatment . Ask your dentist if you have any questions .
3 #### I like chewing gum for my dry mouth , but Biotene is not my favorite : it is expensive , hard to find , and , in my opinion , not any better than many traditional chewing gums . You have to chew two and a time , and that costs about $ .20 per use at the listed price , not including shipping . The gum is boring and small and does n't retain flavor or the texture I like , so I do n't chew it very long when I use it . I do n't like hard gums like Dentine or bubble gum ; I usually use a soft sugar free gum like Extra . It 's cheap and comes in lots of flavors and stimulates saliva flow . I 'm not a big chewer , I mostly suck on it , or let it sit in my mouth . Biotene may be better in terms of mildness , but I love flavored gum , and am not willing to shell out so much to keep buying Biotene gum . ( I do like Biotene toothpaste , though . )
5 #### As a dentist I see many patients that have dry mouth as a result of medication use or due to cancer radiation therapy of the head and neck area . I ALWAYS RECOMMEND BIOTENE CHEWING GUM FOR THESE PATIENTS . Biotene is a biocompatible gum that has natural salivary enzymes that help remove plaque from the teeth . Gum chewing also stimulates saliva release and any natural saliva that can be produced is of benefit . This is a great product for those with dry mouths and I highly recommend it .

5 #### Traditional Medicinals is the best tasting herbal tea out there that I have tried . I have tried the Yogi teas before and did not care for them . I bought the Traditionals Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care . I take the breathe easy whenever I feel congested or like now when I had a coughing attack from some scent . My throat felt irritated and my chest felt achey and wheezy . Brewed a cup of this tea with some honey and it was so delicious and soothing . I do n't know if its the way it makes you feel when you drink it because it tastes so good , or if the herbs really do help but I do feel better , a sense of calm . I highly recommend the Breathe Easy and the Gypsy Cold Care .
5 #### This is a great tea . Flavor is good , works well , priced right and fast shipping . If you like herbal teas , try it , you 'll like it .
5 #### I drink this tea at night just before bed . It helps with my respiratory problem . I could breathe . And it helps me sleep as well . Purchasing this item on Amazon was a great idea . Fast delivery . Good price . Great value .
5 #### I love the traditional Medicinals teas , and i especially love the 15 % subscribe and save Amazon discount .
5 #### I was impressed with how quickly this started opening up my cold - congested nostrils and even my sinuses .
2 #### I got this to see if it matched up to the sinus soother . It did n't . My husband has a lot of issues and the sinus soother can completely clear him up . This just did n't .
5 #### This tea has helped me through bronchitis twice and whenever I get the sniffles which always goes down into my chest . Plus it tastes really good , too . I put a bag or two in my water mug and drink it all day .
5 #### After coughing for months , I decided to try this tea . Nothing over the counter helped at all . I did n't like the idea of buying such a large quantity , but when the tea gave me real relief , I was glad for the purchase . I had enough boxes of tea to share with friends who were also suffering from the flu or colds or allergies going around . It seemed so amazing that Breathe Easy worked so well . When I finally went to the doctor , he diagnosed me with asthma and prescribed a daily inhaler as prevention for future attacks . I will continue to use this tea whenever I start to feel congestion and cough . This is a product everyone should have in the cupboard just in case .
5 #### I love this tea , and it does seem to help clear up sinuses , and it tastes great . I should be drinking it more often .
5 #### I love , love , love this tea . It is my favorite of the Traditional Medicinals tea . It has a licorice thing going on and I happen to really like that . Not so much a licorice flavor but the chest action that it gives you . It really works . Also , this can make quite a cup of tea . I have one of those mega - mugs and this made even that size ... maybe like 16oz?- with one bag , still strong and wonderful . If you are sick , asthmatic , or have a tight chest for any reason ... go for Breathe Easy .
4 #### It helps , when you have allergies and are just trying to be less stuffed up .
5 #### My acupuncturist said Bi Yan Pian is good for allergies and sinus problems . I suffer from extreme allergies and am going through acupuncture to get rid of my body 's reaction to these allergies . In the meantime going off antihistamines this tea really works wonders . The Bi Yan Pian disolves mucus from allergy reactions thereby letting your body get rid of the toxins . Antihistamines dry you making the toxins stay in your body and oh yeah it lowers your immunity so you get sick . Good reason to go off anithistamines . This tea tastes very good with the combination ; I use honey with ginger and that is amazing . I will continue using this tea as needed because it works so well if I drink too much I 'm actually too dry ... but then the acupuncture is part of that too . Hope this helps you decide .
5 #### I have had some breathing problems for a few year and medication only helped so much . I do n't especially care for the flavor warm . I found that brewing the tea letting it coll adding a bit of honey pouring over ice make it quite enjoyable .
5 #### I breathe so much easier with this tea ! It helps me cut my medications in half !
5 #### Very good product . I like the aroma and taste and how relaxing it is .
5 #### My favorite tea for the morning . Mildly sweet with hints of licorice . Wakes a person up gently !
5 #### This tea works absolutely the best for me when I have upper respiratory congestion related to seasonal pollen .
5 #### I noticed a significant improvement in my breathing after having this tea . I purchased it initially at a natural co - op grocery . I had been having some lung irritation after being exposed to perfumes as well as automobile exhaust . After that , I decided to buy more of it here at Amazon .
5 #### This stuff works . Not sure why , but it does .
5 #### I drink one of these breathe easy teas each morning , helps with congestion .
5 #### I drink this every day to support my lung health .
5 #### This product is does what its says I find having this every morning gives me a boost with breathing .
5 #### By far , the tea that helps with my chronic allergies the best . It 's nice to have a cup of tea rather than taking an over the counter allergy medicine .
3 #### I bought this tea for my mom who suffers from pretty bad asthma and thought it might help her a bit . She has told me that its just ok . She has not really noticed an improvement but likes the taste .
5 #### Better than any allopathic products for colds and allergies .
5 #### Breathe easy actually works to cut down on my nasal congestions when my alleges act up . The flavor is mostly licorice .
5 #### Have been drinking this tea for years . I used to get Bronchitis all the time and this was what helped me most with the coughing and congestion . Even now , when I eat something that gives me mucus , this clears it up right away and I am able to sleep .
5 #### If my wife drinks a cup of this tea when she feels an attack coming on it often helps her avoid the attack at all . If we are out and she has an attack drinking this tea has lessened the effects and helped her recover more quickly . We have tried other tinctures and teas but his blend from TM has been wonderful ! It tastes great ( I enjoy it myself ) and it is an effective breathing aid . * * of course this is not medical advice , this N1 experience .
3 #### I bought this to compare it against Yogi Tea 's " Breathe Deep " tea because of the lower cost . It 's pleasant enough but I prefer the Yogi Tea better . This brand tastes good but seems to be less effective in clearing a cough or congestion than Yogi Tea .
3 #### The taste of the breathe easy was ok , a little on the earthy side . I did find it cleared my lungs . However , I am prone to migraines and this set off a big one . I had to toss the 6 boxes I bought , ugh .
5 #### I do n't know about the medicinal aspects of this tea , but the flavor is downright scrumptious . I love licorice root but have high blood pressure , so I 'm not guzzling down box after box each week . A few cups a week does n't touch my BP , so I keep it to that . The directions say to steep it for 10 - 15 minutes , but I 'm far too impatient for that . 4 - 6 minutes is all I can wait after smelling that lovely aroma . Traditional Medicinals puts out some really good teas . I just wish they were n't so proud of 'em . ChaChing ! Thanks , TM . Now try to work on that pricing for us , will ya ? Danke .
5 #### I love this tea , and it 's my immediate go - to for congestion . Works better ( for me ) than DayQuil . I buy it by the case to keep from running out .
5 #### It is the best natural way to relieve congestion of the sinuses . It has a mild sweet flavor and taken warm / hot sets great in the body . I have been using this for 2 years and now even my family use it , all very satisfied .
5 #### I have this every night . The bags hold strong . The flavor is consistent box to box time to time . They stay fresh in the packaging . I 'm going to make some right now .
5 #### I use a lot of this tea when having breathing troubles . It 's not as effective as some prescription meds but does feel good and seems to help and also tastes good .
5 #### I had TB when I lived in Mexico in l970/71/72 . I used eucalyptus / licorice tea and actually cured myself . Since that time , I have used this tea every day as I love the taste of it . I recommend it to anyone who wants to strengthen their lungs .
5 #### For those of us with pulmonary conditions [ e.g. , asthma ] this tea is great ! And , as a tea lover , I have used it successfully and enjoyed so doing .
5 #### My husband has asthma . He uses peventative inhalers along with inhalers when an attack occurs . When the attack is severe he will go into the bathroom and turn the shower on hot , to inhale the steam . Even doing all of this , the attack will continue until I prepare him the Breathe Easy Herbal Tea . Within minutes after drinking the tea the asthma settles down . I ALWAYS carry a tea bag with me . I never leave the house to go anywhere without the tea . IT IS A LIFE SAVER ! ! ! ! ! Even if you do not have asthma the tea will also help you breathe better with respiratory infections . Just recently I had the flu for several weeks with much coughing the tea was AWESOME . A MUST HAVE FOR ANY BREATHING AILMENT .............
5 #### As soon as I take a sip or two I can feel a sort of wash and openness in my lungs . Definitely causes one to " breathe easy . " Have a hot tea or add a tea bag or two to your iced tea bags . Very healthy stuff in there .
5 #### Awesome candy , but it 's nearly impossible for me to stop with one bag , LOL ! I 'll be buying these again , no doubt much sooner than I should need to .
5 #### Whoppers Malted Milk Balls is one of my favorite candies . I like the 1.75 oz packages because it is the perfect size snack . Huuge Saving sent it fast and an excellent job .
5 #### My whole family adores Whoppers and have for as long as I can remember . They 're the perfect mix of malt and chocolate all in one little ball . What 's not to like ? ? The price here on Amazon saved me a small fortune on this batch , wish they have them on Subscribe and Save for this steal of a price ... but I am happy to have gotten this deal even if not ! Thanks , Amazon !
5 #### What can you say about Whoppers Malt Balls except that they are whopping good . I received my shipment on time and in perfect condition to give out on Halloween .
5 #### Either you love them or you do n't . I guess there 's nothing in between . I love them . I love the malty taste in combination with the milk chocolate . One package is considered to be one serving size and just enough to be a perfect treat at no more than 220 calories per package .
3 #### Not as good as I remember . The chocolate is rather underwhelming .
5 #### Their a bit smaller in diameter than I remember , but so are candy bars ... the taste is satisfying and only one carton remains in the pantry .
1 #### I love malted milk , whether it 's in malted milk balls or on milk shakes . And of all the malted milk balls I 've ever tried , WHOPPERS Malted Milk Balls are easily the worst quality , junk candies . For years they 've had unacceptable numbers of duds ; they 've also been made of inferior ingredients , including hydrogenated oils and fats , which are horrible because trans - fats ca n't be properly digested by the human body . I 'd love to see a candy company put out a decent brand of malted milk balls . Sadly , WHOPPERS are , in my view , not fit for human consumption . If you do n't believe me , check out hydrogenated oils for yourself . But good malted milk balls will cost more , but hopefully you 'll get what you pay for .
5 #### Very fresh ( BB date 09/2017 ) . A treat memory from childhood .. what fun ! Good thing there are 6 containers because I think the first one may be gone in a couple of days . Will need to put the rest out of sight ( and hopefully out of mind ! ) .
2 #### These candies did not taste fresh and the surface was not shiny as I have seen it when buying this product in the supermarket . They looked like they had been hanging around for quite a while even though the expiration date had not been reached . Because of the odd taste of the product , I threw them away . Wo n't buy them again on line .
5 #### Big Whopper house here . Love these things . Fantastic value .
5 #### My favorite and addictive , I have never gotten in a stale box here they have always come fresh . I eat them faster than I can buy them
4 #### Delicious , and a good value ... What more is to be said ?
5 #### After we ordered these we got some really hot days .. I was expecting a melted clump .. we were delighted to receive them packed securely cold and well insulated ! ... the whoppers are a link to childhood for us .. totally awesome . Thanks
5 #### Whenever I ordered chocolate in the past on some summer day it arrived a melted mess , Packaging HAS IMPROVED and this is my second order from amazon this summer for something chocolate which arrived in pristine condition . One of them came on the hottest day this year temperature approaching the hundreds , it was packed from every angle with cold packs and a huge pillowy cushion . The malted milk balls ca n't be beat they taste like I remember good ice cream from when I was a kid . Very fresh tasting all around delicious - there are a few recipes on the box but I like it as is .
5 #### Ordered six ( 6 ) boxes as a gift . Five for a dear friend , one for me ! Though the malted balls were smaller than I rememer they are the same melt in your mouth candy you had as a child . Received my order within a few days and the packing far exceeded my expectations . Would recommend . FYI : You can freeze Whoppers . Take them out of their container and put in a freezer bag . I put my freezer bag back into the waxed Whopper container for easier storage and to protect the candy from freezer burn . The candy did not clump into a solid mass . Will be ordering again .
5 #### Been eating malted milk balls since my parents dropped off the kids at the movie theater on Saturday morning and tickets cosr $ 0.35 .
5 #### Arrived in good condition and so far all are fresh .
5 #### They 're frickin Whoppers ! My teeth ache sometimes , but I got ta have one more !
5 #### My order was the freshest that I have ever had for Whoppers . They are a fun product from my childhood memories . They are very sweet , however . I had been eating higher quality malt balls ( from expensive chocolate stores ) as an adult and the sweetness on these is a little overwhelming for me . But , they were still fun and great to take to the movies . If you like Whoppers , this was a great package at a great price .
5 #### These are some of my favorites . We like to munch of these while we watch movies on television . I bought some recently to use in a cookie recipe that sounded delicious but I waited too long to start baking . Somebody had eaten all of my malted milk balls and left the carton on the counter . I was mad but as usual I got over it . I will try that recipe some other time . Whoppers are just too good to be left alone for any length of time at my house . They do n't hang around very long at all .
5 #### These are delicious , absolutely impossible to resist . They never made it to the party they were intended for . I had to buy more . Good Price for an excellent treat .
5 #### My family loves malted milk balls and gave everyone a carton for xmas
5 #### how can you not love whopper ? yum yum yum
5 #### How do you not like whoopers . This was a great gag gift for a friend at Christmas that loves them .
5 #### I was happy to find for a reasonable price and quantity ,
4 #### Been at least 10 years since I had these . Same great chocolate coating . They have removed some of the malt flavoring from the crunchy center . Good thing about that is , I wo n't be getting a sore tongue now if I happen to binge on these . Arrived in great shape . Best Used By date is 9/2015 .
5 #### good buy on subscribe and save , always arrives as expected
5 #### used for gift bags for my Sunday school kids at Easter . Well received , of course . Will buy again for sure .
5 #### Love these whoppers originals , and it 's so convenient to just go get another carton , when I empty one ! This is a favorite for the grandkids too .
4 #### Arrived in very good condition , though freshness could be a little better . I like to mix these with cashews and almonds for a snack .
5 #### These balls are great tasting candy . The aftertaste is great as well . These chocolate balls are tasting . Fully recommended . Five stars .
3 #### I bought the Whoppers hoping to have them packaged in a container like the one pictured ( like a milk carton ) , They arrived in about a gazillion individually packed tiny bags . ( A pain in the A * * to open . ) The whoppers themselves , however , where just like the ones I had as a kid . Pretty dang good .
5 #### Both the 100 % Arabica and the Espressione Espresso are excellent for espresso drinks . Traditionally espresso , unlike good drip coffee , is made with a mix of Arabica and Robusta coffees . The taste differences are noticeable , but I do n't have a strong favorite . I use the pods for convenience , although I also roast my own green beans for espresso as well . If you look at the negative reviews , they 're mostly on the " best before " dates being passed . While I would also be upset to spend money and get " expired " pods , I should point out that the pods are good for quite some time after their nominal expiration dates . I just found a handful of these Espressione Classic pods with 2002 ( this is late 2009 now ) dates and they made acceptable , though not spectacular espresso . Basically they 're vacuum packed and not much is happening inside the wrapper .
1 #### STAY AWAY FROM ORDERING FROM THIS COMPANY . I RECEIVED MY ORDER ON TIME BUT TO MY AMAZMENT ALL OF THE COFFEE PODS WERE STAMPED WITH A DATE THAT WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS PAST DUE .
5 #### We use these pods for a youth group fundraiser at our church . We consistently get comments on how great the coffee tastes . I like how easy they are to use . No mess , no tamping . I am able to make drink after drink quickly and easily .
5 #### Using the Briel Chamonix machine I purchased from Amazon , I have produced delicious lattes using these pods . The smell of the Espressione pods ( regular and decaf ) when opened is incredible - dark , rich roasts . FYI - the pods are produced in Italy , which is a good sign . Also , each pod has a handy paper " tab " so that you can remove it from your machine without burning your fingers . I compared these pods to Starbucks espresso pods ( regular and decaf ) , and the Espressione are my favorite . Only one warning : 150 pods ( individually wrapped ) take up a lot of space , so be sure you know where you 're going to store them . More good news : each box of 150 is stamped with a " best if used by " date , which in my case was 16 months after the date of purchase .
1 #### This is the dirtiest rock salt I 've ever seen . Remember years ago when you opened up the rock salt , and it was white , and you could actually grab a piece and suck on it .. this is n't it ! This bag of salt looked like they 'd swept it up off the busy New York streets after a long storm and then dried and bagged it . Like a friend said , " Buy Morton , it 's clean salt . " Think I 'll do that next time .
4 #### What can one say about a bag of rock salt except to ask , ( where is the home made ice cream ? ) Bought this salt along with an ice cream freezer and it worked just as expected . No problems .
1 #### This is the first time that I 've ever found real rocks in my rock salt . I take my ice cream ball to a friend 's house so that our kids can play , and then we can have ice cream . All goes well until I dump the salty water into her beautiful sink , and then I spend the next ten minutes apologizing and scraping little rocks and what looks suspiciously like bits of glass out of her garbage disposal . The salt part all dissolved right on cue , but that stuff was certainly not all salt . I could n't believe that I was right , but when I got home I checked and double checked the bag -- yep , little rocks . Maybe I got a bad bag ? Maybe it 's supposed to be rocks and salt instead of rock salt ? All I know is I 'll be picking a different brand next time I make ice cream .
4 #### I really enjoyed this bar . It was a sweet and fruity treat that I enjoyed . The texture was a little gritty but not bad at all . Infact , I barely noticed it . The bar itself was soft which is nice when you are tired after a workout . I could see that this bar would harden if I kept it in the cooler . The only downside was that I did not feel any extra amount of energy . I basically felt as replenished as I do with any bar I eat . I was satisfied with this and a bottle of water . This was definitely a flavorful treat that I would reccomend to anyone .
4 #### If you are looking for a flavorful treat to provide energy for a hectic lifestyle , the Berry Blast PowerBar Fruit Smoothie fits the bill . I was hesitant initially to give this one a try , having tasted a variety of other energy bars over the past few years , some good , some dreadful . I liked the sounds of this one and the fact it 's made from real fruit with no additional sweeteners or artificial colors and flavors . So I decided to try it . I am glad I did . While I do n't see this becoming a regular staple in my daily diet , it is great for the occasional pick - me - up when I am lagging on energy . It has a strong berry flavor which pleasantly surprised me . The texture takes some getting used to however . I was n't quite sure what to expect so the taffy - like consistency was a surprise . Actually , that made it even better for me . I felt like I was indulging in a rare treat but without the guilt . I could see myself trying out the other flavors of fruit smoothie bars and see if they taste as good as this one did . Kelley A. Hartsell , July 2008 . All rights reserved .
5 #### I have always been a PowerBar fan . This the best I have ever had ! ! It has a very fruity flavor and was chewy , in a pleasing sort of way . It worked quite well as appetite suppressant . School is still out on it 's " energizing " powers . The taste was great .
5 #### This is a great quality product and Amazon often saves me on the price .
5 #### The original PowerBar in Chocolate has been a staple snack in my cupboards for over 20 years . I 'm not an athlete , but enjoy a whole bar as an occasional meal replacement , or half a bar to push through the afternoon work day . With a large glass of water , they fill me up for hours and boost my energy level . The taste and consistentsy remind me of the Astronaut Sticks from the late 60s I enjoyed as a kid . ( I admit , it 's a weird ' comfort ' food . ) For newbies : the original PowerBar in Chocolate is chewy like a fresh tootsie roll , but not sweet , and definitely more filling . For those who love chocolate , but want to cut back on cane sugar , this is a great alternative . This was part of a Pantry order , and the package arrived intact and fresh .
5 #### Son who is a collegiate runner loves them and with Prime I am able to ship direct to his dorm .
5 #### Delicious and effective ! Use these as a snack every time I 'm on the trail !
2 #### Banana is terrible . You can taste the crushed up vitamins and minerals more than the banana flavor . Wild Berry is delicious , the 2 stars are only for the banana .
5 #### These are the original style of the powerbars . For some reason not many retailers stock this brand . Tasty , filling and affordable . Great for a lunch or snack on the run or when traveling . When you buy them in bulk they are much less than in the store , when , as I said above , you can find them .
2 #### everything else aside - these are difficult to eat . really not tasty and need something to wash it down . do fill me up when i do n't have a chance to eat properly though . probably skip these in the future
3 #### Really has a high level of sugar content -- actually causes a sugar high , then a downer .
5 #### I use these for the movies . I ca n't find them in the stores any more . Great tasting like candy but much better for you .
3 #### I 'm not crazy about this chocolate flavor , but I highly recommend the peanut butter .
5 #### These are delicious and definitely one of the better all - around tasting protein bars I ve had in a long time . Will be getting more soon .
5 #### I keep power bars around for when I need a quick meal . I know some people do n't like this taste , but I do . I have it on auto order and always keep a box in the house .

Great product and love this flavor ! I highly recommend !
5 #### My favorite flavor for a meal on the go . I use these for a boost between meals and the vitamins in them are great .
5 #### These power bars in that mixed berry blast flavor are tasty and delicious ! True , I have to take a few minutes to chew them -- they're not something I can eat very quickly , they 're too chewy for that . Most importantly , but they are very helpful to me when I exercise . For example , they are excellent for a power boost shortly before I exercise ; and they help me replenish the salt I lose when I perspire both during and shortly after exercising . Some will say that these bars really give you protein while others maintain that these bars do n't have enough protein . They do have 6 grams of protein per bar so I guess it becomes an individual decision when it comes to just how much protein you want ; you could have two bars before a workout or running if extra protein is what you want . Overall , these bars are great . I love them ! They are excellent for athletes and anyone serious about working out , but of course they can be enjoyed as a snack if you wish .
2 #### Good try , but these taste too much like over - sweet chemical mush bars that leave an semi - acrid aftertaste . The Chocolates are the best , hands down . This one tastes like sweetener that resembles oatmeal was added . Very fake . They are edible , but they are overpoweringly chemical .
5 #### The only thing that taste better than the wild berry energy bars are the tropical tangy bars . This is a great PowerBar series .
2 #### It 's a shame that all the nutritional benefits of this bar went to waste on me because I could n't even stomach the darn thing . It 's literally just a block of chewy mush with the sharpness of dark chocolate . There were even some random chunks of who knows what stuck in there . I 've tried the creamy citrus flavor as well , and that I could at least get down .
3 #### This is n't really a PowerBar in the typical sense . It 's more of a thick smoothie - like fruit leather , if you can picture it . It 's all one consistency , meaning there 's no coating , no filling . Tastes like a smoothie but with a rubbery texture , so not that great , especially for an energy bar . Does n't seem filling enough to be 230 calories .
5 #### These particular power bars are very hard to find in my area of the country . I like the flavor of these power bars over the many kinds of power bars that contain mainly chocolate .
4 #### You need a magic tonic to help you recover following a new personal best ? Good luck funding one . You want a candy bar ? Keep looking . However , if you want a well - packaged , carb - rich bar that wo n't melt in your hands , that will give you a sugar replacement that 15 minutes following your intense activity lasting 45 - 60 minutes , then this PowerBar Performance Energy Bar might work for you . Nonfat chocolate milk might work just as well , but it certainly wo n't last 12 months in that pack under your bike seat or in your backpack 's side pocket . Know what you are getting , and use it appropriately . Then you wo n't be disappointed !
5 #### I 've always liked power bars even when they did NOT taste so good . I 'd take them on the trail with me while hiking or when riding my bike . They are compact and packed full of energy . The good news is that Power Bar has gotten better and better at improving the flavor and texture of their bars ! Try this one . You wo n't be disappointed .
2 #### I received a free sample power bar through the Vine Program and looked forward to trying it ; when it arrived I was babysitting two preteens , so we each had a portion and all of us agreed -- yuk ! I 'm giving this item 2 stars because the flavor was fine ; though one child said it tasted " like vitamins " , I think he meant the good fruit - tasting vitamins . The problem with this bar is the texture -- it is VERY gummy , and even stretched a bit when we cut it into portions . As one chews , it becomes rubbery ; in the interest of this review I had to force myself to finish my one - third portion because it was so unpleasant . If you 're prepared for the texture you may enjoy the fine flavor , but otherwise I 'd suggest you steer clear of this energy bar .
3 #### I expected this to have a sweet , smooth taste , like the fruit blend drink . Instead I found a sharp , not quite unpleasant aftertaste as the dominating flavor . This was not something I would choose . The flavor was n't very good , the texture was a little too grainy , and the aftertaste just bordering on bad . For people who crave smoothies , this is no substitute .
3 #### This is basically a hunk of quick carbs with some electrolytes and other additives . It WAS tasty , but does it really do anyting more for you than an ordinary candy - bar ? I 'm not convinced on that one .
3 #### This bar may well provide a bit of quick energy , but I found the taste achingly sweet . Too bad , because if it were a bit more tart and a lot less sweet , it might be quite pleasant .
4 #### This bar was a pleasant surprise . The flavor was subtle and the taffy consistancy was a surprise but overall tasty !
2 #### First off this bar is much moister than PowerBar 's that I have tried in the past ; so much so , that when I held vertical , it would bend one way or the other until the top when past horizontal . But moisture alone does not make a good energy bar . The Fruit Smoothie PowerBar is n't bad per se , but it is not very good . It is sweet , but it does n't really taste much like a fruit smoothie , especially not a smoothie from the likes of Jamba Juice . It is just kinda of sweet and pliable . I would recommend one try the Odwalla bars instead , they are much better tasting and they are like eating food , not something out of Soylent Green .
3 #### I did n't get up and sprint around the blocl after I ate this bar so I 'm not sure as to how much energy it actually provided but it hate a good fruity taste and was about the right size for a quick snack . The bar was quite chewy but that did not distract from it 's enjoyment . Would certainly try this product again .
2 #### Power Bar Fruit Smoothie , Berry Blast I like the flavor of this bar , but , the ingredients show too much sugar for me and not enough protein . If it had less sugar and more protein , I 'd recommend it . Gunner June , 2008
3 #### Power bars in general are very soft and chewy . They 're not my favorite , but they are not bad . This one has a strong fruity flavor , similiar to taffy . The " vitamin flavor " is noticeable , but not horrendously strong . This is a good choice for an occasional snack on the go . Power bars keep well in the car and if they get too mushy due to heat , they recover well when cool again .
4 #### It 's surprisingly very tasty , but I recommend eating only half at a time . It 's pretty good out of the fridge and once it has thawed just a little . If you eat the whole bar in one setting , it 's a bit much with the fruity flavor . But half of it ? Excellent !
2 #### First immediate impression : really sweet and artificial tasting . Though it kind of tastes like fruit punch in my opinion , it 's kind of a shocking type of taste for a product like this . Definitely a bit like candy as reviewers have mentioned . Apart for the energy , it did keep me going for a game of basketball I had about an hour after eating the bar . Nutrition facts are n't that great compared to completing products , however . And like other products from this manufacturer , they 're still quite expensive per single bar .
4 #### As an athlete , I have used Power Bar products for years . I have to say this is one of the better tasting Bars . Has a definite strawberry flavor , without being too sweet . If you have n't ever had a Power Bar , then you may be surprised at the texture . These are not candy bars ! They provide a great energy boost when you do n't have time for a full meal . Excellent for slipping in your bike jersey pocket for eating on the road . Highly recommended .
1 #### I found this bar to be labeled wrong . It should of been SuperSweet Fruit Smoothy . 24 g sugar , 42 g carb and only 6 g protein . The smoothy I make in my blender is quick and healthy using a protein mix with fresh or frozen fruit . Can not see myself ever purchasing this . Did not like the candy taste and with such little protein , is not a healthy on the go bar . There are many healthier bar choices for a quick energizing snack . Thumbs down .
4 #### This was a pretty good energy bar . The taste was good . I did notice a energy boost and it was not too high in sugars etc . Overall , a pretty good product .
2 #### I tried this Powerbar with another person . We both were not pleased with the taste . We felt it was oddly grainy in texture and while we could tolerate the berry taste , we did n't think we 'd ever want another One ! I do n't think we are going to finish this bar . Not the best I 've ever tasted and I would never buy this again !
5 #### A very tasty practical treat you can grab on the go ...... who always has time for a sit down breakfast ? ... Well grab this instead .. get some good nutrition and a smile while your at it because it actually tastes GOOD !
3 #### It was n't too bad , but was just too sweet for my wife 's taste ( I ended up not being able to try it , because it turned out to not be gluten free - which I need ) .
5 #### Work great for bath bombs . Shiploed fast . Great quality .
3 #### Price WAY too high for what you get , and due to static cling , ca n't even get them all out , over half stick to the inside of the already ridiculously TINY little compartment !
5 #### Great assortment and very fun for kids to use when decorating cookies or cupcakes .
5 #### my daughter loves candy she would go crazy eating every candy and flavors she see it
3 #### Bright and colorful . Hard to get out of container . The non - pareils were static clinging to the inside walls of the container .
1 #### Do n't get excited by these ! The section of the container that holds the sprinkles is only about one inch high ! You wo n't get many uses out of this if you are preparing a lot of cupcakes !
5 #### These are really cute sprinkles . Will be cute on whatever you put them on .
1 #### Expire ? Mine 's even better : no expiration or manufactured date ! And the taste is horrible , almost starchy . They 're cute alright but I will be returning them .
3 #### Lots of average okay colors mixed in okay shapes that were okay to use for what they were intended .
5 #### Nice , handy and very colorful . We sprinkle just a few on our cupcakes . Always adds that special touch . Will keep on hand . Nice not to have to fool with six different containers . Little lids open easily and close securely . Good product . Maybe just a tad bit overpriced .
5 #### I had to buy another of these . I let my grand kids use them for their mud pies . Perfect for kids to decorate cupcakes etc .
5 #### I bought these for my granddaughter who loves to bake . She was very pleased .
4 #### I ordered this product and came to me like the picture and details said about this product . It has 6 different variety of sprinkles . The price was fair for this and mine was n't expired like the other said . I feel bad for them because that was unfair for them . I hope your order comes out good when you order this but if you are precautious person then do n't buy it . Go to the store and buy it for yourself . It is your choice . The taste was okay to be honest . Most all Wilton sprinkles are okay ; they are n't the best taste .
4 #### How can anyone complain about sprinkles ? This variety pack was a little on the small side , but came with a lot of cute colors and shapes .
5 #### These just make frosted cupcakes look so darn yummy ! Ca n't wait to mix up a batch and add the sprinkles .
3 #### I liked the shapes that are included , so was as expected . It was a bit smaller than the other 6 sprinkle mixes that I have purchased locally .
5 #### I have n't had a chance to use these yet but I love the bold bright colors . Container was larger than I expected .
5 #### Sprinkles for all occasions . Granddaughters enjoy using these on their cake pops . Nice assortment of sprinkles for various baking needs .
5 #### Got these for my first try at Momofuku 's birthday cake - Success ! I was really pleased at how colorful they were and how well they were incorporated into the final baked cake . Will buy again !
5 #### The packaging was good and arrival time was earlier than expected . The colors are bright and fun and the sprinkles were fresh and not stale like some can be . They made my Christmas cookies extra special .
5 #### I bought these for making pop cakes , but the product is so versatile for color themes and various holidays to decorate cake batters , cookies and dough or if you are really messy , for making pictures on a slice of toast . LOL .
2 #### Such a minute amount -- not worth the money . And , the opening is a nuisance -- needs an option to pour , too . Horrible for cake pops ! Icing is dry before you can shake them on pop .
5 #### Perfect Sprinkle Assortment for the price & it comes in a nice little shaker . I 'm pleased with this product & will order this exact assortment or a similar item again .
1 #### I ordered these a while back to make cookies for my granddaughter . What I got was a GARISH collection of these that were FAR TOO UGLY to use on anything . I do not recommend these to anyone . They do not match up to the picture shown . Shame on Wilton for even making what they sent me .
4 #### I bought these sprinkles for my wife as a stocking stuffer gift ! Great idea by the way , fit wonderfully in her stocking . She tends to be a sprinkle nut and really enjoys sprinkles on cakes and cookies , and ca n't get enough ! Anyway this set is great , and comes in a soup can sized container with all 6 types . The reason for 4 stars , is because this is a great product , but in the shipping process some of the sprinkles were broken . If you are ok with losing a few in the shipping process , it 's definitely something to consider . I would recommend this for a kids party or a sprinkles nut like my wife !
5 #### very convenient and practical to have all those sprinkle in one place , it when on easy and that we like when you are cooking with kids
5 #### Not too much you can say about this . A fun pack of sprinkles for the children to make their cupcakes and muffins .
2 #### Color is very weak . Does n't really help Wilton Candy melts color which are already dim . Wo n't buy again .
2 #### Stains your skin really bad ! The colors are not accurate . I did n't get patriotic red and blue , I got a funny shade of pink and teal blue . It also is just a jar and not a dropper so it 's extremely messy . The jars are pretty little . Not a fan of these at all !
5 #### I needed something that would allow me to dye mineral oil without having the color separate out , and this works very well . Do n't make the mistake I made the first time - I used too much , and that results in a cloudy color . Just start with a drop , and take it from there . With the primary colors , you can make almost any other color you need . It comes with Blue , Red , Orange & Yellow - but you can make Green and Purple as well by mixing .
3 #### Red did not mix well to make hard candies , disappointed
5 #### Works really well with chocolate , hoping they can come out with more colors .
5 #### Very nice , used these in conditioner to make a natural toner . Worked perfectly
4 #### As expected . I used this to color mineral oil for sensory bottles . Worked great !
5 #### This project is PERFECT for coloring melted chocolate because it is NOT water based . I want more colors ! Great product !
5 #### These are much better than the colors they sell in the grocery store . More vivd
3 #### I 'm 100 % against serving anything with candy melts between the flavor ( ick ! ) and the palm kernel oil so I bought this hoping to color white chocolate for a project . It works , sort of , but it took so much of the product to get a decent color that my chocolate was too soft to set in the molds . I made three separate attempts just to make sure I had n't overheated my chocolate or something . Perhaps this product is better suited for candy melts and at that point , you might as well buy the pre - colored variety rather than having to dye them yourself . I did end up using some of this in a buttercream frosting when I ran out of my normal gel color and it seemed ok for that too .
5 #### Colored my white chocolate perfectly . I used it to make cake pops
4 #### These work for coloring white chocolate but you need a lot of it to color things vibrantly .
4 #### I love using these colors to dye my white candy melts ! It works really well with the merckens brand that I use to make my cakepops . My only issue with it is that it does not have a drip top . I poked two little holes in the foil , one for the dye to drop out of and one for air to come in for air flow . That way , I do n't have to take the foil off completely , which cause a mess .
4 #### We used this to dye oils for a science and toddler projects . So far we have only used it with baby oil , mineral oil , etc . But we intend to dye other oil - based substances to make a rainbow in a bottle real soon = ) My only complaint is that where the water - based and oil - based substances meet - there is a yellow line forming against the plastic bottles .... in other words , the dye appears to be staining the bottle itself or precipitating out of solution ?
5 #### I tried to use these to change the color of white chocolate . I did n't think about mixing the black with the white chocolate . I wanted black chocolate since I could n't find any color melts but obviously white & black mixed makes grey . There was no amount I could add that would create black which was disappointing but understandable . Just wanted to put that out there for anyone else who was n't thinking about that like I was . The other colors paired beautifully & the chocolate still tasted the same to me .
5 #### 1 . The caps are not very secure and I 've had a mess in my dye box a couple times due to not screwing them on as tightly as possible . Learn from my mistake , otherwise you 'll have a HUGE mess . 2 . Give me more dye ! ! Why do these little containers have to be so stinkin ' small ? I can use almost an entire color for one single order . 3 . Make this into a squeeze bottle or some kind of dropper ! It would be 10x more convenient .
5 #### Used these as oil dye for oil lamps . Pretty colors . Does n't take too much dye to color a candle .
4 #### The amount you get is very small . Works OK .
5 #### Waiting for a long time , but the goods is very satisfied . I think I will buy again .
2 #### I have used this twice for my hard tack candy and it does not " dispurse " . It does NOT blend at all in the boiling state . Hopefully will work when melting chocolate .
3 #### Product seemed like it was maybe old , been sitting on a shelf too long ...
5 #### the 1st box I was sent was partially open and leaked all over . It appeared that the foam seals were opened and the lids were not on tight- what a mess . But Amazon sent me a new box and they are perfect ! they color my white chocolate without making it seize . the colors are lighted then you might want- the red is hot pink . But I was coloring white chocolate so it makes sense . I have never gotten true colors from dye , if I need red , black or brown I just buy candy melts . They mixed ok . I was trying to get purple and it turned out a little gray , and green was dull . So I guess I better buy those color dyes and not try to mix . .
5 #### I HATE the Wilton colored chocolate ( sorry Wilton ) . I use these colors in Merckens and the colors come out vibrant , and with the high quality of the Merckens wafers , the colors are evenly mixed in the chocolate .
4 #### This is exactly what you can purchase in a store . It cost a little more but being that the store I would purchase this from { crafts 2000 } was always out I had no choice but purchase here . This is good option for people needing to use a lot of color .
2 #### Did n't blend into the hard candy mix as it should have . I 'm new to making candy , so it might have been my fault . But I made 4 or 5 batches and had same problem . I switched to Ateco and I am happier .
5 #### These colors are bold and bright ! They are very high quality and work very well when making hard candy ! I would recommend these .
5 #### Love this product I was having so much trouble with my chocolate freezing up when I would try to color it for decoration . This product works great the colors are really clear and not muddled .
5 #### I use these with my melting chocolate and they work great ! ! All 4 colors were as described . I did n't have problems with colors spilling like another reviewer did .
4 #### This is a pretty good product i got them about a week ago and already i have to order more . My only problem with this product is it 's size . I wish they made them bigger . It actually saves me from having to buy chocolate melts in every color i can just buy white and use the candy color .
5 #### My mom used this frosting on my sisters wedding cake and I thought it was amazing ... even better than the icing on my pastry chef made wedding cake ! I was surprised to see bad reviews for this frosting because I love it so much that I changed my own frosting recipe to mimic it . It 's a heavier frosting , but lighter ( weight / sweetness - wise , I have no idea if it has less or more calories ) than pure buttercream frosting feels . I noticed the bad reviews and had to redeem this frosting . I really liked this frosting and quite a few people at my sisters wedding did as well .
4 #### This is not like regular canned icing . It is made for decorating with a bag and tips . It is a lot stiffer and hard to apply if you are planning on using it as a spread icing . Tasted good but tore up the cake a little .
3 #### There are better tasting products on the market but this white icing is okay . Tastes better on something than straight out of the can . It 's stiff so it 's good for making flowers etc . but can easily be made more spreadable by just stirring in a little water .
2 #### Way overpriced on Amazon ! I bought the same container at Walmart for $ 2.74 ! Anyway , I bought this for a " mommy and me " cupcake decorating class . I do n't know why anyone would recommend this icing except for last minute ease of use if you did not have time make your own . It is super sweet and ridiculously stiff , which serves its purpose if that s what your looking for . However , many of the Wilson tips ( a large range of sizes ) that we used in class were too small to properly push the icing out without tremendous force . I had difficulty . It was impossible for my eight year old . The icing seemed suited only for the 2 largest tips . My classmates were inquiring about a more " workable " icing than this . We were told to Youtube it since better icing exists . I guess for something quick and cheap ( if purchased elsewhere ) , it was ok . For 10 bucks , no way ! !
5 #### i 'm amazed how great this tastes . we bought it to go with the wilton colors
5 #### I love this product . It 's always consistently good and so convenient . Stir it up before you use it . It 's easy to use !
1 #### This came in a plastic tube and made me sick to my stomach . It tastes so bad i threw it out immediately , and then threw up . Amazon sucks for selling this crap .
5 #### This icing is not meant for spreading over a whole cake . It 's very stiff icing for making flowers and other decorations . The icing that comes in the 4.5 lb tub is for covering the cake . I recommend not buying from Amazon though . The same product is half that price at WalMart . They put it back with the wedding stuff and crafts . You can also get it cheaper at Hobby Lobby , Michael 's , etc .
5 #### The dark chocolate ones surpass all other flavors we 've tried . They 're decadently delicious . You may want to keep some tins on hand for unexpected guests -- these elegant cookies look wonderful on a tea tray and make an excellent presentation with coffee or ice cream . Amazon offers them at a very reasonable price , given that shipping is free with Prime membership . What a great deal !
5 #### These are NOT sweet at all , which I like .
5 #### These are a great way to eat Dr. recommended dark chocolate . The wafer is light , crisp and lets the chocolate flavor shine . And they stay fresh and whole in the tins .
5 #### Piroulines arrived when promised and , as yet , I have n't encountered any broken ones . Each rolled wafer is a perfect combination of textures : you encounter a crisp but not crumbly sheath of dough filled with creamy hazelnut chocolate . Piroulines are a perfect go - with any after dinner service : sorbets , ice creams , berries , gelato .
5 #### Of all the flavors offered by Pirouline , this Dark Chocolate is my all - time favorite . Not too sweet , crispy exterior with a fudgy interior -- really nice ! Like others , my shipment of six 14 - oz canisters arrived with some breakage and crumbling . So far , I 've used 4 of the 6 cans , each containing 2 foil - wrapped sleeves ( so I 've opened 8 sleeves so far ) . I 've had 3 sleeves with NO breakage at all -- every one completely intact with just a tiny bit of crumbling on an end here and there . The other 5 sleeves contained some broken cookies -- ranging from 20 % to probably 60 % of the contents . Since I purchased these for my own use , this is n't a problem . The broken ones taste as good as the unbroken ones . :-) So far , I 've had no sleeves with total disintegration of the contents . But if you 're looking for perfect presentation , bear in mind that you 're probably going to have to deal with some breakage . That said , I 'll purchase these again . The price is comparable to my local supermarket , and having it delivered is a convenience I 'm willing to pay a bit extra for . The dark chocolate flavor is divine -- definitely 5 - star worthy in my book .
4 #### I love these things even though I 'm not really hooked on sweet stuff . I read some reviews on how a lot of the contents were broken up during shipment . Even though , in my case ... it was n't really a big deal , mine were the same as most .... about 40 % broken in each can I 've opened so - far . Just using these personally , not for show , so .... it 's really not an issue for me . Other than that , they are good for when you do get the yearning for something sweet .
5 #### These are AMAZING ! ! ! Rich dark chocolate , thin wafer crust . I just love them and so does the wife . Almost an addiction by now :) .
5 #### Note that most of the 1 and 2 star reviews are complaints about sellers and shippers . These delicious Belgian cookies are baked in Mississippi by DeBeukelaer , a company which traces its roots to 1860 . They are light , crisp , delicate and made with quality ingredients . The dark chocolate are my favorite and the one I recommend to chocoholics .
3 #### Delicious , however many were broken in transit so I did not give them as gifts . I will manage to eat them myself .
5 #### What 's not to love ? Dark chocolate + easy and fun to eat ! ( I sometimes pretend to hold them like cigars . )
5 #### These are available in sealed tins in different sizes . They are sometimes available in stores , but the Amazon price , per ounce , is somewhat lower than what I have found in stores . The ones I have purchased have internal foil wraps for added protection . They can be somewhat fragile if mishandled ( that may depend on your local shipper ) . They are suitable for serving with coffee or tea for various social events . The tines have a best buy date shown on the bottom of the tin .
5 #### My sister - in - law introduced me to these wafers and I was hooked immediately , enough that I continue to keep them on hand ( thanks to Amazon 's subscribe and save ) . A couple of these will satisfy your sweet tooth . The hard part is trying not to eat the whole can ! Love the texture and taste . Great product .
1 #### I ordered the case and when I opened the first can they were all broken up , I thought maybe it was just that can , but no they were all broken into small pieces , I mean every can into small pieces . I cancelled My subscription , I was so disappointed .
2 #### The entire batch of wafers were beat up , even the tins ! More crumbs and pieces than expected whole wafers . The shipping & packaging boxes themselves were in pristine condition . I 'm believing these were packed as seconds for sale at reduced prices . I like to reuse tins to store odds & ends and the lids were not fitting due to bashed tins & lids . Purchase locally and save yourself the disappointment !
1 #### I used to have these as a kid ... they do not taste the same at all . Quite terrible to be honest and now i m stuck with 6 ! ! ! Eww .
5 #### i love that they 're dark chocolate ! i found these once in a fresh market store but not since then . but i was gladdened to find them online . i have one with breakfast every day and oddly they seem to cut down on my overall craving for other chocolate . which is helpful . : >
5 #### The DeBeukelaer family has been making Belgium biscuits in The United States since 1860 . Pirouline is the only national brand of rolled wafers actually made in America . One bite and you 'll understand why these delicious and light snacks can be very addicting . The biscuit layer is light and flaky and the hazelnut chocolate inside makes for delicious snacking . They come in a tall , slender , 3.25 ounce tin and the tins are great for storing pasta or writing instruments afterwords . Highly recommended .
3 #### I was surprised when I opened the first box of these Piroulines . They were not that CRISP CRUNCHY cookie I had anticipated . They are all wrapped up very well and sealed shut but still act as though they are stale . Sorry . The ones I bought at the grocery store were PERFECT ! ! so , I do n't know what happened . I 'll try again when they have more .
4 #### Accurately described - good value - fast shipping - WEAK paper wall sugar canisters - canister not as durable as the OLD DIXIE sugar canisters - if you use lots of sugar , you will use up the sugar before the container falls apart .
2 #### One of the three cannisters came broken so all of the contents were rendered useless .
3 #### Good product , the sugar hardens quick one the package is opened .
5 #### It tastes great ! We had a problem with rough handling during shipping ( I guess ) and several broke . But it was quickly resolved by the supplier and I am happy . I also like the giant container which comes with a pump and can sit on the counter .
5 #### I eventually decided to purchase the nestle French vanilla twenty four single serving quantity pack ( 24 3/8 oz or 11 ml creamers totaling 9 ounces)after seeing it enough times at the cereal section of my job . The French vanilla creamers have a delectable taste and go perfectly with the swiss miss milk chocolate hot cocoa and the nestle rich milk chocolate cocoas .
5 #### Amazon , would you please change this stupid word count requirement to leave reviews ? IT 'S CREAMER ... it was good . I 'm a't come up with a paragraph about creamer ! I shop Amazon a LOT , but rarely leave a review , because of this requirement . Ok , nonsense now , so I will have enough words : Yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada
3 #### To me this is just a plain , old creamer . I 'd prefer something with a little spunk in it .
2 #### Guess I forgot about the ' non - dairy ' creamer definition . my mistake - I have to be careful in the future .
2 #### Not sweet enough . I have to use three ( 75 calories ) to get the sweetness I like in my coffee . I have opted for another sweeter brand so I can use fewer units to save on calories and plastic waste .
5 #### This was my second time ordering these . Definitely worth buying . Great taste and great price . This box had some spilled in it , but I was refunded and I plan to purchase again .
3 #### Little pricy since so small u nees 3 - 4 per cup , or at least i do
5 #### These creamers are ideal to have in an office for coffee first thing in the morning . The box is perforated and sturdy so it is easy to open and the creamers come out without a hassle . The plastic covers on the creamers pull off with little difficulty . I highly recommend these creamers for the office and those who like French Vanilla flavor and are lactose intolerant .
5 #### I love these creamers ! It is so convenient to keep these in the fridge ( not necessary but I do ) and just take out what you need . The price is the best here on Amazon , I first purchased these from another site and paid $ 2.00 more ! I 'll be back for more .
2 #### Ca n't make the coffee strong enough . I 'm sure it 's good if you like mellow coffee , but I 'm Cajun and grew up on very strong coffee . Will not buy this again .
4 #### I first had this coffee while visiting The Netherlands and was elated to find it here on Amazon ! This was a good coffee with pretty good natural sweetness and good body , you could barely taste the bit of the astringency ( like coffee here in the states seem to have ) . Tasty enough to drink black ( no sugar nor creamer needed ) . It also does n't have that " oily " residue that other coffee has . Nice overall flavor !
4 #### Very expensive for what you get ... but it was good .
2 #### Nothing to write home about . Expensive , and not as good as 8 O'clock Columbian that 's 1/4 the price . I would not buy this again , and sorry I bought it this time . Not a very good value . Now , I 'm waiting for my Cool Brew liquid coffee to arrive .
2 #### liked the first blend I bought better it was a medium roast .
5 #### This is some of the best coffee I 've ever had , and I 've had a lot of average , fancy and expensive kinds . I was in a restaurant and had this coffee , it was so good I asked the waitress if she could fine out what kind it was . She wrote it down for me and told me they get asked all the time . It 's so smooth and such a delightful flavor . I love it ! ! !
1 #### Nothing like the restaurant brew I was looking for .
4 #### Good , but a stronger blend would probably be better .
4 #### I got this for someone who had it at a restaurant and lived it . It 's very smooth ! I personally like flavored , organic coffee better .
3 #### A bit disappointing . Though is is good , it does n't taste like the coffee that the restaurant serve .
3 #### More of a hassle than K - cups , but the coffee is good . Wished they carried DE in K - cups .
1 #### The expiry date is Jan 15 , 2015 . I ordered this just a few weeks ago , so this is very out of date coffee they are supplying ! Will try coffee tomorrow and report further .
4 #### Very strong coffee but I like the flavor . Need to add cream because it 's too strong for me but I do n't even mind
5 #### My wife and I both enjoy the flavor ... we 'd been having coffee shipped from Hawaii and found this to be a much better tasting coffee for about the same cost ... We do n't drink anything now but this and it 's decaffeinated companion .
5 #### I love the taste of this coffee . It brings back memories of my trips to Europe and Asia . And the price on Amazon is cheaper than most " high - end " coffees in my local grocery store .
5 #### Great flavor . I tried this coffee based on the high ratings it received and I was not let down . I 'll be back again to order more . Thanks Douwe voor de geweldige smaak !
3 #### I will go with other brands . Not my type of coffee . Just okay
5 #### My friends had us over and served us this coffee . I had to come home and order it right away . It is smooth , great tasting , and I highly recommend it .
5 #### Great coffee , I brew it in my Bunn coffeemaker . I think I 'll have a cup right now .
5 #### This is the same brand served in one of our nearby casinos , but hard to find . Good coffee .
5 #### The best drip coffee I have found . I have been drinking it for several years now , even while straying off to try other brands . I keep comming back to this for a smooth cup of morning warmth .
4 #### I was curious to try this , believe it or not , after seeing this product being served to patrons of a casino which I visited . I love coffee and will try any brand at any time , even though I am fairly loyal to another brand . This was available at a decent price with free prime . Not bad at all even for what I paid . I 'd likely purchase it again if what I do use ever became unavailable .
1 #### My husband and I were so disappointed with the flavor of this Aroma Rood blend . We love the Douwe Egderts Pure Gold Coffee . But this we awful and we dumped the whole can into our compost pile .
3 #### We ate at Cheddars and fell in love with the coffee! ... very rich , deep , robust flavor .... I asked what brand ... since then , I have been trying to find the Douwe Egberts that mimics the coffe we drink at Cheddars . I have not found it yet ! It was recommended that we try the Columbian D. E. I have tried that , it is closer but stil no cigar .... This brand is far too expensive to buy for a generic cup of coffee . I can get that from Folgers which is what my husband thought he was drinking . I say , save your money . Although it is good , it is not great .
4 #### Classic bubble gum flavor with a subtle mix of mint . Just like other chewing gums , I have to open two every time . One seems like too small that I almost do n't feel it in my mouth . Orbit is a premium gum at a premium price . Generally I find it more expensive that the others at the aisle . But the flavor and taste lasts for a long time before it is time to throw it out . What more , it cleans your teeth . No calorie and no sugar . Orbit is the first sugar free chewing gum by Wrigley , the maker of " Juicy Fruit " . Believe it or not , Orbit gum was launched in 1944 during the war . It was granted by the American Dental Association of a seal of approval to help improve dental health . It is 1 of the top 5 brands of gum in the United States .
1 #### Good taste , for about 5 seconds . After 10 , you are just exercising your jaw , tasteless .
5 #### Great price on orbit chewing gum . I do n't know why but I found it difficult to find sweet mint in the store now . Also for denture and partial wearers this does not seem to stick to dental work .
5 #### My spouse 's favorite gum . I do n't chew it because I do n't eat gelatin but he wo n't chew anything else .
5 #### I 'm not a fan of peppermint . It 's too strong . Sweet mint has that perfect fresh taste while also having a flavor just sweet enough to actually enjoy chewing it . My husband chews this to curb his sweet addictions
5 #### Absolute favorite flavor . Good price here on Amazon too .
3 #### Loved this gum but something has changed . Does nt hold its flavor very long anymore .
3 #### Unfortunately , mine was stale as well . However , the taste was OK and it was n't too expensive , so I 'm not too upset , but next time I 'll buy it at the grocery store .
1 #### Tasted like rubber , zero mint flavor , broken in particles within 10 minutes of chewing .
5 #### The only gum I chew . It is , what it is . What can you say about gum .
5 #### I would not survive without this gum . It satisfies my sweet tooth while keeping me from eating stuff I do n't need . I really enjoy this gum .
5 #### While you 're chewing it , everything 's great . It 's fresh , it feels good , and you wish it could go on like that forever . Then it reaches a point where it loses it 's appeal completely and you spit it out in disgust , hoping to never , EVER see it again , discarding it like a used up tissue .
5 #### Love , love Orbit fruit flavored gum . This is a great value
5 #### My favorite gum ! not too strong but gets the job done and lasts a long time !
5 #### I found I was buying this at the grocery store frequently and decided it would be more cost effective to buy this large package on Amazon . Wonderful idea !
5 #### My favorite gum , and this is n't a bad price .
5 #### My daughter and her boyfriend both really like this gum , wo n't chew anyother
5 #### Great ! Only place I 've been able to find this flavor . Fresh .
5 #### Best flavor . Not too minty and not disgustingly sweet .
5 #### Only gum we chew , only buy on Amazon . Great price .
5 #### I love Orbit and this is my favorite flavor . I like that you get a ton of gum in this package . I would definitely recommend it .
5 #### The flavor of this gum is so good that I always buy it from Amazon in bulk ! ! I 've been buying this from Amazon for the last 3 years and I still love the flavor !
4 #### Good flavor for sugar free and low sodium too .
5 #### My family loves this Spearmint Orbit gum . It lasts a long time even after chewing for a long time it still has flavor . I love that Amazon offers great deals on items that my Family and I use . I took advantage of the $ 1.00 off coupon and also the reduced price adding this on to an existing order of $ 25 or more . Gum came in individual sealed packs and in a box with a clear plastic cover .. I love to keep a pack in my purse and the car . Gum was fresh and arrived with a clear expiration date of next year stamped on the box . I purchased this item full price as described above . My opinions are my own and I was not compensated in any way for my thoughts .
5 #### Love this stuff . Jaw gets tired before it runs out of flavor .
5 #### great long lasting flavor . My husband and I go through gum like crazy while trying to avoid eating unhealthy foods and avoid eating out of boredom . This gum is great
5 #### Tastes good and is refreshing just like it supposed to . We love orbit gum and love this car case for it .
5 #### Bought these in bulk for my girlfriend . Tired of spending more $ at target for them :)
5 #### My mouth waters just thinking about this flavor ! The flavor only lasts a few minutes sadly , but I only really chew gum for something to chew on , and also to make my breath smell great . This gum gives your breath a very powerful strawberry smell , really great .
5 #### My kids love knowing mom always has gum available now :)
5 #### The best price you could ever get , Fresh made ( not expired or not even close to expiry date ) , original neat whole pack that you could n't buy from stores on this price . Orbit have had the best quality since beginning . Do not hesitate to get advantage of this great price deal of the best Sugar Free Gum .
5 #### I love this stuff . I smoke , and this helps promote saliva production to keep my mouth healthy , and my breath fresh .
5 #### What is there to review / say ? Like broccoli or opera , one either loves or hates it . I love Orbit gum . Got tired of chasing down sales at local stores and just bought it by the case on Amazon . No regrets .
2 #### I was expecting a longer flavor experience but it does take care of coffee breath .
1 #### The bottle was busted & only a couple of pieces were on the bottom of the box . Must be a trail of gum from here to where ever the gum came from
4 #### This is a really nice warm minty flavor . Its Mild Flavor . Though , some people like a really strong minty flavor that helps people with what they feel may be their own bad halitosis . LOL ! Do n't let this stop you from believing that . My mother likes the stronger peppermint or spearmint flavor . They also have fruit flavors but like this one ... it does n't have the shocking punch of Strong Mint If you found this review helpful . Please click Yes at the bottom of this review . Thank You .
5 #### Tastes and smells great ! Sometimes the Strawberry flavor is hard to find but not on Amazon ! One of the only flavors I chew . Love them !
4 #### Does n't last as long as I thought it would but it 's okay .
5 #### We 've tried all the varieties of Orbit gum but always come back to the Bubblemint Sugarfree in the familiar pink package . It 's a traditional flavor ; nothing gimmicky , has long - lasting chewiness ( I 'll keep it in for about 30 minutes ) and most importantly , does n't leave my teeth feeling icky or bitty . Amazon has the best price I 've found , and when you use Subscribe & Save it 's even cheaper !
5 #### I 've been sampling a variety of different chewing gums so far , and I 'd say this is my favorite . Sweet , with a nice texture . Flavor is n't terribly long - lasting , but no worse than other gums I 've tried . I 'll definitely buy again .
3 #### This strawberry flavor tastes very phony and kinda weird . My favorite flavor of Orbit gum is the Tropical Remix . None of these gums ' flavors lasts more than about 6 - 7 minutes at most . Caution : the more pieces you chew the more gas you will pass ( I mean severe ) . And if you chew 2 entire packages within a day , you 'll probably get diahrrea like I did ! ! ! All of the Orbit gums are bubble gums which I like but the pieces are rather small so I chew 2 - 3 pieces at a time .
5 #### Love this gum and in the pantry a good price
5 #### Nobody else makes this flavor - hark back to bubblegum of old .
5 #### Good lasting flavor and priced right with Amazon Pantry .
4 #### one of the few cinnamon flavored sugarfree gums that last in flavor for more then a few minutes .
5 #### This is a great but on subscribe and save and pmuch cheaper than I can find in the store . Flavor does n't last that long but it is great while it does . I keep the entire desk on my desk at work and take a pack when I go to meetings and leave on the table for the group . It is usually gone by the end of the meeting .
3 #### The flavor is tastes good , but it does n't last . Good price and free shipping .
1 #### This is NOT BUBBLE - GUM ... This is only flavored like it . YOU CAN'T BLOW BUBBLES with IT , not even one tiny one ! ! !
5 #### Omnomnomnom ... this is so deliciously tasty I have to refrain from eating more than one piece at a time . Tastes like the old pink bubblegum we used to get with trading cards .
5 #### no complaints tasted great and lasted a nice amount of time .. Worth the purchase ..
5 #### My entire family likes the Wintermint flavor . Buying it by the case saves money , especially when I purchase through Amazon 's subscribe and save program . Orbit gum has a nice long - lasting flavor . I would highly recommend .
5 #### Sweet and bubble gummy and not overly minty . I keep a cup in the car all the time and it takes away my craving for sweets and freshens my breath without smelling like mouthwash .
3 #### makes my mouth dry , flavor is good.will not buy again .
5 #### Long lasting mint flavor with a touch of bubble gum flavoring . very unique taste . Great price compared to individual packs . Handy to keep in the desk drawer without damaging the gum . Also a plus , it is one of the few gums available that I have n't had a problem with it sticking to dental work ! That makes it # 1 in my book . FYI ... Orbit Watermelon flavor also does not stick to dental work
5 #### I do n't only enjoy the flavor but also the price that is offer for . Had ordered more than once .
4 #### According to my dentist I should chew more gun , especially in between meals when brushing may not be possible . But I did n't want a sugary offering ; sugar - free is the way to go . And Orbit from Wrigley , offers up the best price /taste combination . While the flavor does not last nearly as long as I 'd like ( would n't we all want it to last and hour or so ) , I still enjoy the brand and it 's plethora of flavor offerings .
3 #### The gum has an amazing strawberry flavor , but it does not last very long . I ordered two cases and all of the gum was mushy . When I would initially bit into the gum it would crumble apart in my mouth . After about 30 seconds of chewing it would solidify into a piece of gum . After about 30 minutes to an hour of chewing it would turn into a nasty mush in my mouth that I would have to spit out . I think the gum I got was not stored properly or was old . I ca n't recall what the expiration date was on the package , but I remember that it was not past the expiration date .
2 #### I love Orbit Bubblemint Sugarfree gum . So technically I should give it 5 stars . However , in the 24 packs that I have received from Amazon almost half were bad . They were melted , stuck to the paper , and when we tried to chew they disintegrated . I am not sure if the warehouse that those are in , is too warm or if I just got a bad batch but I will go back and buy them at the store instead of ordering from Amazon . This is a shame since the pricing here would be awesome !
4 #### Arrived on time , wrapped well , does n't expire for a year , so I know it wo n't get tough and yucky before I go through it . Good deal for the item , just wish it did n't have to be an add on !
5 #### I love this gum . It is so yummy and I can chew it all day long . For some reason , it is becoming more difficult to find this flavor in stores , so this big package is perfect . Plus overall , it is cheaper and more convenient to buy this way .
5 #### Love this flavor . Can be hard to find in stores sometimes , so much easier to buy a big package . Well worth it .
5 #### Remix to what ? Similarly to R. Kelly 's jam " Remix to Ignition " - The Orbit Strawberry Remix Sugarfree Gum is probably far more famous than the original . That being said , I like this gum . It is very strong - flavored , so weak gum - likers need not apply . It is true that the flavor does not last as long as other Orbit delights like the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Wrigleys - Orbit - Bubblemint-14 - Count - Pack - of-12 / dp / B004DIXSV8 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Wrigleys Orbit Bubblemint , 14 - Count ( Pack of 12)</a > . You ca n't win 'em all . Truth be told , that is a better gum . This is more of a special occasion gum , when you 're really feeling the need to take the vacation to flavor country . I keep this gum at work so that I can make sure that my oral fixation always has 12 x 20 pieces on standby . Review over .
5 #### BEST . GUM . EVER ! I LOVE LOVE LOVE the taste of this gum , especially right after my first cup of coffee at work . I feel like it cleans my breath and I hope it cleans up some of the coffee stains ( not sure it does but I HOPE ) . I always have a case of this stored in my desk drawer . One in my lunch bag , one in my purse and one in my car . I never go ANYWHERE without it .
5 #### Lots of gum for a decent price . I wo n't run out of gum for a very long time . It was fresh , not stale and old . Would buy from again .
2 #### Orbit is usually my go - to gum brand , and is also usually a great product , but these pieces are hard and not at all refreshing .
5 #### This is a nice fun gum .. Seems a little hard to chew at first .. but good for the purpose of easing up on sugar ...
5 #### love this gum ! and buying in bulk saves me $ $
5 #### How could you not love Orbit Bubble Mint chewing gum ? It 's refreshing , and will keep your breath nice and fresh !
5 #### Great gum with a flavor that lasts a long while . I usually prefer mint gums ; however , this cinnamon is a great change . I have bought 3 cases and have not had any problems with it being hard . Perhaps I do n't chew gum for as long as others - I can say that I usually have this gum for about an hour and a half and find that the flavor is still there . Happy chewing !
5 #### Hi there , These gums are pretty nice , they release the cinnamon flavour but not for a long time . The taste is less strong compare to the classic Big Red but at least they do not contain ASPARTAME . Overall good product sugarfree
5 #### Yummy ! This is the best sugar free gum on the market besides the wildberry ! Small pieces , great for kids , easy to chew , and very tasty . I recommend this to anyone who loves sugar free gum .
5 #### Well ... it 's cinnamon gum . It tastes good and the flavor lasts long enough . We have bought these for years and do n't look to change .
3 #### I really like the cinnamon flavor of the gum , but that 's about where the pros end . The gum was hard from the start , and I do n't know if this is because it 's too old or what . I do n't mean like rock hard , but it 's just too tough . The flavor lasts for maybe 10 - 15 minutes or so , so not great on that end either . It 's just OK .
3 #### It tastes good when chewing it but the flavor does not last long enough . Other brands hold their flavor , this type after you chew it for a few minutes , the flavor vanishes away .
5 #### Think big red when you order this gum . Did you grow up chewing big red and remember people or kisses related to it ? If so you will welcome the smell and tingly of this cinnamon gum . I will probably order this again from amazon sooner than the 6 months I set it to subscribe . Tasty and when you open the pack the whole car smells warm and cinnamonly
4 #### After the dentyne fire variety this was dull n does n't last as long . Not bad if u ca n't stand the stuff that burns
5 #### Fresh breath , long lasting flavor , does n't become rubber hard after 20 minutes of chewing like so many other brands . In fact I can chew on two sticks all day and feel satisfied .
5 #### I 'm a bit of an compulsive gum chewer so having stashes all over the house and at work have turned into a trend . Comes in 2 standard sizes boxes with 12 packs in each box . Always concerned with things like these when buying in bulk that they may be stale . Everything was perfectly fresh and should keep me happily chewing for the next few months .
5 #### Got this for my daughter , who lives in Istanbul . She and her husband love the cinnamon flavor . Turkey has sugar free gum , but no cinnamon flavor . There national brand flavor is very strange , an herb like flavor , that is very unappealing to the American palate .
5 #### I am a recent convert to gum . My dental hygienist gave me a sample and told me of the way it promoted good dental hygiene . I loved the flavor and subsequently tried most of the Orbit gums until I settled on Wintermint . According to a card enclosed with my sample this gum works by causing increased saliva , which in turn neutralizes acids . Another point made by the card is that the increased saliva can also help prevent early tooth damage and decay . While I am sure most chewing gums will trigger an increase in saliva , this one is sugar free . Nutritionally a stick of this is less than five calories , contains no sodium , and only a single gram of carbs . It 's sugar - free ( otherwise I doubt it would have the ringing endorsements of the American Dental Association ) , and it leaves my mouth fresh . I typically chew a piece between meals to keep my mouth fresh and to add one more layer to my dental hygiene regimen . It 's too early to tell how effective it is in the long term , but my mouth feels cleaner .
3 #### This flavor looked delicious ! And it indeed is when you pop it into your mouth because it 's an explosion of fruity , juicy , strawberry ( tastes like watermelon thought ) goodness . And while you 're salivating and chomping it around in your mouth , I am NOT kidding , 20 seconds later , the flavor is sucked dry and your left with a wad of flavorless gum in your mouth . Like seriously orbit , I know your other mint flavors last more than this ! This is one of the gums which I have experienced that loses its flavor almost instantly ! Thank god I only bought one pack , and I eat it when I 'm craving something sweet and fruity and it does its job in the first 20 seconds .... Do n't waste your money on a whole 12 - pack of this , buy one pack and test the truth !
3 #### This is a good gum , but in terms of flavor it is not the best for Cinnamon flavor , that honor belongs to Big Red . That said , it is a good buy for the price .
5 #### my favorite gum . very original bubble gum flavor with a hint of mint . the mint is little not over powering the bubble gum flavor .
4 #### Like it better than any other gum I tried and I 've tried a lot - started chewing gum when I quit smoking - my only complaint is it seems to lose it flavor too soon and start tasting terrible guess it 's made that way
5 #### I love the taste of Orbit 's Cinnamint Sugarfree Gum ! ! ! The flavor lasts , and its good for your teeth ; including your dental work .
2 #### My son and I love Orbit gum . It usually keeps its flavor better than other sugar - free gums . In this case , although the flavor lasts fine , the taste is not what we expected . I 'm not a big fan of mint gums , but my son usually likes them . He does n't like this flavor . The mixture of cinnamon and mint makes for a strange combination and is not one that we will buy again .
3 #### AFTER CHEWING FOR SOME TIME THE GUM GETS STALE AND I HAVE TO CHANGE IT SHORTLY . OR MAYBE I JUST CHEW TOO FAST LOL NOT BAD FOR THE PRICE THOUGH . IT WAS AN ADD - ON ITEM .
5 #### You are VERY lucky if you find a gum that does n't have its flavor vanish before you 've gotten in a bunch of chews . Orbit cinnamon has a lot of flavor and you can actually sit down while chewing . With other gums , you do n't even reach your chair before you run out of flavor and have to get up to toss it away . Best of all , it 's sugar free -- that 's zero calories . Ca n't get better than that .
5 #### The picture was very clear and I liked very much the manufacture also , I received the part on time without any problem . Thanks for the job let 's keep working like this satisfying correctly the customer .
5 #### i was thought it might be a huge size , well , its actually normal . and we like this flavor and this brand .
3 #### Orbit gum has really had some good flavors , and others that have felt more mixed than divine . When I heard they had done a strawberry gum , I wondered is it was good . Well , it could 've been more with Orbit 's Strawberry Remix gum . It tastes alright at first , but easily loses it flavor , faster than any gum that I have tasted in awhile . The strawberry flavor does n't last long , only a couple of minutes and quickly goes away . I really did n't feel that it could be a flavor I would want to continuous buy . Instead , I definitely think that Wrigley 's should really consider making this flavor stronger to the tee , than this would be a flavor I would recommend for anyone that needs a quick chew on the go . Price : D Taste : C Overall : C-
1 #### Misleading . The reason this is cheaper than the other flavors is that this is a 12 pack , whereas the others are all 24 packs for around $ 21 . Beware of misleading listings . Also , the cinnamint is probably the weakest flavor . Even fresh packs ( I can tell because of the dates of promotions on the package they sometimes run ) can sometimes taste stale . This is because the flavor of the cinnamint lasts just a few minutes . Tasting all flavors , the peppermint by far outlasts this flavor and most of the others . I highly recommend that flavor for a nice breath refresher between brushings or just after meals . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Orbit - Peppermint - Sugarfree - Gum-14 - Piece - Packs - Pack - of-24 / dp / B001IZCY4Q / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Orbit Peppermint Sugarfree Gum , 14 - Piece Packs ( Pack of 24)</a >
5 #### This is my favorite gum . It maintains its flavor for a very long time , and also remains pleasingly elastic when chewed . Other gum I 've tried becomes tough shortly after you begin chewing .
5 #### Orbit is my favorite gum , and this is the best price available anywhere I have found . I prefer sweet mint but this is good too .
3 #### Remix to what ? Similarly to R. Kelly 's jam " Remix to Ignition " - The Orbit Strawberry Remix Sugarfree Gum is probably far more famous than the original .

1 #### Unfortunately this particular box of gums contained staled and hard pieces . Do n't know why , since the fruity flavour Orbit gums were great . . . .
5 #### I like orbit gum and it is vegetarian friendly . This bulk pack gives me an abundance and keeps me from having to buy a Costco membership . Even Walmart does n't carry this quantity packaging so it 's a good deal .
5 #### I 've ordered a lot of gum off Amazon , many different brands and flavors . This is my favorite . I think anywhere you buy gum , sometimes you get a stale pack or batch , but overall I 've been happy enough with the quality and freshness to keep ordering it time and again .
5 #### I know I chew too much gum , but I really like this gum . 1 . At over 50 I still blow bubbles 2 . It has a slight mint flavor 3 . Still tastes like bubble gum .
5 #### In my opinion , the Sweetmint Sugarfree Gum is the best flavor made by Orbit . The taste is wonderfully sweet and flavorful and lasts longer than any other brand of sugar - free gum I have tried . The fact that it is better for your teeth , being free of sugar , is only icing on the cake !
5 #### I sent these to our troops in Afghanistan who wanted gum and I am sure they are very pleased . The price is great .
1 #### Would rather have the whitening gum . Falls apart when chewing I do not like it at all . Love the Harder Pieces Yummy on those !
5 #### Sugar free , great taste , pretty long lasting . Not a lot to say about gum . I like it a lot .
5 #### Starbucks has a flavor all its own . This is a delicious Espresso blend .
5 #### Although I have a Keurig and so use coffee pods I also use my percolator at times especially when on my patio . The Starbucks dark Roast coffee is very good indeed . It is quite a strong blend which is what I enjoy and I hope to buy more when the need arises
4 #### I like the deepness , though I usually mix 50:50 with something softer ( like Dazbog Mocha Java ) . A little too bold for me to drink cup - after - cup of this straight .
5 #### Not much to say other than I love Starbucks . Love their coffee and this is a good strong brew . I used it in my Keurig and it works great in the reusable KCup . All in all it is worth the price .
5 #### This is just was it says it is and really good .
3 #### This espresso is great but I must have read the size wrong because you can get this same size at the grocery store for half of the price . It was my mistake though .
5 #### have been a user for several years . starbucks is the best and really not that expensive as I only have a couple cups of joe in the morning . never thought about the descriptive " espresso " as I do n't use it for that though some could find it misleading . as for me who likes it bold and like mud its perfect . YUM ! !
2 #### I bought this coffee when I ran out of my favorite espresso coffee , Goya . It was a few dollars more expensive but I love having coffee at Starbucks cafes , so I figured it might be worth it . First , it is ground so coarsely that I must grind it some more in order to use it in my home espresso machine . Second , it seems to be among the more bitter of any grocery store espresso coffees that I have ever bought . Even with milk and sugar , I could not mask the bitterness . I wo n't be buying it again .
2 #### I was looking for a decaf the was a full rich medium roast with a wonderful satisfying flavor . Starbucks failed to deliver . Dunkin Donuts House Decaf is for me the gold standard in this category .
5 #### This coffee is soooooooo good ! I bought it after I started experiencing heartburn from my over consumption of regular coffee . So in the AM , I have a 20 oz . regular , then the 16 oz decaf . If you get heartburn , this is a good choice ..... I would defy anyone to tell it 's decaf . I bought mine @ TJ Maxx @ a steal ! Do n't know why it was so low priced ..... possibly due to the May best buy date ..... I bought in March , or that it was in the old blue print bag ? Do n't know , but I got one 12 oz bag of the whole bean and even bought a cheap coffee grinder for it . After trying it , went back and bought 3 more bags ..... wish now , that I would have bought a case . The price was phenominal - ending up being .50 / oz , compared to Starbuck 's price of .81 / oz and Amazon 's price of .74 / oz . I REALLY did get a great deal at TJ , but alas , that story 's over . Amazon 's price is good and this is where I 'll order going forward , now that I 'm hooked !
5 #### We live in NYC and this stuff goes for $ 14 - 15 per bag in most stores . Amazon 's price ( 3 for $ 23 ) is an amazing discount . Plus , this coffee is excellent . Five stars .
5 #### There 's nothing like Starbucks for a morning pick me up . The very best . An excellent value . Highly recommend the product .
5 #### Robust full flavor , for the discriminating coffee drinker . Real coffee flavor for a decaf . I highly recommend it , as I do with all Starbucks products .
5 #### What can you say , it 's Starbucks ! I French Press this and the taste is amazing .
1 #### Tastes like an old ashtray . Scorched and garbage - y. Even half and half could n't mellow it . I actually threw the rest of the brand new bag in the garbage after making just one small pot .
3 #### This coffee is strong and slightly bitter . It would probably taste much better if I added milk or sugar to cut down on the bitterness , but I prefer to drink black coffee . With a choice between this or other weak flavored or watery coffees , I 'd choose this one every time , but there are other brands that have the same strength without the bitterness .
5 #### Great coffee , but high price . Local stores no longer carry the decafe .
5 #### Has a very good flavor and aroma . Makes for a good cup of coffee with or without cream or sugar .
5 #### Great robust flavor for those who like their coffee strong . I am hooked on the taste and look forward to it every day . Even though it is medium blend and decaf it still has the zing to it that makes it popular with many . I plan to buy more when this is gone .
3 #### This is exactly what I was looking for but couldln't find at more local store . I wouldln't have ordered it if I did n't have PRIME , way over - priced .
1 #### I purchased two bottles of these to use for wedding cupcakes and I 'm glad I taste tested them before decorating my desserts because it would of turned into one of my worst nightmares . I sprinkled some on a dollop of whipped frosting I made and ate it and it was just terrible . The texture of this is exactly like thin plastic flakes and they do not dissolve easily when eaten . I had to use my front teeth to smash these down while they stuck to my teeth and it just was n't an enjoyable experience since it felt like I was eating plastic . I 'm very disappointed in this product and would n't recommend it .
2 #### Very small jar . My fault for not realizing it .
5 #### Clearly this is not for everyone . In my opinion , the sparkles are flavorless once added to frosting , icing and the like . I think it 's the texture that 's odd . I mean it 's odd in the best sense of the word . There is something to be said about the unique texture it gives to your finished goodies . It 's snow - like ; I 'd even say glass - like . It especially looks cool when you match the color of sparkles to the color of icing ( e.g. pink icing with pink sparkles ) . I ca n't think of anything else on the market comparable to this . I 've tried it on flooded icing when making sugar cookies and frosted cupcakes . I think it 's worth trying . I like it !
5 #### I use at least a jar of these every year for the snow on a winter cake , and it 's great stuff . Very sparkly , but subtle , and does n't add a lot of crunch the was sparkling sugar does .
5 #### These flakes of shimmering sugar candy are fantastic ! ! ! ! They give elegance to any cake ! I though them on after cake is finished and looks fantastic ! ! ! ! ! I always keep them on hand !
2 #### A little disappointed in this product . This is more clear then sparkle . I wanted to put them on top of pink cupcakes for a wedding shower , but this was barely noticeable .
5 #### Add a little class to the top of cakes ! Recommend using by all means .
5 #### Must have for adding sparkle to cakes ! The only thing I like better is airbrushing shimmer onto cakes ! But , these sparkles can be sprinkled on cakes , cupcakes , etc .
1 #### There is nothing glittery or sparkly about these sprinkles . I ordered the purple and expected the product to look like glitter , not tiny cut up pieces of plastic . It 's not what I wanted at all , these should not be advertised as sparkles . Confetti would be better suited . Will never purchase these again .
5 #### Great for finishing touch ! Not too big but enough to give a nice shine like crystals
4 #### They do shimmer . They are a little expensive for a tiny jar of sprinkles .
5 #### Easy to use and lovely to look at on my cake .
5 #### great product , excellent shipping . have used this product for years and I was very satisfied . I like being able to get what I need .
4 #### I 've never seen edible glitter on a confection before , and the guests at our 5 year old 's party were impressed . Several asked if they could really eat it . It does n't taste like anything , so it 's just for looks , but very shiny and cute . I found them easy to apply , just tap the container lightly , but I do n't mind a random effect ... they're sprinkles after all , and a little clumping does n't look bad at all . I also tried the hearts and stars , which I preferred a bit . These melted into the frosting a bit after storing in the fridge , but the stars and hearts kept their shape . This product might best be used as a " fill " for stencils .
5 #### Came quickly and was the deep purple I anticipated . And the best part is was about 1/2 the cost of what was offered in the store .
4 #### Cake sparkles are intended to give just that ; a bit of twinkling color . If used alone , the impact is subtle . If you want to enhance the effect , use them in conjunction with a purple or lavender color underneath . I use them with royal icing ( it hardens ) on cookies . After spreading the icing , immediately sprinkle the sparkles on top . The icing will hold them in place . The two layers create a beautiful , richer look . Think of a precious stone . Without being cut properly , the stone wo n't sparkle . But , with facets and light , it comes to life . That 's what the cake sparkles do for your flat icing . I keep a supply of several colors and have never been disappointed with my finished products . This is not a product that you can taste . It 's not sweet . Its purpose is to complement your baked goods , unlike sanding sugars or sprinkles / jimmies . Wilton consistently provides excellent quality supplies and I 've been using their products for about 34 years .
3 #### sparkles are ok - but melt into the frosting and do n't show up as nicely as they should , container was 1/3 empty . Packaged nicely , shipped on time , just was disappointed iwth the product itself .
5 #### Love the Zone bars but can only find them on Amazon.com . Lucky for me .
5 #### My daughter gave me one of the peanut butter bars , and I loved it . It also filled me up for the next few hours . I ordered them soon after , and both my husband and I think t hey are great !
5 #### Super delicious , and the price was better than the regular grocery store .
4 #### Love these , but I did n't realize that there were two different flavors in the box .
3 #### These are pretty good , but , I am doing Weight Watchers and wanted a marginally nutritious meal replacement bar for when I do n't have time . These little boogers are 8 SmartPoints each ! They 're loaded with sugar and fat ! And , they 're not that big . No sir . So , I 'm going to carefully finish these and never buy this again . NEVER !
5 #### These bars are awesome as a meal replacement ( or a snack depending on your hunger ! ) . These are my two favorite flavors . Unlike many other protein bars , these do not taste chalky at all . The flavors are delicious ! I highly recommend trying them . You will not be disappointed !
3 #### Not my favorite protein bars but not horrible either
2 #### I love Zone bars but this box of bars had seen better days . They are edible but the chocolate coating is splotchy and the bars are on the tough and dry side . Not a Zone bar issue ... the brand is fantastic and I have enjoyed them for years ... hoping this was just an isolated box .
5 #### Never want to be without these ! Good to have around all the time !
2 #### I already reviewed the item and felt negatively about it . First the bar has 15gr . of sugar and 200 calories and relative a low protein content . I do n't consider it a health bar . It is of course my fault for assuming that the Zone contains low amount of sugar . The sugar makes me hungry after an hour .
5 #### They 're great to have in my purse while doing errands .
5 #### We were introduced to these at Costco and love them . Great product .
5 #### Tastes great , filling and lasts with you a long time . My daughter keeps one in her car when she does n't have enough time between clients to eat a sit down lunch . I eat them to keep from eating a pint of ice cream as the bars are healthy and very satisfying . So glad we tried these .
5 #### These were shipped fast ! I love the graham taste . Very good bars ! Very filling .
3 #### Not great for baking , you still need to flour the pan afterwards . I currently use it the same way you 'd use original Pam .
5 #### We make a lot of cakes in this house . We do not have time to add a cake that breaks to our day . We used to flour and oil our cake pans . But they would break or the side would stick . When I discovered this spray I hoped it would work . It does ! ! ! It is the only spray I will use for my cakes . I just spray the pan and add the cake batter ! It makes life so much easier . Do n't spray the pan and then let it sit . Spray the pan and then add the batter as soon as possible . I always keep this spray around . It is a must for perfect cakes .
5 #### This spray is a time saver . I am so glad I have it on my shelf now !
5 #### works beautifully - especially for bundt cakes & a lot easier than butter & flour
5 #### I often bake cakes and after struggling with them sticking to the pan I got this . It was perfect . Now , my cakes and other treats never stick . This is a must buy for anyone who has ever baked in their life !
5 #### I have never used a non stick spray in a cake pan before .. but recently i purchased two very elaborate bundt cake pans that had lots of tips and points .. they are more like a mold than a cake pan . I decided to try Wiltons spray and see it if worked . Its certainly easy enough to use .. spray the pan and add your batter and bake . I did follow someones suggestion on releasing the cake which was to take the cake out of the oven and let it sit untouched for ten full minutes ... then I used a soft spatula to run along the sides between the cake and the pan .. and inverted the cake onto a plate . I tapped the bottom of the pan several times then gently lifted the pan .. and the cake came out perfect . I made three cakes with three different pans using the same method . It might be noted that I sprayed the pans quite liberally with the spray . I can only base my review on what I experienced .. but it worked well for me both times ... so I am giving it a thumbs up as it is working well with my bundt cake pans . I hope this review was helpful for you . I have enclosed a few photos to show the detail on the cake and how it released well from the pan .
5 #### I love this product ! I use it for all of my baking , frying , whatever needs !
5 #### I 've been using this for years and have yet to have a cake stick . It is flavorless as well .
5 #### Works great for ALL baked goods . My cakes , bars , brownies , muffins , etc . never ever stick when I use this . I think it works better than flour / butter in the pan .
5 #### I do love this product . I do n't bake a cake without it .
5 #### i never use any other spray . leaves no taste that would take away from my food and my cakes come off the pan with ease
5 #### I could not find this in the stores I love using this cause it does not change the taste of the food
5 #### You can buy it for less in stores such as Joann 's and Michael 's but it is great for baking and I always make sure I have it in my pantry .
4 #### These sugar crystals are shiny black I use them against a white royal icing for terrific contrast . When used on black royal icing , they make your finished product shimmer with depth . They really make my cookies pop with a colorful sparkle . Tip : If you are decorating cookies , place waxed paper or a paper towel beneath the cookie you are decorating . When you 're done , it makes it much easier to put back into the jar the crystals that never made it onto your cookies . That saves you money and time .
5 #### I actually purchased these to make desserts for a high school graduation party since these are the school colors . Came out nice and I did n't have to buy 2 different shakers of sprinkles !
5 #### around Christmas they always run out . so now I wo n't run out . great sugar sprinkles .
5 #### Just like the ones in the store . Bright colored sprinkles great for King Cakes !
2 #### I used these black sugar sprinkles in a dessert and was embarrassed to see that it dyed everyone 's mouth greenish black after eating it . I 'm not talking just a little bit .... it was hard to get off and pretty gross . It was also hard to get out of the counter top after cooking with them . The remaining bit of this stuff went in the trash .
4 #### MORE WHITE SPRINKLES THAN SHAMROCK ONES . BUT OK PRODUCT .
5 #### I refer these over the grocery brand I used to buy . Much finer and more vibrant . Recommended . Also , arrived in ample time for Xmas baking despite my ordering them at the last minute .
5 #### I 'm a fan of Wilton products . Rarely do I ever get something that is lacking in quality . I picked up the " Cinnamon Drops " to use as noses for my reindeer cake pops . They worked great , looked great and taste great ! Definitely would purchase these again .
2 #### The&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Wilton - Black - Cake - Sparkles / dp / B0000VMA52 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Wilton Black Cake Sparkles</a>&nbsp;were quite a disappointment because they were more green than black . Black can appear in many hues and this one is n't the best . I ended up finding Black Sanding Sugar at Williams Sonoma that I used for my purpose instead of this and found that the flavor of that product also was better than these sparkles . If you 're not particular about your black color , these may be satisfactory , so I 've given these two stars instead of the one I really wanted to select . I 'm curious to know what 's the difference between this product and the product that comes up at a lower price when a search is done for " Wilton Black Sugar Sparkles " on this website . Image and description are exactly the same , and both are available now via the Amazon Prime Add On Program .
5 #### Just like the icing used on expensive bought cakes ! Perfect to have on hand for " emergency " baking sessions . Buy it you will like it !
5 #### I used cream , and put it on a white cake and my husband just loved it . Note one box does one layer of a two layer cake .
3 #### Using powdered sugar with butter and vanilla and milk tastes better and would be cheaper . Would not buy this again .
5 #### My friends and I all agree that this is the best tasting frosting ! Mine comes out beautiful white , frosted the cake with smooth perfection and set up perfectly for decoration . This will be a staple for my future in cake decoration !
5 #### Delicious Icing - Great Flavor . Mix up icing quickly to frost or decorate a cake or cupcakes .
5 #### I am CONSTANTLY baking and this icing always gets awesome remarks . Most people are convinced it is homemade ! It is light , fluffy and hard not to eat before you get it onto the cake ! !
4 #### The taste was fine , but it certainly did NOT make enough to frost even just the top of a 9x13 cake . You would need maybe three of these .
5 #### Growing up in a typical Puerto Rican family , all we knew was Pilon coffee . Now as an adult with my own family , nothing wakes me up like the aroma of freshly brewed Pilon . Hispanics are all about their coffee and Pilon is definitely one of the best . Try it , you wo n't be disappointed .
4 #### unlike other islander coffee , Bold & Strong Cuban Coffee as expected . will purchase again .
3 #### This coffee has a bitter taste but i enjoyed it i would buy it again
4 #### This is a nice roast and authentic Cuban bean . It 's a good change from my normal coffee - has a nice taste and I use it with a super automatic machine with ease . Not an oily bean .
5 #### First off , my usual espresso is the Starbucks brand . I just like a strong flavor . I want to HAVE to put some cream and suger in my coffee for it to be tolerable . The first thing I noticed upon tasting PILON is that it 's VERY strong yet VERY smooth . I ca n't say that for the Starbucks brand espresso ... actually at all . I still put cream and suger in my americano 's but I use less water , more espresso , and less sugar and cream . That 's because the flavor of this coffee is SO perfect . Living in Chicago it 's easy to find good espresso 's , as intelligentsia and metropolis make excellent coffee for the larger brands here , but nothing really compares to the smooth cuban like flavoring of PILON . Seriously try some if you 're an espresso lover like me and would rather drink any kind of espresso drink than BLAH coffee . This stuff is for REAL .
5 #### I 'm an avid cook and spice mix experimenter , plus I 've been a fan of Chef Prudhomme 's delicious recipes for some time . This is a world - class selection of spice mixes , and definitely a worthwhile gift for the chef in your family . ( Or yourself , if you like to try new flavorings on your food other than onion powder and ketchup . ) Although Prudhomme is a well - known Cajun chef , do n't think that his spice mixes are designed to burn your tongue out . The hottest of the mixes in this collection is the Blackened Redfish Magic . It 's a chile - powder kind of burn straight - on , but it also carbonizes into a delicious crust when you 're cooking most any kind of fish in the Prudhomme manner . ( Note to those who might try this at home : open the windows or switch off the smoke detectors , this is a smoky dish ! ) Other standouts are the Chicken Magic , which is a strong , herbal - scented spice , and the gentler , more complex Seafood Magic , which has notes of pepper and paprika among others in it . And you wo n't go wrong with the remainder of the items , which rely primarily on the ground herbs and not table salt or MSG .
5 #### These are the BEST blended seasonings I 've ever used . The added flavor is wonderful and provides and additional kick to meats and veggies .
5 #### I love these spice combos and they save lots of individual measuring . They are as helpful in the kitchen as Minors Chicken Base . I 'm all for convenience as long as they help me produce delicious nutritious meals . These arrived quickly and well packed .
5 #### Love these . Low carb , great taste . I 've tried the meat and blackened steak so far , five more to go , if any suck I 'll come back and update this review . I used the magic meat to make a friend dinner and she spent a good part of the evening trying to figure out what combo of spices I 'd used ... it 's now my secret ingredient =)
5 #### When it 's too cold or rainy to grill , use this on the range or in the broiler . But turn on the fan first .
5 #### one of the best spices on the planet and if do not have then you need to get this
5 #### Have n't quite tried them all yet but these are great spices , yummy .
5 #### A great vareity of Magic Blends . Each one brings a nice flavor to the meat that is recommended . The vegetable blend is used daily on just about every vegetable I eat . Very flavorful and tasty . Does not overpower the meat or vegetables .
5 #### Coworker informed me to try Magic seasoning ! I thank him after every meal prepared with this seasoning !
5 #### Found it cheaper here than local glocery store . Great Buy .
2 #### They really do all seem really close in flavor ...
1 #### Not good at all ... all taste the same And meat seasoning taste like taco seasoning . Vegetable seasoning taste like something fake . I have not tried the chicken and seafood ... doesnt even want to . Iwill return it
5 #### great purchase . Spices mixed real nice and ads great flavor to my cooking Would buy again
5 #### I love these seasonings , and the variety is really convenient . I often mix my own seasonings , but when I do n't have time , I use the Chef Paul seasonings . I have used all of these , and they go a long way . I keep these and other Chef Paul seasonings on hand at all times .
3 #### I doubt Chef Paul had anything at all to do with these spices . They are surprisingly bland and all taste the same . You will literally get a much better result merely using sea salt and fresh ground pepper .
5 #### The Magic Seasoning Blends are a staple in our house ! I keep them stocked in our pantry . The blends are great , flavorful , and compliment a wide range of foods . My favorites are the Barbeque and Salt Free Seasoning . Alone or combined to create your own mix , these blends are awesome . We love to use the Barbeque on steaks and ribs or mixed into baked beans . The Fajita blend is great for making marinades or adding to ground beef for tacos . The Salt Free and original Seasoning are great for anything and everything . I will admit that I have yet to try the Salmon seasoning . The others I have purchased previous and jumped at the chance to try this 5 pack . You just ca n't beat the price . Most of these , if and when I can find them locally , are $ 5.50 and above . I definitely will be purchasing these again . Planning on gifting a set to my dad who LOVES to cook !
5 #### I use one of these everytime I cook and I love these seasonings .
5 #### After having used the seasoning salt for years , and running out of my current can , I decided to try the set . I 'm glad I did . I still use the seasoning salt the most , then the salmon seasoning next , and the others rarely . Still , they 're all good .
5 #### UPDATE:- I purchased those 4 bottles as I was very impressed with the reviews and decided to give it a shot . Oh boy was I so pleased ! Chef Paul really got it spot on when he made one seasoning blend for vegetables , meat , poultry and seafood . They pretty much have the same main ingredients but each one has that extra couple of ingredients that makes what ever your having taste amazing ! Today I thought I would try the Vegatable blend with my pasta w / pesto and OMG , did it taste so so good ! I am so happy with the blends I got . I get all my lunches at work from a diet centre so sometimes I am stuck with very boring choices . I decided to keep Poultry , Seafood and Vegetables in the office with me at all times and and will keep the Meat Magic at home for my steaks :) UPDATE:- I just used the Meat Magic over the weekend and WOW ! I put a generous amount on every new york strip before grilling along with coconut oil and clarified butter ( ghee ) and oh man it tasted amazing ! I have done close to a hundred steaks with different seasoning and marinade and this has got to be the best so far ! I am considering buying another set for the house as I would like to always have all flavors on hand wherever I am . Thanks for the great product !
5 #### Excellent package deal . This should last us for awhile . Some of the best seasonings out there .
5 #### I especially love the seafood , chicken and pork and veal seasonings . My only wish is that we could build our own sets or buy two or three of the flavors we want . I had to buy the 24 oz of the veal and pork seasoning - which is not replaceable - in my mind - to have it at all . It lives in my freezer and I fill an old bottle as needed .
1 #### these are only 2 ounce bottles . I thought this was a 7 pack of 7.2 ounce bottles . Read carefully ! NOT WORTH THE PRICE .
5 #### As expected . Given as a gift to someone who loves cooking .
5 #### I love Chef Paul seasoning . Taste is amazing . I was first introduced at santa monica seafood . they recommend I try the Fish seasoning on my grilled salmon . Wow ! Taste blew my taste buds . It really adds flavor . The really cool thing is this set of four different seasonings has l;asted much longer than expected . there is allot of seasoning in each bottle .
5 #### Whether I use this on ribs or pork shoulder , my barbecue turns out professional quality -- or better . Recently , I served St. Louis - cut ribs seasoned 24 hours ahead with Barbecue Magic . Not only were they a hit , several guests said they were better than the ribs at a famous upscale casual barbecue chain ( and I agree ) . Chef Paul is the guru of herbs & spices , and like all his seasonings , this product is world class . The flavor is perfectly balanced with a light , natural smokiness , and is absolutely NOT hot . Perfect for beef , poultry , pork , as well as other meats and countless dishes .
5 #### I have used all of Paul Prudhomme 's seasonings and I love them all . They are spicy but not hot and very flavorful . If you are trying to use less salt this is the answer .
5 #### I have been buying Chef Prudhomme 's spices for well over a year . I am never disappointed with them . My favorites are Vegetable Magic , Meat Magic and even though it 's not part of this pack I buy the toasted onion and garlic . It 's great when I bake fresh vegetables . Before purchasing from Amazon compare the prices with his website because sometimes they are cheaper .
5 #### This is a great and easy way to create genuine barbecue flavoring for your chicken , beef , or pork . You can use it either as part of a marinade or a rub . And you can use it when cooking on the grill , in the oven , on the stovetop , or in the barbecue pit . In a word , it 's versatile . But not just that . The taste is great and provides a natural smoky flavor to whatever you 're cooking . We 've tried it on a number of occasions , and we 've never been disappointed . The recommended serving size is 1/4 tsp . , which means that a little goes a long way .
5 #### Wonderful assortment . Taste fantastic . Watch holes in top of shakers as they are large and the volume you expect is way higher when using them . I would recommend .
3 #### My husband and I can not eat much salt and this suites us fine . It tastes so good . You would not know how low the salt is so you can use it for flavoring . I like that you have it for beef , pork,,poultry , etc . Very good .
5 #### We absolutely love these spices ! They are our go to spices for any dish . The one for poultry is so good we needed to buy a large container of the Poultry one as it is used so much ( found it in the supermarket ) . Also makes a great gift !
5 #### Love this unique combo of spices ! There is a wonderful undertone of anise . I ca n't eat steak without it now
5 #### My friends and family think I am a cooking genious .... until I explain that I used Chef Paul 's Magic Seasoning Blends . We were introduced to these blends at a dinner party , and our pantry could not be complete without keeping this product well stocked . From fish to beef , this product would be difficult to beat .
5 #### This stuff has a bite to it , so start with a little and adjust from there . We made the mistake of smothering our ribs with it , and WOW ! ! ! ! ! burn your lips off hot .. We have since learned to cut the rub with a bit of brown sugar and comes out perfect ..
3 #### Usually a big fan of Bob 's Red Mill products , this one does not blow my mind . The first few times I cooked it in the microwave , it exploded all over the place and left a sticky mess ( Cooked it on high for 3 minutes as the instructions read ) . Covering it with a plate or foil does not help . I figured out that stirring after the 1st and 2nd minute prevents it from boiling over . You do have to let it sit for several minutes before it 's cool enough to eat . The texture of this cereal is very grainy , which can not be helped by adding more liquid . I add splenda and fat free yogurt to give it better taste and texture , sometimes I slice some banana into it before I cook it . I prefer Bob 's organic 6 grain and the 5 grain cereals over this .
4 #### I mix this with regular rolled oats to give it some better texture .
5 #### Not sure if I would like the 6 grain but my hesitation was for naught . Love this cereal but the amounts had to be halved ( directions ) or we would be feeding four instead of two ! Tastes great and especially good on those cold mornings when oatmeal just seems bland . Would buy again .
5 #### Excellent value . I store these in the freezer and make pancakes out of them after mixing with equal parts yogurt and letting it sit in a warm place for 12 - 24 hours as explained in " Nourishing Traditions " by Sally Fallon .
5 #### It 's healthy , great when topped with sliced banana . Wholesome food with a glass of milk .
1 #### Ordered this thinking it was 6 grain hot cereal more like the oatmeal style as with other brands , but its cream of wheat essentially , which is sooo gross to me . If you like cream of wheat , you will like this , but it is NOT the oatmeal style .
5 #### I was not compensated or given item at a discount in exchange for this review . This is something I purchased because I either wanted or needed the item . This was an opps order as I meant to order steel cut oatmeal and got this instead . Happy it worked out this way cause would have never tried otherwise . This stuff is great ! It really volumes up after preparing as well . Less of an oatmeal type and more porridge . Easy peasy to prepare , I make a weeks worth in Tupperware and heat up what I need in morning with 1/2 cup milk with raisins dash of cinnamon or fresh fruit if I have . Fills the tummy nicely for several hours and reading the label ca n't believe something so yummy us soo good for you . I whole heartily recommend this product .
5 #### Great cereal , easy to make , great texture , baby loves it
5 #### Good stuff . Healthy , tasty , and best of all ... organic , which is the reason I bought it . I can get multi grain cereal at my local health food store but many times not organic . Easy to order on line and probably a little less expensive for the larger quantities . Lately I have been mixing it with a little Kaniwa , which my local Sprouts had on sale , and the combo is also good , and makes it 7 grain instead of 6 .
5 #### This is wonderful , filling cereal . As part of a plan to improve my diet I began eating cooked cereal for breakfast every morning . This is a big part of that . It is very tasty , and filling .
5 #### This is as easy to make as instant oatmeal , but much more nutritious and cost effective . It has a wholesome , nutty taste . I eat it almost every day for breakfast , since I can make it quickly and easily at work . I just pour some of this hot cereal and water in my bowl without actually measuring but still trying to following the proportions in the label ( 1:3 ) , and then I microwave it for 3 minutes . I usually add a little milk and top it with some fruit , like banana or raspberries . Sometimes right after cooking I stir in a little natural almond butter or peanut butter , which goes great with banana . Ingredients : organic whole grain wheat , organic whole grain rye , organic corn , organic whole grain oats , organic whole grain spelt , organic Whole Kamut ( r ) khorasan wheat grain , and organic flaxseed . Like all Bob 's Red Mill products I 've tried so far , I highly recommend this hot cereal !
5 #### I love Bob 's Red Mill , and their hot cereal is always delicious . I love this blend as it provides wonderful nutrients and acts as a great base for so many oatmeal combinations .
5 #### I am very fond of this particular hot cereal ( porridge ) . I usually cook in vanilla almond or soy milk for extra nutrition . Cooked in a double boiler , I can start it and do other things for 20 - 30 minutes before dishing up a satisfying breakfast for my family . If there is a bit left over , I add it to my pancake or waffle batter the next day . Yum !
4 #### Overall a nice different hot cereal great if you make it with unsweetened cocoa powder and add your preferred sweetener
5 #### Very good vanilla extract and organic too ! This comes in a close second to my homemade organic vanilla extract . Will keep a bottle in my cabinet , while waiting for mine to " develop " .
3 #### Okay so for the price , this is to be expected , after all , it 's organic . I was in a pinch for vanilla extract ( REAL Vanilla Extract ) and I bought here on Amazon . I know for the same price , this cost just as much at my local Whole Foods , but I bought here and was quite pleased with the product . It 's a real high quality extract and using it in my baked goods and some other dishes , I could tell the difference in taste . I use a lot of vanilla extract so for me the only real downside is / was they do n't make it bigger . Perhaps I will have to buy this in bulk .
5 #### Wow ! Simply the best tasting vanilla extract I have ever used ! I hope it continues to be marketed with this kind of quality . As long as it is , it will be the only liquid vanilla flavor I use .
5 #### We always use this vanilla . It is wonderful for homemade ice cream , cookies , and cakes !
5 #### 1 . Good quality vanilla extract 2 . You do n't need a lot to feel it
5 #### Very good vanilla extract , yes there is a difference in regular McCormick artificially flavored vanilla . This is actually an extract of real vanilla beans plus its organic to boot . Definately get this one if you want true vanilla flavor .
5 #### Has a great flavor . Have used it in several recipes and it works well .
3 #### Good quality however , just about every organic vanilla extract on the market has alcohol in it and a lot of alcohol because of an FDA regulation requiring 35 % alcohol in vanilla extract ( IMHO a useless stupid rule ) . I do n't like alcohol . I find that buying the Grade A vanilla pods ( which might take awhile if they come from Asia ) allows me to make about five times the amount of extract for the same amount of money . My home - made extract is far stronger than even the best and without alcohol . I use a lot of vanilla . This bottle is small , and overpriced but it is better quality than the others in the same category . Vanilla is anti - carcinogenic . Alcohol causes disease . Do you think the FDA has your best interests in mind ? Abby 's advice : get pods and make a glycerin or oil extract yourself .
5 #### Smells really good . I like the flavor . Cons * Does n't come in a bigger size - I really do n't understand why
4 #### I like glass bottles better . The brand Simply Organic uses non - alcoholic madagascar vanilla which I also prefer .
5 #### Switched over to the subscribe and save version . This is the flavoring I use for drained yogurt with fruit added : 1 cup of yogurt , drained ( leaves about a half cup ) cream powdered coconut milk 1/4 to 1/2 cup fruit sweetner of choice
5 #### If only this came in a large size . Love Organic products ! I am slowly switching all our kitchen purchases to organic and this has been a great vanilla at a reasonable price . The bottle is plastic and small but the product has been a winner . I could never go back to the early days of using imitation vanilla !
5 #### This is the best vanilla I have ever used .
5 #### Excellent quality vanilla , My family is enjoying it very much . Got here fast and perfect condition .
5 #### Very good and even better knowing it is organic . Like I said I will continue buying this product.i do a lot of cooking .
5 #### This bottle is a steal , at Whole Foods ( at least where I live ) a bottle half this size costs twice as much . Before I was also using imitation vanilla , it smells okay but you can smell the fillers . This bottle smells like fresh , pure vanilla . I used it in a lemon poppy seed cake and it was delicious , mild and aromatic ! My kitchen smelled WONDERFUL !
5 #### This was good stuff but I just went thru it too fast . So I bought my last really large bottle at BJ 's wholesale and it tastes the same and does the job .
4 #### Last night I bought a Luna Chocolate Peppermint Stick for dessert with my evening meal . The texture was somewhat like saw - cutting grains stuck together but the flavor was quite good , one of the better - tasting nutrition bars . Not bad at all . I guess the granular thingy indicates a lot of fiber , and I can stand that . My nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market had them on sale for a buck each . Good deal . Gary Peterson
5 #### They are my absolute favorites . I get them on auto delivery so I never run out . My 15 year old granddaughter loves them too .
5 #### The best Luna bar so far . They come as close to the girl scout cookies , Samoas . This bar is healthy and DELICIOUS ! These two adjectives are n't usually used together when describing a health bar . I slightly heat this bar up in the microwave ( at 10 seconds ) and drink a glass of milk with this bar .
4 #### Pretty standard fare for a Luna Bar , which is pretty much a good thing . Soy crisps laden with pretzel pieces , peanuts , peanut butter smears and peanut butter chips ; there is a peanut butter - y sort of candy coating on the bottom portion . If only there were dark chocolate chips or pieces tossed in the mix ... I guess I 'm just a chocoholic , but the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Luna - Bar - Chocolate - Dipped - Coconut-25 - 4 - Ounce-15 - Bars / dp / B00498HGG0 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Luna Bar Chocolate Dipped Coconut , 25.4 - Ounce , 15 - Bars</a>&nbsp;really raised the bar on Luna products for me . All in all , a pretty tasty treat !
5 #### I 'm an almond joy freak , so I was hoping this would be like those candy bars . It 's not- but it 's really good anyway . The chocolate is rich and delicious . The coconut flavor is much more subdued than in an almond joy ( or even in the coconut cookies I am familiar with)- but though it 's subdued , you CAN tast it . It 's just not like a macaroon- but there is coconut flavor . The bar has a nice texture- and I certainly love the way no one flavor overpowers the bar . This is one excellent snack bar if you can handle the calories 190 , and if you do n't have a problem with 11 g of sugar .
5 #### I do the order for a small grocery store . When I saw this flavor in the order guide , I ordered it without hesitation . Luna Bars always sell well , even though I personally am weary of Luna Bars with chocolate in them ; the chocolate usually tastes funky , waxy . Once it arrived , I tried one . Soooo good ! It 's hard to believe that this treat offers health benefits , it 's THAT good . It tastes like a macaroon . Heaven . It is now the top selling flavor at the store .
5 #### Of all of the Luna Bar flavors , the Chocolate Peppermint Stick is my favorite . It is very minty and easily chewable . You do n't have to worry about breaking a tooth when you try to eat it . The bar is dipped in peppermint on one side ; the overall chocolate and peppermint is very reminiscent of a peppermint patty . If I had not looked at the wrapper , I would be able to say this was meant to be a peppermint bar ( try doing that with other protein / meal replacement / nutrition bars that claim to be peanut butter flavored or brownie flavored and they taste nothing like their inspiration . ) There is also no vitamin taste . Overall , the bar is pretty filling and could hold you over between meals . As it has less than 200 calories , it can be classified as a snack . I like to eat one of these bars after dinner as a treat and also keep them in my office when I ca n't leave for lunch . In sum , if you like chocolate and peppermint , try this bar .
5 #### I like Luna bars , but because I tend to eat them mostly for breakfast , I usually stick more with the fruit - flavored bars ( I especially like their&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Luna - Nutrition - Bars - Blueberry - Bliss-1 - 69 - Ounce - Bars - Pack - of-15 / dp / B000GPLXN2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Luna Nutrition Bars , Blueberry Bliss , 1.69 - Ounce Bars ( Pack of 15)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Luna - Bars - Iced - Oatmeal - Raisin-1 - 69 - Ounce - Bars - Pack - of-15 / dp / B000H01QL0 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Luna Bars , Iced Oatmeal Raisin , 1.69 - Ounce Bars ( Pack of 15)</a > ) . In addition , I tend to avoid protein bars covered in chocolate , as I have found that the chocolate often tastes quite artificial . However , I received a free sample of this Chocolate Dipped Coconut bar , so I gave it a try . I am pleased to report that this bar was delicious ! The chocolate / coconut blend is quite reminiscent of the flavor of a Mounds chocolate bar and not artificial tasting at all -- rather , it was rich and chewy , with no unpleasant aftertaste . In addition , the nutrition profile of this bar is comparable to other Luna bars : 190 calories , 7 grams fat ( a bit high , but only 3.5 grams saturated , and no trans fats ) , 25 grams total carbs , including 3 grams fiber and only 11 grams of sugar , and 9 grams of protein . Furthermore , the bar is fortified with various vitamins and minerals , from 35 % of daily recommendation for Calcium to good amounts of most of the B vitamins . This is definitely a bar that I would purchase on my own -- highly recommended !

I stopped by my local Publix and checked to see if they have any in stock . They have most of the flavours here except for a few and some ( 6 ? ) pack boxes of certain flavours . They 're $ .79 each , not including tax of course . I bought quite a couple , I think 6 . I 'll try to dig up the wrappers and see which flavour , but the chocolate peppermint blew me away ! The others has a slight vitamin taste which does n't bother me , but I just love peppermint . It tastes fantastic , each bite gives you the sweet minty taste with a bit of chocolate taste . I could gobble mine down in a few seconds and it 's easy to chew which helps my teeth . Probably one of the best tasting out of the Luna and Cliff bars . I even like this peppermint better than the GeniSoy one . It did n't melt in my messenger bag which is a benefit , but I 'm thinking about keeping an ice pack just in case , but it 's nearing winter . The GeniSoy melted in the car somehow o. O
4 #### Luna Bars , Chocolate Peppermint Stick , 1.69 - Ounce Bars ( Pack of 15 ) are a good deal
1 #### I am amazed that all these so - called health foods will add artery - clogging " palm kernel oil " as an ingredient . Do n't buy anything with palm kernel oil , cocoa butter , and anything hydrogenated ! ! No matter how many " organic " things are added to it . For many years now , it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease . The World Health Organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases .
5 #### Excellent Organic Peanut Butter ! I agree with other reviewers , you should when FIRST OPEN JAR STIR IN CENTER SLOWLY , to let the oil on top seep down and mix properly . Then you 're good to go and enjoy Peanut butter & Jelly soft bread sandwiches . I 'm getting the non salt version , though only 80 mg of sodium in this type , unlike alot of commercial brands that have 100 mg or more .
1 #### The title of this review says it all . There is something seriously amiss with the thinking apparatus of anyone who will spend 23 $ for one jar of peanut butter . No ?
4 #### This product has a good taste , it is also fortunate that unlike other brands this seems to be the easiest to spread on toast after taking out of the fridge ( though it still is not as easy as it should be and does require patience )
5 #### I first tried this about 15 years ago , and I 've stocked it in my spice cabinet ever since ! I use this on everything from Eggs to Pasta to Pizza . There 's no salt in this stuff , just lots of Herbs , Spices , and Parmesan ! Great Stuff ! Be Careful though , it can be addictive !
5 #### I randomly bought this at a grocery store one day and absolutely LOVED it . I put this in all kinds of recipes ( even mac & cheese ) and it works miracles . It 's THE BEST ! I always use a lot of spices in my food , but this is the only one that I actually find myself craving at times . When I only had a couple teaspoons left I added it to my Parmesan shaker and it is heavenly that way as well .
5 #### It is not salty , like most seasoning blends . It adds just enough pizazz to anything . It works on pizza , pasta , toast , rice , salad , just about anything that you can think of . Let your imagination go wild ! This is a great product . :)
5 #### This makes a lot of food taste great - subs , deep fried mushrooms , pizza .
5 #### Adds great flavor to pizzas and pasta . Just shake it on . I have used this for years but now I ca n't find it local where I live . Glad I found it on Amazon .
5 #### We 've been using this for years ! The blend is unique and full of flavor . Most pizza seasonings we have bought tasted predominantly of oregano , but this one brings in layers of red pepper and Parmesan cheese without being too herbal . We use it on pizza , but we also use it on spaghetti squash , grilled veggies , etc . We do n't go crazy with it , a bottle lasts a long time . It 's almost impossible to find locally now , so it 's good to know that it 's available here .
5 #### I 've been looking for a pizza seasoning and read the reviews and decided to try it . I really is an added taste to any slice of pizza . Not sure what all it has in it but it is really good ! ! Next stop is adding it to pasta .
5 #### I have been using this for years ! Great on tortellini with just some olive oil . Adds great flavor to any pasta or garlic bread . A staple in my kitchen .
5 #### This is a must for anyone 's spice cabinet , but can not find it in my area . This is a very great product .
5 #### One of my favorite seasonings since it 's so versatile . Goes great with pizza and pasta , but it 's basically my default Italian seasoning .
2 #### I found this too hot . Too many hot pepper flakes .
1 #### Been using this one for over 8 years . Never lets your pizza flavor become dull ! Very good seasoning .. among the top ones in my opinion . Give it a try ... you wo n't be sorry ! UPDATE ; Do n't know what happened here , but this bottle was really bad ... I mean throw away your food bad . Maybe a fluke ..... or is this another great product gone by by ? Date was good on bottle .
5 #### I love this product . I use it with pasta and even eggs and pizza of course . Oh , yes , sometimes I sprinkle it over popcorn . It came quickly and in good shape . KayM ... 4.23.16
5 #### Absolutely delicious . I use it on pizza all the time . I have n't tried it on pasta but I 'm sure it 's delicious on that too .
5 #### Love this for use on our pizza crust . Everytime we make pizza , we sprinkle this on our pizza crust . It tastes amazing and adds that " special something " to our meals . Also throw it in pasta sauce !
5 #### We love this seasoning so much I use it on frozen pizza too not just homemade .
4 #### Good stuff . Essentially , it is just parmesan cheese with some spices , so you are really paying alot for the brand name . I would not repurchase .
4 #### really good spice like it adds flavor to pizza and pasta
5 #### My husband loves pizza and loves this stuff too . So glad we found it and that amazon carries it
3 #### I was really looking for something with more punch to it . Even though I have used it several times on pizza , I can only barely paste the spice . It seems to work better when used after your food is cooked .
5 #### i use the red version(sweet and spicy ) for regular pizza 's . but this one i use on white sauce pizza 's and also i use it in butter\olive oil garlic sauces for pasta . it gives a nice zing to the oil and it tastes very good :-) its mostly garlic , herbs and parmasean cheese :-)
5 #### I 've used this for years but my local grocery stores do n't carry it anymore . It 's great with any pasta dish & I put it on all pizzas ! I use this for all dishes that call for Italian seasoning . It works great for a variety of casseroles too .
5 #### As always the " Chef " does n't disappoint , this is SO good ! very flavorful . Would recommend to anyone who would like to try and alternative seasoning that does n't have all that sodium .
5 #### This pizza and pasta seasoning is just what it says it is , MAGIC ! It provides the right blend of spices for your Italian cooking and it is great when mixed into pizza or pasta sauce , meatballs , or any dish . The wonderful thing about it is that it adds no calories , no fat , no salt , no carbohydrates and no MSG to your food . It also contains no preservatives . It is also very good for soups , salads , egg dishes and almost any casserole . There are some very good recipes on his web site and I like the breakfast pizza , it is pretty good . We love this product and as I write this review I see that we are almost out of it so it is time to buy some more ! I recommend it to you .
5 #### If you want a full flavor , real - deal Olive Oil , this is it . I stir it in practically everything . It adds an entirely new and wonderful flavor to spaghetti sauce . I brush it on garlic bread . Uses are endless . Great stuff .
5 #### I love this oil ! I love garlic and adding this oil with infused flavor to most dishes really adds to the taste . For example , I make crostinis and instead of regular olive oil , I use Annie 's and it makes them sing with flavor . I even use it for the oil when I 'm roasting garlic .
4 #### I am always trying to increase the flavor of food without the taste of spices being overpowering . This oil is a good option for cooking foods , especially when stir frying meat and veggies . The taste is strong enough without being STRONG .
5 #### I had so much fun with Wilton 's green Color Mist for a green alien party ! Remember , it 's a MIST , which means it sprays LIGHTLY , so keep that in mind when you want to add just a tint of color to your party foods . For example , it 's a great mist for popcorn . I sprayed some of the Kettle Korn green and added regular colored Kettle Korn for a party mix , then added green M&Ms for a sweet and savory mix . The kids loved it . You could use Color Mist to spray marshmallows , white bread , potato chips and any other lightly colored foods to keep with your party theme colors . I 'll use the pink color mist for my next party : a pink pirate party , mateys !
3 #### I like this WHEN it works . There s inconsistency with the spray which is a major pain when working on a cake or wanting uniformity . Sometimes there is no color , sometimes speckles , sometimes its perfect .
5 #### I am writing this based on my use with FROSTING a cakesprayed this on a red velvet cake since cream cheese frosting has a bit of a yellow cast on it and this worked great and gave my cake a nice pearly look to it without compromising taste . I sprayed about 8 inches away from the cake and sprayed evenly on the topreally changed the top coat color nicely and evenly . Cake tasted fine . I love that this product does n't taint the entire frosting as regular gel or food coloring would do . It is messy so be prepared to cover surface underlying baked good to be sprayed . No need to over spraygave one quick even coat and a few minutes later another one and it gave me the results I wanted . Would purchase again without a question ! I purchased the Pearl Color mist here on Amazon and personally picked up the Black and Pink color mist at a local craft store and they all gave me great results and the attached pictures show all 3 colors on my cakes . Excellent way of capturing an ombr&eacute;/gradient look . The black mist was used on top of chocolate cake and hard t tell on photo but gave it a stunning metallic dark gray look .... received many compliments !
5 #### This leaves such a fun gold color on food . Easy to apply and did n't rub off
3 #### I ca n't decide if I like this or not . Pros - it is gold , and shiny . Cons - it 's hard to aim and get just the right amount if you 're going freehand . I liked it sprayed on fondant that I then cut with cookie cutters to ice Christmas cookies . I did n't like it as much sprayed directly on frosting on a cake - too sloppy .
5 #### Sprayed white fondant with this to make it look like a pot . Used a few coats to achieve real silver but it was great .
2 #### Pretty disappointing . It did n't work well , the color was very pale and even with multiple layers did n't cover or make my food look gold .
5 #### Loved it ... made the waves on the " ocean cake " perfect ... not to mention so easy
5 #### I bought this to spray my horseshoe sugar cookies . Very happy with the result because this is not a shiny or vibrant color . It is mat and it 's perfect to recreate a metal look . Will buy again .
5 #### I bought silver and gold colors to spray my horseshoe sugar cookies . This is not a shiny bright gold or silver , it is mat in color . That makes it perfect for my horseshoe cookies .
3 #### It takes a little practice to get this right but when you do , it 's great .
5 #### LOVE this product ! I used it on a three layer rosette cake . Spraying a lot of silver at the bottom and slowly easing up toward the top for an ombre effect . The customer absolutely LOVED it and I had a ton of compliments on it as well . It truly gives a metallic effect without the odd taste !
4 #### Really cool spray . Be sure that whatever your spraying is room temperature and not right out of the fridge otherwise the spray well kind a look dewy . Use the spray on something that 's already yellow for a better look . You need several coats and the can is n't very big . Yellow looks awesome for my husbands Notre Dame cupcakes ! Update : I have also tried red and it works great ! I got the frosting basically pink in color with food dye and then I sprayed over the top with red . Did n't take a lot but man it was everywhere so do it outside or over a sink if possible . Update # 2 : I have now used black and It turned out awesome for my galaxy cupcakes ! Started with blue frosting , Sprayed a little bit of black , then painted on some luster dust !
2 #### This Color Mist was disappointing -- it just looked like an odd purple , not black . Despite repeat applications , the color never appeared black . The extra sprays made it seep under the cake stencil , so it just became a purple mess . I was able to scrape away the extra purple / blackish color and repair the whipped cream frosting , but I regret trying this product -- so I caution you if you need a dark color . When I was ordering for cake - decorating , the Color Mist had seemed likely to be the easiest way to decorate the cake top with a stencil . As it turns out , my back - up plan -- colored sugar -- actually worked much better . I can not recommend this Color Mist , but CK 's sanding sugar ( if you want a very fine sugar with color ) and crystal sugar ( which is larger than granulated sugar ) are excellent decorating products . I gave this Color Mist 2 stars only because the sprayer worked .
5 #### This spray is amazing . Previously I just used a light dusting of silver to give this look , but it was n't the same . I recently used this on cream cheese mints and they looked AMAZING . No added taste or stickiness .
3 #### It does n't look gold at all . It turned my oreos muddy . But my students loved the " golden " oreos .
5 #### am waiting for this saturday to do cupcake and change the colors of the cupcake on top
5 #### once i do my cupcake i change the color on top it going to look perfect and beautiful
5 #### I used this on Christmas cookies and everyone raved about how nice it made them look .
5 #### great color coverage . I used it to paint on white chocolate mold . It comes out in a nice even spray and the color is a matte gold for the surface I painted . We did not eat the white chocolate so I can not say if it affected the flavor or not . The head in the photo is what we painted with the gold spray . We used 1.5 cans of the spray because we had to spray it with a few coats to get full coverage and to prevent any drip marks . It is very quick drying and we only waited a few minutes between coats .
4 #### I sprayed this on Oreos to make them look like gold coins to take to a St Patty 's Day Party ( minimal effort , maximum cute ) . The effect was great but it did lend a little off - taste to the cookies , like a sugar alcohol flavor . Also , I was concerned that this would make my cookies soggy but I left them to dry for about an hour and they texture was fine .
1 #### It smelled like rust - oleum . I had to spray the cake in the garage . After all that messing around the paint did not stick to the side of the cake . Gross
4 #### I had so much fun covering my cake pops with this . You must be careful not to over spray .
5 #### I used it on Christmas cookies , and everyone was full of praise
3 #### Not as shiny and chrome as I was hoping . It also burns your gums like 190 proof alcohol ( I suspect that is what is in it ) . That said it worked well for Halloween . For all you warboys out there , you will be disappointed by my other Halloween results . I had the trick - or - treaters vote for Immortan Joe or Lord Humungus by picking candy from one bowl or another , Immortan Joe lost very badly . All hail Lord Humungus ! Lord Humungus 2016 : Just walk away ! Now we just have to wait until Xmas to put on our leather pants and chest harnesses and go Christmas caroling . We 'll will sing songs like " We witness a merry Christmas all shiny and chrome " , " War rigs We Have Heard on High " and " Shiny night chrome night "
3 #### Product had a funny smell and taste . Very fast shipping !
4 #### I bought this for a project : pill identification . I take multiple medications , and 9 of them are small , round , white ones . I put them in those containers designed for a weekly dispensing . Well , I would n't know which pill was which , so I thought of these sprays , where I can color each with it 's own identifying color would be a big help -- and you know , I was right . Now , each pill gets it 's own color , and I can easily identify if any are missing in the daily ' cup ' . PRO : ease of use , price , color selection CON : small cans = small quantity i each can

5 #### Used this for a War Boy costume in a bike ride . Blasted the whole can up my face and did not die . I therefore recommend this product
5 #### Perfect for applying before leaping from war rigs onto pursuing vehicles and just about any situation that requires you to say your prayers beforehand . Retains its shininess , even in toxic sand storms . If you 've got ta go , make sure you go shiny and chrome !
5 #### Accidentally whiffed this and visions of Valhalla flooded my brain .... oh what a LOVELY DAY ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### beautiful easy to use for large quantities of treats
4 #### I have to admit , I witnessed the glory of this spray and it allowed me to enter Valhalla . Unfortunately , it just made my blood bag really sick and now I have to walk around Valhalla dragging him everywhere . What a day ... what a crappy day . UPDATE : This cost $ 15 on here but you buy it for half this price at Gas Town or the Bullet Farm . WITNESS THE SAVINGS BROTHERS
1 #### The guys I hang out with like to spray this into their faces , then veer into the oncoming path of my War Machine in some misguided attempt to find Valhalla . You wanna go to Valhalla , boys ? No spray necessary ; I 'll send you there myself .
5 #### " On this lovely day , me and my war boys are coming to reclaim Valhalla ! I live , I die . I LIVE AGAIN ! " -- Hillary Clinton
5 #### Used to decorate cookies , the kids loved them . They did not complain of any funny scents or taste . The adults thought they were a nice addition to the party and thought I bought the cookies with the glitter .
4 #### Works well but do not use at close range or it will have a paint - like after taste .
5 #### Amazing ! ! I made a crystal ball cake and sprayed it on for a " glassy " finish and it worked beautifully ! No weird taste that I could detect and sprayed on smoothly . I want to try some other colors now !
5 #### I love this product ! I 've went through several cans . It 's great for adding shimmer to cookies , coloring pearls , painting small details on cakes . It does n't go as far as I would like in terms of how much use you get out of can , but it 's still a great product .
5 #### I have a puppy and use this product to spray on the brown spots she leaves on my lawn . The color is perfect and I do n't have to worry about environmental or health issues because it is edible ! My lawn looks great .
5 #### This stuff covered very well . I did not eat it , so I can not say anything about that , but if you want a metallic looking gold on whatever it is you 're making , this product really works .
5 #### Great stuff ... might I recommend using a small mask with this product as it will go into the nose and mouth when breathing while you are spraying it .
1 #### The " Violet " is not a true violet , but instead , more of a navy blue . Besides that fact , it is NOT good for use on cookies . Unlike airbrushing , the spray goes everywhere and has a horrible , chemically smell and taste . I had high hopes for this product , being the Wilton brand , but unfortunately I can not recommend this at all .
5 #### I used this on cookies which i iced with white royal icing . This gave the cookies a special pearly glow ... not cheap , but it does look lovely .
5 #### they are so fun to use,,,,they make the cupcakes look soooo cute and it is easier to use than regular frosting ... just use white frosting then pray it on and there is no after taste at all ...
5 #### they are so fun to use,,,,they make the cupcakes look soooo cute and it is easier to use than regular frosting ... just use white frosting then pray it on and there is no after taste at all ...
5 #### loved the product , worked perfect for a kids birthday party with cars . Shipped in plenty of time , good quality , excellent
5 #### These colors rang very true , as Wilton colors always do . I have found that the easiest way to avoid using the whole container of black on one batch of frosting is to make chocolate frosting and then tint black .
3 #### I have n't used the black yet . I was hoping for something a little less cheap - orange - sherbet and a little more expensive - tangerine .
5 #### Nice these colors are available year round , used the orange for a Harley Davidson cake . Came very quickly and perfect condition , very happy with transaction and product .
1 #### TERRIBLE ! This changed the taste of the icing . We had to toss the icing and make over . Would NOT recommend . Very disappointed .
4 #### These arrived quickly and in good condition . I was using the violet to color sugar for a Lavender sugar scrub . I found these to be a pain to et the color out of . I used a toothpick as shown and it finally worked . It took a few jabs of violet to get a decent lavender color . They look smaller than 1/2 ounce .
4 #### It took much more gel to color the frosting than I thought it would . The colors are quite pastel and it takes some time to get them more vibrant . Its not a big deal , just an observation .
5 #### These are the best colors for coloring frosting . I 've used Wilton brand for years and always get consistent colors . A little goes a long way ( unless your want red , then you need a lot of dye ) .
5 #### Not used yet but I know that the product is good . Tried it before
5 #### Nice variety of colors to create the exact color you are needing .
5 #### Vibrant colors ! Enjoy the gel -- does not affect consistency or taste . Easy to use . Will purchase again .
5 #### Worked great for my royal icing mix to make Christmas sugar cookies . My skills as a decorator are lacking though . LOL
5 #### tis the season for baking . The colors are bright and very pretty .
5 #### I have to admit that I bought this for Christmas and have not used it yet but since it is from Wilton I gave it 5 stars . It is supposed to be easier to use and use less because it is not a liquid . So will see .
5 #### These work great ! ! We used for colored pancakes . Colors looked awesome .
5 #### These gel colors are amazing bright . I have used them in desserts while my daughter uses them in DIY experiments . Great as always , Wilton !
5 #### Worked great . I was n't sure I would need it so had it as back up . Thought the icing could use a little pink tint . Instructions said use a toothpick . Thought more would be better . NOT . It turned into neon pink with 1/4 tsp . A little truly goes a long way . Next batch used the toothpick method and lovely shade light pink .
5 #### Good quality colors . Spreads evenly and is not clumpy
5 #### Great selection of colors . They all seemed very vibrant and you only need to use a small amount for intense color .
5 #### Good quality that produces bright colors . Consistency is like a gel not liquid .
3 #### not bad , I made a big mess though , was getting it out with toothpicks
5 #### Used for rock candy and the colors were very vibrant .
5 #### Just a tiny drop of this food dye goes a LONG way . I add it to my cakes and cookies by dipping the tip of a toothpick in the dye and then stirring the toothpick in the dough . That 's it . They come in individually sealed little screw top jars . Do n't get the dye on your fingers because they stain . They are made in the USA .
5 #### I use this for coloring macarons , and the quality is great . You only need a few drops to give rich color to a big bowl of batter , and the gel consistency ( compared to liquid food coloring ) is crucial for making macaron batter that does not become to runny . I 've bought the same pack multiple times already and do n't plan on changing products anytime soon !
2 #### Why would n't you put food coloring in a little jar with a top that you can pour out by drops ? This top screws off and it 's so hard to get just a small amount in a tiny 1/8th tsp . When one is coloring frosting , it is done gradually and this is too easy to end up dumping . Wilton should know better !
5 #### Vibrant colors . Very pleased with this purchase . You only need a tiny amount to jazz the place up ! Be careful not to overdo it !
3 #### Super thin and takes a TON to make something white . BUT it gets the job done .
5 #### Worked great for making candy apples for my daughters birthday party .
5 #### Used these to make icing for sugar cookies . Did n't take a whole lot of tint to make beautiful cookies . NExt up , rainbow layered cake .
4 #### I used to color my icing and the colors are bright and fun !
4 #### This seemed to brighten the whiteness of the buttercream which had a slight tint from the butter . No additional taste , true buttercream flavor not affected . Overall , good product
2 #### Used this in a batch of icing and " thought " it would turn my icing white as is stated on the bottle , but it did n't . I added more , little by little hoping to get more of a white icing and it did n't happen . I will admit , I did n't want to dump the entire bottle in the icing and I was only making enough icing to frost 12 cupcakes ( not a lot ) . I did shake the bottle well prior to use and beat it well to mix it well into the icing . I finally gave up and went with a different company and made different colors for my icing since I could not achieve the white color I was looking for . I would not recommend this company for coloring and they do have a lot of additives in their products . I would also not recommend this product because it could not achieve what was stated on the bottle - color my icing ( white in my case ) .
5 #### I baked a cake for my son 's third birthday with a buttercream frosting , which , as we all know , often comes out yellow thanks to the butter . I put several drops into my double batch of frosting , and it did noticeably whiten . I will say the my frosting was n't a perfect white , but I did n't need it to be , and I wanted people to know I 'd made it from scratch , so this at the very least brightened the frosting beautifully and did not affect taste or smell .
5 #### This was my first foray into gel food coloring . I use it to dye cookies , cake batter , and icings , which it works wonderfully for . You only need a tiny bit to get bold color ( which does n't fade in the oven ) and it does n't change the taste or texture of your baked goods . I would highly recommend this , especially if you 've never used gel before . The difference is amazing . Be careful with it , though-- it 's also quite good at coloring hands and counter tops !
3 #### The food coloring works fine . Colors are great . I just wish they came in a squeeze bottle . Not only would it be less messy , but it 'd be easier to measure how much color you 're adding in case you want to recreate it .
3 #### Use for icing like you 're supposed to , not other things . This is n't a drop , it 's a gel with a bit of a sour taste , somewhat messy unless I was doing it wrong ( possible ! ) . I will buy the drops next time .
5 #### The problem is not in the product . It 's the light in your home . Colors appear differently in artificial light than they do in natural light ( daylight ) . This happens to everything , not just food . It happens to clothing and even makeup . Purple colors are most affected by this . What looks like a pretty purple outside is going to look black inside the house . Beware if you have rose colored bulbs in your bathroom . Your makeup is going to look like you are a streetwalker . ( Get some daylight bulbs , " warm " is more yellow or lightbulby , " cool " is more blue - whitish or sunlighty ) . Thanks for reading this , I hope it helps .
5 #### Great product for coloring granulated sugar ! Put 1/2 cup regular white granulated sugar in a ziplock baggy then add a few drops color ( using toothpick ) reseal the bag getting all the air out first , and squish by hand til color is blended ! Saves a lot of money from buying colored sugar ! ! An easy kid friendly project too ! ! Great color intensity and no drying time needed ! !
5 #### I bought this to use as white paint to paint on fondant for cakes . It worked perfectly ! A little goes a really long way . I do n't see running out anytime soon .
5 #### I love using this to whiten icing ...... A must have for decorators ...
5 #### i found wilton colors very ssheap special for me that a love make cakes
5 #### Great selection of colors for cake decorating . The bottles will go a long way . I am happy with this purchase .
5 #### These are small tubs but you do n't need much because the gel is so think . One dip of a small spoon and you have enough to color an entire cake ! Easy to store because of there small size and no bad after taste .
4 #### I love these colors . I use them for my fondant . The directions say to use a toothpick to color your icing / fondant . I tried that initially but because I always want such deep colors it took forever to do . So I started using a brush get more gel on the fondant then knead it in . I got deeper colors fast . I suppose if you are looking for pastel you should use the toothpick method . These are gel so they do n't spill . No mess -- and I can be messy .
1 #### Another terrible quality product from Wilton - why do they have a monopoly in the USA on cake decorating stuff ? There are WAY better products out there . My mom used these colours to make my birthday cake . I went to have another piece 3 days later and the lovely lilac color had turned into a murky blue . The colours do n't just change into another attractive colour they go into horrible dingy colours - supposing I had sold a wedding cake and it had changed colour before the day ? ! Do n't risk it and do n't waste your money on this terrible product . Do n't buy their horrible stiff dry fondant either .
5 #### Love this product , never will use anything else to color icing again . It does n't thin the icing and the colors you can create with these basics are the best !
5 #### Nesco jerky seasoning is AMAZING . I mix the seasoning and cure in about 2 tablespoons of seasoning and then add to my meat . The resulting jerky is AMAZING .
5 #### We make Venison jerk all year round , good source of protein on ATV trips !
5 #### We all love this spice seasoning . Not too spicy , but just enough . Arrived quickly .
5 #### This brand has the most variety of flavors i have used yet . i use a jerky gun made by the same company . There is a flavor for everyone in the family . I prefer mine hot n spicy but the maple bacon is to die for . i would recommend this brand for any jerky lover <3
1 #### did not get what is pictured and the box was squashed , I was very disappointed because it was a gift to someone .
5 #### My husband used it with his deer meat . It had a great taste and worked well . He 'd buy it again .
5 #### Nesco jerky 3 pack has something for everyone . I have used this mix to make jerky with 93 % ground beef . Higher quality beef better the result . The original and teriyaki are very good , just the right amount of heat and sweetness . The Hot and Spicy mix packs a nice hot punch with a mild sweetness . I prepare jerky in a dehydrator and finish with cold smoking for 2 hours . Smoking is what take good jerky and makes it extraordinary . I prefer this to the original mix from A.C. Legg .
3 #### Fair . Save some $ $ $ and make your own with a soy/ BBQ sauce base and liquid smoke varieties . There are a number of recipes online and ultimate cost is a lot less .
5 #### I love this stuff . It 's great on its own or a good starting point to add additional spices . I like to grind up some rosemary , fennel , garlic powder , cayenne , chipotle or cumin !
3 #### way TOO Strong flavoring use more meat then what the recipe says then it is good
5 #### This is excellent . Each pack makes two pounds of beef jerky . I also added smoked paprika , garlic powder and liquid smoke . Tastes great . Will buy again .
3 #### TL : DR First off , why 3 stars and not 5 ... 1 : Too much " Original " Flavoring , 3 packs for 6 # of meat which makes up 25 % of the flavorings . 2ndly : The teriyaki taste absolutely nothing like REAL teriyaki or even close to " Teriyaki " . Nothing wrong so to speak with the Original flavoring , it just too plain for me , like plain salted chips . Some of you enjoy that , and its your prerogative so go for it and enjoy ! Ill be trying the other flavors soon and will comment on them when I do . I use 2 # of 20/80 ground beef per batch using the Plain Nesco Jerky gun included in my set , 3 clicks gives you nice 5 " strips which shrink down to 4ish . With my Nesco Snack master express set at 160 * , 2 # of burger strips takes roughly 4 hours at 70 * Ambient room temperature which yields me 50 strips totaling 1 # dry . Math : 2 # burger at $ 1.99/ # Seasoning for 2 # $ 1.97 Electricity > $ 1 for 4 hours That comes out to less than $ 7 for 1 # of prepared Jerky . Now , stores selling the same thing would cost you roughly $ 3 for 5 strips/ 1.6 oz , so $ 30 worth of jerky per batch . For people that love jerky , are on a high Protein / Keto diet , hike , Prep , etc ... you ca n't go wrong with these mixes , they pay for themselves with the 1st batch .
5 #### I love this jerky seasoning the best thank you yummo
4 #### Good seasoning . Pretty generic , but a great starting point .
5 #### Love it . Use it all the time for hamburger jerky . Taste great . I will keep buying this one .
5 #### Great jerky spices . With the variety pack , you ca n't go wrong when you try 'em all to see what you like best . It also includes the curing powder for turn key jerky : Just mix with meat and dry ! I make double or triple batches and blend different packets to get jerky flavors in between . Fair price too . I 'll be buying more Nesco .
5 #### I really like this stuff , used it twice for jerky already ..
5 #### Love this sweet hardwood flavor ! Always comes out great .
3 #### The ratio of salt has changed from the older version . It 's too salty . I had some of the older version cure packages . There was 2 teaspoons of ground salt in the package . The new package had 2 teaspoons of Kosher salt . No wonder it was too salty ! The spice mix is excellent , just do n't add all the cure salt package .
4 #### fantastic flavors ! ! Loved them all ! ! I just wish it had a far lower sodium content , which is a concern for many , like myself , watching their blood pressure and other health concerns ..
4 #### This works well , I had to add some heat .
5 #### I had 3#s of burger I made from lean T - bone steaks . I used my meat grinder to grind it . I pressed out patties with a 16 oz bean can so they would all be the same size . " pinch off a small bit of mixed burger & roll it in your palms to make nice neat meat balls " I kept grease wiped off the patties as they dried to a leathery state . & off the dehydrator top . They got done in about 6 hours . This time will vary with different machines . I tried one while it was still hot . It was fantastic . :) So I ate 5 more . They were all really easy to chew yet chewy . Much better than store bought . & cheaper . :)
4 #### The jerky made with the basic recipe is OK . I would suggest adding some additional spices if you would like more flavor . This is basic jerky made with a mixture of beef and pork .
5 #### These seasonings are great . I think they 're a bit pricey . The reason I make jerky is to save on costs . Paying an extra $ 1 / lb just for seasoning is n't my thing . I wo n't by these again and will just mix up my own seasoning .
5 #### I 'm sure all of you have your own way of doing this . Myself , I prefer to get the leanest meat possible . Have used London broils , trimmed out all the tendons and fat and I do a double grind in my meat grinder . It 's difficult to season the meat thoroughly and evenly , but the 2nd grind eliminates that for me . After the 1st grind , season the meat evenly , 1 lb at a time . Then run thru the grinder a 2nd time , which really mixes it up . Using the jerky gun , it spits out evenly the double ground meat and it dries very well . I 've never noticed one piece of meat having more flavor than another , thus eliminating under / over cures . I hope this helps anyone trying for the 1st time . Seasoning nonground strips of meat and drying is doable , but the meat will always be tough to chew and hard on ones teeth , perhaps even damaging is you pull too hard to tear off a piece to chew . Being skeptic , I used the jerky gun and much to my surprise the strips are very tender ( thanks to the grinding ) and safe for all ages and no damage to your teeth , false or real . Once dried to your satisfaction , I bag mine in my foodsaver to keep out moisture and extend it 's shelf life .
5 #### Best jerky I 've ever had AND way cheaper than the store brands .
5 #### With a little futzing around , you can make your own Burger - Jerky . It tastes great and goes fast . Fun , and since it is from chopped / ground beef , it is easy to eat . A+ from me .
5 #### This is my 3rd box . Love the flavor . Marinate meat for a full 24 hours before dehydrating . You 'll be glad you did .
5 #### Very good Jerky . I made my first batch using eye of round and my nesco fd-1040 dehydrator . Jerky went fast . Nesco original seasoning and cure worked well . I cured my eye of round , sliced 1/4 inch thick , for 3 hours . Dehydrated for 6 hours at 160 degrees to perfect leathery texture .
4 #### Tasty seasoning -- a little spicy for me , but just right for my husband ! Good product !
5 #### Best jerky making product for easy ground beef beef jerky
2 #### ugh . taste is a personal thing , but too salty and just off somehow .
5 #### Original for the win ! Made 8 lbs of ground beef jerky the other day and shared it at work , everyone was floored that I made it ! Great recipe , easy to make , just do n't let it get too dry on the dehydrator . Would buy this again , and have already recommended it to others . Also works well if you want to spice things up yourself . I 've added a few Tbs of black pepper to a couple lbs that worked out well , and even added habanero to some . Probably would n't work so well if you added your own teriyaki , but hey , maybe I 'd be wrong .
5 #### This is great jerky seasoning and curing kit I tried the spicy first . and Yes it is . Mixes easily into meat .
5 #### This stuff is great ! Follow the directions on the pack and pop your meat in the dehydrator , smoker , whatever . This is the best tasting pre - made mix i 've used .
5 #### I still like homemade jerky best , but this jerky seasoning is probably the next best thing and , if you 're willing to do the work , a heck of a lot cheaper than buying jerky from stores .
5 #### my husband loves this type I got it for him and he says way better then store bought so we will be coming back for more because he really loves it and he is a very picky guy :) shipping was fast and packaging was amazing even our cats think the box was amazing my order came in lmaoo
5 #### I have been making beef jerky for about 20 years and this is the only product I will purchase . Everyone says that my beef jerky is better than any other jerky they have tasted ( I do add other ingredients to my marinate ) . I would never consider purchasing another product . Every year I make beef , and sometimes venison , jerky for gifts and everyone looks forward to it . They immediately rip open the packages and start eating it up !
5 #### Great , have used in the past , my families favorite !
5 #### I love the way these make my Jerky taste . This flavor the Sweet Hardwood is my fav . I jerky usually venison and turkey and bother turn out so good . I just add black and cayenne pepper to raise or lower heat value . They are a huge hit with friends . The sweet hardwood is just that , nice subtle sweet and smokey taste . Another think i will do if i want more smokiness is to add a few drops of liquid smoke . I have yet to make a batch of bad jerky with these seasoning .
5 #### Best flavor , only thing I use for my venison .
5 #### I bought this to use with sliced beef ( rather than the ground jerky version ) and so far have only used the terriyaki flavor . It is very tasty and even better than store bought jerky . I ca n't wait to use the other flavors . I will definitely buying again .
5 #### Very good flavor , and a bargain for the price .
5 #### This is the best jerky spice we have found . However , if you are allergic to monosodium glutamate do not buy this .
5 #### Honestly , the Sweet Hardwood flavor is absolutely delicious when used with deer .
4 #### Have not used yet but i am sure it will work out just fine .
5 #### Great variety pack of seasoning to try out when making jerky ! I like the original and teriyaki best . Comes with the salt to cure it too . Nice set w nice variety from a company that I trust .
5 #### This is my go - to jerky seasoning for my ground beef jerky . I 've got a complete Nesco dehydrating system and this was the very first seasoning I ever tried . It 's changed it 's packaging over the years , but it 's always the same high quality flavorful taste we 've come to expect . With the latest change to packaging , the cure and the seasoning are in two separate plastic pouches joined in the middle . This is such a huge improvement over the old separate , foil - lined paper pouches . With this packaging now the seasoning does n't clump and form blocks that need a spice grinder to break apart . So much easier . The taste is amazing . Everyone who 's ever tried my jerky says they like it when they taste it at first but then each of them has come up to me later and told me again how incredible it was . This stuff literally makes you crave more . It 's evil in the best kind of way . I 've probably made a couple hundred pounds of jerky over the years and this has made up more than half of it . I 'll continue to buy it and win people over . You really ca n't go wrong with the Original !
2 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Nesco - BJ-6 - Jerky - Spice - Works - Original - Flavor-6 - pack / dp / B0000CFPI2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Nesco BJ-6 Jerky Spice Works , Original Flavor , 6 pack</a > Nesco Original jerky marinade is superior to Nesco 's Teriyaki jerky marinade . The Original is bolder , has more flavor , and the hint of authentic smokey flavor and is just right , something that 's missing in Nesco 's Teriyaki offering . Also , I would advise using only half the cure packet or your jerky will come out way too salty .
5 #### Just finished another batch of Jerky using this Nesco product . I made some into Hamburger Jerky and some with sliced mean . Love them both . I would highly recommend this product for making Jerky that everyone loves .
3 #### Sweet hardword is ok . Not sure I really like a sweet jerky .
4 #### Great starter flavors for beginners . Just remember to only use the salt right before dehydrating .
5 #### I bought the sampler kit and the original is the only one that I really enjoyed . It is so good it is hard to describe . I use this for ground beef jerky and 10lbs of jerky is gone in 2 days with this where as with the other flavors it lasts about 3 days .
5 #### I used one package so far , the original seasoning . Soaked the beef overnight in the fridge then dehydrated the pieces . Got raves about it . Was n't too ' hot ' . I do n't care for hot type flavors so it was just right . There is a package that looks like it would be way to hot for me , so that one will get donated ... LOL . Makes mixing up flavors on my own a lot easier and a lot more predictable . Highly recommend .
5 #### Coworkes and guests LOVE this particular seasoning with the ground turkey in the dehydrator . Nesco does a great job of season and curing agent balance . Not to saltyand never lacking flavor .
5 #### Really good tasting flavors , I have n't even used all of them yet . For the best results marinate the hamburger over night .
2 #### The spicy flavor has a lot to be desired , yes it was somewhat spicy but the good taste was missing and was it ever salty ? They need to go easy on the sodium , a lot of my friends thought . The same !
3 #### It tastes too similar to the original flavor . either this should be called " orginal " or the original should be called " cracked pepper and garlic " Its not bad , just not what i wanted .
5 #### We love this flavor ! I was introduced to this brand when I bought the jerky gun . It had 5 packs in with it . A simple process that gives plenty of flavor ! A must have choice for all jerky makers !
5 #### This is my favorite flavor and is what everyone is used to . Have tried other brands when I could not find this in the store and regret it . It is a mild flavor and is good to use when making jerky or sticks . All NESCO flavors are great , as family likes the Teriyaki flavor . For best results would recommend letting set overnight after mixing , covering with plastic wrap in refrigerator . Would also recommend using beef at least 85 % or less . It will come out dry , if you do n't . Using the NESCO dehydrator , it runs around 165 degrees . Rotate the trays as the lower trays dry faster , and turn the jerky as it dries . The round NESCO dehydrator is not efficient at making best use of tray space when making straight lengths of jerky , but they now make a new square model , recently purchased , and has adjustable temperatures . Added a small amount of water , makes it mix easier .
5 #### This is my , and my wife 's , favorite flavor . Each pack works for one pound of raw ground beef . The garlic is noticable without being overpowering , and the pepper adds a nice touch . You should know how easy it is to use , just mix the dry ingredients with the ground beef , add the salt packet ( we use about 2/3 of the salt ) , put the meat mixture in the jerky gun , press and dehydrate .
5 #### Absolutely the best & easiest way to make jerky ! !
5 #### With it . And its great not to salty just right .
3 #### Nesco Teriyaki Jerky Spice came highly recommended , bu is far from the flavor of Jack Links teriyaki packaged jerky that I love . Is not as sweet or tasty as Jacks . Maybe extra brown sugar and soy sauce added may help . Will prob go for the peppered next time . And this is TOOOOO expensive to not be perfect .
3 #### Very convenient , good flavor . A little strong so I do n't always use the whole flavoring packet . And full of MSG , so not something to use for everyday jerky unless you do n't care about that .
5 #### This is the best non spicy jerly mix we have tried . We used it on deer meat .
5 #### A must if you like preparing your own home made beef jerky in your Nesco dehydrator . Buy lean ground beef like 93 % lean or grind your own if you own a meat grinder , mix with these ingredients and use the jerky gun with the wide nozzle that will produce nice ribbons of beef . You are in for some great jerky in no time . 3 pounds of ground beef will yield about 1 - 1/3 pounds of dried jerky in about 6 hours in the dehydrator at 160 degrees with one flip of the beef ribbons half way through the dehydrator sequence .
5 #### Perfect for making jerky . Use this stuff all the time .
5 #### Great product , quite tasty . If you 're going to be eating your beef jerky within a week , you can avoid using all the cure and sub in salt . Refrigerate it , and should last you at least 2 weeks .
5 #### The best jerky spice I have found ! Tastes great ! Easy recipe !
1 #### This came in a 10 ct variety pack that I ordered from Nesco 's website . This is seriously chili flavored , not buffalo wing flavored - not even close . It 's not even a good chili flavor - it 's like imitation chili flavor . Also , I used this seasoning with ground beef in the Nesco jerky gun , and it prevented the beef from binding and caused the strips to break apart while ejecting the meat onto the rack . Very difficult to work with . I 'm SO glad I did n't get stuck with a whole box - ruining a pound of meat was bad enough .
5 #### This is the best flavoring you can get anywhere , I make alot of jerky & this is the best of the best .
4 #### My wife thinks this is too spicy . So we double the recipe add one of these and one of the regular jerky seasoning . She loves it ! It 's now her quick go to for jerky seasoning .
4 #### I have never used this cure before and was surprised how easy it was to use . I will definitely order this again .
2 #### No way would I put the vast majority of the ingredients in these ' spice ' packs in my body .. As you know the list of the amount of anything in a product starts with the item it contains the most of and then the next most etc . Try this for heart healthy , : Dextrose , sugar , salt , spices ( does n't say which ones ) hickory smoke flavor , MSG , hyrolyzed soy protein , dehydrated onion , dehydrated garlic , less than 2 % of caramel color ( what the heck for ? ? ) , silicon dioxide and calcium silicate ( anti - caking ) . Then they list Cure ingredients:- salt ( like they need more ) and sodium nitrite ( 0.62^ ) . As far as I 'm concerned , this product should either come with a warning that it 's not heart healthy or be taken off the market entirely . I 'm sure I can come up with practically the same taste without adding the junk . Do n't know if it 's worth bothering to send back but I sure wo n't be using it .
3 #### Great for the beginner or if you just want to whip up some jerky for the kids . But for an experienced connoisseur of cured meats , it may be a bit so - so for your friends at the hunting lodge or deer camp . A bit too much salt and not enough flavor for a real enjoyable nibble , this , for understandable reasons ; too much salt / cure is better than not enough . None - the - less you could maybe cut it with celery salt and tone it down a bit . As aforementioned , this is a great product for the beginner .... can't miss if used according to instruction ...
5 #### Whenever there is London broil on sale , this is the seasoning that helps to transform it into some of the best beef jerky ever . We marinate our meat in this overnight in the refrigerator . I use a little of the ' cure ' to keep any fat from turning rancid , but honestly it does not last long enough to be an issue if the kids can get at it .
5 #### Bought this for my hunter - boyfriend . We broke up shortly after . I think he got all he needed from me . I bought an extra set and now I 'm pretty content , too .
5 #### I have tried different flavors and I always come back to the Original . Main reason being it serves as a great base or starting point for adding your own tweaks . Sometimes I add a bit of cayenne , garlic , ground pepper , terriaki , or some other flavor I want to try . Been using this brand for several years and yet to disappoint .
4 #### this is the 2 nd time i have ordered this product . good flavors and variety to choose . would buy again
5 #### This is really easy to use and tastes great ! The kids had a fun time mixing it all up ! We bought two boxes . Line your dehydrator though because the hamburger grease makes an awful mess ! At least line the bottom
5 #### This is some great seasoning , but if you use the full pack of cure salt per pound , it is VERY salty . For me , it was just barely edible . I read some other reviewers saying that they only use 1/2 a pack of cure per pound and I 'm going to try that on the next batch . I keep my jerky in the fridge and it 's usually gone within a couple weeks , so the reduced cure salt should n't affect preservation .
5 #### I have been making this jerky for 15 years + . Made it for the Carriers at the local Post Office . I Settled on 15 - 20 percent fat Ground Beef . No fat beef is tastless . I would buy in 5 pound increments then have the butcher break it up into 1 pound pieces . 1 baggie spice and perservative each per lb of ground beef . Some liked it hot so I added a tblsn+ or - red pepper flakes per pound . Make 5 pounds or more each time . Do not run this through a mixer . Comes out hard and rubber like . Hand Mix then place in jerky gun . I use a Large gun with twin head cutting down on time . Cook anywhere from 8 to 10 hours depending on the outside temp . I use Excalibur 9 tray unit set too 160 degrees . Let it cool and bag it up then refrigerate . This comes out so tasty and tender even your toothless relatives can chew / eat this witout any problem . I am one of those toothless wonders . Chew this no problem . Good luck my friends .
5 #### Great spices for just starting out in jerky making . The whole family enjoys home made jerky . Every flavour is great .
4 #### Good flavoring , but more for ground meat you form into jerky than it is for thinly sliced muscle . It worked for the latter , but was a smidge on the salty side .
5 #### I followed the instructions . It was very tasty but salty . Next time I will use more meat per packet . Will buy again 3/10 made it again . Added 1/2 cup of srirachi . Yummy
3 #### Good product , great seasonings , applies well , gives a great aroma , tastes great . Well worth the money I paid for it .
5 #### My son told me someone at his work used these- had allot of venison so tried it .. Ca n't decide which was my favorite . Went back and ordered the 25 pack so I could also have the Pepper / garlic flavor . Better than some venison jerky we have purchased .
5 #### i have tried various jerky spice premixes and i tend to like the the nesco brand best . i make jerky at least 1 or 2 times monthly . the spice mix comes in a two - package mix . one with the spices and the other with the cure ( salt ) . the only thing that i have an issue with this brand ( and with many the others also ) is that i find the jerky has too much salt for me . so i only use a 1/2 - 3/4 bag of cure when making a batch . i feel that this is safe because i normally eat the jerky within three weeks . hence , i do not need the cure for a long - term consumption .
5 #### Love all the 4 flavors in this box - have used prior to this purchase . Will continue to order and recommend
5 #### Everyone in our family loves this seasoning the best . We have tried the others but always come back to the original Nesco .
5 #### I idem is great . I love the taste it makes , of the food . It is so good , I want to reorder it .
5 #### This seasoning is great ! I 've purchased this several times and use it to make ground beef jerky with my NESCO dehydrator ( the square white one ) . It is always a hit wherever I bring it and everyone loves this flavor ! While I 'm sure I could try to find my own seasoning to match this or come close , getting all the mixed seasonings and the curing packets for this price make it a great deal !
5 #### Love this product ! Started using it probably 10 or 15 years ago when I purchased my first Nesco dehydrator . We love all the Jerky Works flavor but the original is my personal favorite .
5 #### I have used the products from Nesco for several years ! I make jerky and send to my sisters every year at Christmas time .
5 #### As always this product is great ! I have been using it every year for several years and we think it is the best !
5 #### this package a complete surprise after some thought . I originally believed this to be one flavor but the 3 that came where good .
5 #### I 've been buying this for year direct from the manufacturer . Amazon is about the same price but has free shipping so you save money . This is a great spice . Works best with venison . Beware of the ho variety as it is VERY hot . If you are using ground beef to make beef stick jerky try the pepperoni or fajita flavor . I still like this one ( original ) the best .
5 #### Love making beef jerky and the spice packages are very easy to use . We enjoy all the different flavors that this pack comes with too . I 've tried other name brands but this one is the best flavor and does n't cost a lot .
5 #### We tried all 4 flavors for making venison jerky . Each flavor is excellent and provides a burst of taste . Each packet makes 1 lbs .
5 #### Makes wonderful jerky with the nesco dehydrator . How much water you use though will greatly affect flavor if you marinate . I plan to try several different amounts of water with varying meat sizes . Too much water and you do n't get any flavor .
5 #### More flavors and different package configurations needed . I usually buy the regular and pepperoni by the 25 count bag . Nesco makes lots of flavors and package sizes and configurations for multi flavors . I wish Amazon carried more selection
5 #### Bought a bunch of these in different varieties . Loved the selection and ease . Cuts down prep time more than half since the seasoning is pre - measured for 1 lb of ground meats .
5 #### Liked the Varity of different spices plus there perfect for 1 lb of any kind of ground meat . Cuts prep time in half or more .
5 #### This stuff is awesome and all is inclued to make great jerky . Qiuck and easy it 's all in the box compact with good instructions . Nesco is the way
4 #### I bought the 6 pak to try out . We liked it , it has a good flavor , but we thought it was a bit salty . Next time , I will probably use half of the salt mixture . I also added 1 teaspoon of red pepper flakes to season 3 mix packets for 3 pounds of beef . The heat was just right for us - not too hot but a bit of zing to it . Very tasty - would recommend to others .
5 #### I have been buying jerky for years so I now decided to start making my own . This is so easy and great . If I thought this was going to be so easy I would have done this long ago . Just the right taste and so easy to do
1 #### Warning . Contains MSG and nitrates . Those wanting to make real jerky , not a chemical cocktail should avoid this . Buy from online spice sellers or a local spice shop .
5 #### Good variety pack . Easy to use . I do recommend it . ( But It does have msg ) My Family loves it .
4 #### I use this jerky cure for making ground beef jerky . I like the flavor of the spice ; however , I feel that the spice mix has enough salt that I do n't need the full salt / cure packet . I usually use 3 pounds of ground beef with two packets of spice mix and one packet of salt / cure and it is way salty / spicy enough .
5 #### This is our favorite flavor of all the different flavors by Nesco . We bought the variety pack and decided this was our favorite .
5 #### We bought this product so we could try the different flavors that Nesco had to offer before we bought larger quantities and found that we did not like it . I am glad we bought this because we found that we like the original and the pepper garlic the best , but that is us .
4 #### I love jerky and enjoy making it myself . This spice tastes good . I actually use twice as much when making my jerky . Is n't too overpowering . Highly recommend for jerky - making lovers .
5 #### If you make your own jerky ( and you totally should ) , get this variety kit . I have made several varieties from this kit , and I have gotten compliments on each one every time I made it . My favorite is the teriyaki !
5 #### My family loves all the different spices used in these Jerky Spice packages . Ca n't go wrong when making Jerky . Always yummy .
5 #### I decided to make my own jerky and could n't believe how easy it is with a dehydrator . By using the JERKY SPICE mix , I could n't go wrong with the great taste ! !
4 #### Very good spices but too salty ...... wish they could make a spice packet with less salt .... but the taste was great other than that .
5 #### I love this Original flavor jerky spice ! Also the Hot and Spicy . They are my two favorites . I mix with lean ground beef , and it 's the best . My friends and family ca n't believe I made it ! I 've tried other brands , but Nesco makes the best flavored !
5 #### I love the Hot and spice because it 's a little less sweet than the regular . I still add some cayenne pepper and black pepper to kick it up ! ! !
5 #### Nesco Jerky spice is as far as I 'm concerned the only one to purchase . Love the original flavor the best .
5 #### I love the flavor of these , but found that it 's best dispersed if mixed in the ground beef using a food processor . There 's two ( attached ) packets : one with flavoring / spices and another that is curing salt . For me , I use a little over half of the curing salt , but never the full amount . The jerky is too salty otherwise . I always keep the finished jerky in the fridge anyway , so I do n't need as much salt in mine .
5 #### I like this variety pack bc it allowed me to find my favorites . I really like the hot and original so I need to find somethin to do with this nasty pepper flavor ! :/
5 #### This is a good flavored jerky , I used it with strip beef and my family eats it right up . It is delicious without being over powering . Kind of peppery which we liked , but if you do n't like black pepper , you probably wo n't like this one .
5 #### This an excellent spice for homemade jerky , but it was n't quite hot enough for me . My wife prefers this spice the way it is , so we made a regular batch for her and it was quite tasty . To make it even hotter we added powdered habanero peppers that we make from the garden . Man - o - man was it hot . But I loved it and my friends loved it .
4 #### Compared to the regular this product has a strong peppery taste which I do n't mind at all . Keep the flavors coming
5 #### Great taste for a home made treat . These rubs have just enough flavor in them . Would definetly buy them again after we try to make a few rubs from home ! ;)
5 #### We use ground turkey with this jerky spice . Love getting this from Amazon.com because you can get this in a larger package . The flavor is very good . We add some hot , spicy seasoning to this original flavor sometimes and it 's quite good . It 's great all on it 's own , but if you want to add a little heat , that pairs well with it ! Good , tasty stuff !
5 #### I 've used all of the flavors in this pack and every one of them makes really tasty jerky . Having curing salt along with flavoring gives your jerky a real ' professional ' taste , and directions are easy to follow .
5 #### I love these packets , the flavor is good in each of them . They make the process of jerky making very simple . I normally use deer meat and I like a little heat to mine . I always add extra cracked black pepper and crushed red pepper with all of these packets when combining to ground meat . I do use ground meat to make jerky using a jerky gun to form it into shape . By doing this , you get flavor throughout the entire pieces of jerky . The best thing about these packet compared to others that I have used is the cure also comes in individual packets that are pre - measured . Also , it is not too salty like some other jerky spices that I have used that make you measure out the cure from a bulk packet . Bottom line , I will order these again when I run out .
3 #### I prefer the Nesco Original Flavor as it packs more of a flavor punch than this . I do like this flavor but it just seems it should be a little stronger . On another note you should be aware that this product contains MSG in the cure packs . Since a lot of people want to get away from MSG you may want to look elsewhere if that 's a problem for you . If you 're dead set on Teriyaki and do n't mind the MSG , give this stuff a try . Otherwise try their Original flavor or go with another brand that does n't include MSG . I 'll be looking around at other brands going forward . -D
5 #### We tend to add our own spices / peppers , etc . to get the exact flavor we want , but the base flavor is pretty good on its own . I like to use the Original , with about a cup of Jalapenos per pound of meat , and maybe some chipotle to adjust the flavor a bit . A bit of BBQ sauce mixed in can be a nice change of pace , as well .
5 #### Quick and easy review : Very good for dehydrated jerky spicing . A variety of flavors from sweet to spicy . Good value for the money .
5 #### We have made a lot of Jerky and shared it widely ... even sent some to SW Asia ( Afghanistan and Iraq ) ... it traveled well and was always appreciated . It works , is reasonably priced for what you get and well worth the time and effort . You ca n't ask for much more ...
5 #### If you want to get a variety to see which jerky flavor you like for the future , then this is the way to go . To me they all tast good to great .
3 #### The taste is a little less than expected . I really prefer to mix up my own . Soy sauce , ginger , brown sugar , honey , etc .
5 #### the produce was easy to use all you have to do is follow the direction that come on the package and when you go to make what you want with it comes out very well
5 #### Have had nothing but rave reviews from everyone who 's tried my jerky ! So easy to mix , can be used with ground meat or strips , and does n't require a lot of fuss or instructions . Have n't tried the other flavors yet , cause I 'm still hooked on the original ! Highly recommend !
4 #### This is a good tasting Jerky Spice , the cure is too salty for me so I use 1/2 the package without any issues . I have used it on Ground Chicken , turkey , pork . Used it on thinly cut chicken breasts , thin cut pork chops , tuna and salmon .
5 #### I ordered this and the Cracked Pepper and Garlic flavors , both worked out well but I liked the original more . I used this as exactly as I could to the volume of weight and it did seem a little extra salty - I know Jerky is supposed to be salty of course but if I had one and only one complaint it would be regarding that . Next time I 'll try limiting some of the salt and see how that goes , but either way I do recommend this product it 's very easy to use and tastes good . Oh , I used this both for ground beef ( using a jerky gun ) and for flank steak pieces . -D

5 #### I found this product through my oldest brother and now I am addicted , I love this spice kit and if you follow directions it is perfect every time .

5 #### used this to make jerky for the first time .. the flavor is awesome and everyone kept digging in for more .. makes me feel good , when I have come up with a winner ... try it !
5 #### I 'm not the best person to review this item . I have no other piping gel to compare to . I will say that while it is edible , I do n't care for the taste , but then it 's not frosting , it 's for accents ( writing or design on top of the frosted cake ) if I try another brand , I may come back to this review and update it . Oh , when I mixed in the Wilton food color , the gel had a cool " clear pearl " or slight shimmer look to it . I liked that a lot . It was easy to work with , but it 's not overly thick , so if you are writing with it , use a tip with a small hole because it comes out a freely . Not sure how to put it - as I said ' new to decorating '
5 #### this product ( Wilton Piping Gel , 10 - Ounce ) , is truely a very ghood product , today i tried it for the first time , wanted to do some writing with < royal icing > , on a cake , as i am still learning an and lines and curves were not easy to do , alwayes came out sloppy and ugly , till i used the wilton piping gel , half a tea spoon in a cup of royal icing made it perfect , had no trouble at all , it was easy , smooth and beutiful , i regret that i got only one pack , promised myself to buy more next time . highly recommended .
5 #### love this stuff and use it to create water droplets and fountains etc
4 #### Looked very pretty tinted blue as water on the cake , but did n't taste all that good .
5 #### I used this as a sort of glue to put glitter on edible snowflakes and it worked great
5 #### Wife loves this piping gel because it makes the piping work much easier , flows better and makes a professional outcome . She also prefers it over gum glue in some instances . Makes fondant pieces sticks better , there is no sliding like when using alcohol or him glue .
5 #### Used it as glue for fondant pearls . Worked like a charm .
3 #### This did not have the consistency that it normally does when purchased in the store . Possibly an older batch but with a little work I can probably use it .
4 #### This product is just perfect to use as a " glue " when I have to attach fondant items to fondant or to buttercream cake / cupcakes . I highly recommend this product for this purpose or even to color to use for writing on cake .
5 #### Used it it to adhere fondant to a cake . Worked well and did n't affect the flavor of the cake at all .
4 #### I probably will order tubes in the future . This was perfect for my project while I was learning . Quality is always there on Wilton products . You can count on them .
5 #### I wo n't say this is the best coffee in the world ; because I have yet to try them all and everyone 's tastes differ . However , from my 20 + years of coffee drinking and of all the Kona coffee 's I 've tasted , THIS one reigns supreme . And it better for that price ! But if you appreciate a well rounded , flavorful coffee , then this is the one to try . I lived in Hawaii for 3 years and was introduced to Kona coffee at the source . Of all the coffees I 've had in my life , Kona is my favorite . It is the richest and smoothest you could imagine . Others are good , but not in this class . Also , watch out for Kona coffee blends . They can be tasty , but are usually only 10 % Kona beans and not the top crops at that . This is the primo stuff here ! There really is something in that Volcanic soil on the Big Island . A word of caution though . Drink this at your own risk . It is very hard to go back to " normal " coffee after tasting this nectar of the gods . Enjoy !
4 #### Thought this coffee was terrific . But , the a.count order was Such smaller than attendances . I wish the amount was bigger .
5 #### I received a box as a gift and was surprised by the flavor , medium - bodied and smooth . No bitterness , this coffee was well balanced and well , comforting :) Enjoyable on a nice sunny morning but equally satisfying on a rainy day . A great gift for coffee connoisseurs !
2 #### Very salty and did n't taste as fresh as unsalted one . I prefer Virginia Diner Gourmet .
4 #### As described but not as large as I have ordered from other sites ..
4 #### The best of all peanuts ! Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars - usually enough salt , but sometimes skimpy and sometimes not enough blistered jumbo peanuts . I wo n't buy any other brands of Virginia Peanuts after these . The price is well worth the product !
5 #### Killer peanuts . Huge size , great taste , lightly salted . We like The Peanut Shop and Costco Kirkland Peanuts . In a grocery store trip pinch , Planter 's Dry Roasted . These are better than all .
5 #### As delicious as a Virginia peanut can get . ALL GONE !
3 #### Tastes good but they are not large - just regular + few large + few tiny .
5 #### Great product ! Fresh taste ! Regular purchaser since finding them !
5 #### I have been looking for peanuts that do n't have preservatives or other garbage on them . Several months ago I found peanuts from Virginia ( Parker 's Peanuts ) in the local store and decided to try them and we loved them . Just peanuts and salt . No chemicals or preservatives . I had no idea Virginia peanuts were so amazing . Best peanuts we ever had . They ran out of the Parker 's so I decided to try this brand and these are also fantastic ! Highly recommend .
1 #### I love peanuts but these were NOT GOOD ! I threw them out .
5 #### I am a consumer , no one paid me , I bought all the peanuts with my money with no promos . Writing review as I was so surprised by the Hubs ' bland taste . Ordering another Feridies right now . No , zero affiliation with any of these brands . Taste & Value : Feridies : 5 stars , expensive but worth it Hubs : 2 stars , 2 star taste , 2 star value . Planters : 4 stars , 3 star taste , 5 star value . Feridies : Crunchy , excellent taste , smell , aftertaste . Essentially $ 23 for 40 oz can , 58 cents per oz . Have consumed 4 cans over past 6 weeks . Hubs : Crunchy , bland , no soul , not much flavor . No Prime either , ca n't be returned . These may look as good as Feridies , but the tastes are not close . Since Hubs only sells it on Amazon as 2 can box , $ 46 wasted . 58 cents per oz . But I ate 2 oz and do n't even want to eat the rest . Sorry , to those who gave 5 stars to this product . Not to me . Debated 2 stars or 3 stars . But since I do n't even want to eat the rest of my 78 oz .... Planters : Not that crunchy , decent flavor , decent smell , not much aftertaste . Price for 6 can box fantastic . $ 18 for 6 cans , 96 oz . 19 cents per can . These are ok to good peanuts . Give 4 stars because of value .
5 #### great peanuts but holy crap 40 oz is a lot
5 #### This was hilarious , I did n't pay attention to the size online . They are huge . And amazing . They are a " dry " peanut , so very crunchy - PERFECT for what I wanted . I keep them at work for my friends that have medical issues or forget to eat . They 're universally loved .
5 #### The biggest peanuts ever and so so crunchy . Not too salty either
5 #### I can not express vehemently enough how yummy these peanuts are ! They are so well salted , with some kind of delicate , finely ground salt , that when I crave a salty snack these are my go to . The peanuts are fat and almost sweet , they are so very flavorful . I 've trued many brands of peanuts before , but I ca n't get enough of these . I buy them over and over and have turned other peopke on to how wonderful they are .
5 #### These are the old - fashioned style of Va. peanuts , lightly roasted , large and full of flavor . If you like brown roasted Planters , do n't buy these . And do n't leave negative feedback if you buy these and they are n't roasted as much as you like . They are not supposed to be . These are perfect , the way Williamsburg and other Va. peanuts used to be before they went national and overroasted their peanuts to sell to the Planters buyers .
3 #### Unique flavor . Rate this peanuts as okay . Will not purchase again .
5 #### Best peanuts in the WORLD ! ! I highly recommend this product .
5 #### I was looking for GMO peanuts and Feridies fit the bill . The fact that they are perfectly roasted and taste better than " The Peanut Shop " or other brands of Virginia peanuts is a bonus . Highly recommend !
5 #### Super sized and super crunchy with a ton of flavor . Another quality product I would buy over and over .
5 #### EVERYBODY LOVES THESE PEANUTS ... SAVING ONE CAN FOR CHRISTMAS BAKING
5 #### Just trying to find the best Peanuts I could and happened upon these and I have to say " they are great " I will order my second can as soon as I finish this review . Excellent product and it is a huge can . I mean you can stick your fist into it .
3 #### No one complained , but neither was anyone impressed with these nuts .
5 #### The very best peanuts are Virginia peanuts . They are large and lightly slated . They are absolutely delicious . What a healthy snack .
5 #### My favorite peanuts . I love them . Wish I could have them all the time ! ! ! This is stupid that I have to add more words .
5 #### We have tried most of the Virginia peanuts out there and my wife and I agree that these are the best available . They are a perfect match of crunchiness and salt and it 's hard not to eat just a handful of them . They 're great when watching any type of sports or at any kind of party . You wo n't be disappointed !
4 #### See 's Candies is a well - known California chocolate company , now with stores and distribution throughout the United States . In California , the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door . I 've had See 's Candies many times , most recently this assortment , and while See 's makes an excellent product , the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor . Still , these confections are above average ; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman 's with fresher and more flavorful fillings . Anyone receiving a box of See 's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made . Although they are n't the best I 've had , they certainly rank up there with the finest chocolate assortments available in a box .
1 #### Was stale and some of the chocolate was white .
5 #### Arrived in good condition . It was a gift and recipient enjoyed the candy and shared it with friends . I 'm a big fan of See 's candy . Very tasty . I love the chocolate flavors and the fillings are always good . I even eat the coconut one ; I do n't usually like coconut .
5 #### Great Chocolates that only Californians use to know about .
5 #### Who does n't love see 's candy ? Right ? no one . Growing up in California we had this all the time . I have to mail it to my friends and family out of state so they too can enjoy this wonderful candy . Having Amazon ship it for me makes it so easy . If you have not tried it please so .... the milk chocolate Bordeaux is the by far , hands down , make you wanna slap someone , best candy that has ever been invented ever . And I have 50 plus years of candy eating experience so I would honestly say that I am an expert in this field .
5 #### Sees candy cures depression and speeds healing of any illness ! !
5 #### This is by far my favorite candy ever . The quality is unsurpassed and I order it every Christmas for my special friends and family .
3 #### See 's is my hubby 's favorite . We have one in town but I was n't able to get there in time for Valentine 's day 2015 so I ordered the 2 lb . here . I was pleased with the price and it shipped in a day . However my husband noticed after eating a few pieces some of them did n't seem to live up to standard . We turned the box over and it was dated 2014 . Bad form , will not purchase from here again .
5 #### The best candy you can buy , cost ore but well worth it . Try the peanut brittle , even if , you do n't like peanut brittle , you will be wanting more .
5 #### bought as a gift , these candies were enjoyed by the whole family .
5 #### almost nothing better than See 's . This chocolate is so yummy and the price is right for this product right here on Amazon . Especially if you are a Prime Amazon member and can find it right here . So easy . Then just sit back and wait for the mailman .
5 #### What can I say - it 's See 's candy and they have n't changed in all these years - except for the PRICE ! This is a LOT of money to pay for a box of chocolates ! So - you had better love the person you are buying it for ( including yourself ) to want to spend that much on a single layer box . They 're good - but once a year is enough unless it 's someone VERY special !
3 #### In my memory See 's are the best , but this one is Not as good as I remember it to be some who . I would not get it again at this price .
5 #### Ordered these for a gift . Not all the See 's chocolates had an option for gift wrapping but these did so that 's what we went with . While I ca n't comment on the freshness of the product since we 'll never see them they shipping was super quick . Very glad it made it there sooner rather than later . Was supposed to arrive on the 17th via PRIME but actually arrived on the 14th ... how this is possible I 'm not sure . Did they wrap it up and hand deliver it ? lol
5 #### Sees has wonderful candy . So worth cheating on your diet for . If you get this item for a gift , do n't share it . Hide it from every body else it is too good .
5 #### See 's is the best ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! This was a gift for my daughter and her friend , who live in Florida . No see 's store there , so they really appreciate it ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I 'm a big fan of English breakfast tea , and this tea tastes amazing ! ! !
4 #### It is good , but it is still tea - ron swanson
5 #### I gave up coffee a few years ago and had been looking for a good morning tea that I can take to work and give me a good wake up kick of caffeine . this english breakfast tea has such a great taste to it and is of such a high quality . I ca n't recommend it highly enough . absolutely love this tea .
5 #### Love this brand of English Breakfast tea . Happy to see I can buy it on Amazon and get free shipping .
4 #### Tea is good . The leafs are nice and full and the taste is full bodied .
5 #### Not as strong as Irish Breakfast tea but none the less .
5 #### If you are an Earl Grey Connoisseur , this tea is for you ! LOVE LOVE LOVE ! Heave with bergamot .
5 #### I am a repeat customer . Wonderful flavor . Great price .
5 #### great flavor . my only problem is how much to use . I have slowly perfected the amount . You do n't need much . A little goes a long way . Great flavor and great quality
2 #### I would give this delicious tea 5 stars were it not for a ' natural ' flavor added to the tea . I am not sure , and I do not want to start any conflict with Harney & Sons , inc . I love their teas , have for decades . My body systems have become more " reactive " to food stuffs that never gave me a problem before , Harney ' E.G.S. ' Tea is one of those items . After 1 cup I started to break out in giant , angry red blotches on my face , neck , and dcolletage . I thought it was a delayed reaction to something I ate earlier . So , I tried my second cup , at which point the severe HIVES and angry rashes started faster , were much larger , and also painful , but horrifically itchy . My delicate facial skin the following day was rough , with the actual tactile feeling of burlap combined with sandpaper , but worse . At which point I knew this delicious tea was no longer my " boyfriend ' and the break - up would be immediate .
5 #### i really like ALL of the ' harney & sons ' loose teas ! i do n't think you can go wrong with any of them !
4 #### A good Earl Grey ; consistent flavor from batch to batch . I frequently mix with a milder Earl Grey to change flavor somewhat .
1 #### I was very disappointed with this tea . Promoted as a better taste and finer taste - just not so . In fact , the tea tastes a bit like dishwater . The bergamot flavor is not as strong as the plain Earl Grey . I will not be buying this tea again . Just a trumped up fancy name to try and get more $ $ $ from the consumer I guess ....
5 #### Best decaf tea . Hard to find loose decaf . Expensive , but worth it .
3 #### Arrived on schedule . A competent tea , but not worth the price . I find that Tetley 's decaf tea bags are about as good .
5 #### This is wonderful tea for decaffeinated : far and away the best I 've had so far . But to be clear , it still is n't as good as caffeinated teas are . Sadly , there do n't seem to be equivalent flavors without caffeine . Still looking , though , and I 'm trying some of the other Harney & Sons decaf teas ( not the flavored kind ) soon and will report on these . This tea is somewhat light in flavor , but very pleasant , with more tea flavor and more complex than others decaf 's I 've tried . Kudos to Harney etc for a superior decaf tea ! - Carolyn
5 #### I 'm new to the tea game but already have a love of Earl Grey . I 'm trying out as much as I can from as many different vendors as I can . At the time of writing though my experience is limited to only this , Adagio and only a handful of others .. this is clearly the better tea . Where others may have an overpowering amount of bergamot or focus too much on adding extra to it this seems to have a very well thought out blend that is just a good subtle cup of tea . I keep this tin at work and look forward to my Earl Grey in the mornings and afternoons . The tin itself is about the size of a mug and is filled to the brim with the tea . While it 's not overly decorative it will still make a great gift for any loose leaf tea lover . I suspect I 'll be buying more from Harney & Sons in the near future . I think maybe I 'll try Paris next ...
5 #### Easy to prepare great taste . Convient to store tin . You do n't need a lot of tea to make a mug full
3 #### Normally drink Taylors of Harrogate but thought I would try this based on reviews . Not really that impressive . Seems a little weak and definitely very light on the bergamot . Smooth but not that flavorful . But like coffee , tea is very subjective .
5 #### Really good ; more mellow than other earl grey teas that I 've tasted .
5 #### I bought several Harney & Sons teas when I ordered . This blend was easily my favorite and the tea that disappeared the quickest . This is a delicious Earl Grey tea , full bodied , with the pronounced Bergamot richness inherent in great Earl Grey teas . I find Harney & Sons to be a superior purveyor of teas and I have tried many of their varieties and blends . All have been excellent , with the Earl Grey being my favorite .
3 #### Bergamot flavor is not that intense . Perhaps the stock is old at Amazon
5 #### Outstanding Earl Grey tea . The standard just about that all should go by . The fragrance is unreal . You will not regret this buy .
5 #### One of the great Earl Grey teas ... as simple as that ... I've had one or two others that are as good , none better . when you get it right , not much else to say
4 #### The tea is rich and smooth , as a black tea with a bergomot flavor that is very subtle , almost non - existent , so if you go to Earl Grey for the bergomot flavor and aroma , this tea may be disappointing in that regard .
5 #### Harney and Sons was a brand that I instantly fell in love with , though their teas can get a little pricey , but that 's sort of expected when they sell high - quality loose teas and fine tea . I 'm not sure why they added in " Supreme " when the taste is delicate and profoundly different from the rest of the Earl Grey teas that you find in the market . Moreover , given than they were only founded in 1983 , it shows how they have managed their brand and products in an effective manner , growing to become one of the more reputable tea manufacturers out there . Other flavours to try : Fine Tea , Bergamot Tea . This is bound to emerge as a signature tea favourite of Harney & Sons
3 #### There is an odd aftertaste of the black tea used in the Harney & Sons Earl Grey Supreme Tea . The Bergamot flavor is lovely , but the black tea tastes " off " to me . I know this is subjective to " my tastes " . I have tried the Twinings and found the bergamot flavoring to be more lemony than anything else . The Taylor 's of Harrogate Earl Grey has an exquisite bergamot flavor , but the black tea is very weak . Alas ! I will continue my quest to find the perfect Earl Grey tea that has a good marriage between the black tea and the bergamot flavor . I am afraid though , that this tea is not it . The Upman
3 #### The teas in the mixture are of good quality but the word " Supreme " in the title is a little confusing - it 's not related to the bergamot content but to additional " white " tea component . Pros : fine taste ( in my opinion - too fine ) Cons : the intensity of bergamot taste ( the major distinctive component of Earl Grey Tea ) is a second to nothing . So I ca n't recommend it because I personally do n't much like it . But maybe people with delicate taste would appreciate it .
3 #### Harney & Sonds early grey is acceptable but somewhat flat in flavor . I 'll stick to Harney a & Sons for their English Breakfast tea .
4 #### Great quality . Has a very strong bergamot scent , which to me is the whole point of drinking earl grey . The tin is also cute .
4 #### Love earl grey and this is a very good one . Scent is strong and seems like the tea is very fresh .
4 #### This is n't quite what I had in mind for my Earl Grey , but this is an excellently crafted tea . For those who like delicate teas , this might become your favorite . The tea is a blend including Ceylon Silver Tips , a very expensive tea that is quite light and aromatic . You can see these when you open the tin , which by the way has no foil liner -- the tea is just packed right into the can . The bergamot is light and citrusy , not heavy and perfumed . The tea brews up light golden to red depending on how strong you made it ; I used 2 full cups ( 450ml ) of water and 3 small tea measures and brewed five minutes ( recommended time . ) It came out a medium red and a bit weaker than I like . The taste was sweet , no bitterness and a light bergamot scent . Summary : if you like mild , delicate Earl Grey , this will be just what you want . I happen to prefer a bit more robust tea myself , but there is no doubt this is a high quality , very refined tea .
3 #### I love Earl Grey tea and have been trying different brands to find one that 's more available than T*****a . This one comes in a fully packed canister and is very " Earl Grey . " I do enjoy it as my breakfast tea but it 's a bit strong / bitter for all day sipping . The leaves are not all little pieces of tea dust which is a nice treat from the grocery store brands of loose tea . If you are looking for double bergamot - this is your tea .
5 #### I try to eat miso somewhat consistently , but it was missing something , and making the stock with this put it spot on ! Like most Americans I was a tad hesitant with the overwhelming fishy smell that it has , but it is sooooo worth it . Once the miso paste , green onions and veggies were in ... soup was perfect !
5 #### Even if I 'm not making miso or another soup , I add a little of this to my water when boiling noodles . Gives a very good flavor to any dish ! :)
4 #### The results from powdered stock are n't quite as tasty as what you 'd get boiling down dried bonito flakes or dried fish themselves * but * this little bottle will save you the 8 or so hours of pervasive fish - stink that comes with making your own from scratch . I 'm not a huge fan of fish , but love Japanese food . Dashi is in almost ~everything~ and this is a way for me to make it easily in small amounts for single recipes without dry - heaving :3
5 #### I 'm surprised with this product . it helps enhance foods with a delicious umami flavor and actually makes a nice broth for ramen . i use it in a mason jar with veggies and noodles for work and when its time to eat i simply add boiling water ! ! its been a real time saver !
5 #### Ever find soy sauce even the low sodium soy sauce to be overpowering . Well this is your solution . It has a great soy sauce taste and is sweet not salty . It is great for dipping tempura and sushi . I like to baste my sea scallops with a little bit of this tempura sauce and some oyster sauce , a killer combo . I use it for cooking and dipping . It 's tough to get at any of my shopping centers so I was very glad to find it at Amazon delivered right to my feet . thank you .
4 #### I like the brand , But have n't tried it yet , So I 'll let you know what it 's like when I do .
5 #### If you cook Japanese food . This is a must have additives . I would buy this again next time ! Great for miso soup , Japanese styled fried rice , Cha - Sui , and etc . Just use it in small amount , do not over use it !
5 #### I use this ( along with MSG ) to make Kewpie mayonnaise . If you 've ever tried Kewpie you will never go back to anything else . We take it up a notch by making it at home with a stick blender . Quick , simple & easy plus no chemicals
5 #### I used this to make Inarizushi and it was marvelous ! So tasty
3 #### Ca n't believe I bought this stuff ! Good flavour but FULL of so much salt my cardiovascular system must have had a fit the ony time so far I 've used it . Am uncertain if I will ever use it again --- BUT if you have no problem with loads of salt -- go for it ! Vendor got product to me quickly , correctly address , well packed , and fairly priced . If you 're into giving it a go -- vendor delivered what he promised , and quickly .
5 #### Vendor shipped it faster than I expected As for the product itself , the sweet sap is taken from sugar cane and is used to make this vinegar . The vinegar has a bit of a tart effect to it , and is often used as a dipping sauce for various foods . It is common in Filipino cuisine to add peppers or spices to make it a spicy and tangy sauce , and is great for your deep fried shrimp and pork !
1 #### Buy the box - of - envelopes version of this product , it 's literally half the price per ounce of product .
5 #### I finally decided this is my go to dashi base . I use it primarily for miso soup base , but also use it for ramen and udon noodle bases too . I was always going between this and the sachets ( Ajinomoto always ! ) because it is almost half the price as this jar . However , the jar keeps my dashi more fresh . Which makes it last longer . I do between 1/3 and 1 tsp of dashi per 1 cup of water . 1/3 for my daughters , 1/2 for my wife , and 1 tsp for me . Then I use between 1 and 2 tbsp of miso paste . White for the kids , 1 tbsp white and 1 tbsp red for the wife , and 2 tbsp red for me . I 'll boil the dashi , add any veggies , remove from heat , then add the miso . In any case , this dashi powder is 85 - 90 % as good as Bonito flakes . It 's totally worth the almost double the price of the sachets , the only time I 'll buy the sachets is when I 'm cooking for a group of friends , otherwise I find if I 'm not finishing the whole sachet in a week to a week and a half , it starts to lose flavor and starts to taste like my fridge . With this jar , I can keep the jar for months with no issue . Buy with confidence !
4 #### This fish stock adds a good flavor to my soup . I would n't mind buying it again
5 #### I 'm new to the miso soup scene and was making possibly the biggest rookie mistake ever . I would just whisk a big spoonful of miso into hot water and call it a day . You can image why I thought I just did n't like miso . This changed my whole viewpoint , of course . A spoon of this , bring it to a good heat ( but not boil ) , turn off the gas , add your miso , add your toppings , done . Delicious . Truly makes a world of difference .
5 #### Made a couple of Japanese dishes with it and liked the flavor . Actually , it would probably be good added to any soup or noodle dish .
4 #### I am very happy that I was able to purchase this product . The shipping was pushed back so I have to remember buying before running out of this . The shipping part was the only small downside .
5 #### Another item i re - up on when running low . It makes a great soup base with even just water .
5 #### I moved and have yet to find a grocery store near my new abode that carries " world " items like this in their stocks , so I turned to amazon for it . This is exactly what I needed , thank you ! So far as the actual product goes , it 's just instant bonito stock . Sorta like bouillon cubes - it 's not the absolute best way to go about it but especially in this case , it 's very much close enough , especially for the effort involved . If you 're looking to make a miso base for any dish , this will do the trick .
5 #### I was using plain white vinegar for my adobo but finally bought this . The flavor is incredible and a huge difference in Filipino food .
5 #### I use this because it has a strong vinegar taste
4 #### This was great . I made miso soup with it and it turned out wonderful just like at the sushi bar . I simply added a couple of teaspoons to a pot of hot water and added my tofu and miso . I will say however that I wish there were clearer directions on the water to stock ratio . I just did it by taste and that worked out well enough . Quality was great , I was worried it would be too fishy tasting / smelling but it was very subtle and mild . Put it in the fridge after opening .
5 #### . A tiny bit goes a long way and the flavor is great .
5 #### I absolutely love this product and keep it on hand all the time . Highly recommend ! So tasty and easy to grab when I need a hot cup of soup !
5 #### This is so simple to use and has made making miso soup so easy ! It tastes great , not too fishy , in my opinion , but everyone 's tastes are different , just use less or more to taste .
5 #### A must for home prep of Japanese soups . Nice value .
5 #### This is instant fish broth . It has earned a permanent place in my kitchen .
5 #### This stuff is AMAZING ! I used to make my own dashi with the bonito flakes and the konbu and the boiling and the straining . x.x Ugh ! It was a headache . With this , you just measure it out , throw it in the water , add your miso paste , and BAM ! Perfect miso soup . It is a rather small container , but after going through an entire container of awase miso paste , I still have over half of this container left . One thing to keep in mind though , is that a 1 tablespoon measuring spoon will not fit in the mouth of this thing . I have been using 3 teaspoons instead so that I do n't have to pour it into my tablespoon and risk losing some of this deliciousness .
5 #### Exactly what I was needing to make homemade miso soup . After I bought this the first time , I ordered a few more before I was even half way through with this stock . I am so excited to make my own miso soup now !
5 #### Very good ! Not too salty . Nice bonito flavor , but not too fishy . Savory and delicious !
5 #### I bought this for a special recipe that required the Chinese Five Spices in Pumpkin Pie . I was surprised at how much difference the addition of Annise spice made in the taste . I like it !
4 #### all seems well , used in a few soups so far ... but now that i think about it , my head feels light and my feet are tingly ) )
5 #### I add a little of this to my miso soup for a deeper flavor . Great quality product .
5 #### This made a simple and great tasting Miso Soup . I would recommend it without hesitation .
5 #### YUM ! This is the perfect addition to miso soup . Highly recommended !
5 #### It 's very strong in this form and the first time I made miso ( which includes Dashi ) the receipt said 2 tablespoons and it tasted like fish soup . ugh . Anyway , it 's strong so start small and taste test through the whole thing .
1 #### Whoops . I * did n't * read the label , and bought this product ... First ingredient : SALT Second ingredient : MSG Returned immediately , This product 's flavor has little to do with fish stock . I 'm going back to this for now:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Katsuo - Dashi - Powder - Bonito - Soup - Stock - Powder / dp / B00JYF96OI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Katsuo Dashi Powder ( Bonito Soup Stock Powder)</a > . It contains pure Bonito fish flakes .
5 #### We love to wok and cook asian but have not had a chance to really " cook " with this , but I opened it and used it on a diet asian frozen dinner the other day and it rocks ! I can smell every spice ! Can not WAIT to wok with this ! Nice glass jar , packaged great , tight and safety lid ... YUM WHAT a great addition to our every day or asian spice mixes ! I think just sprinkled on white rice would be fabulous . A Must for your spice cabinet !
5 #### Great to have in the house to make recipes .
5 #### Authentic fish soup stock with great taste . Easy to use and dissolves nicely .
5 #### I use this as a base for miso soup . This is very flavorful . I may have to buy more since my son has been requesting miso soup on a weekly basis .
5 #### Really delicious . It is mildly spiced , but has tons of flavor . Goes great in so many dishes . You really can cook some fantastic Asian food at home with the right ingredients , and this is one of those ingredients . I 'm almost certain that my favorite Thai restaurant uses this exact product . However I would not pay extra for shipping . Amazon needs to get this under Prime shipping . My local mainstream grocery store carries this in the Asian section . Lee Kum Kee 's Oyster Sauce is also excellent and I 'm anxious to try their other products .
5 #### Nice flavoring for dishes . Give it a try , not just for Oriental food .
4 #### Despite the bottle size , there is n't much content . But for the price , it 's a good way to try working with dashi . Like the other reviewers , I agree that it has a very strong fishy smell . But once its in water , the smell is pleasant and the flavor is awesome . I 'm not a huge fan of salt , so I tend to use prepared stock items very sparingly , which is the perfect plan for this item as well .
5 #### when you do n't have the time to prepare kombu and bonito flakes , like for a quick bowl of miso breakfast soup , Hon - Dashi really takes just a few minutes to fix . throw in some of last nights noodles , a raw egg , and you are ready for work . It 's not quite as good as the real thing , but it sure helps for the quick fix .
4 #### Great seasoning I use it for sea food and soups . high sodium content so a little goes a long way . The picture give the impression that the jar is larger than it actually is so keep in mind this is actually only 2ozs
5 #### Perfect for miso soup . The pre - packaged miso soup is way to salty for me . I can make a moderately seasoned soup using miso paste , kombu and wakame , seasoned with the Hon - Dashi .
5 #### I love the flavor and use it not only when I make Chinese food , but in other items .
2 #### this stuff is a poor example of an authentic 5 - spice powder which I paid $ 1.5 for 4 oz locally , despite the fact that other Dynasty products are useful such as their Satay sauce . I live walking distance to Flushing Queens , and have a good idea what it 's supposed to taste like from authentic Asian cooking sold nearby . If you want to go cheap off Amazon , you are better off with&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Frontier - Five - Spice - Powder-1 - 92 - Ounce - Bottle / dp / B0001M10VA / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Frontier Five Spice Powder , 1.92 - Ounce Bottle</a > . BTW " star anise " or " aniseed " is already a licorice flavor , so to add even more licorice to this bottle was foolish .
3 #### I really do n't have enough words to fill this spot so lets just say I love Chinese cooking and this is okay .
5 #### I 've never used Chinese Five Spices before , but we had a holiday goose and I wanted to try it in combination with citrus to flavor the bird . It was a real winner and I loved the spice combo . In fact , I like it so much that I 'm finding other recipes just to use more of it . This brand seemed to be of good quality and fresh , as well as being reasonably priced . We live in the country and do n't have any stores that would carry such things , so I was really glad to find it online . If you 've got a recipe that calls for it , I highly recommend giving this one a shot .
5 #### Ah , that hits the spot . Needed this for my Chinese dishes , and I do n't regret it . It 's the same as the stuff I 'd buy in China .
5 #### This is an excellent version of five - spice powder , which does not seem to follow any standard formula . I have several different ones on hand , and this is my favorite . Good flavor .
5 #### Excellent price and the price is very reasonable . Have used this in several Asian recipes and going to try in more savory dishes .
3 #### never bought this so i can not give a review at this time so please stop asking me to review this item i ckeck my pantry and this is not in it , thank
5 #### Have n't tried this yet , but it sure smells good . Ca n't wait to try it soon . Should add a new dimension to my food .
5 #### Whether rice , noodles , stir - fry ... these LKL condiments really bring the taste to the table ! If you want authentic Asian taste , this will not disappoint !
3 #### I expected something else to apply to eggs in the morning Its still too sharp for me
1 #### Similar to Lee Kum Kee 's " black bean sauce " , this product tastes bad . It contains processed garlic ( probably low quality , maybe even spoiled , then cooked ) and other ingredients a home cook should add fresh , if needed . The person that slopped together this " chili sauce " sauce needs to quit smoking or get a different job ... he / she obviously is n't the same person who formulated their excellent oyster sauce . Just because food is made by chinese does n't mean it 's good chinese food .
5 #### I used to find Five Spice in the supermarket when we lived in PHX . But here in NC it is hard to find so I happy that I can order this online .
5 #### I tried to find this spice and was unsuccessful . It is a great spice that I use not only in making Asian recipes but in many other dishes as well . I find it to be very versatile and an asset to my spice cupboard .
3 #### This was ok - a bit strong on the licorice , so it is not the best that I have had .
5 #### I had bought my first container of Dynasty Five Spices to smell . I love the aroma ! Then I started using it in my marinated cucumbers ' n ' onions . Well , it does n't last forever that way . I tried another brand of five spices but it did n't even begin to compare to Dynasty . There is n't anywhere around close where I can buy it so I was glad to find it on Amazon . True , the shipping is a little steep but I pay more than the total for spices in stores . This was worth it !
4 #### It is good . I live in the Bahamas and a friend of mine had it and I loved what they cooked with it and I could n't buy it here so I am glad I was able to find it online .
4 #### I 've used this in marinades and stir - fries . The most surprising but best use was in a rub / glaze I made for baked chicken drumsticks . Wow ! It brought the exact right amount of heat and flavor to the party , balanced nicely with the brown sugar and other spices I used . Have had a couple of people ask me for that recipe . Heat is a mixed bag in my household - I love it , bring it on . But not so much for others . This product is a good middle ground . Not too spicy , but still full of flavor .
5 #### This is now my new favorite " go to " for marinating chicken , meat , ribs and so on . We love heat in this family and this product certainly fits the bill . Will definitely be ordering again .
5 #### Chinese black vinegar has very distinctive flavors that come from the fermentation of rice and other whole grains like barley . This has a nice , slightly smoky , slightly sweet , almost plum - like , piquant flavoring that makes it a great complementary component for a variety of dishes . This is the sweeter variety of black vinegar that is better suited for dipping ( steamed buns , steamed dim sum dishes ) , rather than the cooking variety ( which trends towards being more astringent , with stronger vinegar flavor ) , albeit it is completely suitable to cook with . You can do many things with this , such as using in marinades , braises , stir fry , boosting flavors in soups , and part of dipping sauces / by itself . A lot of people focus on the hard spices and thicker sauces when cooking , but overlook the importance and versatility of vinegars . This is a must have for authentic Chinese cuisine .
5 #### milder than most vinegars , but with its own very special taste to add to Ume Plum vinegar , and cider vinegar for that hmmmmm layer of flavor !
2 #### I lived in China for years and the black vinegar was rich , robust with a great taste . This product is a ghost of what it should be . Still trying to find the real Black Vinegar .
3 #### It is not traditional Chinese vinegar , tastes sort of funny
5 #### Black vinegar has become my favorite condiment . I love it cooking and in homemade salad dressings . It is pretty versatile .
5 #### We have been waiting for this item . To purchase it at a price , we thought was reasonable . This is why we jumped on it . Thank you for that choice . November
5 #### I like black vinegar , I like the way it taste . and this is good , michael
4 #### I am anxious to give this a try in my oriental cooking .
4 #### This is essential for a yummy , strong tasting Hot and Sour Soup . Great , great product . Try it .
5 #### Mild and delicious , I like this just about as well as white rice vinegar . It 's a good choice when you need a gentle souring agent .
5 #### A different taste from what I 'm familiar with . Enhances a lot of different foods . Makes vegetables stand out and gives new life to bland dishes .
4 #### I could n't find black vinegar anywhere ... not in specialty stores , or chinese markets or anywhere . I had all but given up before finding this . Good size bottle . Vinegar is well aged , so it 's slightly sweet and slightly acidic but not overly bitter or powerful . Compare to a very mild balsamic . I use this in my Hot N Sour soup and also when frying rice or noodles for Asian dishes .
5 #### I read about this stuff and had to try it .... The complex flavor should add that " something special " to a dish .... I have an assortment of " flavor " in a bottle in the pantry ... Still have n't tried it in a complete dish .... A drop or 5 in a dish should perk it up nicely ... Sort of an Umami " what a unique flavor profile " this food has ..... type thing ... When I use it in a complete dish , I will report back ... still experimenting ... for a couple bucks , what the hey .... add it to your arsenal of " hidden secrets " ......
5 #### My favorite nearby Asian food mart is closing with plans to reopen months from now in a new location . I need this stuff badly as a staple that must always be in stock , but I do n't need it badly enough to pay nearly twice what it costs in a retail store , plus nearly double that again to have it sent to me . I love Amazon so I hate it when Amazon is the worst possible place to buy a product , but there it is . I will look around for other sources because this stuff is AWESOME . It has more fire than the relatively wimpy chili oils in the ethnic sections of mainstream US grocery stores , but you can control the burn factor by choosing how much to use in your recipe or as a condiment . The flavor is subtle and is n't overbearing even if you load it on to increase the heat . Very versatile and very good .
5 #### I got this specifically to make dan dan noodles , and it was perfect ! the chunky bits of chili are so good I use this when I make chinese stir frys too . its really spicy but not omg my mouth .. its a smoother spicy if that makes any sense lol
3 #### I like it , but a little too salty for me
4 #### Great for use in noodle dishes this chili oil has a rich savory and spicy flavor with just the right amount of heat . I use it with roasted potatoes to and they always come out nicely .
1 #### I was very disappointed with this product . I did n't care that it was way overpriced ; I was dying to have some good chili oil in my refridgerator . This was n't it . It just does n't taste that good .
4 #### Makes any asian side dishes delicious , a must have . I took a star only because it 's not spicy at all . Its all about the aroma and flavor it gives , very distinct .
5 #### Love it ! ! ! We put it on everything . What a flavor ! ! !
5 #### Love , love , love this stuff . The perfect touch to an avocado toast breakfast and so many other dishes .
3 #### not what I expected , my mistake and , don't even know what it was for as its in Chinese , and it leaked every where . second bottle of hot stuff that leaked this week
5 #### Great taste for those who like the spice in Chinese recipes . I was unable to find this product in my local grocery stores .
5 #### The product was in great shape , appears fresh and is delicious for my miso soup . Will have no hesitation purchasing this brand again .
5 #### Took a couple of tries to get a feel for preparing this seaweed . But after you get a salad that tastes good , you 'll never want to be without this product Excellent flavor . Excellent pricing ( compared to local stores )
5 #### As you may have read , seaweed is a good source of nutrients , and has benefits for your skin and hair . Wakame is a kind of kelp ( Undaria pinnatifida ) and is most commonly found in miso soup and Japanese salads . If you use wakame a lot , this bag will fit your bill . I 've been using this brand for years because it 's big and one bag usually lasts me a year or more . Text and texture is comparable to wakame brands I 've had in Japan . There is more than enough dried seaweed here for 50 + bowls of miso soup . Just snip off a few bits of seaweed directly into the hot soup with a pair of scissors and let it rehydrate for a few minutes , then enjoy . Wakame is also good as a salad . Rehydrate in water for 4 - 5 minutes , then drain and cut into desired lengths . Add some julienned cucumber , daikon , carrots , and sesame seeds and you have a simple Japanese seaweed salad . Top with a Japanese - style dressing or any of salad dressing of your choice . You can also add some imitation crab leg pieces and mayo , or use the wakame as a bedding for other foods . Wakame should be eaten shortly after rehydrating , otherwise it 'll lose its elastic texture and get soggy . Product of Korea .
5 #### Best stuff out there ! Not too spicy and hot but it is at the same time ! Not unbearable .
5 #### Hot stuff ! Great for cooking . Watch out for the bottom of the jar , though . It collects any drips and will stain easily .
5 #### My mom buys this jar all the time for her cooking . I use it for sauce for vegetable , fish , meat and dumplings . It work like a paste and spread too . You can cook with it because it has a lot of oil . Let the meat soak up all that spicy - ness . I mix it with soy sauce and vinegar for a dumpling sauce and it 's so good . Great for seafood too . It 's not super duper spicy but definitely get you gasping for air .
5 #### I am a huge seaweed fan and this is no exception . I soak it in purified water , drain it and eat it like noodles with a little bit of sesame seeds and green onion . Yum ! I 'm raw vegan so this is perfect in my repertoire . Just wish it came with more bc I can go through this fast !
5 #### Much better value for price than the wakame at my nearby health foods store . One bag will last you a really long time . Highly recommended .
5 #### We use several different kinds of Wakame in this house and this particular one is just perfect for making miso soup . Lovely , mild flavor . The seaweed was dried perfectly and well packed . The size of the individual pieces is nice for those who like a good bit of wakame in their miso . Two ounces may not seem like a lot , but believe me , this is a large quantity .
1 #### I have lived in different places and eaten at many chinese restaurants and I have also had decent store bought chinese mustard , but I have no idea what this crap is . It is n't even good mustard . It is just horrible . There is also nothing hot about it . I am also not a fan of the Dynasty duck sauce , so I will be avoiding all of their products from now on .
1 #### I grew up in Philly and NY and traveled extensively . Dined in so many excellent Chinese restaurants in every major U.S.city . I love really Hot Chinese mustard and ordered this product . It is awful . The worst ! Thick paste NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING MILDLY HOT . Gulden 's brown mustard is better . Save your money . THIS IS REALLY AWFUL . You will throw it out along with your money ! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING . The only thing authentic about this product is the label .
4 #### Not quite as hot as I expected but still good .
5 #### Closest thing I 've found to what I used to use at a noodle bar in Hong Kong - nothing else seems to come close - perfect addition to almost anything - I often use it as an addition to ramen or lentil stew - I always have a bottle or two extra in the house so that I never run out . :-)
5 #### This is the old stuff , which ( at least in California ) is extremely hard to find : dried chili in vegetable oil . I recall that you used to find a jar of this hot classic on every table of every Chinese - American restaurant , but for some unknown reason they seem to have switched to chili pastes ( too sharp , vinegary , fruity for my liking ) . Very glad I can get the old burn back -- I might just start carrying this jar whenever I go out for Asian cuisine , since it 's too good to just use on leftovers .
5 #### I use this to make a spicy cucumber salad and it is full of flavor and I love using it !
5 #### Excellent , I make a salad out of with just Sesame oil and Tsuyu noodle sauce base . Tastes great .
5 #### I 've been using this particular wakame for simple seaweed salad for a while , after using mixed dried seaweeds for about a year . The mixes are a little more exciting , but also much more expensive . These are n't as uniformly small - some are flat sheets after being rehydrated , but just cut them when dry and you can make smaller pieces . I make a basic and easy seaweed salad for snacking - about 1 serving of this seaweed ( about 10 grams ; there are 6 servings in the package ) , soy sauce , ginger powder , julienned cucumber and carrots or radish , a dash of fish sauce , and some crushed red pepper ( or japanese pepper flakes if you can find them ) . Makes a great snack or first course for dinner .
5 #### I use this with the dried anchovies for miso soup .
3 #### Its OK for Chinese mustard , but not very hot . The hot Chinese mustard does not have vinegar , etc added .
2 #### Bought this from Caputos and regret it . The mustard has no spice at all to it and mostly just tastes a bit vinegary . Avoid this one like the plague .
5 #### Spicy , smoky , with a bite . Not your usual Asian hot sauce . Made with fermented beans , is a special treat from Hong Kong .
2 #### I did not dig the taste . I ended up buying chilli oil freshly prepared by a Chinese restaurant and it was absolutely fabulous and much cheaper . Check with your local chinese restaurant . They might sell you some in a container .
5 #### I think this is a bit hotter than the S&B Chili Oil with Crunchy Garlic and the nearly identical Momoya product . This one seems heavier on the heat than the salt , while the others are heavier on the salt than the heat . They 're all good , just different heat / salt ratios . One advantage to this brand is that the container is much larger than the S&B and Momoya jars I 've seen , so it lasts longer . As with the others , give this a good stir before you use it .
5 #### We have a favorite recipe that calls for chili oil . I could n't find it in our local grocery and so was glad to find it on Amazon . It is the only chili oil I have tried . I found it to be very authentic tasting . Unless I venture to try another one and find it to be better , I am comfortable leaving a 5 star review .
5 #### I am a fan of spicy hot Asian food and this is the best bottled chili oil I have tried ... so good I will no longer bother trying to duplicate my favorite Asian restaurant chili oil myself
5 #### I love this stuff ! It is great in dipping sauces . I also like this in my chicken soup broth or pretty much any soup . I would n't think of eating Ramen noodles normally but with some of this stuff , I will eat it and like it . I think it is better than Schriacha sauce , you just have to be careful and use a small amount till you know how strong it is and then you will be adding it to everything . I do a quick dipping sauce with soy sauce , vinegar , sugar and this oil . Great for dumplings ! This is a staple that everyone should have in kitchen .
5 #### Although many folks cook with this oil I use it as a condiment . I love the way the spicy heat builds and spreads , and the subtle and not - so - subtle flavors that you can taste . Also , it is salty enough to use as a substitute for salt the same way you would with soy sauce or a fish sauce . A little goes a long way , and especially if you are counting calories , fat or sodium intake . A serving is about a teaspoon - more than enough to mix into rice or drizzle over other dishes - and it comes in at 90 calories . That same serving contains 9 grams of fat and 440 mg of sodium . So , do use sparingly if you are watching any of those nutritional factors . Another thing that I personally love is this is unfiltered . There are pieces of peppers and other ingredients that will suspend in the oil if you vigorously shake the jar before serving . Those add a lot to the flavor profile , which is predominately salty and piquant ( and there is also a distinct element of umami ) . If you love spicy sauces and oils and want to ' spice ' up your meal ( pun intended ) this is an excellent infused oil that will do the trick . I wish I could elaborate on how it works for sir frying , but I do not use it that way . I can say that it is an excellent condiment .
5 #### My aunt is from Asia area , she loves it . Obliviously it contains too salt , and in my opinion , it is not healthy at all
5 #### I purchased this wasabi powder at our local Shaw 's ( same as Albertson 's ) for $ 2.99 . It is a very practical way to buy wasabi because you can make your own wasabi for sushi simply by adding water and stirring it together in a small bowl or you can add this to mayonnaise , mustard , oil and vinegar or do whatever you please with it . This powdered wasabi has fresh flavor and it 's an easy way to keep wasabi on hand for getting creative . How about adding a small amount to a rub for seafood or steak ? Have fun with this practical grocery item that only takes up a small amount of space in your cupboard ! Or pack it in your bag when you head off for the weekend !
5 #### " Hime " is " Princess Brand " and it is a big seller in Japanese and Korean grocery stores . This faintly green powder is mixed with water to make a thick paste to get wasabi , used for sushi , sashimi and to flavor tuna and other dishes . One trick is to mix the wasabi in a rice bowl or tea bowl and turn the bowl upside - down . Yes , that 's what I said , turn it over . The paste will stick in the bowl , and the developing sulfurous gases that make wasabi hot , hot , hot are retained , improving the bite . Get that wasabi buzz . I like to use it in tuna with wasabi - potato crust . Or being short on time , I just grill some yellowtail and mix a wasabi - sugar - soy sauce glaze and brush it on at the end of the grilling . Hot and sweet . Another totally bizarre but quite normal Japanese dish is wasabi nori chazuke , or tea - rice . Get some leftover rice warmed up in a bowl , put a dab of wasabi and a sprinkle of sushi nori strips . Pour hot green tea ( bancha ) over and drink like a soup . Said to be a cure for hangover ( I would n't know , but they say it works . )
4 #### This is good powdered wasabi . Let it sit for a half hour after you mix it with water in order to build up heat . It loses its spiciness rather rapidly once you open it compared to other dried spices . I took a star off for that because they do n't put it on the label . They must can it under inert gas or something . This is exactly what Japanese people eat . Do n't listen to people complaining that it is not real wasabi . You do n't want real caterpillar in your caterpillar roll or real dog in your hot dog . You do n't want real wasabi , either , because it does n't taste very good . Real wasabi is just a restaurant gimmick to separate rubes from their money .
5 #### Love it ! Just add water and I am happy ! Tastes great !
5 #### Easy to make and so much more flavorable than the tube - kind .
3 #### Wasabi flavor but no wasabi heat . I think I could eat a spoonful of this and remain unphased . I 'm used to restaurant wasabi where the vapor rushes up and out your sinuses , like a ball of fire and the poof - it 's gone . I was looking for something with heat to it so this was disappointing . But - it was shipped quickly and arrived in good condition ( something I 'm coming to appreciate more and more these days ) .
5 #### I love horseradish and the probably flammable mustard you get in Chinese restaurants . This is not less flammable . We approach it with great care and consume it with vast love .
5 #### very small container , had i known it would be this small i would have ordered another couple of tins . but all in all , this is excellent product ! !
2 #### I 've tried this brand ( Hime ) several times , and it always came up a little " short " on flavor . The last time I tried it , I purchased it from Kroger 's Food Store ( sorry , Amazon ) . I ended up taking it back and getting my money back . I 've tried S&B powder " Wasabi " powder , and it convinced me to start purchasing that brand . Especially when a 1 Kilo bag of powder is less than $ 15 bucks ! It 's the best imitation Wasabi powder I 've ever had . To make it last ( I probably have several years supply of it ) , I vacuum - packed 1/4 pound bags in the Food Savor bags , and then stuck them in my freezer . The bags are " double - sealed " , as there is a vacuum bag inside of another vacuum sealed bag . Double protection , I hope . If you like your " Wasabi " paste a little on the light side , I recommend the Hime brand , but if you want it " kicking good " like the real Sushi restaurants serve , go with S&B Brand . Thanks for reading this .
2 #### I was aboslutely shocked to see how much 1 oz really was . At $ 7.60 , I mistakenly assumed it would be a decent sized can . As locally I am able to buy a medium sized tube of wasabi paste for around $ 3 , but never used it fast enough so it would get old . I figured a powder would be better , so I can mix it as I needed it . When I opened the box and dug thru the packing and saw this little little can , I started looking for the hidden cameras ... thought this HAD to be a joke . Nope .. and it 's NOT returnable either . SO I HAVE LEARNED MY LESSON . Please just be aware if you should decide you want this EXPENSIVE wasabi powder .
5 #### This powder is what any sushi or Ahi Tuna lover needs to compliment the fish . I mix the powder with hot chili oil and soy sauce for a marinade when making poke or Ahi Tuna ceviche .
3 #### I was looking to try genuine wasabi , and I bought this product thinking " Japanese horseradish " was the real thing . It is not ... apparently it 's just regular European horseradish grown in Japan . The ingredient list contains horseradish , mustard , corn flour and corn starch , and a bunch of artificial colors . In that regard , needless to say , I was disappointed , although for roughly $ 8 I ca n't have too much buyer 's remorse . Taste - wise , however , the product is fine , and is exactly like the fake wasabi paste everyone is used to from most sushi restaurants . I take 1/4 teaspoon of the powder in a bowl , and add water drop - wise while rolling it with my fingertip until I get the right consistency . I 'll continue to use the rest this product ( it 'll probably last me a year ) because it has a nice pungent horseradish taste that indeed complements my take - home sushi well . But when this product runs out , or maybe even before , I 'll look more carefully for a real 100 % wasabi product to see what the real deal tastes like . It seems like&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Sushi - Sonic-100 - Real - Powdered - Wasabi-1 - 5 - Ounce - Jars - Pack - of-3 / dp / B001EPQOM8 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Sushi Sonic 100 % Real Powdered Wasabi , 1.5 - Ounce Jars ( Pack of 3)</a>&nbsp;might fit the bill , so that one I might try next .
3 #### I like HOT spices - so this is so I have - whan I want / need it - for that " right taste " !
1 #### unsure if I just got a bad batch or what ... the flavor has been bland and never builds to the expected pop of wasabi ... followed the directions exactly , but just did n't get the results I was hoping for
3 #### I wish this had a lot more kick in it . Flavor is ok . Still trying to figure out what I should use it on .
2 #### I can not understand for the life of me why dye is added to color foods . I was excited to receive this to find out it has dyes and preservatives in it ( which is not a good combo ) . I like to eat foods without these so I will be giving this away to the local food pantry .
4 #### I use this for making my homemade kimchi . It works great ! My kimchi tastes perfect .
5 #### This is the only shrimp sauce that I can use since I am on a strict elimination diet because I am breastfeeding my son . I cook with this and he would n't break out . It makes my so upas and salads more flavorful since I do n't have many choices of ingredients to cook with on my diet .
1 #### I do n't know if it 's me or if I got an old jar but this is absolutely putrid ! ! ! I hate it ! ! I bought it to make my kimchi & never used the paste before so I thought I 'd try it , oh my god I almost threw up from the smell !
5 #### This stuff is disgusting , I threw it away , but I gave it 5 stars , because it 's probably good to people who like this stuff , it was well packed and arrived early , but it tasted like something that was scraped out of Hulk Hogans underwear , after doing squats in the gym for six hours , well , that and a slight hint of CRAP ! ! Niether my cats or my dogs would eat this ! But try it , maybe YOU will like it !
2 #### Thought it was like belacan but not . More fishy .
5 #### These are a little larger than pastina . We use it in chicken soup and sometimes swirl in an egg or two for a heartier meal . You can also just have it with butter ; yum . I 'm never without this pasta .
5 #### I LOVE these , I 've used them for YEARS . I do wish they were less expensive .
5 #### So hard to find this any more . Great to have on hand .
5 #### I luv this kind of pasta , for making ' pastine in brood ' , with chicken broth . However , I was very disappointed with lack of tracking capability & time - line for delivery of this order !
4 #### Nice preserves , good quality from an excellent company . Good old fashioned flavor . Made with real sugar , not that corn syrup stuff .
5 #### I was looking for chutneys and this caught my eye . It is very good with a great morello cherry flavor . It is super sweet though and for that matter I see using this only as a jam or in a dessert .
4 #### I can not buy these in my local grocery store . I have bought other brands which i prefer , but these are an acceptable product all the same .
4 #### Recently , while dining out at a fine local Italian restaurant , I had the Pappardelle Bolognese . It was delicious . The sauce was terrific , but I had never had pappardalle before , and this pasta interacted with the sauce to wonderful effect . I decided that I had to purchase some pappardelle and serve it with my own meat sauce . I was happy to discover that the combination worked well together for me . I really enjoyed the taste of a nice pappardelle . And this brand tasted quite good . The pasta had a nice smooth taste and texture to it . All in all , I am a satisfied customer .
5 #### Have tried the store found brands and the noodles have not held up to my recipes . These held up and tasted very good . I 've found a new and true pappardelle egg noodle . Thank you !
5 #### Great wide egg noodle . They hold up against the thicker sauces . I only use De Cecco pasta ! I have used this pasta for over 30 years and will only use this brand . No matter what I will always find De Cecco somewhere . I always keep at least a one year supply , as there tends to be times where it is hard to find and I do n't have a backup pasta to go to !
5 #### These are just the best - can not find this variety of pasta anywhere nearby and am so glad to find them available here . Try them with fresh asparagus and a lemon sauce - you will not be disappointed .
3 #### Noodles are okay but too expensive will not purchase again
4 #### These are very good . I paid $ 3 for them at the time .
3 #### it was ok .. not a fan though ...
5 #### Yummy ! A great al dente texture and a rich flavor make for a very satisfying pasta . They taste good with sauce or with just a little browned butter and some fresh grated parmesan . In order to get the full , eggy richness from the noodle , make sure you salt the cooking water . They did n't need to cook as long as most dried pasta , so check them after 5 or 6 minutes .
4 #### I liked it . Cooked perfectly . My ex had asked for a certain casserole I used to make , so i used it in that . Next time I am keeping it all for myself . The reason for not being 5 stars is that there was a lot of packaging and not as much pasta as I would have liked for the price .
4 #### Love the pasta . Unfortunately , the nest are very delicate . 2 out of the four nest were in pieces . So pasta was very small pieces . Good product but not so much for shipping . Probably better to buy in a supermarket where you can check the product first .
5 #### Love the texture . A bit pricy but good for special event meals .
3 #### thought they were egg . going to give them to girlfriend
4 #### Giving a 5 for taste but a 3 for packaging . These noodles are delicious . They have a wonderful texture and taste . But they are packaged with a thin plastic top and half the noodles were in bits by the time they got to us . I would buy again , just not from amazon .
5 #### Luxuriously good . Worth the price - this is great pasta .
5 #### Just exactly what I was looking for - a wide noodle that is a mouthful ! Just like my gramma used to make .
5 #### Excellent pasta . Perfect fit for my homemade Bolognese sauce . Nice texture and taste . Stands up beautifully to heavy sauces . Also used with Alfredo sauce with fresh peas and asparagus . Wonderful ! Quality I have come to expect from DeCecco . I use their pastas almost exclusively . Highly recommend .
5 #### I love De Cecco pasta products . Their pasta nests , like these , are the closest you can get to fresh made pasta . Unfortunately , these are about 4x more expensive on Amazon vs my local store . In short : highly recommended product , however , they are overpriced on Amazon .
5 #### Richly and subtly flavorful , this dark brown rice vinegar tastes slightly less acidic than apple cider vinegar but is not nearly so sweet as balsamic and brings a delicate , interesting flavor to salads and cooking . Everyone to whom I have served it in salad dressing has raved about it .
1 #### I 'm fortunate enough to live in a city with Chinatown , another area with Asian markets(Thai & Vietnamese ) , Korean markets and Japanese markets . In my search for the genuine thing , I hit about 10 shops and finally found the genuine item in Super H supermarket . Strangely , the 4 Chinese grocers in Chinatown I normally visit did not have the real Gold Plum brand . I have many bottles that looked very similar but the real brand actually says Gold Plum . This bottle is very similar and very deceptive , but pass on it . It 's not worth it . The price for the real thing ? About $ 2.75 !
5 #### I live in an area where finding any kind of genuine ingredients for preparing ethnic dishes is nearly impossible . I buy most of them here on Amazon . The Chinkiang Vinegar is awesome . Try some ... you will love it .
5 #### Your name does n't have to be David to find a big old grin on your face at the sight of the bright red tin that says " David 's Cookies " ! Two delicous pounds of homemade - good cookies . Just enough for one big kid and a gallon of milk . Indulge . Smile . Meet ya at the playground : )
5 #### These cookies are delicious ! I will buy them again .
5 #### God ! ! ! ! These are so damn good and FRESH so far my favorite is the Oatmeal raisin cookies and the Chocolate chip cookies they 're so good I m definitely ordering more .
4 #### Gave ad a gift . They were fresh and good .
5 #### I love it over my pancakes and my capuccinos
5 #### Why ca n't more products be splenda - based and ZERO calorie yet taste SO good ! If you love the taste of cinnamon and sugar , you will LOVE this product . I have ordered several times and put it on my oatmeal , squash , popcorn , toast , waffles , etc . The best part is that it is zero calories but tastes like real cinnamon sugar . The health benefits of cinnamon have been known and this product contains real cinnamon as well . Give it a try ! !
5 #### I always buy several at a time . It makes the best cinnamon toast , or you can sprinkle it on natural applesauce ( the kind without sugar )
5 #### These were sent to a business as a thank you . They loved them .
3 #### It has a great flavor , but not enough refrigeration in transit and it had an extremely unpleasant smell when it arrived . I have eaten brie cheese for years but the quantity was too much to keep properly .
5 #### This is an excellent cheese from igourmet.com . The cheese we received was very fresh , and was by far the best french brie , we had ever tasted ... This cheese makes an excellent holiday gift , and is highly recommended ... " Enjoy "
5 #### The cookies came on time and packaged nicely . Never mind the fact that the cookies were fresh and delicious .
5 #### I have purchased these on three different occasions for gifts and they loved them . They stated they were very good cookies and the containers are nice .
5 #### The Person seemed to enjoy them they ate them in 2 days loli would have like to try one for myself i guess i will buy again .
5 #### Cookies arrived in record time and were delicious and fresh . Everyone in the office enjoyed them as did I. I 'll be back to purchase more when I 'm able to afford them . They are a little pricey but worth the cost ! ! ! ! ! Thank you ...
5 #### The oatmeal raisin cookies are the best I have ever eaten . I also sent an order to my mother and she agreed ! Thank you for such a wonderful delicious , fresh product .
5 #### As ALWAYS NEVER A DISAPPOINTMENT ! ! David 's products are ALWAYS Fresh & Stay fresh longer than most other cookies .
5 #### These cookies rule ! Fresh as can be and very tasty ! I mailed them to relatives at Christmas with other gifts and guess what they all said ? Those cookies were the best ! Did n't last one day !
5 #### Great flavor . Use on a variety of foods . Very good product .
4 #### What says I love you like a jar of kraut on valentines day ? Great on kielbasa dogs with peppers and mustard . hit this one out off the park . We do n't need no stinking chocolate !
5 #### Delicious ! And so good for me . It has live probiotics for a healthy stomach which I need since I have celiac disease . I eat it right out of the jar . Wonderful !
4 #### I ordered this as a gift for our resort office staff and they were thrilled ! So thank you for helping me make their holiday season a bit more delicious !
5 #### The cookies were moist and had a lot of raisins . Very good .
3 #### No probiotics . It is a fermented product but it 's also pasturized so there 's no active bacteria and thus not probiotic . I heard this from the Kuhne office after emailing through their web page about it .
5 #### GOOD QUAILTY AND DELICIOUS , IT IS TRULY HEALTH FOOD IN A JAR . I ADD A SLICED ONION AND SOME CHICKEN STOCK AND LET IT SIMMER FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND ENJOY THIS SAUERKRAUT WITH ALL OF MY MEALS .
5 #### This is a good kraut with a nice flavor to it .
5 #### This barrel sauerkraut is absolutely delicious ! It is rather expensive , but I savored every bite of it . I ate it right out of the jar . Yum .
3 #### Found cookies to be so so and ok . Certainly far from the best . Do nt agree with rave reviews .
5 #### Large homemade style with fresh tasting cookie dough and large chocolate chunks throughout the cookies . Taste delicious .
5 #### I love sauerkraut and have made my own but was just being lazy . This is wonderful sauerkraut
4 #### OK , but not really what I was looking for . Thanks
5 #### This is really a very good sauerkraut . It does not taste bitter or strong . I like it .
4 #### this is just like I remember as a child in Germany . The only drawback that I saw was not having any caraway seeds . Just the right amount of sour and spice .
4 #### took to share with my coworkers . they were happy i did n't get even one . bummed out .
5 #### Yes these were wonderful . I sat and ate them by myself while watching a white Christmas , wishing we had snow .. 29 and no snow ! The cookies made it better . White chocolate macadamia cherry . Lots in the tin , layers of them . Worth every penny .
5 #### This is one of the best store - bought saurkrauts that you can buy . I actually prefer this same company 's red cabbage , but only by a narrow margain . This regular saurkraut is nicely sour , but not bitter . It has a good overall flavor and texture to it , which can actually vary in saurkraut despite the general simplicy of the ingredients . As someone who grew up eating saurkraut , its a treat to be able to buy this German brand and get something as close to homemade - tasting as you can purchase at the store . It works well cold or warm , though most people tend to prefer it heated up . You can also do what my grandmother used to do and saute porkchops and then simmer the cooked chops in the saurkraut before serving . Works well as a side to most beef or pork dishes and , obviously can be spooned onto hot dogs or be served with sausages . Go on , try some of this at your next BBQ ! Sure , you can buy cheaper saurkraut -- or go to the trouble of making your own -- but I think this version is well worth the price .
5 #### EXCELLENT ... THIS IS A GREAT FIND ... EASY TO OPEN JAR LOTS OF GOOD STUFF ... I AD THIS TO THE REST OF THE STUFF IN THE CROCK POT AND ITS AMAZING AND VERY SIMPLE AND JUST LIKE I WANT TO EAT SAUERKRAUT EVERY DAY ... ITS FANTASTIC
1 #### Cudos for using pounds instead of ounces and tricking us . Pounds sounds like you get a lot more but you get the same ounces . Bought on pound basis and haha ya got me this time . Hope this caviar sourkrout is as good as its premium price .
1 #### They were dry . Not fresh at all ! Do not waste your money like I did !
5 #### These were a gift , but they received rave reviews from the recipients upon arrival . They recommend warming them briefly in the microwave !
5 #### This was a gift . They raved about how good each flavor was .
4 #### These were a gift . Feedback is the cookies are very tasty . My only issue is the lack of a gift wrap option from the vendor ( when ordering through Amazon ) . I understand why this may be an issue but would think some means of handling this could be created .
5 #### WARNING : chewy and addictive . Those were some of the best cookies I have ever eaten ! ! ! I 'm just disappointed in the fact that I only ordered one tin ... I need more ! ! They were actually ordered as a gift , and thank God the recipient was pleased as well . I will definitely be purchasing in the future . - I had the oatmeal raisin .
5 #### I buy these every year for gifts and everyone raves how good they are .
2 #### I do n't think these are very good cookies . Not worth the money at all .
5 #### Dare I say that these cookies are every bit as good as most bakeries produce . Yes I dare . These are scrumptious .
5 #### Great gift for someone . Nicely wrapped . Home made looking cookies . Taste awesome .
4 #### Well received on a relative 's birthday . Would have been better if a gift card was available . There was no indication who sent them .
1 #### These were revolting and made everyone sick ! Must ve been spoiled . Gross . We threw away half of them when we realized we were getting nauseated because of them . I do not remotely recommend since you ca nt return food and these were funky and nasty .
5 #### Great tasting cookies . Fast delivery . The cookies come in a nice tin .
5 #### Great aroma blessed me as soon as I opened the well packaged box . They are so fresh . The instructions said if you 're not going to eat within next two to three days , to freeze them . There are six layers of fresh baked , yummie , scrumptuous cookies . I ordered the variety package . I can hardly wait to taste all the different flavors . I will definitely be ordering these cookies again . Great job !
5 #### This was used as a gift . They truly enjoyed the wonderful cookies .
5 #### I sent these to my daughter . She loves them and I wanted to cheer her up while she is in school , they arrived badly broken . When they contacted me to thank me for my business I told them they arrived broken . They sent her another tin of cookies ASAP ! Thanks so much 5 stars just great costumer service and a fantastic cookie
5 #### These cookies are so tasty and chewy and fresh ! ! Tastes so homemade ! ! I just received my second tin of the m&m 's cookies .. equally as good !
5 #### These cookies are delicious . There are many chocolate chips and the cookies are nice and soft . The packaging is good and keeps the cookies fresh even after the can is opened . If you are a cookie monster like me you will be happy with this .
5 #### Ordered as a Birthday gift & the recipient loved these cookies . They were gone quickly . Would order these again !
5 #### Love these cookies ! ! Great taste , packaged well , not a broken one in the bunch .
3 #### These were just okay . I ordered some of the jumbo peanut butter cookies about a week before I ordered these I think . Those were delicious and fresh . These cookies were not as fresh as my first order with the company . I made my first order directly from their site , but I ordered these through Amazon . I 'm going to place another order directly from their site to see if that makes a difference as far as quality goes .
5 #### I ordered these twice and in both cases the people loves them !
5 #### Seem very Fresh ! Delicious and soft . Recommend ordering from Amazon rather than other places , much fresher here .
1 #### You would be better off making them yourself ... even if you got it wrong it would be better than this stuff ..... Save your money and time .. zero stars .. and that 's to much ...
5 #### Did n't have these myself - I sent them to coworkers in another state . They thanked me for doing that , so they must have been fine ;)
5 #### Great ! Finished off the tin in one setting with 4 people ! Everyone loved them . My favorite was the oatmeal which surprised me because usually I like choc chip better . All of the cookies were wonderful
5 #### Last year I purchased this product on a hunch at a local discount store(TM)at a tremendously discounted price . Now I am hooked . Works wonders on fish , but also terrific on potatoes , rice , eggs , chicken , steaks , Italian dishes and in all sorts of casseroles . It is a delightful medium grind blend of salt , black pepper , parsley , garlic , onion , lemon peel and green peppercorns . The mixture is a bit heavier on salt than I would like but I use it sparingly as it is quite potent on the other spices as well . I like to mix about a third cup of spice with a cup and a half all purpose flour in a baggie which I refrigerate for at least a few days . The spice flavors the flour which I then lightly sprinkle on fish or meats before pan grilling in a couple tablespoons of olive oil in a cast iron skillet . The result is a beautifully browned , light , crunchy , low fat , flavorable crust surrounding a wonderfully moist fillet of salmon , orange roughy , tuna , chicken or even rib eye steak . Fisherman 's Wharf really kicks up homemade potato salad , scrambled eggs and homemade chicken salad . I have mixed it with mayonnaise to spread on ham , tomato and lettuce sandwiches , BLTs and leftover turkey and fresh vegetable wraps . It also makes a quick and tasty salad dressing using olive oil and apple cider or balsamic vinegar . The uses for this wonderful spice blend are limited only by your culinary imagination .
4 #### I sent them to my son . He lobtf them .
5 #### The cookies were awesome and fresh , I really enjoyed them ! They arrived fast and on time and was wrapped really well . I will definitely be ordering more !
5 #### The cookies arrived in a timely fashion and they were packaged well enough that the cookies were each non crumbled . These cookies were absolutely delicious and should be considered addictive . I will definitely purchase more cookies from this vendor ; in fact , I already have .
5 #### I ordered a 2 pound tin of assorted David 's cookies for a 95 - year - old birthday girl . She and her family and birthday guests say that every type of those cookies is delicious -- can not pick out a favorite . So I guess I 'll have to keep sending the assortment ! Thank you for making my dear friends so happy !
2 #### Not that great . Certainly not worth the cost . To be honest , the recipe on the back of a bag of tollhouse chocolate chips makes a far better , far fresher cookie . I would n't waste my money on these .
5 #### Excellent Cookies . We ate them very quickly and yes I will have to reorder .
5 #### The recipients were very pleased with these cookies . Just like , or better than homemade and such a nice assortment !
5 #### Always a great option for any kind of seafood or vegetables .
5 #### Best seafood seasoning I have ever used . My son also uses it at college , he took it with him and uses it on both seafood and tofu !
5 #### Outstanding seasoning . I use it on just about everything - chicken - veggies - fish . This truly is an all - purpose seasoning
5 #### I bought this to try it on boring fish . Well , I found this is not just for fish . The name Seafood Seasoning fools you . I use it in everything from soups , chicken , veggies , baked potatoes , sweet potato fries , eggs and on and on . It does have a lot of wonderful ground black pepper in it so be sparing at first and simply do n't buy it if you hate black pepper . I ca n't live without it now so do n't buy it all , save some for me . Highly recommend this seasoning . It 's delicious !
5 #### Amazing ! Fresh and delicious . The cookies were soft exactly the way I like them .
1 #### Cookies were not bake right . It was like eating raw cookie dough .
1 #### Fifty percent of the cookies arrived broken in pieces ! Some of the cookies were not that good(Peanut Butter , Macadamia White Chunk ) . My local Publix Supermarket has better cookies at a fraction of the price ! All considered , not worth the price !
5 #### Fresh . Packaged great . Love the tin canister can be used for anything to keep junk in . These are fresh baked and I mean fresh . They smelled warm and they were right out of the ovens . The packing is wonderful also . Very safe . These are almost on par with the special cookies that you find in the malls . BUT you wo n't find the freshness in them unless you catch them when they 're first taking them out of the oven .
3 #### I did n't enjoy them because they are to soft , I gave then away Plus they took forever to arruve
5 #### These were a gift to a cookie monster of a guy ... He loved them . Delivery was a little delayed but the address was very rural , so it 's not unexpected .
3 #### too sweet . Not that tasty . But i am comparing to Mrs Fields .
5 #### I ENJOYED THE COOKIES VERY MUCH , ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE PRESERVATIVE FREE . I PLAN TO PLACE ANOTHER ORDER .
5 #### Without a doubt , the best cookies ever . I purchased the variety tin to see which I liked the best . Oatmeal raisin were my favorite but would n't refuse any of them . Large cookies , chewy and delicious and the chocolate chip ones had huge hunks of chocolate . I honestly rate these a A++++ .
5 #### Excellent variety of cookies . They arrived on the day promised . Sent as a gift ... they loved them !
5 #### David 's Cookies did it again ! These cookies were delicious and delivered on time ! Thank you David 's , you certainly have a return customer !
5 #### I 've purchased 8 tins of the large soft assortment and ate them all myself . They are incredible .
5 #### I sent these to my niece in N.C. She said they were delicious .
5 #### Freshly backed and soft and chewy . What 's not to love . The arrive very fast and I could have sworn I felt the heat from the cookies when I opened the tin can . :)
5 #### These are the best cookies . They arrived moist !
5 #### Its about time Spanish products started getting their due .. The most famous ( rightly so ) Spanish cheese , Manchego , is world class , and is really tough to beat . Try some with some fig cake , or some quince paste , or drizzled with olive oil garnished with rosemary .. Serve with a fino sherry , manzanilla , or any number of red wines ( depending on age of cheese ) , and you are guaranteed a winning combination .. Sliced , melted over a great burger , with a roasted red pepper and a hearty glass of earthy zinfandel = heavenly joy .. Cube and marinate in Spanish olive oil is also a treat ... I have had no problems with iGourmet so far , so I ca n't comment on their customer service - all of my orders have been shipped quickly ( 1 - 3 business days ) , without issue . Their Manchego is much better than I can get at the local gourmet grocery stores . They have great specials and offers , so I have to count myself as a big iGourmet fan . Regardless , Manchego cheese is so good , you 'll undoubtedly be back for more .. and more .. and more .
5 #### Cookies came package very well and might I add delicious cookies nice and soft I had to place another order love them .
5 #### I ordered these as gifts for friends and when I asked to try one , were already gone ! ! ! Everyone loved them !
5 #### Tasty . I use it in so many dishes . Will be buying it again .
5 #### Excellent ! I am so happy I can find such delicious cheese here on Amazon as it is not available anywhere near where I live .
1 #### Bland and tasteless . It is not the product in the picture , it is a lower quality variety
5 #### so love cookies but do n't have time to bake them these are heavenly just right texture great with a glass of milk or cup of coffee . If you treat your dog to a tiny bite ( no more ) pick out the chocolate bits . ( about the size of a quarter ) for a hundred pound rottie it 's fine . Enjoy ! beautifully presented and packed to stay moist ! Do n't forget that raisins are poison to dogs so no oatmeal raisin for Fido please !
4 #### Wow is this stuff yummy ! I think it 's pricy for what you get but it is tasty . The box arrived a few days ago . It was double packed with ice packs between both layers . The ice packs were completely melted , and the cheese were warm , but it was n't runny . They need to either use larger ice packs or some kind of temperature retaining item for packing so it wo n't get so warm in the summer . Otherwise , it arrived on time and , did I say it was tasty ?
5 #### This is an exceptional sheeps cheese . I can not eat regular cows milk cheese due to lactose intolerance however sheep and goat have become my main stay . I have been expanding my horizons and eating more cheeses from other countries . The flavor and taste is nice and mild and yet is filling creamy and luscious
5 #### Excellent cheese . I love Monchego , this is . Good one . It makes awesome grilled cheese toasts
5 #### Sent David 's cookies as a gift to my son in college . He loved them .
4 #### It has long been a favorite cheese . Cheese is always a good as ever .
5 #### I love , love these pickles ! ! I started eating them in Germany and so happy that they have them here . Crunchy and great tasting ! ! !
5 #### the best I could have not got anything else better freshly and the taste is awesome
5 #### These pickles are DEEEELLLLIIIICIOUS ! Crisp and great ! I do n't like garlic so I like these very much ! ! Do n't leave you with bad breath !
5 #### The best barrel pickles . My supermarket does not carry anymore and kuhne is the new label but always the best .
5 #### According to an answered question here on Amazon , these pickles do not contain ALUM , a toxic ingredient used as a cheap crispener in most brands of pickles . Cheers !
5 #### this hit the jackpot , great as usual , will order the spicy mix next time , but we used to buy these in Germany ,
5 #### All of David 's Cookies baked goods are delicious but I 'm a peanut butter devotee and their Peanut Butter Cookies are delicious ! There are no nuts in it , instead there are peanut butter chips -- biting into one of those with the soft , rich PB Cookie surrounding them , is beyond wonderful !
5 #### I loved this cheese . I will buy it again and again . Thanks .
5 #### Manchego is a favorite cheese . In my area , it is rare to find good quality Manchego . Amazon to the rescue ! This cheese was delicious ! !
5 #### This is amazing cheese ! Straight from Spain ... it 's pricey , but worth it . One of my top favorites .
5 #### THESE PICKLES ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD AND THE BEST I HAVE EVER EATEN AND I WILL SAY THEY ARE GOOD FOR YOU .
5 #### I came across these pickles in a grocery story several years ago and decided to try them . I have not been disappointed . I have been purchasing them ever since . There is always at least one jar of them in my cupboard . The flavor is great . It is not over vinegary like a lot of commercial pickles . Also , I enjoy drinking the pickle juice . The people I have share them with have become converts to these pickles .
3 #### These pickles are not sweet pickles . They might be bread and butter pickles , but I thought hey were sweet pickles ..
5 #### I tried these over a friend 's house several years ago and was blown away . So much better than U.S. pickles . They are the only pickles I buy now . Crisp , but not hard , very nice subtle flavor . My only issue is that I bought several jars at once , and did n't use them all right away ... after around a year on the shelf , they loose their crispness and get rather limp . So enjoy them within a few months of buying them !
4 #### Ordered the pecan / chocolate chunk . Cookies were hard and without flavor . Contacted seller , who responded immediately . Second shipment is wonderful : cookies are soft and taste great . Giving 4 stars because customers should n't have to complain to receive a superb product .
5 #### The first time I bought David 's cookies , was from HSN and I have a standing order with them . I get them every month but this David Tin , is great same cookies , Great Taste , same texture , over all the best cookie I have ever had . I highly recommend this cookie . I 'm a Cookie Monster from way back and I know my cookies ; * )
5 #### I was with ebay and the quality did not meet
4 #### The Peanut butter Cookies are Pretty good but not great , the chips make it a little too much , probably would prefer them without the chips ...
5 #### These are really delicious ! Taste like they just came out of the oven !
3 #### I purchase 2lbs of this M&M cookie product as a christmas gift . When I tasted the cookies when I went over to that person , I was embarrassed by the cookies being too hard and overbaked . It was n't terrible , mind you ... but I 've tasted better at Wegman 's . If i had know these cookies were like this , I 'd just have bought some freshly made cookies at Wegman 's and just wrap it . To be fair , this may be normal . perhaps I just got a bad batch . I dunno . But as of today , this rating stands .
5 #### Always fresh and delicious ! A winner with every cookie lover .
5 #### They were good have a good buttery taste to it
5 #### Cookies were fresh and tasty . Just wish it there were more , maybe 2.5 pounds for the price . Very close to homemade .
5 #### I have tried so many different brands of cookies from Amazon and I have to admit : David 's cookies are SOOO delicious ! I purchased two orders of these cookies ( Variety and Chocolate Chunk ) , in less than a month . They are so soft and a great size ! The orders came to my house early , without the cookies being crushed and/or in pieces . So far , these are the BEST cookies I have tried on Amazon !
5 #### The cookies are fresh and absolutely delicious . Some people preferred a cookie that 's a bit softer . The advertisement says that they 're " soft - baked " , but I guess the meaning can vary . I would order them again , and recommend them to my friends .
5 #### Sent these to my sister . She loved them Next I 'm ordering them for myself
5 #### I gave this as a gift at Christmas , and the recipient is still raving about it several months later !
5 #### This is an excellent product & the seller is OUTSTANDING . We ordered 9 of these for our clients , and had them delivered a couple of days before Christmas . They were delivered promptly , when promised , and before the holiday . The quality of the baked goods and the presentation were top notch . The clients RAVED . Excellent value for the money ! Excellent baked goods at almost any price . Also , some of the best customer service around from this seller . Kudos all round !
5 #### These were put in a Irish gift basket along with bread , biscuits , mustard , marmalade and beer . Since the recipient is a huge cheese lover , these cheeses were a big hit !
5 #### If you are looking for traditional Irish cheeses and other products , you do n't have to look any further than this company . Their selection of products directly from Ireland are wonderful . They even sent me a gift certificate to use on the next purchase I made from them . So if you 're wanting real Irish , you will love these cheeses and the many other Irish products this company offers .
5 #### This is my third or fourth purchase from iGourmet . My first order had a small issue that I just sent them a note about as an awareness , but they went all out and not just resolved it ( I was already satisfied ) , they blew my socks off . Subsequent orders have all been great . I really love the service I get , not to mention the delicious cheese . It 's a good thing I ca n't order 50 pounds of cheese at once , because if I could , I would . Yes , their selections really are just that good . I am giving serious consideration to making this year 's holiday gift giving cheese to all my cheese loving friends . There are two birthdays in July , and both will be getting a package from iGourmet . If you appreciate a good cheese , iGourmet is the on line cheese monger that should be your go - to guys . ( Do n't forget to support your local cheese monger too ! )
5 #### Ate them all with in three days . Way too good
4 #### I wish I had left out oat meal , their flavor was not good and I do not know if there were white chocolate but if that was what they were they did not stand up in flavor like others I have had . All in all we liked the peanut butter and chocolate chip . I do wish I bought just the two flavorss as did others .
5 #### I ordered this for a close family member , and they invited me to enjoy it with them . Boy , oh boy . I ended up sneaking back to the fridge to munch on this stuff . The Cahills went first , but all of them were enjoyable . Mostly sharper cheeses , but not extra sharp .
4 #### I LIKE CHEESE A LOT SO I PRETTY MUCH LIKE ALL CHEESES . THIS PACK IS MORE ON THE CHEDDAR CHEESE TASTE .
5 #### I got them for my wife for christmas and she loves them .
5 #### I purchased these cookies for my boyfriend he said they they were very soft and delicious
5 #### Everyone we sent this to as a gift responded with , " We love these cookies ! " Just buy them ...
5 #### An excellent choice for Holiday Gifts . Made all my friends very happy .
5 #### YUM ! The whole family found a cookie they liked . Fresh tasting ... definitely worth the cost ! The cherry & white chocolate chunk was my favorite ! I must add - All of the cookies were delicious ! Excellent for the holidays , to have around the house or to give as a gift . I will buy more in the future !
5 #### This was a gift , came in a cute tin for the holidays . The recipient told me the cookies were " great " and she is a cookie lover !
5 #### I hate to say just how good they were ... I am wearing about 5 lbs more from them .. Delicious , fresh , like home - made ( actually better ) .. the Chocolate chip are AMAZING and the Peanut butter were fought over by my family ... great buy .. would make an amazing gift
2 #### Most of the cookies tasted ok . The main problem was that many of the cookies were broken . Add to the that the bottom layer was very stale . This was to be a nice snack gift but turned out bad . First and Last time ever ordering from this company .
5 #### The best Foods come in small packages , the whole Family Loves these Treats .
3 #### Cookies tasted good , but poor packing and presentation is not what we have previously experienced from David 's Cookies . Received some odd shaped , broken cookies .
5 #### Was a gift ......... said they were VERY good . Fast delivery ; would buy again .
5 #### REALLY Rich cookies , nice homemade taste , quality and softness . Already gone . DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE DIETING !
4 #### We sent four of these cookie bundles to our kids with free gift message . The cookies are good sized and come in a nice variety , and they 're definitely moist with a ' fresh baked ' look , feel , and taste to them . When not on sale I think they 're rather expensive , but for the price I paid ( 25 % off regular price ) I think they were worth it . My only real complaint is that the gift message was printed in small font at the bottom of the packing slip ; not a single one of our kids noticed it , and we got quizzical messages from them asking if we were the ones who sent them the cookies . A separate card or note taped to the top of the tin would have been a much better idea for the gift message . So , if you 're sending them as a gift you pretty much need to let the recipient know that you 're sending them on your own as they most likely wo n't notice the gift message and be left wondering who sent them the cookies .
3 #### The cookies were tasty but the last two levels in the container the cookies were all broken . It arrived a day before they said they would .
5 #### These cookies are delicious ! I will buy them again .
5 #### This was a gift for my 97 year old father in NY . He absolutely loved it . This was his favorite cookies . He recognizes the David name .
5 #### Absolutely perfect gift ! Nothing better than sending a surprise to someone and hearing the joy in their voice when they call ! Of course , mom had to then send me pictures of the cookies they had consumed ! The 2 lb tin of assorted David 's cookies arrived well packaged ! Not one broken cookie ! The cookies were soft , flavorful and tasty ! They enjoyed receiving different flavors and they are already into the second layer ! A total hit ! Thank you ! What a wonderful treat and I will send these again !
5 #### God ! ! ! ! These are so damn good and FRESH so far my favorite is the Oatmeal raisin cookies and the Chocolate chip cookies they 're so good I m definitely ordering more .
4 #### Gave ad a gift . They were fresh and good .
5 #### I 've tried dozens of cookies from on - line companies and David 's are the closest I 've found to homemade . The cookies are not all uniform in size , so they do n't look they were machine made . They arrived well packed and very fresh . The chocolate chunks are generous and the nuts are fresh tasting . The cookies are soft , but not too soft . I have no complaints whatsoever and have already placed 3 more orders to send as gifts .
5 #### I bought these as a gift for my father . He loves them , and says the cookies are delicious . Quick delivery too . A bit pricey , but worth it according to my dad .
5 #### This was my " go to " holiday gift this year . The cookies were reported as " the best ever " by my colleagues , friends and family . Although two of the tins I ordered were dinged up when they arrived , the cookies inside were undamaged . Overall , the price is higher than other cookie sellers but so far , seems to be worth it .
5 #### These are by far the Best Cookies I have ever bought . Usually the label says homemade taste and all I can really tasted is the box mix . However I love " David 's Cookies " . And yes I will recommend these to family and friends and purchase some as gifts . Great , Really Great Cookies ! ! !
5 #### These were sent to a business as a thank you . They loved them .
3 #### Nothing special but an all around good home made cookie .
3 #### no note was delivered with the package my friends did not know they came from me till I called . I ordered these cookies because I have had them before . I thought I ordered chocolate chip cookies , they were assorted .
5 #### Very yummy cookies . Nice assortment . Packed nicely . Arrived on time . Recommended
5 #### Before sending a tin of these cookies to my niece in college I purchased a tin for myself . I wanted to test the quality of the cookie and the reliability of the delivery . The entire experience was fabulous ! There was one serious drawback : I am already thinking about reordering the cookies- for me ! David 's Peanut Butter Cookies are simply incredible . Everyone I shared them with thought they were delicious as well . The tin of cookies will make for a wonderful treat for my niece to share with her friends .
5 #### These cookies are by far the best cookies ever especially this Oatmeal Raisin because I bought before the assorted one but I only liked the Oatmeal Raisin flavor among the others and I came back to order it especially . It 's not too soft it 's not too hard perfect amount of sweat raisins . Go buy it if you like cookies .
1 #### I love your cookies and have ordered another 2 lb . They are wonderful . But this last order was awful . They all tasted the same . Bland . Can not eat them . Will NOT ORDER AGAIN >
5 #### The cookies came on time and packaged nicely . Never mind the fact that the cookies were fresh and delicious .
3 #### This was about the sixth time we ordered the cookies . Very disappointed with this last order . Top layer all broken up . And not as big as they used to be and when we got to the bottom layer they are all crumbled up . Just not what they were before .
3 #### Good cookie more flavors want to try but too expensive
5 #### I have purchased these on three different occasions for gifts and they loved them . They stated they were very good cookies and the containers are nice .
5 #### Delicious Cookies great combination . Only problem is you keep wanting more . Fast delievery and super fresh . A++
5 #### These are my favorite cookies to order and to send to friends . My mother loved them and said they tasted like they were ' just baked ' . I told her that that was how they sent them - just after baking . They fill your hand ; not like some of the ones you order that are so tiny .
4 #### This selection made a nice , presentable gift . The packaging was very good . The cookie was too sweet . I like a crunchier cookie with more shortening . I did like that the cookie was n't a soft cookie .
5 #### The Person seemed to enjoy them they ate them in 2 days loli would have like to try one for myself i guess i will buy again .
5 #### Cookies arrived in record time and were delicious and fresh . Everyone in the office enjoyed them as did I. I 'll be back to purchase more when I 'm able to afford them . They are a little pricey but worth the cost ! ! ! ! ! Thank you ...
5 #### The oatmeal raisin cookies are the best I have ever eaten . I also sent an order to my mother and she agreed ! Thank you for such a wonderful delicious , fresh product .
5 #### As ALWAYS NEVER A DISAPPOINTMENT ! ! David 's products are ALWAYS Fresh & Stay fresh longer than most other cookies .
5 #### These cookies rule ! Fresh as can be and very tasty ! I mailed them to relatives at Christmas with other gifts and guess what they all said ? Those cookies were the best ! Did n't last one day !
5 #### Wonderful cookies , tasted homemade . Very good , big cookues . Saved myou day , I was sick , could not make any , they got them here on time !
4 #### I ordered this as a gift for our resort office staff and they were thrilled ! So thank you for helping me make their holiday season a bit more delicious !
5 #### The cookies were moist and had a lot of raisins . Very good .
5 #### Gave five stars the first time I ordered this , and I 'm giving it Five stars again ! This time I ordered 2 pounds . I 'm ordering more for friends , as Christmas presents .
5 #### Unbelievably great . The best , but pricey . After you cut off the rind , it is a shrinking pound cut .
3 #### Found cookies to be so so and ok . Certainly far from the best . Do nt agree with rave reviews .
5 #### Large homemade style with fresh tasting cookie dough and large chocolate chunks throughout the cookies . Taste delicious .
5 #### My iGourmet order arrived quickly and in perfect condition . The Spanish cheeses are expensive , but of incredible quality and flavor . A quick web search will turn up some fantastic ways to eat each cheese , ranging from marinated in olive oil and herbs ( Idiazabal ) , to served with dried fruits and nuts ( Mahon ) , diced and added to a tomato - based salad ( Murcia al Vino ) , and even coated and fried ( Manchego ) . I definitely recommend picking things that will highlight the flavors of each cheese rather than obscuring them , as these are truly delightful .
5 #### Okay some were broken up but tastes great . Like a bakery ones used to get . I love the double chocolate chip and chocolate chip cookies . Like how they are stacked with paper dividers . I got these on discount for honest opinion . Really are great not too sweet . I will definitely buy more .
5 #### Have sent these to my parents out of state twice now , and they loved the cookies both times . Customer service is wonderful too , I had failed to provide a street address , and they called and emailed me to get one . Great company with a great product . Will definetly order again .
5 #### One of my favorite cheeses . Manchego is mild with a good texture and should appeal to anyone who appreciates real cheese .
5 #### I'M A RETURN CUSTOMER , BECAUSE THESE COOKIES ARE THEEEEE BEST ! ! ! OATMEAL RAISIN & PEANUT BUTTER ONES ARE PERFECT TOO ! ! !
5 #### Once sold in Japan . No longer . Was great to find them online . I am a fan of David 's Cookies . It may be the butter content because they are far more tastier than other chocolate chip cookies . Put them in a microwave for ten seconds and they will melt in your mouth .
5 #### I got this for a gift . Asked him how they were and he said he inhaled them -- figured that meant he liked them .
5 #### Nice tasting cookies that come in an original David 's round tin canister ! ! ! !
2 #### Did not like these . Tastes very sweet that overpowers the flavor of the cookie . Ended up giving them away .
5 #### YUM , Great Tasting , went Great with a Glass of wine & a salad . Thanks
5 #### Great taste ! Arrived in very good shape . Well packaged on shipment . I love this cheese and know it is also free opf additives and healthy to boot !
5 #### A good cheese . A long time favorite eats chicheu . Highly recommended .
5 #### Perfect ! Live in Bush Alaska and had a serious craving for good cheese . The cheese was well packaged and the selection was wonderful . This company truly cares . Thank you .
5 #### This cheese was very very good . It came well wrapped , fresh and in tact . Will order again
5 #### READ ENTIRE REVIEW : FIRST BATCH FROM ORIGINAL ORDER I STATED : " I 'm sure these are probably good tasting cookies but by the time I received them they were stale . I 'm going to have to contact the supplier . " AFTER CONTACTING SUPPLIER : I did contact the supplier and they apologized and sent me a free 1 lb canister of these same cookies and they were wonderful tasting . So , if you love home made oatmeal raisin cookies these are very very good . I like suppliers who pay attention to their customers and I believe the first batch was an anomaly ! Give these cookies a try .
5 #### arrived 2 days ahead of schedule . mouth - watering taste & aroma . very well packaged in tin - 5 layers of five cookies separated by thin cardboard , surrounded by bubblewrap & cellophane . i had ordered the oatmeal - raisin in the past & was very impressed as well . nice metal tin too .
4 #### took to share with my coworkers . they were happy i did n't get even one . bummed out .
5 #### Yes these were wonderful . I sat and ate them by myself while watching a white Christmas , wishing we had snow .. 29 and no snow ! The cookies made it better . White chocolate macadamia cherry . Lots in the tin , layers of them . Worth every penny .
5 #### Nice to try something new . I wish the tin was larger though , but I found the cookies different and interesting .
5 #### I ordered the 24 oatmeal - raisan cookies . These are the softest , freshest , most delicious ones I have ever tasted . Enduldge ! ! !
1 #### The David 's Cookies I bought in Princeton and Menlo Park 25 - 30 years ago were flattish , mis - shapen , came from light brown dough and were very full of chocolate chunks reminiscent of tobler or lindt chocolate . The things that arrived this week were perfectly round , dome - shaped , made from yellow dough , low on chocolate chunks ( which seemed more like baking chocolate ) , WAY too vanilla tasting , and too chewy . Taste - wise , they were similar to vanilla wafers with chunks of baking chocolate . REALLY disappointing ..
1 #### They were dry . Not fresh at all ! Do not waste your money like I did !
5 #### These were a gift , but they received rave reviews from the recipients upon arrival . They recommend warming them briefly in the microwave !
5 #### Excellent taste and texture . Well worth the cost . Packaging was very good . Just be patient on the shipping . Highly recommended .
5 #### The whole family loved this mix ! 1 cheese was not from Spain but we knew they could do that . It was a cheese I had before but it was very good . I had no trouble with that . Anyone wanting to visit a country through their cheese ! WTG
5 #### This was a gift . They raved about how good each flavor was .
4 #### These were a gift . Feedback is the cookies are very tasty . My only issue is the lack of a gift wrap option from the vendor ( when ordering through Amazon ) . I understand why this may be an issue but would think some means of handling this could be created .
5 #### WARNING : chewy and addictive . Those were some of the best cookies I have ever eaten ! ! ! I 'm just disappointed in the fact that I only ordered one tin ... I need more ! ! They were actually ordered as a gift , and thank God the recipient was pleased as well . I will definitely be purchasing in the future . - I had the oatmeal raisin .
5 #### I buy these every year for gifts and everyone raves how good they are .
5 #### We all love this cheese and the shipping packaging is the best we 've seen . So far , we 've eaten 3 orders of this selection of cheeses and the only complaint we have is it taste so good it does n't last long .
5 #### Everyone was impressed and pleased with this assortment . Even the members of my family who are gourmet foodies really liked it . Terrific gift ! :)
2 #### I do n't think these are very good cookies . Not worth the money at all .
5 #### Dare I say that these cookies are every bit as good as most bakeries produce . Yes I dare . These are scrumptious .
5 #### Great gift for someone . Nicely wrapped . Home made looking cookies . Taste awesome .
4 #### Well received on a relative 's birthday . Would have been better if a gift card was available . There was no indication who sent them .
1 #### These were revolting and made everyone sick ! Must ve been spoiled . Gross . We threw away half of them when we realized we were getting nauseated because of them . I do not remotely recommend since you ca nt return food and these were funky and nasty .
5 #### Great tasting cookies . Fast delivery . The cookies come in a nice tin .
5 #### Great aroma blessed me as soon as I opened the well packaged box . They are so fresh . The instructions said if you 're not going to eat within next two to three days , to freeze them . There are six layers of fresh baked , yummie , scrumptuous cookies . I ordered the variety package . I can hardly wait to taste all the different flavors . I will definitely be ordering these cookies again . Great job !
5 #### This oil is light and delicate yet flavorful . Not the most robust oil I 've tried , but that 's not always desirable anyway . I will be buying this oil again and I recommend it to anyone who cooks with olive oil often .
5 #### This was used as a gift . They truly enjoyed the wonderful cookies .
5 #### Pretty gouda stuff . One of the cheddar products we have tried to date . Nice packaging and arrived in very good condition . The cheeses may vary from sampler to sampler I do n't know ... Ours had gouda , roquefort , cheddar and what looks like swiss . We have tried the cheddar and it was very very good , quite sharp and tasty albeit a bit on the crumbly side . Trying the others a bit at a time as we go along . Great for sandwiches and mouse traps .
5 #### Once you taste the cheeses inclued in this set , you will never buy regular cheese from the supermarket again ... Welcome to gourmet cheese ... simply one of the best cheeses in my opinion ... highly recommended ...
5 #### I sent these to my daughter . She loves them and I wanted to cheer her up while she is in school , they arrived badly broken . When they contacted me to thank me for my business I told them they arrived broken . They sent her another tin of cookies ASAP ! Thanks so much 5 stars just great costumer service and a fantastic cookie
5 #### These cookies are so tasty and chewy and fresh ! ! Tastes so homemade ! ! I just received my second tin of the m&m 's cookies .. equally as good !
5 #### These cookies are delicious . There are many chocolate chips and the cookies are nice and soft . The packaging is good and keeps the cookies fresh even after the can is opened . If you are a cookie monster like me you will be happy with this .
5 #### Ordered as a Birthday gift & the recipient loved these cookies . They were gone quickly . Would order these again !
5 #### Love these cookies ! ! Great taste , packaged well , not a broken one in the bunch .
3 #### These were just okay . I ordered some of the jumbo peanut butter cookies about a week before I ordered these I think . Those were delicious and fresh . These cookies were not as fresh as my first order with the company . I made my first order directly from their site , but I ordered these through Amazon . I 'm going to place another order directly from their site to see if that makes a difference as far as quality goes .
5 #### I ordered these twice and in both cases the people loves them !
5 #### Seem very Fresh ! Delicious and soft . Recommend ordering from Amazon rather than other places , much fresher here .
1 #### You would be better off making them yourself ... even if you got it wrong it would be better than this stuff ..... Save your money and time .. zero stars .. and that 's to much ...
5 #### Did n't have these myself - I sent them to coworkers in another state . They thanked me for doing that , so they must have been fine ;)
5 #### Great ! Finished off the tin in one setting with 4 people ! Everyone loved them . My favorite was the oatmeal which surprised me because usually I like choc chip better . All of the cookies were wonderful
4 #### I sent them to my son . He lobtf them .
5 #### The cookies were awesome and fresh , I really enjoyed them ! They arrived fast and on time and was wrapped really well . I will definitely be ordering more !
5 #### The cookies arrived in a timely fashion and they were packaged well enough that the cookies were each non crumbled . These cookies were absolutely delicious and should be considered addictive . I will definitely purchase more cookies from this vendor ; in fact , I already have .
5 #### I ordered a 2 pound tin of assorted David 's cookies for a 95 - year - old birthday girl . She and her family and birthday guests say that every type of those cookies is delicious -- can not pick out a favorite . So I guess I 'll have to keep sending the assortment ! Thank you for making my dear friends so happy !
2 #### Not that great . Certainly not worth the cost . To be honest , the recipe on the back of a bag of tollhouse chocolate chips makes a far better , far fresher cookie . I would n't waste my money on these .
5 #### Excellent Cookies . We ate them very quickly and yes I will have to reorder .
5 #### The recipients were very pleased with these cookies . Just like , or better than homemade and such a nice assortment !
5 #### Amazing ! Fresh and delicious . The cookies were soft exactly the way I like them .
1 #### Cookies were not bake right . It was like eating raw cookie dough .
1 #### Fifty percent of the cookies arrived broken in pieces ! Some of the cookies were not that good(Peanut Butter , Macadamia White Chunk ) . My local Publix Supermarket has better cookies at a fraction of the price ! All considered , not worth the price !
5 #### Fresh . Packaged great . Love the tin canister can be used for anything to keep junk in . These are fresh baked and I mean fresh . They smelled warm and they were right out of the ovens . The packing is wonderful also . Very safe . These are almost on par with the special cookies that you find in the malls . BUT you wo n't find the freshness in them unless you catch them when they 're first taking them out of the oven .
3 #### I did n't enjoy them because they are to soft , I gave then away Plus they took forever to arruve
5 #### These were a gift to a cookie monster of a guy ... He loved them . Delivery was a little delayed but the address was very rural , so it 's not unexpected .
3 #### too sweet . Not that tasty . But i am comparing to Mrs Fields .
5 #### I ENJOYED THE COOKIES VERY MUCH , ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE PRESERVATIVE FREE . I PLAN TO PLACE ANOTHER ORDER .
5 #### Without a doubt , the best cookies ever . I purchased the variety tin to see which I liked the best . Oatmeal raisin were my favorite but would n't refuse any of them . Large cookies , chewy and delicious and the chocolate chip ones had huge hunks of chocolate . I honestly rate these a A++++ .
5 #### Excellent variety of cookies . They arrived on the day promised . Sent as a gift ... they loved them !
5 #### David 's Cookies did it again ! These cookies were delicious and delivered on time ! Thank you David 's , you certainly have a return customer !
5 #### I 've purchased 8 tins of the large soft assortment and ate them all myself . They are incredible .
5 #### I sent these to my niece in N.C. She said they were delicious .
5 #### Freshly backed and soft and chewy . What 's not to love . The arrive very fast and I could have sworn I felt the heat from the cookies when I opened the tin can . :)
5 #### These are the best cookies . They arrived moist !
5 #### Cookies came package very well and might I add delicious cookies nice and soft I had to place another order love them .
5 #### I ordered these as gifts for friends and when I asked to try one , were already gone ! ! ! Everyone loved them !
1 #### Items not as represented on the description . I ordered this exclusively for the Chimay cheese , and I did not receive . Instead I was given a substitute without even a heads up prior to shipment and this is non - returnable . Buyer beware
3 #### We were looking forward to the beer cheese in this pub cheese kit , it was NOT here ! They substituted Kings Cheese for it !
5 #### Love cheese , almost all types of cheese . These are particularly excellent . Each has its own distinct flavor the one with mustard seed makes an excellent grilled ham and cheese sandwich no actual mustard needed .
5 #### My daughter and her new husband have the problem of converting two complete households into a single one , so I was confounded when seeking a wedding gift for them . I finally settled on the Pub Cheese Assortment as something they could enjoy that would not add to the complexity . Not only did they enjoy it , but they served the cheeses to guests at a wine - tasting , who also loved the different cheeses and insisted on knowing where they found them ! It could easily become my favorite wedding gift , as well as my favorite way to enjoy learning more about cheeses I ca n't find in my local supermarket . I highly recommend this assortment as well as many others offered by Amazon.com . My own plan is to try them all !
5 #### so love cookies but do n't have time to bake them these are heavenly just right texture great with a glass of milk or cup of coffee . If you treat your dog to a tiny bite ( no more ) pick out the chocolate bits . ( about the size of a quarter ) for a hundred pound rottie it 's fine . Enjoy ! beautifully presented and packed to stay moist ! Do n't forget that raisins are poison to dogs so no oatmeal raisin for Fido please !
5 #### This is a very good cheese . It has little " crystals " in it that I 've found are a marker of good cheese . The crystals have a lot of flavor in them and add a nice texture . The cheese is pretty strong . It 's not overly smelly either . I ate it straight mostly , but one night I heated some cream and added the cheese and it made a great cheesy sauce that I ate with chicken .
1 #### I am not a cheese expert . I do like a variety of cheese from around the world and I like to try new things . My favorites so far are sharp cheddars , fontina , havarti , edam , cottswald , brie , and port . I tell you this because if you are of a similar palate you will want to steer clear of this cheese!!!It It is extremely pungent , with a nutty like flavor , odiforous , and somewhat gritty to the feel . It also takes a long time to get the taste out of ones mouth . Yes , even after brushing ! ! ! ACK ! ! I would only recommend this cheese to people who knew what they were doing . My family and friends detested it . It was gross .
5 #### Since I have visited the town of Gouda , NL ( pronounced " How - da " in Dutch ) , I had the opportunity to taste the different processed Gouda cheeses . My favorite of all are the aged Gouda cheeses , they have a rich buttery flavor made from the cows milk in the Netherlands ; even the medium aged Gouda cheese is very good , a little softer , but it still has the rich buttery flavor . I was so excited to see that Amazon was carrying their products .
5 #### I ordered three pounds of the Double Aged Gouda . Instead of coming in one pound wedges , it came in several smaller plastic wrapped cuts . As it turns out , this was a good thing . This cheese is well aged and delicious , a perfect snacking cheese . It is slightly hard , yet still easy to cut , and creamy and rich on the palate . It is sharp , but not overly strong . Lately , I have taken to eating it in small slivers all by itself . The last package I sampled while watching the late shows , I ended up eating the entire wedge . LOL ! This is good cheese . I am currently on my second order , and I will definitely reorder this again . UPDATE : I have found that this cheese makes a great grating or shredded cheese in lieu of sharp cheddar . I have used it grated to top homemade salads . I plan on using it shredded within the rice mixture and on top of stuffed green peppers . This is a very versatile cheese .
5 #### Sent David 's cookies as a gift to my son in college . He loved them .
5 #### the best I could have not got anything else better freshly and the taste is awesome
5 #### All of David 's Cookies baked goods are delicious but I 'm a peanut butter devotee and their Peanut Butter Cookies are delicious ! There are no nuts in it , instead there are peanut butter chips -- biting into one of those with the soft , rich PB Cookie surrounding them , is beyond wonderful !
4 #### Ordered the pecan / chocolate chunk . Cookies were hard and without flavor . Contacted seller , who responded immediately . Second shipment is wonderful : cookies are soft and taste great . Giving 4 stars because customers should n't have to complain to receive a superb product .
5 #### The first time I bought David 's cookies , was from HSN and I have a standing order with them . I get them every month but this David Tin , is great same cookies , Great Taste , same texture , over all the best cookie I have ever had . I highly recommend this cookie . I 'm a Cookie Monster from way back and I know my cookies ; * )
5 #### I was with ebay and the quality did not meet
4 #### The Peanut butter Cookies are Pretty good but not great , the chips make it a little too much , probably would prefer them without the chips ...
5 #### These are really delicious ! Taste like they just came out of the oven !
3 #### I purchase 2lbs of this M&M cookie product as a christmas gift . When I tasted the cookies when I went over to that person , I was embarrassed by the cookies being too hard and overbaked . It was n't terrible , mind you ... but I 've tasted better at Wegman 's . If i had know these cookies were like this , I 'd just have bought some freshly made cookies at Wegman 's and just wrap it . To be fair , this may be normal . perhaps I just got a bad batch . I dunno . But as of today , this rating stands .
5 #### Always fresh and delicious ! A winner with every cookie lover .
5 #### They were good have a good buttery taste to it
5 #### Cookies were fresh and tasty . Just wish it there were more , maybe 2.5 pounds for the price . Very close to homemade .
5 #### I have tried so many different brands of cookies from Amazon and I have to admit : David 's cookies are SOOO delicious ! I purchased two orders of these cookies ( Variety and Chocolate Chunk ) , in less than a month . They are so soft and a great size ! The orders came to my house early , without the cookies being crushed and/or in pieces . So far , these are the BEST cookies I have tried on Amazon !
5 #### The cookies are fresh and absolutely delicious . Some people preferred a cookie that 's a bit softer . The advertisement says that they 're " soft - baked " , but I guess the meaning can vary . I would order them again , and recommend them to my friends .
5 #### Sent these to my sister . She loved them Next I 'm ordering them for myself
5 #### This is an excellent product & the seller is OUTSTANDING . We ordered 9 of these for our clients , and had them delivered a couple of days before Christmas . They were delivered promptly , when promised , and before the holiday . The quality of the baked goods and the presentation were top notch . The clients RAVED . Excellent value for the money ! Excellent baked goods at almost any price . Also , some of the best customer service around from this seller . Kudos all round !
5 #### Ate them all with in three days . Way too good
4 #### I wish I had left out oat meal , their flavor was not good and I do not know if there were white chocolate but if that was what they were they did not stand up in flavor like others I have had . All in all we liked the peanut butter and chocolate chip . I do wish I bought just the two flavorss as did others .
5 #### I got them for my wife for christmas and she loves them .
5 #### I purchased these cookies for my boyfriend he said they they were very soft and delicious
5 #### Everyone we sent this to as a gift responded with , " We love these cookies ! " Just buy them ...
5 #### An excellent choice for Holiday Gifts . Made all my friends very happy .
5 #### YUM ! The whole family found a cookie they liked . Fresh tasting ... definitely worth the cost ! The cherry & white chocolate chunk was my favorite ! I must add - All of the cookies were delicious ! Excellent for the holidays , to have around the house or to give as a gift . I will buy more in the future !
5 #### This was a gift , came in a cute tin for the holidays . The recipient told me the cookies were " great " and she is a cookie lover !
5 #### I hate to say just how good they were ... I am wearing about 5 lbs more from them .. Delicious , fresh , like home - made ( actually better ) .. the Chocolate chip are AMAZING and the Peanut butter were fought over by my family ... great buy .. would make an amazing gift
2 #### Most of the cookies tasted ok . The main problem was that many of the cookies were broken . Add to the that the bottom layer was very stale . This was to be a nice snack gift but turned out bad . First and Last time ever ordering from this company .
5 #### The best Foods come in small packages , the whole Family Loves these Treats .
3 #### Cookies tasted good , but poor packing and presentation is not what we have previously experienced from David 's Cookies . Received some odd shaped , broken cookies .
5 #### Was a gift ......... said they were VERY good . Fast delivery ; would buy again .
5 #### REALLY Rich cookies , nice homemade taste , quality and softness . Already gone . DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE DIETING !
4 #### We sent four of these cookie bundles to our kids with free gift message . The cookies are good sized and come in a nice variety , and they 're definitely moist with a ' fresh baked ' look , feel , and taste to them . When not on sale I think they 're rather expensive , but for the price I paid ( 25 % off regular price ) I think they were worth it . My only real complaint is that the gift message was printed in small font at the bottom of the packing slip ; not a single one of our kids noticed it , and we got quizzical messages from them asking if we were the ones who sent them the cookies . A separate card or note taped to the top of the tin would have been a much better idea for the gift message . So , if you 're sending them as a gift you pretty much need to let the recipient know that you 're sending them on your own as they most likely wo n't notice the gift message and be left wondering who sent them the cookies .
3 #### The cookies were tasty but the last two levels in the container the cookies were all broken . It arrived a day before they said they would .
5 #### This was a gift for my 97 year old father in NY . He absolutely loved it . This was his favorite cookies . He recognizes the David name .
5 #### Absolutely perfect gift ! Nothing better than sending a surprise to someone and hearing the joy in their voice when they call ! Of course , mom had to then send me pictures of the cookies they had consumed ! The 2 lb tin of assorted David 's cookies arrived well packaged ! Not one broken cookie ! The cookies were soft , flavorful and tasty ! They enjoyed receiving different flavors and they are already into the second layer ! A total hit ! Thank you ! What a wonderful treat and I will send these again !
5 #### I 've tried dozens of cookies from on - line companies and David 's are the closest I 've found to homemade . The cookies are not all uniform in size , so they do n't look they were machine made . They arrived well packed and very fresh . The chocolate chunks are generous and the nuts are fresh tasting . The cookies are soft , but not too soft . I have no complaints whatsoever and have already placed 3 more orders to send as gifts .
5 #### I bought these as a gift for my father . He loves them , and says the cookies are delicious . Quick delivery too . A bit pricey , but worth it according to my dad .
5 #### This was my " go to " holiday gift this year . The cookies were reported as " the best ever " by my colleagues , friends and family . Although two of the tins I ordered were dinged up when they arrived , the cookies inside were undamaged . Overall , the price is higher than other cookie sellers but so far , seems to be worth it .
5 #### These are by far the Best Cookies I have ever bought . Usually the label says homemade taste and all I can really tasted is the box mix . However I love " David 's Cookies " . And yes I will recommend these to family and friends and purchase some as gifts . Great , Really Great Cookies ! ! !
3 #### Nothing special but an all around good home made cookie .
3 #### no note was delivered with the package my friends did not know they came from me till I called . I ordered these cookies because I have had them before . I thought I ordered chocolate chip cookies , they were assorted .
5 #### Very yummy cookies . Nice assortment . Packed nicely . Arrived on time . Recommended
5 #### Before sending a tin of these cookies to my niece in college I purchased a tin for myself . I wanted to test the quality of the cookie and the reliability of the delivery . The entire experience was fabulous ! There was one serious drawback : I am already thinking about reordering the cookies- for me ! David 's Peanut Butter Cookies are simply incredible . Everyone I shared them with thought they were delicious as well . The tin of cookies will make for a wonderful treat for my niece to share with her friends .
5 #### These cookies are by far the best cookies ever especially this Oatmeal Raisin because I bought before the assorted one but I only liked the Oatmeal Raisin flavor among the others and I came back to order it especially . It 's not too soft it 's not too hard perfect amount of sweat raisins . Go buy it if you like cookies .
1 #### I love your cookies and have ordered another 2 lb . They are wonderful . But this last order was awful . They all tasted the same . Bland . Can not eat them . Will NOT ORDER AGAIN >
3 #### This was about the sixth time we ordered the cookies . Very disappointed with this last order . Top layer all broken up . And not as big as they used to be and when we got to the bottom layer they are all crumbled up . Just not what they were before .
3 #### Good cookie more flavors want to try but too expensive
5 #### Delicious Cookies great combination . Only problem is you keep wanting more . Fast delievery and super fresh . A++
5 #### These are my favorite cookies to order and to send to friends . My mother loved them and said they tasted like they were ' just baked ' . I told her that that was how they sent them - just after baking . They fill your hand ; not like some of the ones you order that are so tiny .
4 #### This selection made a nice , presentable gift . The packaging was very good . The cookie was too sweet . I like a crunchier cookie with more shortening . I did like that the cookie was n't a soft cookie .
5 #### Wonderful cookies , tasted homemade . Very good , big cookues . Saved myou day , I was sick , could not make any , they got them here on time !
5 #### Okay some were broken up but tastes great . Like a bakery ones used to get . I love the double chocolate chip and chocolate chip cookies . Like how they are stacked with paper dividers . I got these on discount for honest opinion . Really are great not too sweet . I will definitely buy more .
5 #### Have sent these to my parents out of state twice now , and they loved the cookies both times . Customer service is wonderful too , I had failed to provide a street address , and they called and emailed me to get one . Great company with a great product . Will definetly order again .
5 #### I'M A RETURN CUSTOMER , BECAUSE THESE COOKIES ARE THEEEEE BEST ! ! ! OATMEAL RAISIN & PEANUT BUTTER ONES ARE PERFECT TOO ! ! !
5 #### Once sold in Japan . No longer . Was great to find them online . I am a fan of David 's Cookies . It may be the butter content because they are far more tastier than other chocolate chip cookies . Put them in a microwave for ten seconds and they will melt in your mouth .
5 #### I got this for a gift . Asked him how they were and he said he inhaled them -- figured that meant he liked them .
5 #### Nice tasting cookies that come in an original David 's round tin canister ! ! ! !
2 #### Did not like these . Tastes very sweet that overpowers the flavor of the cookie . Ended up giving them away .
5 #### READ ENTIRE REVIEW : FIRST BATCH FROM ORIGINAL ORDER I STATED : " I 'm sure these are probably good tasting cookies but by the time I received them they were stale . I 'm going to have to contact the supplier . " AFTER CONTACTING SUPPLIER : I did contact the supplier and they apologized and sent me a free 1 lb canister of these same cookies and they were wonderful tasting . So , if you love home made oatmeal raisin cookies these are very very good . I like suppliers who pay attention to their customers and I believe the first batch was an anomaly ! Give these cookies a try .
5 #### arrived 2 days ahead of schedule . mouth - watering taste & aroma . very well packaged in tin - 5 layers of five cookies separated by thin cardboard , surrounded by bubblewrap & cellophane . i had ordered the oatmeal - raisin in the past & was very impressed as well . nice metal tin too .
5 #### Nice to try something new . I wish the tin was larger though , but I found the cookies different and interesting .
5 #### I ordered the 24 oatmeal - raisan cookies . These are the softest , freshest , most delicious ones I have ever tasted . Enduldge ! ! !
1 #### The David 's Cookies I bought in Princeton and Menlo Park 25 - 30 years ago were flattish , mis - shapen , came from light brown dough and were very full of chocolate chunks reminiscent of tobler or lindt chocolate . The things that arrived this week were perfectly round , dome - shaped , made from yellow dough , low on chocolate chunks ( which seemed more like baking chocolate ) , WAY too vanilla tasting , and too chewy . Taste - wise , they were similar to vanilla wafers with chunks of baking chocolate . REALLY disappointing ..
5 #### Your name does n't have to be David to find a big old grin on your face at the sight of the bright red tin that says " David 's Cookies " ! Two delicous pounds of homemade - good cookies . Just enough for one big kid and a gallon of milk . Indulge . Smile . Meet ya at the playground : )
5 #### We recently received a gift basket that included these David 's Cookies Butter Pecan Meltaways . These were by far the favorite thing in the basket and did n't last long once my kids got a hold of them . These are very similar to " Russian Tea Cookies " and go great with hot tea . These are very buttery and the pecans flavor is just perfect . They also literally melt in your mouth . And now for the bad news , each cookie has 80 Calories and 7 Carbs ... but my wife says they were worth it . Highly Recommended ! CFH
3 #### As I wrote above with a similar product , they were not what I expected , The best were my last mother 's , and Whole Food s are also really goood .
4 #### Kinda dry but good with coffee . They are fresh , however Davids cookies asst . is the bomb ! Best mix ever ! Everyone raved about them . Not so much these however .
5 #### OMG , if you have never tried these , you must . I accidentally got a box I meant to send to my mom for Christmas , so we had to eat it ... These are highly addictive and PACKED with pecans !
3 #### I 've ordered these before but this time the cookies are very dry , crumbly , and seem darker than usual ( maybe over cooked ? ) so I 'm sorry I ordered such a large tin .
2 #### These are delicious just like Homemade cookies except there were only a few whole ones in each 1/4 of the can and the ones under those were all crumbs ... or just bits of cookies ? 20.99 for 20 oz ? ? I asked for a refund !
4 #### Nice cookie , not too sweet . Pecan favor was not real strong .
1 #### What a disappointment ! Nothing like the pecan meltaways I have every Christmas . Hard as a rock , these meltaways appear to be even fire resistant , much less melt - in - your - mouth good . Maybe I 'll save this expensive disaster until spring and repave the driveway with them . No more David 's .
3 #### I defy you to find a nut like those pictured . The actual size of the nuts in the cookies is crumb size ..... cookies taste fine ....
3 #### somehow worse than in their standard long cardboard boxes I have been buying for years
5 #### Like to treat the ladies at the local mani / pedi spa and they very much enjoyed these cookies . Checked them out to make sure they were not all in crumbles and they were fine . Have had them in the past and find generally to be delicious .
5 #### Better than expected , these cookies arrived fresh , not broken , and are melt - in - your - mouth good . Will order them again .
5 #### THESE ARE THE BEST COOKIES EVER . THESE COOKIES ARE MY WEAKNESS !
3 #### These cookies were OK but were not what we are used to . I thought they would be more of what we know as Russian Tea Cakes but they were not . Dryer , not very sweet , and pretty much a waste of $ $ $ . Thought it would be a treat , and they do not look like the photos on the front of the tin . They eatable but will not be reordered .
1 #### It had very little convection sugar coating and about a 1/2 + of crumbs . Not tasty at all .
5 #### My husband , unfortunately , has eaten most of these . I did manage to snatch a few . Yummy cookies !
5 #### Two pounds of cake for $ 20 including shipping sounds like a good deal so I thought I 'd give it a try . I 'm glad I did . These two bite crumbly cake / cookies are delicious . The butter and pecan flavors are subtle - do n't expect shortcake sweetness . They accompany both tea and coffee perfectly . The only problem I have with them is that they are very crumbly . I was breaking off a piece for my 18 month old grand daughter and the thing just exploded all over the place . She loved it though . So did the dogs . The wife has eaten about half of these already in a couple of days . I plan on buying more stuff from David soon .
5 #### My husband must have eaten 1/2 of the tin when he opened these ... he said not to buy another one for some time as he has to work the calories off ... they are light , flavorful , and perfect . Fresh , not stale , and they came super fast . I would buy from this seller again !
1 #### I usually loves these cookies but last batch were flavorless . What happened David ?
5 #### So yummy ! They arrived fresh and nicely packaged . Delicious
5 #### Arrived fresh and amazing , fully powdered and delicious . They were a bit on the thick side but were still very good . The flavor is definitely right and they can be hard to stop eating . Love them .
5 #### Mine Mother love them very much : ): ) I will be order more next month
5 #### Such yummy cookies ! ! Makes a wonderful and appreciated gift for any time of the season .
5 #### Omg they are delicious . Impressed with the taste . Not to sweet just right .
5 #### I usually bake and mail this cookie to my mom ... I have n't been able to do that so looked on Amazon to see what they had ! These had mostly good reviews but also some negative ones but crossed my fingers and ordered ... I was very relieved to hear they are beautiful and tasty ...
3 #### I make a version of these for the holidays . My version is sweet , buttery , and crumble in your mouth . These are basically like Keebler Pecan Sandies rolled in powdered sugar . They 're " ok " ... but not worth the price you pay here .
3 #### Cookies were in good shape for the most part . We expected some breakage . These were a gift for my Mom and they made her very happy . Could have used a little more powdered sugar on some but overall a good gift .
5 #### 3 : 52 in the morning . Ca n't sleep , so what am I doing when I saw a request to review your cookies ? EATING your cookies ! How coincidental is that ? Yes , I love the cookies , a bit addictive , so have to watch myself and limit how many I eat at a time . Almost as good as the Pecan thumbprint my mom would make with icing , but then always hard to beat those homemade goodies she made . Love yours , are they made by a mom ? Lol
5 #### These cookies are very tasty . Perfect snack . Packaged very well , too .
5 #### These were a Birthday Gift for my son . And he said they were delicious . Thank You David 's and Amazon
5 #### Best cookies ever ! A little pricey , but worth it .
5 #### " There are few hours in life more agreeable than the hour dedicated to the ceremony known as afternoon tea . " -Henry James , Portrait of a Lady This " English Breakfast " style tea is quite satisfying and has a rich flavor that is quite delicious . I 'd like to say that their teas are best steeped for an extra 5 - 10 minutes to draw out all the delicious flavors . You can use a teapot or a coffee maker to make tea . Simply put the tea in a coffee filter or the tea bags in the coffee pot , then allow the boiling water to drip over the tea leaves . The sensual blend of exotic spices , teas and herbs used in their teas include a mixture of the following : Black tea , green tea , hibiscus flowers , chamomile flowers , lemongrass , spearmint leaves , blackberry leaves , cinnamon , Rooibos , Gingerroot , rose hips , orange peel , rose petals , licorice root , safflowers , black pepper , lemon verbena leaves , cardamom , cloves , peppermint leaves , chicory , sarsaparilla root , lemon balm leaf , star anise and red poppy flowers . This is a blend of black teas , but all their teas are worth trying . Passion and Chai are also favorites . ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### These cookies are delicious ! Just like " Mexican Wedding Cakes " , which is a big favorite in our family . The round tin container was much larger than expected , and included four sections filled with these yummy cookies . Nice presentation - will order this again !
4 #### These are very tender cookies that melt in your mouth . We liked them .
5 #### This is an excellent product & the seller is OUTSTANDING . We ordered 9 of these for our clients , and had them delivered a couple of days before Christmas . They were delivered promptly , when promised , and before the holiday . The quality of the baked goods and the presentation were top notch . The clients RAVED . Excellent value for the money ! Excellent baked goods at almost any price . Also , some of the best customer service around from this seller . Kudos all round !
5 #### Thank you This is so close to what I make The cookies are just a little harder than mine but yours are so good
5 #### The best tea I have ever had . I miss being able to buy it at Starbucks , so much . It was my daily " treat " . Now , I have it at home ! I am of British ancestry and I know good tea . This is the best !
2 #### This brand of tea felt stronger in the past . Now it feels more ordinary . Relative to other teas I have consumed , this one has no flavor whatsoever . It is not even Organic , but that 's okay as it was never advertised as such . I will not be buying it again .
5 #### One of the strongest ( caffeine - wise ) teas i have tried . I love that it does not give me the ' caffeine jitters ' the way that coffee does . Just Let it sit in hot water for 5 minutes and this tea quickly shows why it is called " Awake " . :) I think it goes best when milk and sugar are added . ( some people may prefer creamer and sweetener ) . It does n't say it on the package but Starbucks is the mastermind behind this brew .
5 #### I 've been trying to ween myself off of pop , both diet & regular . And since I still need that caffeine pick up , I figured I 'd give this a try . Very nice tea taste that is n't too strong , I drink it chilled & unsweetened .
1 #### It takes 2 teabags of this to make a single 12 - oz cup of tea steeping for 5 minutes . Overpriced and expensive tea -- that does n't even taste very good and has no fragrance whatsoever . I 'm going to post this review to every TAZO AWAKE listing on amazon.com that I can find , so others are n't taken in by Tazo 's hype . ( Purchased at my local grocery store . Not an expired package . )

Not an expired package . )
5 #### I like this tea a lot . It has full bodied black tea flavor , and only a little bit of bitterness . It 's the perfect tea to start off your morning or to drink as a pick me up in the afternoon . I usually add a bit of soy or almond milk to it , and a bit of sugar to combat the bitterness . It is much less bitter than other plain black teas I have tried .
5 #### These cookies arrived fresh and on time . They are light and wonderful with a hot beverage . Not overly sweet .
5 #### We found these cookies to be outstanding . First , the cookies are divided into four mini - trays to reduce breakage and crumbling . Second , the inner trays were tightly plastic sealed to ensure freshness . And , of course , they come in a pretty , sturdy , tin . They tasted fantastic . I ca n't believe how fast the tin was emptied at work . This is two pounds of cookies ! I 'm very happy with product , and will definitely be repeating my purchase .
5 #### This tea is strong works great to start your day . A boost of caffeine . I drink one cup only a day . So If I did n't sleep well or feel a little run down , I go for this tea works great almost as good as coffee with less caffeine .
5 #### I disagree that this tea is too strong . I am a real tea connoisseur , I have teas of all kinds from all over the world , but first thing in the morning ? I always come back to Tazo Awake tea . It 's not too in your face strength - wise , it tastes smooth and delicious with a little sweetener , and it wakes me up . I have chai and green and red this and that , and Twinings and PG Tips , and The Mariage from France , but in the morning this is my bread and butter . It 's just the perfect cup of tea for me , period .
1 #### I got this at starbucks once and it was flavorless , so I bought the teabags myself , thinking it would taste better . I 've used up to 3 teabags at a time and it 's still WEAK and flavorless . I m caffeine sensitive and this tea does n't seem as high in caffeine as it says it is . It did n't cause any heart palpitations or anything . Try PG tips tea bags- it 's WAY better , strong and robust
3 #### English Breakfast tea is my go to morning drink . It 's smooth and subtle while providing the early caffeine boost . Tazo 's Awake version is sort of a letdown . It does n't taste as full as some of the other brands . Not much different in taste and affect than a bulk store black tea . I also got Tazo 's earl grey which was better . Overall not a bad experience but ill stick with more traditional brands for my black teas .
2 #### With its new - look packaging , Tazo also reformulated the Awake tea blend . The old blend was strong , robust , and biting . It was by far my favorite bagged black tea . The new blend is weaker and maltier ; it is sadly reminiscent of standard Lipton tea . If I want Lipton tea , I 'll buy Lipton tea ; it 's a lot cheaper than Tazo . I know that many people found the old blend to be too bitter . Tazo apparently decided that they 'd gain more customers than they 'd lose if they toned down the flavor . I do n't know if they 're right , but they 've definitely lost me .
5 #### whenever my daughter feels like she needs a pick me up tea then this is her choice to go to .
5 #### Was sent as a gift ... They said they like them
5 #### Better than I expected . I read a few reviews that said the cookies were not " fresh " . That was not my case . They were extremely fresh ! In fact they did melt in your mouth . These are very traditional , homemade tasting cookies that are a special treat . They are very buttery . I thought they might be too sweet with the powdered sugar , however , that is not the case . Large amount of cookies in one tin . Great gift for yourself or others anytime of the year . I really love these and will order them again .
5 #### Absolutely delicious ! ! The texture was a little different from the cookies I remember Mom making but actually , I liked it better . I went through them so fast I have ordered two more cans . Yum , Yum , Yum ! !
5 #### Really fresh , buttery crisp cookies made holiday gatherings extra special . Super fast shipping . Cookies packed well and arrived with none broken . Thanks so much !
5 #### Fresh cookies . None broken . Brought back memories of Mom 's cookies !
5 #### Great gift for Mom 's birthday . She has been sharing with friends . Fast delivery .
5 #### My mother used to make " pecan sandies " every Christmas . They were crescent shaped cookies with pecans and really did melt in your mouth . I have purchased many cookies over the years since she passed , trying to find something that came close with no luck . These " David Meltaways " are so close to my mothers that when I ate my first one I was hit with such a wave of nostalgia that I literally cried . This has really made my Christmas to finally find the " perfect " cookie my Mom used to make .
5 #### Sent to my grandkids ... they said these cookies were very very good !
5 #### I 've ordered three tins of these Butter Pecan Meltaways --and will be ordering more for Xmas presents . Fresh and delicious !
4 #### Do n't expect these cookies to melt in your mouth . They do n't have that moist , buttery goodness I was expecting . However , they are very nice tasting albeit crumbly . The tin came slightly scratched and dented . If you 're planning on purchasing these cookies as a gift , be aware the packaging might not be perfect .
1 #### These are -- were -- our favorite holiday cookies . We ordered them three times last Christmas , and now again , just a few weeks ago . The first two times we ordered them last year , they were perfect : whole cookies covered in white powdered sugar , just as pictured on the tin cover . The third time last year , and now this year : not so much . About half of the cookies are broken and there is almost no powdered sugar at all : just two tins full of broken brown lumps . I guess I 'm the definition of " insane " -- doing the same thing over and over again but hoping for a different result . When these cookies are good , they 're very , very good . When they 're bad , they 're horrid .
5 #### Wonderful ! Cookies arrived earlier that scheduled and they arrived in mint condition ! No crumbs ! Taste great ! Definitely will purchase again especially since they are low calories !
5 #### The cookies are delicious ! They arrived in a finely made tin without damage or dents , cookies undamaged and whole ,
5 #### These are so good ! I look for these locally in my Costco store around the holidays . They are not the most healthy but damn they are delicious ! I had a friend in another state that needed some cheering up and these were a well received gift . I recommend them completely for yourself to devour or to send to someone you love .
1 #### Very disappointed because the majority of the cookies were cookie dust .
5 #### These cookies are so delicious that I have given up making them myself . They have the perfect balance of soft and crunchy and truly taste homemade . They stay fresh a good while , but as they are a family favorite , they disappear as soon as the tin is opened . These cookies are the only treat that every member of the family likes . I sent these to my elderly parents and they also enjoyed them very much . They make a great gift for hard - to - buy - for people as they come in an attractive tin with pretty mylar foil for a nice presentation .
5 #### My mother loved these and she can find something to complain about most gifts she receives . So thank you for finally satisfying that old bat .
5 #### I sent these to my parents in Louisiana and they loved them . I have sent cookies from David 's Cookies multiple times , fast delivery and great quality . A nice treat for my family out of state .
5 #### The best tasting butter Pecan Meltaways ever ! ! ! nicely packaged . not alot of broken or crumbly cookies . Big plus in my book .
4 #### Very good cookies . Not as moist as homemade but delicious if you do n't want to bake them yourself .
5 #### I purchased these cookies for our niece she loves David 's cookies and these are her favorites . I have been buying David 's for years from HSN . We thought we would give these a try from amazon because I could get them on prime and they will ship in a couple days . :) They arrived fresh and she loved them . She said they were all in one piece not crumbly . Thanks David 's & Amazon for having these available for us . Hope you will offer many more David 's on Prime in the future . :) I also just received these as a gift and they are so nice not one crumb in the tin they are packed so well to keep them in one piece . I will freeze some of these for eating later . :)
5 #### These are the first pecan " meltaways " that are almost as good as mine . I make them for Christmas every year . My recipe is over 100 years old . I use more pecans in mine . These are the only pecan " balls " ( which is what mine are called ) that nice crispy pecans . Most of this type of cookie that I have bought in the past , have pecan dust ! David 's are the best I have bought . I am sure I will buy them again !
4 #### They were delicious , good quality and quantity for the price and arrived on time ! A win , win !
5 #### These cookies are absolutely delicious ! I 've been looking for this type cookie ( I used to bake them until I got old < grin > ) and previously was very disappointed . These do not disappoint ... they are so good they are addictive ! Thankfully there are a lot of them in this tin because nobody eats just one . They also have a long shelf life so last a long time . They can also be frozen for 6 months . David 's recommends eating their OTHER cookies like pecan chocolate chip , etc . in 3 or 4 days so it 's another reason why I like these so much . I take these to any meetings or Christmas parties we go to and they are always a big hit . The people are disappointed if I do not bring them so it has become a yearly item and I purchase many of them . BTW -- The cookies are not packed as shown ; they come in the same tin but it has 4 plastic dividers inside so you do get a few less cookies but it probably helps keep them from breaking up .
5 #### BEYOND FIVE STAR PRODUCT ! ! ! Five Star Seller ! ! ! The most amazing butter pecan cookies - my Mother ( God rest her soul ) use to make these for Christmas every year . FINALLY I FOUND A COOKIE LIKE MOMS ! ! ! I LOVE YOUR COOKIES ! Thank you so much ! Your product has brought tears to my eyes and joy to my heart !
5 #### Very good cookie . Both cans of cookies went fast .
5 #### I am sorry to hear that some people received crumbs instead of cookies . That 's a shame . If they had received whole cookies they would have been leaving great reviews like I am . These are rich and delicious . I have a family cookie recipe we call " Almond Crescents " . They look different , but they taste almost exactly like these wonderful cookiers even though we usually use finely chopped almonds when we make then . These have chunks of pecans in them . They really do melt in your mouth if you let them last that long . Very buttery tasting . They are crumbly , but if you are careful you will get every bite and not make a mess . For once , I have n't looked at the calories . It 's the holidays . I do n't care . I bought my tin at Costco for a lot less than they are being sold for here . You pay something for the convenience of mailing , but it 's not worth it if they come as a can of crumbs . I would probably still eat them and love them .
3 #### so delish , but at least 1/3 pf the can was crumbs . ashamed when i brought it as a gift and saw the contents . i had been too lazy to make them myself . i learned my lesson .
2 #### I wanted some cookies like the ones mom made . These were kind of the same , but really crumbly . Mom 's were more moist ( I guess it 's the butter ) . Passable , but just barely . Plus , there were a lot of broken ones .
4 #### Excellent cookies ..... but ..... probably 1/4 to 1/3 of them were reduced to crumbs after shipping . They really need to come up with a better way to package them ! However , waste not , want not .... had about 1 1/2 cups of cookie crumbs left in the tin that I used for a garnish on a red velvet cake on top of the cream cheese frosting . Was quite nice , however this was not how I envisioned serving these cookies when I ordered them .
4 #### These are very good cookies ! Buy them ! But , I tell you what , here 's the recipe for these cookies even better -- 2 sticks butter , 2 cups flour , 1/4 cup sugar , 1/2 tsp salt , 1 cup finely chopped pecans , 1 tsp vanilla extract , powdered sugar to roll in . Those are the ingredients , the rest of the recipe is a not - so secret family recipe . But , be forewarned , the tin was dented and about 20 % of the cookies were in crumbs , which is to be expected from a recipe like this , if it 's any good , which it is . But , Kosher 's the kind of company that will e - mail you not to post negative reviews . So , I told them the above and heard nothing from them . I did n't expect much , maybe a sorry or a $ 1 - 2 coupon I might or might not use or even an offer for a return and replace , which would n't have been possible since , these cookies are so good , they were already long gone , crumbs and all . But , it 's irritating to complain and not get any response at all . Very good cookies ! I and my family make them better if I could any of those lazy b 's to do it . I just spent a day making two batches to fill the battered tin for my sister , so it 's not the pot calling the kettle .... Maybe I just like to complain .
5 #### Awesome product the best I 've ever used . Highly recommend .
4 #### Very tasty , small cookies covered in powdered sugar filled with small pieces of pecans .
5 #### This tea takes me back in time . When I was really young , my mom used to brew up big batches of iced tea . First , she would get the jugs ready , and then pour hot hibiscus tea into them , and add a lot of ice . We 'd set them out in the sun and the natural light in mid - day would make the tea naturally sweet , as it brewed . Those were definitely good times . What better past time in the summer , than to brew a nice pot of iced tea on a sunny afternoon ? Tazo Passion Tea does n't fail to disappoint . For starters , one of the main ingredients blended to make it so delightful is hibiscus ( along with orange peel , rosehips , cinnamon , lemongrass , natural tropical flavors , citric acid , licorice and red poppy ) . If you like your tea on the ( slightly ) tart side , I reccomend you drink this unsweetened and relish its wonderful , natural flavors . However , if you prefer some sweetness in you life , add a teaspoon of honey or your favorite sweetener for a different flavor note altogether . Doctors are now reccomending people drink five cups of tea daily , for improved health . Make Tazo part of your regimen ! It 's a great way to take care of your health , while making an excuse for a much - deserved tea break .
5 #### I love this tea . The filterbag smelled unbelievable , and the beverage itself brewed up into this gorgeous dark pink color . I wish I 'd used my clear glass mug . I added a little sugar because I ca n't drink anything without a little sweetener , but your average person probably would do fine with it . This stuff is terrific , I definitely recommend it .
5 #### Blend a little apple cider mix into your Tazo Passion Tea and see what happens . This creates a magical apple cider experience with hints of cranberry and hibiscus flowers gathered in an ancient land . Snuggle Up Spiced Cider is a good choice because you can then spoon in the exact amount you desire , but packets of cider work equally well . This is the type of tea you would expect to enjoy after skiing in some distant forest where you are also munching on homemade brownies or eggnog cookies . Apple cider also works very well with the Gypsy Teas , especially the Lemon Jasmine . The deep purple / red color and hibiscus fragrance of Tazo Tea is enough to make anyone passionate about tea . Yet , is this really tea ? It looks like tea , but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers , orange peel , licorice , cinnamon , rose hips , lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water . The original flavor is also slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice which is why it is extra delicious with a cider mix . Tazo Teas are a mysterious experience into which you can lose yourself with a sense of abandon . So far I 've tried more flavors than I can count and have always been impressed . ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### Great product , this is the exact tea that Starbucks uses in their Passion Lemonade drinks . Just add a good quality pre - made lemonade ( I use Newman 's Own ) 6 oz of lemonade to 8 oz of this tea and a shot of simple syrup , serve over sparkling ice . Great taste alone a s well , love the large size bag as I make it using the sun tea method .
4 #### Makes terrific iced - tea , Starbucks style . Much less pricey ordered here .
3 #### A little too fruity for me . Will be making in the summer and adding fresh fruit . A Doctor Oz purchase .
5 #### Tazo tea is my favorite , although Passion is not my favorite variety . I ordered several different boxes and flavors , and all were great . The price was right , and shipping was fast .
5 #### I hate sweet teas . I drink alot of different " frou frou " teas ( including several varieties of Celestial Seasonings ) but there are only a few that are my top " repeats " . This is one of them . This is definitely tart enough that if you like sweet tea , you will have to use alot of sweetener . If you do n't like sweet teas & enjoy a tart tea , this one is great .
5 #### This is great tea for those of us who use decaf . I really like it and drink it often .
5 #### Earl Grey is a standard great tea and Harney and Sons ca n't be beat . Love it .
5 #### Given that this is a decaffeinated tea , it 's an excellent one . The bergamot flavor is very well defined but it 's not overwhelming , and it really boosts the tea flavor . This is a tea I 'll use a lot for a hot cuppa ! It arrived a few days ago and I 've used it daily for 2 - 3 cups . Very enjoyable . I prefer Harney & Sons Decaffeinated Black ( Ceylon ) with breakfast , but the Earl Grey is great if you 're not eating , though it probably could complement some meals and snacks . I am a reformed ( by medical necessity ) coffee junkie ( decaf only now - and very limited coffee ! phooey ! ) and have had a very hard time finding decaf teas I really like . So far , Harney & Sons has done the best for hot tea .
4 #### The scenting oils are so strong , I have to blend this item with unflavored tea . Some people might like it that way ; I do n't . All the same , I 'm giving it four stars because it 's a quality product . Very few broken leaves , very little dust , and the tea base has an excellent flavor .
5 #### Tazo Chai Organic Spiced Black Tea is a blend of black tea , ginger , cinnamon , black pepper , cardamom , cloves and star anise . These items are all organically grown and this creates a sense of purity and clarity of thought . The tea has a delicious rich flavor and is perfectly blended for an ultimate Chai experience . Delicious when you add a packet of Stevia and a swirling of orange blossom honey . Milk powder makes this richer and a dash of cream makes it luxurious . While drinking this tea you are transported to India where Chai wallahs sooth your soul with a cup of spicy tea . Each cup of Tazo tea is an adventure and this tea is especially delicious . ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### Really delicious chai tea flavor . Why pay $ 10 at a restaurant for an ice tea ?
5 #### Received on time . This is a popular product in our office
5 #### This is a product that I 've used for years . It 's nice to have a " stash " on hand .
5 #### I ca n't stand Oprah , but her chai tea tastes better than this one . But this one is much cheaper . Sorry , Oprah .
3 #### Tazo Chai is still the best out there , and this IS a good price for the multi pack . BUT ... There is always a but . The other reviewers are right in that Tazo has changed the formula . Most of the spices are weaker than it used to be , all but the star anise , apparently . The batch that I got this last time was really minty - tasting . Not up to their usual standards , I am sad to say .
1 #### Very sad disappointment ! Almost NO chai spice taste , only black tea ! Not spicy at all . I feel like throwing the whole box in the trash .
4 #### This is some of the better packaged chai I have drunk . As others have commented , it is a bit weak , but I tried two bags to a mug and it was pretty good . I just wish it was a little more heavily spiced . My all time favorite of this type of tea is by Lupicia , but it costs a bit too much with postage . So I 'll be content with this .
5 #### Nice blend of tea and herbs . Tazo usually has the best tea you can buy in a bag .
3 #### Got it free from Smiley360 . Was n't a fan of the Indian spice flavor of chai . If you like this sort of flavor ten you would really like this tea .
5 #### Tazo Chai Tea is the best Chai Tea . I have tried many different Chai Teas . Most of them taste like cinnamon tea . Tazo Chai tea is the best . The flavor in this tea is much more then cinnamon .
2 #### It would n't be that bad but it has so much pepper in it . That 's the only problem
1 #### I contacted Starbucks and they swear they have n't changed this tea , but they have . I have been drinking it every morning for years and I know it is different ; a much weaker tea with less spice . To prove it to myself , I compared a bag of new to what I had at home . The bags are simply not as full . They are also bleached stark white ( ! ) and I do n't understand how a company that promotes an organic image could think that to be a change for the better . I stocked up on the good stuff but I wo n't buy the new . The new tea has a green swirly / wave design on the box . It was tan before . I only mention this because it might help someone distinguish between the two types . Bottom line , Starbucks ruined a great product and lost a customer with this reformulation . Update : Tazo has now repackaged this tea as Tazo Chai Classic and dispensed with the green labeling and bleached bags . You can buy it in either an organic version ( usually found in grocery stores ) or non - organic version ( I have only seen this at Target ) , but it does n't make a difference ; I had hoped they would have returned to the original formulation but this is still the weaker , blander variety .
4 #### A pleasant tea . Subsequent shipments were not as aromatic . Or did I just get used to it ? Consistency in a brand is important to me . I 've ordered one more to be fair .
5 #### Perfect Starbucks tea for at home , if you like the tea at the store you ca n't go wrong with this .
5 #### This tea is so good -- great flavor and makes a large cup of tea . I sweeten with a spot of honey and use steamed milk . Why pay $ 5.00 for a cup of tea at " you know who " when you can have the same thing at home with little or no sugar . I buy four boxes at a time !
5 #### This is the best Chai Tea that I can find . I have tried just about everyone on the market and I always come back to this . This particular product has a 24 count instead of the normal 20 count thus it makes a much better buy . If you are price checking then look it over . I 'm highly recommend .
4 #### Tastes great and I use super large cup and two bags , steep 5 minutes and add milk and sweeter . Great anytime
5 #### I am from India and absolutely love Tazo Chai . It is a very spicy strong tasting tea that is perfect with milk and sugar . It is the only tea I will drink and is available at Starbucks . The Amazon price is good . I ca n't find this tea in stores except at Target so I order from Amazon Prime . Love my Tazo Tea !
5 #### Do n't pay $ 9.09 for this tea . You can get it for $ 3.54 . If you ca n't get it for that price at Amazon , go to vitacost.com I received the wrong tea . I ordered Tazo Organic Chai , but got Om ( with peach & cucumber , which sounds disgusting )
4 #### I do not drink this on its own . I steep it with a bag of Tea India Cardamom Chai , a Star Anise , the seeds of two cardamom pods and a chunk of candied or regular ginger , I also grind in a twist of black pepper . After it is done , I add honey to taste and milk or half & half . I 've had this tea alone and it misses something ( in my taste preferences ) and the pepper taste is strong in an unpleasant way . It mellows out if I add milk or cream . But since I prefer stronger flavors in my Chai , I add all of the above . The milk is crucial because without it the tea will be bitter . Even though I 'm not crazy about this alone , I ca n't do without it when making my own Chai .
5 #### This is simply put the best spice Chai tea you can get easily in the US . Hints of licorice , cinnamon , cardamom , and cloves mix well with steamed milk for a fantastic Chai latte you can make at home . Great before bedtime , or as a digestive aid , Tazo Chai is well worth the purchase .
4 #### Of all the Earl Grey 's I 've tried , this and Rishi 's version are the most robust . If you like the distinctive flavor of bergamont , but wish it were more pronounced than in the conventional blend , and your not opposed to some extra tannins , then this or Rishi are your Earl Greys of choice . Of the conventional Earl Grey teas that are relatively easy to find , my favorite is Bigelow 's . My favorite Earl Grey is made by Revolution , and includes lavender as an ingredient . However , I have to knock Revolution by trying cut costs by not including a string with their tea bags . If you want to try an Earl with a unique citrus zing , go for Stash Double Bergamont . I think it includes grapefruit flavoring ( just my perception ) . Lady Grey by Twinings also tastes great , and includes small blue flowers , which you can see in the loose leaf version . Cool visual effect against the dark black tea leaves .
5 #### Tazo shows considerable expertise in the blending of this top quality tea . The black teas utilized are , as the box states , " the worlds most sought after teas from the high - elevation gardens of Nuwara Eliya , Uva and Dimbula in Sri Lanka and Assam in northeast India . " These sumptuous black teas provide the perfect complement to the strong bergamot essence in this blend . The fragrance of Tazo Earl Grey is powerfully floral , in particular lavender , citrus , and the woodsy - malt scent of premium black tea . The flavor of this splendid potion is rich and perfumed . The addition of cream creates a lush sensual brew . A topnotch tea blend ! Earl Grey is considered to be the second most popular tea in the world . Traditionally Earl Grey is created from a blend of black teas , usually Chinese and Indian teas , sometimes with a smoky flavor , and scented with the citrus fruit bergamot . Earl Grey tea has an interesting history . Legend has it that the first tea scented with bergamot oil was presented to Lord Grey from a Chinese mandarin whose son was saved from drowning by one of Lord Grey 's men . Twinings and Jacksons of Piccadilly both claim to be the first to have commercially blended this tea .
5 #### This is a strongly aromatic version of Earl Grey , scented with citrusy bergamot . If you like a mild Earl Grey , this may be a bit strong for you . I personally love it . One of my favorites .
5 #### One of the best tasting passion fruit syrups out there .
3 #### It 's was nice , but not as intensely passion fruit flavored as I would have liked . The flavor is subtle .
4 #### It is great , but I prefer the Mango flavor when making Starbucks famous Black Tea Lemonade iced drinks .
3 #### Has a bit of a artificial taste , not the best but will do for shave ice or baking .
5 #### This one taste great . Make great tropical ice tea with Lipton tea bags .
5 #### Monin strikes again . This Passion Fruit is true to passion fruit 's essence . Amazing !
5 #### This tea scores high on all counts -- fragrance , flavor and even the name ! Making tea with Lotus creates a delicate light green brew which is deliciously scented . The flavor is augmented by the aroma -- a light floral flavor with just a hint of the grassines of green tea . The unusual taste of lotus flower is hard to describe -- it has a slight buttery flavor reminiscent of fine jasmine tea . If you need a strong jolt of flavor this tea is not for you . If you want something unusual , savor the subtlety of this wonderful tea . Quote from The Book of Tea by Okakura : " Meanwhile , let us have a sip of tea . The afternoon glow is brightening the bamboos , the fountains are bubbling with delight , the soughing of pines is heard in our kettle . Let us dream of evanescence , and linger in the beautiful foolishness of things . "
5 #### I recently had afternoon tea at the O'Henry Hotel in Greensboro , NC and tried this Queen Catherine blend . It 's wonderful ! I am a bit picky when it comes to my teas , and this one had a nicely mellow , medium bodied flavor ( absolutely no bitterness ) while still having enough strength and character without the need for milk and sugar . With a pinch of sugar , the tea opens up with a hint of a creamy floral aroma , and it was heavenly with the various cakes , scones , and savories served with the O'Henry afternoon tea . My husband also gives this tea a thumbs - up and drank most of my pot despite having his own lonely , barely touched pot of green tea . : )
5 #### I have been a life - long tea drinker and find this tea to be excellent . The flavor and body of the tea are superb . This is my favorite cup of tea and I will purchase again from Harney and Sons .
5 #### An exquisite black tea with a little extra . If you 're fond of black tea but think Earl Grey is a bit twee , give this one a try . The flavor and aroma are brisk but refined . It 's become my standard .
5 #### I am a mustard lover and this is a real stand out for yellow mustard . It makes hot dogs extra special .
5 #### Best mustard in my world ... My whole family is hooked !
5 #### " Go to " mustard in our house while watching Browns games . A true winner each week .
5 #### this is the best mustard . My son and I use it all the time . The reason we use it all the time is because it cost 1 dollar and fifty cents at Big Lots . If you pay more than a couple bucks for it you getting really ripped off . Shame on these people charging 8 dollars .
5 #### we saw this on the Chew and its just as good as they say .. I would recommend it for hot dogs not burgers
5 #### Looks like a small fir tree . I hope it gets bigger but not too big . The Juniper is a sweet little tree .
5 #### Arrived in good condition . So far it 's easy to care for . The pines break off easily though I do n't know if it 's supposed to be that way or it 's just cause it 's cold outside right now .
5 #### After growing up on Sassafras tea , and candies .... I no longer had available to me , after moving to Hawaii , three years ago . No merchant would order it for me , so I thought I might find it on Amazon . There it was , and I bought 3 bottles . Shipping was very fast , and I would recommend that if you can not find sassasrass , I highly reccomend this others .
5 #### This stuff is great , tastes like melted root beer lollypops ... only downside is that the concentrate need to be used up in a short period of time , like a month .... but it is WONDERFUL !
5 #### Cute little shrub , arrived promptly , very well packaged , with care instructions .
5 #### Bought as a birthday gift for my wife blew her away she really loves it
3 #### Way too spicy , even for my friends who like spicy . I think because it 's sugar free , it ca n't calm down the spice .
3 #### Read the fine print . I bought this at a Natural Market and was shocked to find out that it has the preservative potassium sorbate . If you are trying to eat natural , you do n't want potassium sorbate in your body .
5 #### The Bonsai tree is wonderful quality and arrived in excellent shape . My nephew was so excited when he received it . It came with instructions , which were helpful . I was so surprised at what a beautiful , hardy tree it was .
4 #### The sauce is very good and a bit too spicy for me . It has very good flavor . I wish it came in mild .
5 #### Good deal for the quantity and taste . I hope maybe Amazon will have coupons for this product in the near future .
4 #### Great option for my pulled pork ; has a " vinegary " taste and is not as thick , but it 's what I like ! This was shipped in mind - blowing time - great seller ; will definitely buy from again !
1 #### There is no kind way to say this . This is terrible . There are several reasons why : 1 . It is thin like water 2 . It stinks ( I could barely taste it without gagging ) 3 . It is vinegar based . If you think you would enjoy dipping your nuggets in vinegar then you would like this . In addition I was mailed expired BBQ sauce . When I contacted Julia 's Pantry about the fact that it was expired they accused me of confusing the lot number with the expiration date . It clearly said August 1 , 2011 on the lid . They wanted me to mail it back to them . If I could do that I would n't have ordered BBQ sauce online . Not everyone can get to the post office . What a complete waste of money and time .
5 #### Nice tree for the money . Well packaged . No complaints . We 'll I do have one complaint , the FedEx man keeps delivering my packages next door . This is my second tree that I 've ordered through Amazon and I 've been pleased with both . Will order again .
5 #### Shipped very quickly and well packed . The tree survived shipping and looks great . Much bigger than I expected . Great looking tree adn great value at this $ 65 .
5 #### Great tree for the price . Packaged well . Very healthy .
5 #### Love this and did well in Arizona . Will probably bring indoors when gets really HOT .
3 #### My first experience with Wrigley 's was a bit disappointing . The gum was very hard as if stored in the warehouse a bit too long . I usually give a merchant a second try . Boom ! My second purchase , same experience . The gum was very hard and required a bit of chewing to soften it . Therefore , I will not purchase the gum again .
1 #### Wrigley now colors the spearmint gum and adds aspartame ( Equal ) . It 's not what we grew up with . I think the flavor and consistency is basically the same as the original version .
5 #### REALLY nice , healthy plant with interesting shape , very nice container . I was quite pleased . Shipping was fast . I paired it with a book on bonsai so the recipient does n't kill it :-)
5 #### Bulk box that you see in a normal gas station . Nothing fancy , but exactly what you would expect .
5 #### Aaah ! Gum that is NOT sugar free . :-) The flavor lasts , and there is no bitter aftertaste , as with Extra . If one brushes one 's teeth regularly , the small amount of sugar wo n't rot their teeth . My dentist verified it .
4 #### Quality product . Delivered and packaged well . Am pleased with it .
5 #### It 's gum- same stuff that 's been around for ages ( though this does have some artificial sweeteners , that I do n't like ) . Tastes fine . I like the five - stick packs for my purse .
5 #### There was a lot of foliage on this tree and it arrived very healthy . Pretty much exactly a sdescribed and for a good price though I do have Amazon Prime so shipping costs are n't an issue .
5 #### This plant was shipped on January 3rd . It arrived at my house on Jan 9th . I 'd have bet anything this plant would be dead upon delivery because it was boxed up for so many days . When I opened the packaging , which took me forever because of all the tape , it was still alive and still had plenly of moisture . I 've already named her Judy . With luck she will be with me for many years to come .
1 #### I used to love the old Wrigly 's Spearmint gum , but that was way back in the 60s , 70s , 80s . It had a mellow spearmint flavor . This new stuff has the sharp almost acrid sweetness that is just like every other spearmint gum . I do n't think it 's the sweetener either , because their Juicy Fruit tastes just like the old time juicy fruit . They must have changed the ' secret recipe ' for the Spearmint and they absolutely ruined it ! It used to be my favorite flavor , but evidently it 's gone forever . They even changed the package to be sharp looking . The old time spearmint package was almost all white . I wo n't order it again .
5 #### Wrigley 's Spearmint Gum freshens my breath FAST ! Love the fresh taste ! A few weeks ago , I picked up this gum at a local store and was glad to find it . This has been my favorite gum for years ! So I keep it in my purse and find that after a meal , it helps me freshen my breath , or just before a meeting , I enjoy this gum for fresh breath fast . Since this has sugar in it , I do not use at night after I brush my teeth so no sugar will be left on my teeth as I sleep . Highly recommend this !
5 #### I bought this 40 pack of Spearmint gum a few weeks ago . It came promptly and was well packaged . Several years ago , chewing gum seemed to stick to my dental work so I stopped chewing the stuff . Summer before last my daughter offered me a piece of Wrigleys and I found that it did not adhere to my dental work so I bought some . Whether or not Wrigleys is the only brand with non - stick properties , I have no idea , but if that has been a problem you might give this brand a whirl . I quit smoking in 1985 and used toothpicks to assuage the transition for a long time . Now chewing gum can help pick up the slack . Spearmint is my favorite breath / mouth freshener . Good gum , get some .
2 #### Amazing that you can orders these online , but it died within 3 weeks . I took care of it just like they said to . It makes a nice dead Bonzi , but that 's not really what I had in mind .
3 #### The first tree I ordered was badly scarred by wires . The company replaced it quickly with a very nice tree that had a great shape . The ficus is great if you have little natural light . My apartment is very dark and the tree did fine off of the artificial light . That said , this is NOT a tree for beginners . Ficus are notoriously finicky . They like regular water and the same light conditions day after day . Each time you vary the routiine significantly , it will drop all of its leaves . Moreover , this plant was hard to water . The pot does n't have enough room for the water to soak in , so I had to use a spray bottle and lots of patience . It needs to be watered daily . In short : good choice if you just do n't have any good light , bad , bad choice for a first Bonsai or if you are forgetful or travel .
1 #### Terrible product . Has bugs that spread to my other plants . Horrible service . They did nothing about it . I bought 3 of these and wasted my money and infested my other plants
5 #### Tree was delivered in amazing condition and was everything advertised . Beautiful ! ! ! Could not be more pleased .
3 #### Chili sauce was vicious ' spicy ' flavor was lacking though
4 #### More like a hot mustard . Very good on roast beef sandwiches .
2 #### The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is not because of the product quality , but just because I did n't like it . Tastes like mustard , great volume of vinigar and cinnamon or something similar . Someone might like it , do n't take my evaluation to judge the product .
1 #### If you are a fan of viniger flavored sauces you will be ok . I am not this stuff just tastes awful . Also it is not even close to spicy at all just a weak vinigery sauce with an odd flavor after that ... Also the bottle is much smaller than you would think . Oh well just my 2c .
4 #### Decent enough that I am reordering . Has a kind of Indian food flavor to it .
3 #### When it arrived , branches were broken off and on the bottom of the box .
5 #### One of my new favorite hot sauces ! This is actually hot sauce with flavor ! And it has the coolest name ! I will definitely buy it again !
2 #### The plant only lived one week . I have not had good luck with any plant coming from Brussels . I have tried numerous different plants and none of them survived more than a few days if they even were alive when they arrived . When I called the company , they were not helpful . I have bonsai from other companies which are doing very well so I do n't think it is anything I have done .
5 #### Very lovely / healthy tree . I know it looks dead in the pics but it is just dormant , the buds are swelled and ready to bloom any week now ! My favorite part is the spectacular NEBARI ! This tree will give me a jump start on a red wood bonsai piece . The only complaint i have is there is a bare spot on the lower part of the trunk ... it will require some branch grafting before i can begin training it for bonsai . I think i should also mention that other than the bare spot on the trunk , the top of the tree has an excellent start on ramification . The tree comes in a very sturdy ceramic pot . If you are a bonsai enthusiast like myself , the pot that comes with the tree is only training quality , it is not a presentable display pot for showing off your work of art . However if you are not a bonsai enthusiast and want this item for home decor it is still a beautiful pot . Ca n't wait until the spring so i can plant my redwood in the ground to thicken up the trunk !
4 #### Not really a hot sauce . But Verrrrrrrrrrrry It is tasty . Not inexpensive so that is why it only recieved 4 stars . It is missing from my cupboard so someone in my house really liked it or took it because the name colon cleaner makes it a great novelty
1 #### I bought this for my wife , a woman who has had a few of her many plants for over 30 years . To say she is good with plants is clearly an understatement . But this thing died within a month of getting it . I wish I had reviewed it then , but just came across this in searching through my old orders for something else .
5 #### Really cute . I love the maroon leaves . I hope it 's the same plant , as the pictured plant has green leaves . Ca n't wait for the flowers .
4 #### A very lovely plant indeed . If you like bonsai 's I would give this one a try .
5 #### This was BEAUTIFUL ! ! ! It was really big and just as nice as it could be ! It does n't say in the description that it is an outside plant so make sure it will do in your climate . I have had it for almost three weeks and I put it outside everyday and bring it in , in the evening . It is doing really well need to transplant it though pot is a bit too small . You will love it though !
5 #### Plants looks in good condition , very satisfied with purchase
5 #### I purchased the dawn redwood directly from Brussels Bonsia near Christmas time . My tree arrived in only 4 days to the west coast . It was very healthy looking but dormant , as it should be this time of year . The company was very helpful answering my questions . Be aware this tree needs a winter dormant period of at least 80 days and is not evergreen . I have read that the dormancy can be partly spent in a 33 to 40 degree refrigerator after it goes dormant naturally . Dawn redwood loves to be almost wet , cool and with high soil acidity and outdoor sunlight . The beautiful pot it was sent in was not a cheap one . I hope this review helps .
4 #### Unbelievably Hot ! I can bare just about anything spicy , but this is a killeradded a few drops to my ramen noodles and could n't get through itif you want intense , intense heat , this is the sauce for you
5 #### Gorgeous Bonsai Azela . I bought the large and am so glad I did . It was full of buds and is not blooming . I love it .
5 #### Came in great condition . In a nice pot . Has n't flowered yet ( bought it in dec its now march ) but it 's still cold outside . I ca nt wait for the flowers . So far fairly easy to care for .
5 #### This stuff is crazy . Very hot , but also very good tasting . Unlike the entry level which is Beyond Insanity , this one actually has a sweet taste to it and that comes from the pineapple juice that s in it . A must in every chiliheads collection . Try it , you wo n't be disappointed . However if you think tobasco is hot , then do n't even think of attempting this stuff . If tobasco is like a throw down snap , this is like a nuke in comparison .
5 #### Such good flavor . Using it for steaks , dips , poultry , and yes .... drinks . Super super good . YUM !
5 #### Time has passed and this little tree is lovely and green and charming .
5 #### I received Ms. Bonsai today . :) She was very well packaged , nice moist soil , no damage done to any of the branches during shipment . The pot is a nice heavy sturdy pot . If I can keep her alive ... ( that 's the big question ! ! ) she will make a perfect addition to my patio table . So far , well worth the money . I ca n't wait until she blooms !
5 #### We 've tried them all . Flashbang , Buttpucker , Beware , Megadeath , you name it . This blasts them all out of the water for sheer powerful heat . It will knock you down , it will punch you in the face . It can cause delirious reactions as your body reacts to heat it 's never experienced before . This makes normally ' hot ' sauces taste like ketchup . Even a tiny toothpick full of this will set you on fire .. First your tongue will burn , then your lips will burn , then your entire mouth will flame up and your eyes and mouth will start draining massive fluid . Then as it slides down your throat your entire throat will flame up and become infused with blow torch levels of heat . If you survive you will not likely remember much of the delirium you experienced which rivals an out of body experience . Think I am joking ? Then prove me wrong . The scoville rating of this is probably understated by at least 500,000 + . There is no way this is under 800,000 + Scoville .
5 #### It arrived just on time for my husband 's Birthday . He love it . We put it outside on our deck table and it looks perfect ,
5 #### My mother - in - law recently experienced a wonderful outcome in her prognosis following surgery . I picked this plant to tell her we love her and we 're glad she 's doing great . This beautiful tree arrived very quickly and looks more beautiful than the photo . It was ( and is ) a very healthy and robust looking plant . She is thrilled . I would recommend this for anyone who likes giving plants that live - on for years . Cheers !
3 #### Not super hot and very vinegar - ey . I 've had better hotsauce , for cheaper .
5 #### This was a gift but was very pleased with how quickly I received it . My son - in - law loves it .
5 #### if you love bonsai plants , dont miss out on the dawn redwood bonsai . i havve a large collection and i love this so much i purchased 2 of them ! ! i will be back to buy more very soon.[something different ] thanks brussels
5 #### Great product in the line of three . Awesome additive to kick up my homemade salsa and adds a nice flavo . Ca n't wait to get the third item .
5 #### its the best for how like to eat really spice food
5 #### This stuff is Hot and it has a bite and I like my food that way , it 's like how you like me now Da Bomb is pretty good stuff all I can say is try it only if you like hot sauce and you want that kick .
1 #### I was very disappointed with this item . I unpacked and followed the directions and some leaves began to fall off which is normal . But within 2 days the leaves started turning brown and within a week the leaves had fallen off . This was n't my first bonsai and I have not had issues previously . Something was wrong with this plant . :( and it is just a sad sad little plant .
5 #### This stuff is the real deal ! Not for newbs , very very hot ! It has an excellent flavor and heat , and must be used in very small amounts , or it is more of a Bhut Jolokia experience , rather than enjoying some really hot sauce . a drop or two is really all that is necessary . I was very happy to find it again here , and bought 2 ! That will likely last a good 5 years . Like I said , it 's a few drops hot sauce for us picante heads ! The 4 oz bottle is much larger that the last one I got as a gift , so that really rocks too . If you love habanero 's like I do , you need this sauce ! You will sweat . :)
5 #### Has good flavor and serious heat , not to apply directly to food , more to add heat and flavor when mixed with something . I mix it with salsa , beef jerky marinade ect . do n't need much to do the trick .
4 #### GZ is the most painful sauce in my collection ( until I recently got The Final Answer ) . There is a difference between heat and pain . I consider the mad dog silver collector sauce to be extreme heat . This , is pain . It feels like someone is driving a nail through your tongue . Pepperheads know this sauce by name , and for me , it 's the only sauce that releases those endorphins and gets me all giddy like a school - girl . I have noticed that you really need about a pea - sized drop to get the full effect . Any smaller and you might be disappointed . Non - seasoned pepperheads should not really try this sauce . I find this sauce to be the most disgusting in my collection too . It 's what I imagine motor oil tastes like . It 's really just for heat this stuff .
3 #### The first tree I got , it was n't looking like a tree , more like a branch . I contacted the seller , and ask to send me similar to the one from the amazon picture , is it so difficult ? ! New tree arrived few days ago , much large , older , but it looks like they chapped off the top of the tree just to fit in the box , nice tree trunk and the pot , but the top of the tree is a total disaster . So , if you decide to buy it from this seller , make sure you state exactly what you want . Seller responds very quickly and quite care for the customers and business .
5 #### I love super hot hot sauces and this flagitious concoction is the hottest thing I have ever tasted . The flavor is really good and the heat is long lasting habanero sting . Blair 's ultra death hot sauce is legit and should n't be over looked but in my experience not as hot or as long lasting . I do n't understand one sauce or beer types of people buy lots of hot sauces !
1 #### I bought this from Amazon ( not the seller depicted currently ) . The plant looked great on arrival , but it died with 15 days , despite trying very hard and following all instructions . I wonder if shipping in a box ( and depriving light , etc for 2 - 4 days ) causes such damage .
5 #### I have yet to open this bottle of hot sauce . I bought it for the name . Period . I will someday .
2 #### This should be called strange taste sissy sauce . Leaves a lot to be desired in the taste department and is barely spicy at all .
5 #### This stuff is Da ' Bomb . I totally agree with the other 5 stars on here . I usually eat Dave 's Temporary Insanity on all kinds of stuff , I use the Da ' Bomb Beyond Insanity / Dave 's Insanity quite a bit with certain foods , but I can barely touch this stuff . The burn is so much more powerful and lasting compared to any of those that I can only handle a small amount . I 'm not buying the 234k Scoville rating either . The flavor is good . You ca n't even remotely taste it unless you eat very hot foods all the time . I highly suggest the entire Da ' Bomb line to give you a good range of heat options . I also noticed there is a ghost pepper sauce on Amazon too , first time I 've seen it . My second bottle and I 'm hooked . My favorite use is to toothpick this stuff , then spread an ultra thin layer on my sammiches . Blazin hot ;)
5 #### The base of the tree was thicker than the one shown in the picture . The I received has a nice taper . A nice touch , there was a little bit of moss growing over the dirt . The tree came packaged in a tall box with an inner Styrofoam base to protect the pot . The pot and base of the tree were wrapped tight in a thick plastic and the soil was damp upon arrival . The rest of the space inside the box was filled with a biodegradable type of foam peanuts ( watch out , they get everywhere when you take the tree out ) . Fantastic tree !
5 #### Not flowering when it arrived because that would kill the plant , so be aware of that , but it 's in perfect shape , no disease . Ca n't wait to see it Bloom !
2 #### This product is spicy as advertised and taste good . It is not as hot or good as tobasco habenero . It is just grey poupon , mustard , red wine vinegar and a habenero to give it some heat . Yeah , it is a bit hotter than regular tobasco . Like someone else stated if tobasco is too hot for you this is not for you . I like the flavor of brown mustard which is where the flavor comes from , but sorry , this product is not worth $ 2 an ounce . I will never buy it again since I can make this myself for much less , well except for xantham gum ( what ever that is ) . I do not recommend this for anyone else . Make it your self .
5 #### We got this as a gag gift for my friend who loves hot sauce , but he actually really likes it !
5 #### I received this tree this week . I have purchased Bonsai trees from other online vendors , but none have compared to this starting with the packing of the tree , you could tell it was packed with great care , it arrived in perfect shape . The tree is healthy and beautiful , far more beautiful than the picture shown on Amazon . The tree has a wonderful aroma , it smells like your in a forest , on a fall morning . I could tell it was healthy immediately . Sometimes when you order things on line your disappointed , but not enough to go through the trouble of sending the item back . The minute I saw this tree I had wished I had ordered more . I will order other items from this company , I hope they are as fine as this purchase was.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Brussel - s - Dawn - Redwood - Outdoor - Bonsai - Tree / dp / B0000DGG22 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Brussel 's Dawn Redwood Outdoor Bonsai Tree</a >
1 #### This thing did not last no longer than it took to get . Save your money .
2 #### I bought this for my father - in - law who suffers from migraines headaches , but the small amount of capsaicin that is SUPPOSEDLY one of the ingredients in the bottle , is either not in it , or is not enough . It has n't given him any relief when a migraine hits him . :-((
3 #### To be fair , for me it was to peppery , and a lot hotter then I expected - colon cleanser is a good name - for me the pepper flavor over took the mustard flavor to much , but if you are looking for straight sweat inducing heat , this is the mustard for you
5 #### As a hot sauce fanatic , I have tried a good number of hot sauces - Dave 's Ultimate Insanity , Crazy Uncle Jester 's , etc . I put this near the top - it has a good mustardy vinegary flavor and a good amount of heat to it , without being too hot or flavorless . I think they 've found a good mix in this sauce , and I recommend it . I can not speak for the " phartpounding " action however ...
3 #### I sent this to my Mom for Mother 's day . She said it arrived with the soil spilled out of the container and looked like a twig . It did n't have anything to identify it as an Azalea plant or how to care for it . She was a little disappointed with it . It was n't blooming ; looked nothing like the picture . She did say the planter was very nice . My suggestion to the seller would to at least include some information as to what the plant is and how to best care for it . Hopefully , it will grow and bloom .
5 #### Awesome ! ! Had my doubts yet decided to give it a chance . This little guy arrived PERFECTLY & has prospered since day one . Thank you !
5 #### C'm on now , this is an eye - popper and a nice conservation piece . I have n't tried it yet but it 's fun to have on display .
5 #### Great flavors accentuated with some pretty serious heat . I put this on just about everything . If you 're a " pepper head " , you owe this a try . Nice work Professor P !
5 #### Not your typical hot sauce but certainly Hot Enough while being very complex ! I put it on most everything .
3 #### Funny ass bottle , but other than that i am not a huge fan of this stuff . The taste is odd , not sure how to describe it . The heat takes a second to hit and it hits hard , but it also dissipates quickly .
2 #### Tree arrived half dead . Has a total of 23 leaves on the whole plant . You can see where leaves were once attached but most are gone . I hope it survives but I do n't know if it will .
4 #### It 's like a combination of curry sauce and " onions " sauce for hot dogs , but way spicier than both . I like it . Just wish most on - line places would n't claim it costs $ 5 or $ 6 but that it just happens to cost the same amount for shipping , when in truth any brick & mortar store you buy it from will not charge you less than $ 10 a bottle . Mind you it 's worth it , but just ... you know .
4 #### Falls under the " novelty " sauce collection , similar to @ss reaper hot sauce . Prob would never buy again . Great heat / flavor ratio but it 's mustard flavor dominates everything . It 's good , but better to finish and save the bottle for the collection . On a side note , I found it hard to keep my appetite while looking at the word " colon " on the bottle .
5 #### bought as a joke just cuz the laff factor of the name finally decided to open n taste ... just damn ... awesome flavor nice b4 n afterburn works well on sammie n burgers
5 #### This is the most adorable ! and its THRIVING ! ! ! I LOVE this little guy !
4 #### This was purchased as a joke gift for a hot sauce lover . He loved it . The bottle reminds me of a pocket flask and like a turn of the century product for women : " pure vegetabe compound " with alcohol and tincture of opium .
5 #### This was a gag gift but the flavor is good and intense it will definitely do some work on the lower GI tract .
5 #### Awesome ! Got this in a healthy state and it is really flourishing !
2 #### The flower arrived as it should , but in a month , although my sister done everything that it was to do by the book , the flower faded away and now is lost ! I really don t think that a flower should resist only a month !
5 #### I love it because of its consistency and aroma and texture . My father made a comment that I totally agree with : it pretty much tastes like a spicy Heinz 57 steak sauce . I 'm not banging this sauce at all , it really is great and I will be purchasing a lot more of it . I would recommend this to anyone who is trying all different types of hot sauces , but I would n't recommend it to anyone looking for a " high " level of spiciness . The heat is on par with low tier habanero sauces .
2 #### Can half dead all the care has not brough it back to life . Very disappointed . We leave in Oregon perfect climate for the Azalea
3 #### I was hoping with the name colon cleaner this would be like hot . I use blair 's a lot and its really hot and good and tastey . This overall was okay flavor , if you 've had vadalia onion sauce it reminds me a lot of that , a lot of mustard flavor too . But literally Texes Pete is hotter , very disappointing .
4 #### This tasted good although it was purchased as a gift for someone else . Not too salty and it is hot .
4 #### I tested this sauce with my favorite chips - Have'a Corn Chips ( available on Amazon ) - heated for 15 seconds in the microwave to warm the chips up . The sauce has a very nice flavor , unlike any other sauce I have tried . I would say it kind of has a bit of a mustard taste with Habanero . I did not find it too hot to eat , and my colon is still intact . I think it has too strong of a flavor to use in recipes , but it might go well on your morning sausages or potatoes . Definitely worth a try , but not in my top ten hot sauces . Update : I tried this on Morningstar Veggie Patties ( e.g. vegetarian breakfast sausage ) and it is fantastic for breakfast !
4 #### As usual , I took this sauce to work and had everyone try it as it was n't that hot . To a person they all loved it . It is great on a roast beef or pastrami sandwich . Excellent flavor profile . You should be thinking of things mustard might go on when using this . Not really hot at all to me , but I just stomached a dollop of Da ' Bomb The Final Answer so I ca n't really be relied upon in that aspect .
5 #### This is one of our favorite sauces . rating Hottness is difficult to do because every one tastes things different . All I can say is , if original Tabasco is hot to you , then this is not for you . I feel as if this is on par with original Tabasco in heat but has a different flavor . Colon Cleaner is a mustard based sauce with a lot of flavor . It 's main ingredients are Scotch Bonnet peppers and mustard . It is not so hot that you ca n't taste it like some other brands . It is one of our favs ! If you like to change things up and have an extensive collection of hot sauce 's like we do , this will be a great addition . The price of 12 seems a bit high ( the highest I'v seen ) . I have seen it as low as 5 and averages around 7 - 8 .
2 #### I am very happy with this ficus bonsai . It was trained in a way that it has a characteristic " bonsai bend . " I also like this type of ficus because it has smaller leaves than other ficus plants , making it a more ideal bonsai plant . Edit in November 2017 : I had to downgrade the review dramatically , as the plant is inexplicably losing its leaves and dying . It 's in my office , as all my other ficus plants , which are doing just fine . So , I have no idea why this plant is dying . This is very sad .
4 #### Great Gift . Do n't know how much watering is required .
5 #### OMG this tree is fantastic ! ! Came in great condition very moist very green and healthy looking twice the size I expected for the price of $ 25 , this tree is huge Compared to other bonsai that I paid 40 + dollars for and a bonus it actually looks like the Advertised picture I put three other of my bonsai 's in 2 of the pictures to compare , it 's the big one in the back ! ! Great buy ! !
5 #### Could n't be more pleased with this product ! Packed extremely well . Arrived quickly and in perfect condition ! Gorgeous specimen of bonsai . Looks even better in person than the picture . Very happy with this purchase and this seller !
5 #### I was a little nervous buying this after reading the mixed reviews and worrying that the plant would n't survive being shipped . I took the chance and bought one for my mother - in - law for mother 's day . I decided to play it safe and not make it a surprise . I told her to open it upon arrival which she did nt . Took her the followong day so this plant sat in the box for 3.5 days in total with amazon prime shipping . When she opened it , it looked like what is shown by the seller but with fewer flowers . Really happy with this purchase and will likely purchase the other bonsai in future .
5 #### Had one aerial root already touching down ! Beautiful tree very large for 35 dollars . Very worth it ! The specimen i recieved has very spaced out branches , but for a bonsai enthusiast like myself an air layer , and some branch grafting will make it more presentable .
1 #### Very disappointing ! After a couple of months , WORMS started doming out of the soil .. and this plant was kept strictly INDOORS ... so the eggs must have been along with the plant .. DISGUSTING . Threw the entire plant AWAY .... Horrible product .
5 #### Beautiful , I like it so much i bought a how to book on caring for Bonsai 's
5 #### This was a birthday present for my friend , she lived it .
1 #### I was very disappointed , I had bought this for a gift and did not re wrap it as I was traveling with it in the car and did not want to take a chance on damaging it , when it was opened I was very embarrassed it was one branch , with two very small branches about 1 - 1 1///2 " long . What a miss leading picture . I will never purchase from this company again .
5 #### Arrived in full bloom for Mother 's day ! It was packed well . Three months later it still has flowers and looks great ! A seriously great price for a nice bonsai .
3 #### live in arizona , and having trouble keeping the plant alive . need further help to know how to take care of this plant
5 #### Sent these to two friends as a " just because " and they have said that they love them .
4 #### Great value from a wonderful seller with many nice plants . Will recommend this product and the seller and look forward to purchasing additional Bonsai 's ! !
5 #### I had this sent to my mother . The plant arrived very quickly was packaged very well . Very little dirt spilled and none of the leaves seem to have been damaged . After about a week , the azaleas started blooming . Very nice ! The picture is after 5 weeks .
5 #### Just the right size for me ( small ) . Very nice , rapid delivered .
5 #### I bought this plant for my husbands desk 5 months ago . It is still alive and thriving . When we received the plant it was packaged nicely , and did not loose many leaves . People ask him where we bought it !
5 #### Arrived Healthy and I already see one of the buds blooming . It 's may 1st so I received it just in time to enjoy the full bloom May - June :) . I had no problems when it arrived . It was packaged well .
5 #### It looks great . Not flowering as yet , but it looks healthy .
3 #### Beautiful on arrival . Slowly dying even with special slow release food .
5 #### Purchased for a friend whose relative had died . It arrived quickly and in great condition . Lovely little planter . Don ' expect it to be in bloom unless you buy it around May . Very easy to take care of . Loves to be outside .
5 #### I had this little 5 year old Bonsai tree delivered to my mother for Mother 's Day . She said it 's very pretty and hopes she can keep it alive . She 's pleased .
1 #### So , to make a long story short , I had one sent to my mother for her birthday , it arrived dead , spoke to customer service in Manila , had a replacement ordered , which was also dead , had another replacement ordered , this one was also dead . ( Three dead total . ) I asked for a refund , and was refunded . Then , I noticed that I had been refunded for one tree , but had also been charged for all three of them ! ! ( So they still owed me refunds for two more trees . ) Quite frustrating , but I eventually got it all taken care of . I 'm sure this would be a nice item if you got one that 's alive , but I went 0 for 3 . This took place in August , in the Midwest , during fairly mild temperatures , BTW .
5 #### My mother loved it . I sent this plant instead of flowers ( which only last a week ) and it was a big hit . It is packaged in a clever way to avoid damage etc . It 's a much better gift than flowers .
1 #### These multiple gifts all given to multiple friends all died within one month . It is shame , no blossom , no bloom , no plant . No refund . Do n't buy again .
5 #### This was a replacement that I bought for the one that my son gave me for Mother 's Day . That one came from [ ... ] . , and it was healthy , but I somehow managed to kill it . In the meantime , I became very fond of the idea of having a bonsai plant , and I 'm planning to buy a more expensive one later on , but for now , I love this one . Unless he notices , I 'm not mentioning that it 's a different Azalea . Obviously Azaleas are outdoor plants , but our winters can get cold , even down south , so I bought a grow - light from Amazon.com , and I 'm going to try to get this Azalea through the winter indoors . In the spring , I can set it out under the arbor in the backyard . It came well packaged , hardly any dirt or leaves had fallen into the box , and the soil was still damp . I very gently freed it from the supporting cardboard by cutting the side out of the box . Just a few minutes of snipping random yellow leaves ( only half a dozen or so ) , and it looks happy underneath the grow - light . I placed a pretty rock and a little mudman statue underneath the " tree " . Wish me luck with this one !
2 #### I was very disappointed when this ficus arrived . Many leaves had dropped off but the worst part was that there were so many leaves which were blackened with some sort of insect infestation in the plant . Rather than going through the trouble of repackaging it and delivering it to be sent back ... I placed it in new soil , spread powered insecticide in it and put it in a larger pot and will hope for the best . I was very surprised that this plant was delivered in this condition . I ordered this because of the many positive reviews even though there were some also complaining about the problem I mentioned .
5 #### Tree arrived shrink - wrapped and strapped to the bottom of a large box filled with packing ( very impressive packing ) . The tree was healthy and the soil was still moist , if anything it had too much soil . I took a fork and scooped out a good bit of soil so as not to have a huge mound around the trunk of the tree . The picture shows a blue tray , but mine was brown , but for me that worked better with my office 's color scheme . I added some baby tears to the soil as a ground cover and to keep the soil wetter . I did n't notice any leaves dropping like others have reported , do n't believe the reviews that are two years old , maybe the trees were poor quality back then but the one I got is great .
5 #### I 've just had the bonsai for 3 days , but , coming out of the package I knew I had a great plant . It is about 8 inches tall , has complex features , and has lots of sprouts to work with . Could n't have been happier for the price .
5 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Brussel - s - Golden - Gate - Ficus - Indoor - Bonsai - Tree / dp / B0000DGF9V / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Brussel 's Golden Gate Ficus Indoor Bonsai Tree</a > I am really satisfied with the tree . I always thought these would be a bit more expensive . Like nearly all plants needs light , inderect outside shady best , inside near window probably good .
5 #### I do n't normally give a review on the condition of an item as it arrives from shipping much less one I gave as a gift , but I simply must pass this on . I bought the ficus from Brussel 's Bonsai . It being a tree , I wondered if the tree would make it to my mom in one piece . Well , my mom called me today . She just got the tree and she is thrilled beyond belief . She said it arrived in absolutely perfect condition , as if someone had hand delivered it . She still ca n't get over how it was possible . She said it arrived in a huge box , but it was just a little tree and it looked perfect . They had packed it so well . I told her to send it back if there 's anything wrong with it , but she said no , it is PERFECT . Knowing my mom , she would have told me if it was n't . UPDATE : I 've had three trees sent as gifts to family and they have been an absolute hit ! Usually , I get a nice , polite thank you ; but this time it is call after call from people who are at a loss for words , just like my mom . Rarely does a present garner so much positive feedback . Thank you , Amazon !
3 #### I just wanted to post the tracking on this gift I sent which was delivered late i guess as it is probably sitting on my friends doorstep at this moment or at least I hope it still is . She is working today but was home yesterday when the 2 day delivery was supposed to have taken place ( see below ) October 3 , 2008 09:40:00 AM MORGAN HILL CA US Delivered October 3 , 2008 08:33:00 AM SAN JOSE CA US Out for delivery October 3 , 2008 07:38:00 AM SAN JOSE CA US Arrival Scan October 3 , 2008 05:48:00 AM OAKLAND CA US Departure Scan October 2 , 2008 10:26:00 PM OAKLAND CA US Arrival Scan October 2 , 2008 02:35:00 AM OAKLAND CA US Departure Scan October 1 , 2008 03:47:00 PM MEMPHIS TN US Departure Scan October 1 , 2008 03:23:00 PM OAKLAND CA US Arrival Scan October 1 , 2008 04:29:00 AM MEMPHIS TN US Arrival Scan September 30 , 2008 11:06:00 PM MEMPHIS TN US Departure Scan September 30 , 2008 04:04:00 PM MEMPHIS TN US Shipment received by carrier September 30 , 2008 02:00:00 PM --- Shipment has left seller facility and is in transi Apparently Fedex has a time warp machine . On Oct 1 delivered the package to Oakland Ca 24 minutes before it left Tennessee :-) I know this is not a review of the product but i just had to share
2 #### I received the tree today , and when i got it out of the package it had small bugs crawling around everywhere ... I decided to go to my local nursury and i found some bonsai tree 's that looked better and were alot cheaper .
4 #### My parents loved the plant but they had NO idea who sent it ... apparently the gift card was not there
5 #### So far so good . It lost a lot of leaves at first but with some love and a new plant light it is recovering and has several new shoots and leaves . Will be a while before we know
2 #### 2 Stars because I was able to enjoy it for all of about a month . The tree came in okay condition ( most of the branches intact except for 2 that snapped ) . I followed directions in the the little manual to the " t " and all of a sudden , the bonsai withered and died . Very unfortunate .
5 #### After pricing them elsewhere I came to realize that this was a great price on a fantastic product . Would highly recommend !
2 #### Mine came is chopped off from the top ! ! The packaging was good , I chose to keep it coz I did n't want to pack it back up to ship . The cut off mark is so obvious that its takes away from the natural beauty of the bonsai .. good packaging and container is the only reason I gave it two stars ..
2 #### Quite disappointed . Tree came in and 90 % of the leaves have brown spots . Since it came they have been dropping like crazy . I replanted with the super Bonsai Boy soil and I guess it has helped a little but man this thing does n't look good compared to others I 've had . Really quite unhappy . At this point I 'm just praying the thing even survives .
5 #### Had to replace my $ 150 . ficus bonsai that died after 7 months ( it was the roots , probably needed to be transplanted , which I was not expecting to do after just half a year!)in my psychotherapy practice . Wanted something zen like and inexpensive this time and this fit the bill in spades . Got it in 3 days and very well wrapped . It looks like a 15 year old bonsai thatr would cost much much more and is quite beautiful . Considering the tiny stick like bonsais you can get for this $ 34 all inclusive price , this is an awesome bargain ! Great looking bark too ! Jody Koval
5 #### This is the perfect Bonsai for what I needed . I am in the learning phase of Bonsai and did not want to start from scratch . I received a very healthy plant . The soil was wrapped with plastic and bow tied to keep the soil in place and the moisture level high . The box was then stuffed with packing peanuts . I was shocked at how large the trunk is and how much beautiful new foliage is present . The trunk has several bends , no wire marks , and is firmly held within the blue oval pot I received . + Inexpensive Considering the Health / Quality / Age of the Plant and the Pot + Received in Perfect Condition with 1 Leaf in the Box + Basic Care Instructions - One Broken Branch ( Not broken recently , can see the break occurred some time ago , held in place by a wire ) no big deal _ Bottom Line _ Yes , I would recommend this Bonsai to a friend . I am purchasing a humidity tray separately as this is a tropical plant and needs high humidity to thrive . The instructions are fairly basic but a quick search of Fukien Tea will yield many useful results . I am more the 100 % satisfied with this plant . It looks beautiful , pest and disease free , and even unboxing was exciting . This Bonsai really is healthy and has at least as many leaves as in the pictures . This is NOT just a sad cutting ; this Fukien Tea is a strong Bonsai ready for care . 5 Stars Easy !
1 #### I have several bonsai trees that I have ordered from different locations ( including an olive bonsai , a pomagranet and a jade ) . This Fukien Tea Bonsai arrived and looked awesome but soon started shedding all of the leaves so I was a bit worried . After a few days most of the leaves were gone and at the 2 week point there was only 1 green leave attached . I gave it to a friend who also enjoys bonsai trees because I hated that it was starting to die . I can report after a couple of months of total TLC it has started to regrow some of the leaves . I 'm not sure if it is the company or the tree but I was very disapointed .
1 #### I purchased three of these Fukien Bonsai from Brussels Nursery , via Amazon , two months ago . They arrived promptly and appeared to be in excellent condition . I was actually impressed with their large size , shape and foliage . They were intended as gifts for family and friends . After a couple of weeks , they all started losing their leaves . Upon closer inspection it was evident that they were infested with some type of crawling mite , aphid or whatever . I quarantined them from my other houseplants which displayed no similar problems . My Fukien Bonsai are now void of all leaves --- since Brussel 's Nursery / Amazon will not accept returns at this stage , I 'm trying to revive them with TLC . I have notified the U.S. Department of Agriculture that this supplier is distributing diseased stock . If / when Brussel 's gets their act together , I would highly recommend them .
2 #### 1 : No drip tray that 's required , but not mentioned . 2 : No rocks for tray , which say are included in included instructions . 3 : Soil so compacted that wo n't absorb any water .
2 #### The Bonsai came in superb condition and I followed religious followed the care booklet . The tree gradually deteriorated over the first month and the leaves began to drop of . This was followed by an infestation of black fly . It was at this time that I decided to move the plant outdoors . We live in the Pacific Northwest and the temperatures are relatively mild . I next contacted the vender and he said that the tree could survive temperatures in the high 40 's at night . The tree is slowly recovering outside .
5 #### Tree arrived shrink - wrapped and strapped to the bottom of a large box filled with packing ( very impressive packing ) . The tree was healthy and the soil was still moist , if anything it had too much soil . I took a fork and scooped out a good bit of soil so as not to have a huge mound around the trunk of the tree . The picture shows a blue tray , but mine was brown , but for me that worked better with my office 's color scheme . I added some baby tears to the soil as a ground cover and to keep the soil wetter . I did n't notice any leaves dropping like others have reported , in fact it 's putting out little white flowers that are great . Do n't believe the reviews that are two years old , maybe the trees were poor quality back then but the one I got is great .
5 #### Very Tasty . I 've had a hard time finding raw almonds that did n't have that weird mushy chew to them . These are terrific . I 'll be buying more .
5 #### I make my own almond butter with these . Sometimes I roast them in my oven first , which makes the butter get smooth faster , but sometimes , I just throw them in the food processor and let it work . I do n't add anything else . Cheaper and better for you than the commercial almond butters .
5 #### Very fresh raw almonds . I will definitely buy again . And 10 lbs is a lot , but I keep them in smaller bags in the fridge and freezer .
5 #### Excellent almonds , great tasting , fast shipping , nice little usps air resistant package . I must have eaten 30 to 40 immediately after box open ed and my kid 10 . Great tasting , again !
4 #### The price went up a little but still a good buy compared to grocery stores .
5 #### Great buy , and since I only use a few in my morning oatmeal , a great value ! And delicious !
5 #### VERY FRESH and crunchy almonds in heavy - duty plastic bag . ~ I separated into 1/2 gallon wide - mouth jars and keep in refrigerator for longest retention of flavor and crunch !
5 #### Very good taste & less costly than I can get anywhere else !
5 #### Best almonds I 've bought on here and i ve tried all the popular brands on here . Basically when I say best I should say freshest .
5 #### I received these 2 weeks ago and LOVE them . Almond milk , almond butter and in smoothies . I know 10 pounds will last a long time but I have already ordered 10 more pounds . These almonds are excellent .
5 #### The reviews on these were a bit mixed but they are fabulous . Some reviewers said they were dusty / dirty but mine arrived yesterday and they are perfect . These are more than a dollar a pound cheaper than the best price I can get around where I live .... when I can get them . I 'll definitely order them again when the time comes !
5 #### These almonds are tasty in recipes or just eating as a snack . I would buy them again .
5 #### I love using almond extract in desserts featuring chocolate , cherry , or both . It really enhances those flavors . This particular brand has a wonderful taste , and even better , it is organic . Simply Organic is a brand I use a lot for extracts , and this was an excellent purchase . Highly recommended .
5 #### I loved this . It smells wonderful and taste even better . I purchased it because I had never bought organic extract before this .
4 #### It has a good almond taste but it tastes much more like the bitter almond oil & not really the typically sweeter extract . Does n't seem though to give you a bitter almond after taste though so it bakes out well .
5 #### I love almond flavored desserts and knowing that this is organic makes me feel better . I sometimes use this as a substitute for vanilla when making muffins , pancakes , and other baked goods . I 've even used it in smoothies .
5 #### This brand is a favorite of mine . Good quality almond extract . Great price . The bottle showed up in perfect condition as well .
5 #### This is the most incredible almond extract I 've ever purchased ! I put it in everything including my coffee to make chemical free almond coffee ... a much better alternative than Dunkin !
5 #### Very good almonds . Fresh and taste great . Will definitely buy again .
2 #### Not sure I will buy this brand again- I purchase almonds to soak , dry , and then process into Almond Butter to make Almond Milk --- After pouring these Almonds into my soaking bowl and then adding the water , there was a distinct turpentine smell ... Only after rinsing about half a dozen times , did the smell fade --- I know that most Almonds have to be ' prepared ' before shipping , but never , ever smelled anything like this .. I contacted the company and was told " Our Almonds are bought directly from the farm . I am not sure what the issue is but we will bring it up with our quality control personnel and see if we find a similar issue and get back to you . " Have never heard back but based on the stereo- typical brush off , " not really interested in hearing complaints " that underlies this response , I did not expect any further reply .
5 #### Almonds tasted fresh , and you can not beat this price .
5 #### These are the very best almonds available for the price . I am a 3x repeat customer for these on Amazon and I am never disappointed . Quality , always fresh , taste great , large ( most about 7/8 " ; many 1 " ) . Buy with confidence . UPDATE : I just received another order on May 12 , 2017 and I must say there was no way I was going to keep them . They were " dirty " with all kinds of fuzzy / cobwebby looking things on them and many were molded . I have purchased these many times , and this is the first that this has happened . It could just be a fluke , but I am hesitant to buy again right now .
5 #### Good quality raw almonds . I mostly use them to make homemade almond milk . These work great for that purpose . They are also good as a snack when toasted .
4 #### Not quite as sweet tasting as the Kirkland raw almonds available at Costco stores ( in the baking ingredients aisle , not with the snack nuts ) . But a far superior value than any other retail source of almonds .
5 #### Great fresh taste ... I soaked the nuts and then dehydrated them to remove phytic acid and anti - nutrients before storing in jars .
5 #### I eat almonds everyday and this 10 lb bag was a great value and the almonds are fresh and great tasting .
2 #### Too many work traces , too much rancid and bitter almonds for the one package .
5 #### I made Mexican Wedding cookies with these . The taste of this extract is fantastic ! If you 've never tasted a high quality almond extract or sweet almond oil , you should definitely give this a shot . Your taste buds will thank you !
3 #### Meh ... Did a side by side test and it 's just OK ... Spice Island has much stronger essence ... just ok
5 #### This came very quickly after I ordered it . Good product . Quality of the bottle , and the way they shipped it was terrific . I would definitely order this again when I need it .
4 #### A good almond extract , and I like that it 's organic . I took off one star for high price . Should not cost that much .
5 #### Very nice flavor . As expected and no strange tastes ,
5 #### Very good product ! ! ! wanted these for my juicer , and works wonderful ! !
5 #### I am very pleased with these almonds . I regularly purchase almonds in 10 lb quantities and these are as good or better than any I 've purchased . They arrived promptly , were well packaged , and they have a very good taste and texture .
5 #### Californa is in a drought . Almonds require a lot of water . I bought these to supplement me throughout the year . Prices will rise . These almonds are about as good as you will acquire . Best wishes to you all . Buy bulk .
5 #### Delicious . I have tried a variety of other extracts and Simply Organic is by far my favorite . True rich flavors .
4 #### Strikes me as a little less intense than what I 'm accustomed to ; but I could be wrong . It smells and tastes wonderful and the price is right . I 'll buy it again .
4 #### Good , but I would 've liked it a little stronger .
5 #### Wedding shower gift & one for me too , I love this brand .
5 #### I use this all the time . A half teaspoon with one teaspoon of vanilla extract in white buttercream frosting us absolutely delughtful . Boys and men love it . I find simply organic has the most consistent and pleasant flavor than others I 've tried .
5 #### I have to say that I am OBSESSED with this extract . I use it on so many different things . You only need the tiniest amount to taste . Came on time . Will purchase again !
5 #### Excellent value ! I use this in my blueberry muffins and french toast , among other recipes , and it is every bit as good if not better than the much more expensive almond extract I have been purchasing at Whole Foods . The glass bottle is sturdy and sits well in my spice drawer and on the counter , unlike some other plastic extract bottles I have purchased in the past . Highly recommend .
5 #### I use this mainly when I 'm making macaroons but in some other cookies as well . It has a really nice , rich nutty flavor and you do n't have to add too much to get it . It comes in a good size bottle so it will be a while before I have to buy more which is nice . I love that it 's organic too so I do n't need to worry about the ingredients or having extra chemicals , etc . stuck in there with the almonds . And it 's cheaper than the local stores by a lot , especially if you do subscribe and save on it ! Will definitely buy again when I run out .
5 #### Great flavor . Being organic is the icing on the cake !
5 #### These were a gift for a friend who loves raw almonds and she loves these ! ! I would buy these again .
5 #### These are excellent quality and freeze well which is good because that 's a lot of almonds . And they 're healthful too .
5 #### I use this in my morning smoothies . Everything taste better with a little almond extract added .
5 #### Great for cooking . Made yummy Snowflake Balls for the holidays and they were delicious . Will definitely buy more .
5 #### Update : I 'm now on my second bottle and have also used this for Spanish almond cookies , almondrados , accentuating the almond flavor nicely . Without the extract the flavor is barely noticeable ; the extract makes all the difference . I found this to be a very good extract . I 've only used it in coconut macaroons , with this extract - just a half teaspoon - vanilla extract , and salt being the only flavors added ( to the sugar , shredded coconut , egg whites and a bit of flour ) , and it made for very tasty macaroons . Nothing overpowering to the flavor , just enough to contribute nicely to the overall taste , blending nicely with the coconut and vanilla . Glass bottle , not plastic , and I always appreciate organic when it 's available . Not a lot more to say , but I can certainly recommend this product .
5 #### Like the brand , flavor fresh and strong . Shipping was prompt .
1 #### I do not like the taste of this . Finally used it after getting it a week or so ago . The alcohol taste is just too overwhelming . It was so much so I Had a headache . Had The same issue with the vanilla extract I purchased , but from another seller .
5 #### Great almond extract . It 's my favorite one . Very strong almond flavor . I love that it 's organic .
5 #### If you love organic , I highly recommend this product .
5 #### My only complaint is the 2 oz bottle is too small . .4 oz is bigger and better ! :)
5 #### Love it . Good price . I use this stuff for baking and home made ice cream . Will order again for sure :)
5 #### I have this on my auto orders . Great price for organic Almond Extract
5 #### excellen , very concentrated , did n't loose potency after a year .
5 #### This is the best price when I was looking around this product . I trust this brand , and I trust Amazon . I carefully checked the expiration date , and found that it was really " new " product . So I now feel good about it more buying this kind of food product from Amazon .
5 #### I use almond extract in many family recipes . This extract gives a wonderful almond taste . The brand is certified organic , and donates a percentage of its sales to support organic farming and education .
5 #### I bake a lot , and this brand is not only easy on the pocket , but works as well or better than that other famous brand . Will buy many times again .
5 #### I enjoy the flavor of almond and find this product well worth the money . If the extract remains flavorful to the end , I will continue to buy and use it in the future .
5 #### This product arrived in good condition and it is exactly what I was looking for . I live almond flavor in some of my recipes but dislike the synthetic kind . This product fits my requirement perfectly .
5 #### When I got this , I promptly made sugar free , dark chocolate , almond brownies . Added slivered almonds and was delighted with the results . Yummy !
5 #### I needed this to make my mother - in - law 's pound cake . It works great and does n't have that strange taste that some of the extracts get . Definitely will buy it again .
5 #### Very pleased with the quality of this extract as almond flavor is hard to " nail " without an unpleasant aftertaste in your prepared product . This is great .
5 #### First of all , I love to use organic products . I am so tired of seeing our food supply come to us contaminated with pesticides , fungicides , etc . It is wonderful to find products being grown organically and using sustainable agriculture . The almond extract is excellent , and I will be buying more from Simply Organics in the future .
5 #### Used this yesterday in a new dessert and the flavor is exceptional . Very happy
4 #### Flavor okay but not as potent as I personally like . Glad got to try as an add on . In a pinch I may purchase it again . Shipped promptly arrived safely without issues .
4 #### I find this product to be just as tasty as other brands . This is the real thing ! NOT ARTIFICIAL !
4 #### Good vanilla . I use it for all my baking needs . Delivery was good .
5 #### Delicious vanilla extract , but no surprise . Frontier is always dependable .
5 #### Really good product , I usually make my own , but around the Holidays use so much of it , decided to buy this , was not disappointed .
5 #### Will be ordering this product repeatedly for my candy making . And again with the word requirement . Sheesh , if my store required this , I would never get a review .
5 #### Great product and very fresh . I have been buying almonds locally in bulk . These are a better price and much fresher !
3 #### I needed green tea for a diet and found this box on Amazon . It 's not my favorite green tea , but will be O.K. Wish I could have found peach green tea , but this one seems better for our purpose because I think it 's somehow more pure than the true fruity flavors . Probably wo n't order again . 100 is a lot of tea for our purposes .
5 #### This has a wonderful , smooth taste . I love green tea and the jasmine makes it a delicious change . YUM ! YUM !
5 #### This tea has a wonderful flavor ! ! The price is right . And I love that they do n't use staples on the bags . i can just throw the used ones right into the compost pit . Jasmine and green tea were meant to be together .
4 #### VERY BITTER if prepared with boiling water or steeped more than 3 or 4 minutes . I use hot but not boiling water and mix it with a rosehip / hibiscus blend and oolong ( total of 3 teabags per brew for two 10 - 12 oz mugs , sweetened with 1 teaspoon raw honey per mug . I 'm not brave enough to drink it unsweetened or alone , smells wonderful though . UPDATE 3/12/12 - I brewed this recently with bengal spice tea & love the combination .
5 #### Fabulous tea ! This makes a great presentation with frozen peaches floating in it . It has become my favorite organic tea .
2 #### I am a big fan of the high quality of Celestial Seasonings products and their usually good tea blends . This particular blend does not make the cut . I want to like it but somehow the coconut does not really work in this tea . The aroma is artificial coconut , and the flavor is a strange somewhat musty coconut flavor without noticable chai spice . Drinkable but an eccentric blend -- perhaps a diehard coconut lover would find this appealing . Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging : they utilize 100 % natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they do n't package each tea bag individually . Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it . It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag . The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface . Quote from the box : " Love the moment and the energy of that moment will spread beyond all boundaries . " Corita Kent .
3 #### It was OK . I ate it . But a little dry , and should have had more flavor .
4 #### These almonds were slightly crunchy for the most part , and had a rich taste . The 8 oz size was more fresh than the the larger 5 lb one , but the latter was okay as well . Apart from the few bitter almonds that come with most orders of raw almonds , these were good . Almonds have a host of health benefits , and are a great addition to a trail mix . They 're also great slightly roasted or for use in an almond milk recipe . For anyone considering these , opt for the larger 2 - 3 lb size as the value is much better , and the quality does not suffer . If you do n't mind picking out a few bad ones , opt for the 5 lb one . Had a few bitter almonds , but good quality nonetheless .
5 #### I love almonds and these are delicious . Great buy ! !
3 #### It 's ok . I really could n't taste the coconut , but the chai was good .
5 #### I use them to make my milk . homemade almond milk is the best .your milk is so much richer and thicker than store bought . and makes wonderful almond butter . and the company is very knowledgeable about there nuts
3 #### I ordered a significant batch of this variety of tea , mostly because I love the peach flavored , and wanted black tea , so I figured the combined taste might be nice . The flavor took a little while for me to get used to ( like half of one box ) . I generally drink it with and without artificial sweetener . It does brew fast and it 's nice that I do n't have to heat up water to do so . I 'm not sure if I will order this flavor again or not . If you 're unsure , buy one individual box , try it , and if you like it then take advantage of this great pricing .
5 #### Great snack . No salt and not roasted so you get all the healthy goodness . Also is a great price . It is a lot of nuts but I use a vacuum sealer to keep them fresh .
5 #### The package arrived earlier than I had expected and the packaging was great . The nuts were very fresh and great tasting . I will continue to order from this vendor .
5 #### Love this . Have given this to my MD office and my friends also
5 #### Delicious tea , and an Earl Grey that has the bergamot toned down a bit . It is more of a soft undertone of bergamot oil rather than the in - your - face strength of many Earl Greys . I recommend this for anyone who loves Earl Grey but find it too bergamot - y. This Victorian Earl Grey is very very good .
5 #### Favorite Fast brews in cold Water for people on the go ! Tastes is Peachy Perfect ! Classic cold drink for on the Go people ! Or sweet dreams , when warmed for a sleepy soul !
5 #### This is HANDS DOWN the best Chai on the market . Wait ... I mean , this is the worst ! Do n't buy it . Leave it for me . ALL of it . :)
5 #### If you 're into pumpkin spice , you 'll love this tea . Smells amazing
5 #### I made some AWESOME iced tea with the Pumpkin tea bags and some Lipton regular bags . It 's a gift from heaven . Absolutely perfect ...
5 #### Very good almonds . I have made this same purchase many times and they are always delivered on time and fresh .
5 #### These are great RAW almonds ! I use them to make fresh almond milk & I save the pulp to use in other recipes . Much better than buying watery tasting almond milk from the store with so many unnecessary added ingredients . Pure raw almonds from Food To Live are the way to go !
3 #### It tastes like unsweetened Kool - Aid ... Oh - No ! Not Oh Yeah !
5 #### YUMMY ! We have been purchasing raw nuts in bulk from our local health food store and grocery store , and they were crazy expensive , so I decided to try Amazon 's subscription service to save money . What we now know is that we were not only paying too much , but we were also getting nuts that were stale . These almonds are fresh , crisp , and flavorful as if I had cracked the shells myself . Definitely staying on subscription for these !
5 #### Love this product . It came fast and was packaged well . Will order again .
5 #### Like this tea sweetened with stevia instead of bad sweeteners . Descent price , glad I found , hard to find in my home town ,
5 #### i would not be with out this one day , my favorite drink . that s all i drink this and my coffee . if you try it you will never stop drinking it , the best Lemonade tea ever
5 #### Man this tea is great and all the right spices . You have to try it iced with coconut milk creamer to .
1 #### Worst almonds I ever tasted . About every 7th or 8th almond has a heavy perfume taste . Does not even deserve 1 star .
5 #### Great tasting Almonds -- whole , raw , and unsalted as promised -- at an excellent value price . I will purchase again .
4 #### Really good , but a pricey for just two pounds .
5 #### SERIOUSLY , the best tasting cold brew tea out there . I 've tried SOOOOO many and I love this one best .
3 #### Good brand . Flavor fair . Bigelow cold brew far superior .
3 #### Ordered this as gift for friend but she said it tasted rather stale , wonder how long it has been sitting at Amazon . Normally this is quite a pick me up tea . It was still drinkable , just a little flat .
3 #### I really like the Dirty Chai that Celestial makes . I thought this would be the same , without the espresso . Unfortunately it does not have the same flavor . Try out one bag or box with a friend before buying a bunch .
5 #### Oh I love this tea . ( coconut thai chai ) It was formally know as sweet thai coconut ( decaf ) . I contacted Celestial to ask what happened to the flavor after it became impossible to find . The told me that this flavor would be replacing it . It 's the same flavor , but it now contains caffeine . It 's new version is a red /black tea blend and taste just how I remembered it . I recommend making this less sweet , then adding some international delight French vanilla creamer . Oh my GOD
5 #### This is fantastic tea when served chilled .. I use 5 bags for 1 liter of water and steep for 30 minutes . Chill and serve with a little 2 % milk .. I use a little bit of Monin Sugar Free sweetener and it 's magical .... Oh , best to stock up on this during the autumn when it can be purchased in - store for around $ 3 a box .
5 #### These are on subscribe and save , I eat raw nuts every day . These are quality nuts and I also gift them at Christmas
5 #### I absolutely love this tea . I had purchased the peach version first which I also liked a lot , and I wanted to try the raspberry kind . I decided to commit and purchase the six boxes . One of the best things is the fact that you can make this healthy ( sugar free ) yet delicious drink in under 15 minutes : you 're only suppos d to brew for a few minutes , but I let mine sit in the fridge for awhile because I like stronger tea flavor . I sweeten it with natural stevia and it 's some of the best iced tea I 've ever had ! Will definitely keep buying ! I use about 12 bags to make theee liters . Yes it costs more than buying powdered sugary tea but it 's so worth it !
5 #### Hubby 's favorite tea . Sweet , mild flavor that reminds you of a crisp fall day .
5 #### I really like this iced tea , as it helps me drink more water , without adding more sugar to my diet . I read another review ( not on Amazon ) that claimed that it tasted like " unsweetened Kool - Aid " and it absolutely does , but I think that makes it taste really good ! I drink this plain or with a packet of True Lemon or True Orange . I was a little worried about the rooibos component , as I do n't care for rooibos , but it has a very mild rooibos flavor . I brew this with 2 bags for ~20 oz of cold water , then add ice . ( The tea does n't seem to brew correctly in ice water . )
5 #### I have been using these to make my own almond milk . The resulting milk tastes great . I use the left over almond meal for baking and has made some excellent paleo chocolate chip cookies . My kids are usually avoidant of eating nuts , but they will gobble down those cookies just like any other chocolate chip cookie .
1 #### So so disappointed , they use ppo to pasteurize these almonds . Please do NOT buys these , PPO is a jet fuel additive that has been banned from racing because it is so hazardous to your health . Somehow it 's legal to spray on food and then feed it to children . My daughter gets rashes whenever she eats almonds that have ppo on them . I thought these would be ok , but she got the rash and I emailed them to ask , they responded and told me that they do in fact use PPO pasteurization , so sad . Food to live has organic almonds that are fine , but stay away from these .
3 #### Love me some whole almonds , but damn - $ 33 - 39 for a big bag does n't last long .
5 #### This was my first time placing an order with this company , the package of Almonds were fresh , and quite delicious .
3 #### Tried it for a while but the Black Tea they use is not very good . Just alright .
2 #### I admit I was spoiled by another brands " Double Bergamot " tea , but this seems to have just the barest hint of it . It 's a nice enough black tea .
5 #### My favorite blend for making thai iced tea ! Does n't have the dyes most of the others do .
5 #### LOVE this . Ca n't find it in the stores around me . Great pumpkin flavor .
5 #### Best price ANYWHERE for ORGANIC almonds . Lots of flavor which is great for my snacks and homemade Cashew Almond milk ( 2 cups Food To Live Organic almonds + 1 cup Food To Live Organic cashews makes 2 Ball jars ) which I discovered at an amazing boutique coffee roaster / shop in Denver .
1 #### Disappointed ! Received this product expecting a great tasting snack . To my dismay , they not only taste stale but more upsetting is the fact that in every mouthful there is at least one bad almond . I had expected an organic product to be of superior quality . Will be contacting Amazon customer support with this complaint .
3 #### Really wanted to like these almonds more , since they 're such a good deal ( in the 12 lb size ) ... but they 're not what I hoped for . They mostly have a decent flavor , but a large percentage are flat / thin ( compared to the nice plump almonds from my local bulk store ) , and there 's a much higher percentage of " bitter " almonds than I 'm used to ( on the order of 1 per handful or two ) . Turns out these are Spanish almonds ( Valencia I think ) and not like the California almonds I 'm used to ... it really should say that clearly when shopping online , instead of having to wait until they arrive to discover that . On the other hand , the Food To Live customer service was quite good ... the solicited my input , which I gave honestly , and they kicked back a rebate to my account to make up for my disappointment .
3 #### Not bad , not good , could use some more kick as the taste alone is not enough reason to purchase this tea .
5 #### Yes , I mix it with green tea and lemon .
5 #### It tastes delectable and appears to make an incredible showing with regards to of awakening me . I have n't possessed the capacity to get enough rest of late and have truly been feeling the effects . The tea was precisely as portrayed .
5 #### I tried this tea when I was out at a diner and they had this tea and WOW ! It 's delicious . I 'm kind of a picky tea drinker . I only have a few teas in my house that I drink regularly and this is apart of it . You have to try it to know what I mean . It 's hard to explain , but it 's delicious .
5 #### I love this spicy tea . This is the first tea that is so delicious that I can drink it hot without sugar . I need sugar in other hot teas . Strong flavor but delicious . I first found it at our Meijers store but will order now from Amazon as the store does n't have it anymore or are always out , not sure which .
2 #### I have ordered these nuts multiple and absolutely loved the taste , quality , and service . I have referred all of my almond loving friends to order from this company . However , I was extremely disappointed with my last order . I ordered 2 very large bags , but so many of the nuts were sour ! Every 1 out of every 6 was so gross I had to spit them out . No one would eat them . I spoke to one of my coworkers , who I had referred to buy these nuts , and she said her last batch was sour as well . Nuts are so expensive and I order such large quantities I do n't want to risk receiving another bad batch and will be looking for a different seller . So disappointed ):
5 #### Fresh and a full almond taste for making milks , cookies , and cereals
4 #### Usually have no problem with these , but this batch tasted funny . Gave it 4 stars bc I have never had a problem with this company and have been buying for years .
5 #### I started drinking fruit / veggie / protein powder smoothies about nine months ago after seeing " Fat Sick & Nearly Dead " but wanting something more satiating than straight juice . I started with one of their smoothie recipes ( alas , I can not provide a link ) and tweaked it . They suggested coconut water for the liquid , but what I found in the supermarket seemed overpriced and full of undesirable ingredients . I decided to use tea instead , and this is the tea I use . This is a nice , energizing start to my morning . I buy it by the case via Subscribe & Save , as I do all the tea I drink regularly .
5 #### Good product , but please note it contains black tea . It 's not entirely herbal as is the country peach . DEFINITELY DOES NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT STRONG PEACH FLAVOR ; wo n't buy again
5 #### This tea is delicious ! I put a little bit of cream in it when I make it .
5 #### I love pumpkin teas and this one is extra yummy .
5 #### I discovered this at another store and became addicted . Tea , cocoa , espresso and spices ? Some of my favorite things !
5 #### This is great iced tea without the hassle of boiling water and waiting for it too cool . It tastes so good .
5 #### Fresh and delicious . These almonds surpassed my expectations . I will definitely be purchasing these regularly .
3 #### Seem to be ok . Flavor taste like cherries . Sometimes the cherry taste is strong and overpowering , leaving a kinda strange cherry aftertaste .
3 #### They are good but often you will chew one that is real bitter .
5 #### This is one of our favorite versions of Earl Grey and I have not been able to find it in any stores locally . I was very pleased to find this online . The bergamot is not very strong and the tea has a hint of orange flavor and nice floral scent . We have drank this with creamer and without and love having it as an addition to drink options .
5 #### Very tasty , ca n't really detect the cocoa but the coffee flavor is noticeable , if light .
5 #### Wife loves it ! Brownie points for me and fudge brownies .....
5 #### I gave these molasses to my mom and she called me a day later to tell me how much she enjoyed eating them . She said that she really like that the molasses were not bitter ( no sulfur added ) . I will order a bottle for me next ! Update : When I purchased this bottle of unsulfured blackstrap molasses for my mother the price per bottle was not so ridiculously high . I will buy my molasses locally from now on !
5 #### this is really good stuff ... brews quickly in cold water , add a bit of stevia and ice and VOILA ! a great , refreshing and low calorie pick me up !
5 #### One of my favorite teas ! Rich and sweet and fantastically decadent I would recommend to try make it as an actual Chai Tea , that is the milk tea or the tea with some milk added into it . That is how I do my Chai : I heated up a mug of unsweetened vanilla almond / soya milk , froth it a bit , and then drop a tea bag in . As with all herbal teas I like them better when sweetened , this one is no different . So I add a tiny bit of sweetener(I use agave ) This drink definitely satisfies my sweet tooth , and I recommend trying it like this to anyone , especially those who are unsatisfied with the tea 's flavor when it 's made with water . Great treat for a fraction of calories/ Again , I would definitely recommend this tea . 5 out of 5 and thank you , Celestial Seasonings ) PS the tea is certified kosher and all - natural in case you are wondering :)
5 #### This is the best tea for making milk tea with . I brew 2 bags with lots of sugar in a cup of water and add about another cup of hot soymilk . Yum ! If I have some boiled boba I add those too . Delicious and never bitter !
5 #### Just like I remembered . I use to drink this year 's ago and bought it from another website . It is this same great quality . Very good for you . I will buy this again for sure
5 #### If you are low in iron this stuff is for you .
5 #### Love them ! Great taste and perfect for my homemade trail mix .
5 #### After extensive research , its the only brand I purchase , again and again . They are excellent . I am grateful that such a clean , unadulterated product like this is made available so readily , and yes , so inexpensively . Thank you .
5 #### I had my doubts about this stuff , especially with the reviews that say this stuff tastes like licorice . Gag . I HATE licorice lol . It does n't taste like licorice AT ALL ! ! I think it actually tastes like prunes , not my favorite flavor but very tolerable ! I mix mine in some raw milk , but I have tasted it in coffee as well and it 's an awesome balance to the bitter tones ! Will definitely buy again , it 's also a fantastic way to replace coffee if you 're trying to quit , it 's full of vitamins and minerals to help you feel more alert than coffee , and without the caffeine crash . Thanks for a great product ! !
5 #### Fast shipping . This product is not for the faint at heart the taste is a bit harsh if taken straight
4 #### The cold brew does n't have a particularly strong flavor , but it was still quite good . I will try a hot brew to see if there is a difference .
5 #### I really like the extra boost this tea gives to me in the morning . I combine it with chai for and even better cup of tasty tea .
5 #### This will move ya at only a teaspoon a day !
3 #### I need more time to give an honest review as I bought this for my anemia . I have not taken it long enough to know if it is helping or not . Will update in a couple of months .
5 #### ... i was told this would taste awful ... but not bad ... i will use in coffee with my pauling protocol and ribose .. My bottle had leaked some ... it had the plastic around top and was bubble wrapped well but top was loose ... my recommendation would be to hand tighten before shipping or even better seal with foil ..
4 #### These are fine . Decent quality , good price . No issues with rancid almonds in the version I received . The bag actually stands up okay on these , which is nice ! You can store them vertically without moving them to a diff container , unlike some bulk packages .
1 #### Has an awful after taste . As if there is almond extract in it . Threw away 2 lb . bag . Last time to purchase ..
5 #### Very pleased with these organic almonds . I 've made almond milk with them so far .
4 #### I use these in place of wheat or any other grains for baking as well as just eating . I soak and dehydrate then run through my processor to make almond meal . They taste great but are very expensive .
1 #### Horrible . Will be returning . Taste like very strong perfume Would not even give it 1 star .
5 #### This Molasses has a less bitter , slightly sweeter taste than other brands of blackstrap molasses . Definitely worth looking for this brand .
4 #### While I like the Twinnings Peach Cold Brew a bit better ( hence four starts , not five ) as far as natural peach flavor goes , this stuff is great every day tea . Flavor is rich and smooth - as long as it is n't over - brewed . Sweetens will with honey and/or Stevia . I made a few pitchers of it for a potluck and it was gone before the other beverages there ! It 's cheaper than the Twinnings which is why I make it a weekday treat and save the other for weekends .
5 #### I have NEVER liked molasses but needed to find a way to get more iron into my body . I had heard that blackstrap molasses was the best to take so I purchased Plantation based on an article I read online . I am here to tell you , this stuff is sweet rather than sharp and bitter . I add my daily tablespoon in my morning coffee to sweeten and it is delicious ! I could probably eat the tablespoon just by licking the spoon but it is very sweet and I 've been off white sugar long enough that too much sweet is a horrible taste to me . This works perfectly . I just use the stronger stuff for my baked beans - this is perfect for " medicinal " purposes ! If you need more iron , I 'd recommend this . If you do n't like super strongly flavored molasses , this is one you 'd like - not too strong , good flavor , sweet , and good for you !
5 #### This organic Plantation molasses brand is by far my favorite . It has such a rich , full - bodied flavor , and is long and taste , but short on sweetness . Compared to the Patty 's brand , it is just more satisfying . I eat a tablespoon or so a day , right off the spoon . What a treat . I know it has great health benefits , and it never adversely affects my blood sugars ( diabetic ) . Love that it is organic and unsulphered . It 's super thick , but well worth the wait for it to pour out ...
5 #### Great taste , good price . Purchased this because I heard it can have very positive and beneficial health results . Thanks so much !
5 #### This Pumpkin Harvest tea is an amazing flavor for getting into the fall and winter spirit . It has a great pumpkin flavor that is enhanced when a little sugar and real cream is added to the cup . This tea only requires the usual 5 or so minutes to make a rich and satisfying cup of tea . It also comes packaged in a cute box that for fall , can be left out and blend into your fall dcor .
5 #### Excellent almonds . Their sweet flavor made it difficult for me to stop eating them . Best tasting almonds I 've had .
1 #### We are honest buyers from Amazon . 1 STAR FOR THIS PRODUCT : Overall Quality - not good . Overall taste - not good . Many almonds were smashed , chipped , and broken in half . We are disappointed with this purchase . Returning package for refund . We eat almonds regularly and we have tried several brands .... thought we would give this brand a try --- we will not be ordering this brand from this supplier again . Other companies and suppliers offer a much better raw organic almond , you can believe it !
5 #### I have been drinking this tea for years and it is hard to find in stores . Thank you Amazon for carrying it ! I very rarely drink coffee but still want the caffeine and love the flavor of this tea . Yum !
1 #### The product says that it is gluten - free , but also states in the product details , " This product is processed in a facility that also processes wheat . " THIS IS NOT A GLUTEN - FREE PRODUCT ! ! ! Plus , the nuts are pasteurized , and therefore not raw . This is deceptive advertising , and I almost fell into the pit . I 'm glad I read on to find out the details .
1 #### I already posted on this . One in a handful of almonds throughout the bag have a STRONG anise taste . I sent the manufacturer all the information including Best Buy , Lot # , and country of origin . Never even received a " sorry for the inconvenience " email back from them . I wo n't buy this brand again .
5 #### The best ORGANIC almonds we have found .... Now i just need to find an organic milk bag ... We are so excited to start making our own almond milk . We are so impressed that we have ordered cashews and hemp seeds .
5 #### Almonds tasted fresh and slightly sweet , not at all bitter . I feel fortune to be able to obtain these truly raw almonds . I make almond milk , eat them out of hand and bake with them . I will order again .
5 #### I have had these teabags in the past and really enjoy how easy they are to use and make a batch of ice tea . Out here in AZ we all enjoy a nice cold glass of ice tea and these work perfectly to make our daily dose . I am able to make a new batch whenever I want and the tea is iced cold when I want it . The flavor is light ... it does n't overwhelm the tea taste .
3 #### they have an occasional bitter nut . We reported this to the company and they went us a new bag .
5 #### Great product ! This is my third order . Great for protein for my morning smoothies . I will continue to order this product .
5 #### I am very pleased with the taste , freshness and quality of the product . Pricing is also budget friendly .
4 #### Pretty good , can be overly sweet at times , but I like it in small doses . Really good for fall ! I keep some in my office for afternoon pick me ups . Might not buy again but I 'm happy with my purchase now .
5 #### A fantastic tea with beautiful art to boot . Hard to find , harder to find reasonably priced but you just ca n't go through the season without buying at least one box .
3 #### The name of this tea is amazing . i just had to try it . It 's OK . It tastes like a good black tea . It 's rich and smooth . I drink a cup some mornings when I 'm seeking caffeine . It 's a pleasant cup of tea .
3 #### I like the flavor of this tea . It has a pumpkin taste that 's not covered up by the spices . With that being said , I 'm removing two stars because of the bitter aftertaste of stevia . I wish they would leave it out completely . I have to add sugar to cut the bitterness , and for health reasons I prefer not to add sugar to tea . Because of having to add sugar , unfortunately this wo n't be a tea I drink very often , which is a shame since its the only pumpkin tea I can find that actually tastes like pumpkin rather than chai . * * * Updated : So I 'm through one entire box of this and my opinion has been downgraded a bit . Each cup I enjoyed less and less . Of course that 's because a friend gave me a few bags of Bigelow Pumpkin Spice tea which blows this out of the water and no bitter aftertaste . So while I think this tea is worth a try ( we all have different tastes afterall ) , it 's not one I will be buying again .
1 #### Visually spectacular and the first few handfuls were fantastic . Then I kept eating them . Someone else on here said , " In about one out of every handful , " I tend to agree with that . I STRONG anise taste that was extremely offensive . It left my tongue numb for a few minutes . I dumped all the almonds out of the 1 pound bag and inspected all of them . They all looked fine . I started eating them again , and found a couple more that had this horrific taste . ( I 'm an almond HOUND , and I can tell you , I 've never had an almond taste like that ! ) I sent an email to the company . I was n't asking to be reimbursed or looking for anything free . I simply wanted them to know that : 1 pound , raw unpasteurized , organic almond , Best if Used By Date : May 2017 , Country of Origin : SPAIN , Lot Number SO-03490 had a strong , offensive anise taste . On their web site , they DO sell anise products . I figured it was cross - contamination . I sent that email a few weeks ago . I have n't heard anything at all from them . I 'll never buy any products from this manufacturer again . AWFUL ! AWFUL ! ! ! !
3 #### My fault for not reading closer , but there is no resemblance between this and what I was getting in k - cups until they decided to discontinue the product . Tastes OK , but needs more " doctoring up " than the k - cup version did .
1 #### This was n't just peach tea - it has a spice to it that I did n't like at all . I ended up giving away the rest of the boxes , so it was a huge waste .
5 #### I really love this tea . I discovered it after a hospital stay when I needed something warm and caffeine free to take my medication with . I heat the water for at least 2 minutes , then let the tea steep for 25 minutes . I follow this with 1 teaspoon of sugar and three shakes of cinnamon powder . if let to sit for another minute or two and blend after stirring it tastes exactly like cinnamon graham crackers .
5 #### I love this tea & was so sad when my local stores stopped carrying it . As usual Amazon came to my rescue . Very delightful taste & aroma !
4 #### Great NATURAL cold brew ice tea ! ! ! Have used this for years , all year round , and love the fact it is quick and easy , and all natural . Great value on Amazon . The Peach flavor is so tasty it needs no sweetener at all . Delicious drink with ZERO calories . Works for me ! !
5 #### so delish and easy to make . shipped fast too
5 #### Arrive fresh , and stayed that way till they gone . Much better flavor of natural raw almonds than other brands
4 #### Like being hit with a coconut . Nice late evening drink , or an iced tea .
5 #### Incredible tea , I buy it in these 6box packs every few months . I drink several cups a day . Delicious tea that I now worry over if I run low on it !
5 #### I think this is the best chai tea I have found .
5 #### Delicious tea . My family loves it . I have to keep it well stocked , so I 'm now a regular purchaser of the cool brew peach tea .
5 #### I have been drinking this tea for years . Sometimes I put a little bit of honey in it , sometimes I do n't . I like the taste . Mainly I drink it because I do n't drink coffee so it 's my morning drink .
5 #### I love this flavor tea but it 's hard to find . I bought the six pack so I could share with my family . It also takes good cold .
5 #### This is the best bagged Chai Tea I have ever purchased .
5 #### The shipping is too much on this . You can purchase simple ones with Prime and save $ 3 . Otherwise the product is fantastic .
5 #### The almonds were delicious ! Arrived quickly and as described .
5 #### Lovely and subtle flavor . I like to combine with Roastaroma and some milk for a perfect cup of tea !
1 #### This chai tea has been de - chai - ed . Chai has a specific flavor profile - it 's tea , and warm spice , such as pepper , clove , cardamom , ginger . This tasted vaguely clove - ish , no tea flavor , and then ... There is this big hit of fake - smelling ( it 's as much an aroma as a flavor ) vanilla perfume . You know what the perfume made me think of ? It reminded me of the smell of my mother 's powder compacts when I was a kid 40 years ago . I did n't like kissing my mother when her face was covered with makeup and I do n't like drinking this tea now . This odor is so strong that it stayed in my mug even after washing it in the sink . If chai is what you seek , move along .
1 #### I do n't know what I was expecting , but this is a flavor all its own , I love tea , and I could n't drink a cup of this , a lot of different flavors that I did n't like
5 #### This is the second time I order raw organic almonds from " Food To Live " . They are really good . I make almond milk all the time , so these work out really well . I have also bought raw organic hazelnuts and cashews from this company . All very very good !
5 #### Great price for organic almonds . I use them to make milk and also soak and dry them to eat . Yummy !
3 #### New Chai Tea is o.k . , but I ca n't taste any Coconut Flavoring in it . It seems as if I always have to add a big more spice to the Chai teas , but this one will definitely need a few drops of coconut extract .
5 #### DELICIOUS Refreshing Easy to make just add water & refridgerate can make a gallon at a time I use 6 bags
5 #### Amazing warm flavor ! It 's very soothing and is almost like a treat itself .
5 #### Been drinking this tea for 25 years , I love the taste and the convenience of not having to make the mate the old fashioned way in boiling water in a gourd and drinking with a silver mate straw . The tea gives you a great boost of energy without the usual effect of jitters if you overdue caffeine ( IMO ) . Love the taste and it brews nicely . If you get just Mate ( tea ) it is so fine some of it ends up in your cup if you try to use a loose tea screen . This is a blend of black tea and Mate in a no - string attached tea bag . Great taste of black tea and the energy boost of Mate .
4 #### I 'd give it 5 stars but there were WAY too many broken nuts in this bag . Much more each of the past 2 or 3 times .
4 #### We purchased a large bag of these mainly to make almond milk for smoothies and to replace regular lactose milk types , so far they have been working out well ! We always soak and sprout them , but they do taste pretty good and smooth with a nice flavor just regular as a snack too . I read all of the info and reviews about raw / sprouting etc and it seems these are popular and legit as far as all that goes , though we are beginners to this area FTL seems to be reputable and well recommended . There were a decent amount of broken / cracked almonds , I suppose this ca n't be avoided but it did seem a little more than expected - I 'd say maybe 15 - 20 % overall . Again totally ok to snack on and taste yummy even without soaking so we just eat the cracked and broken ones this way , but it was a little disappointing - could be how these large bags all come though regardless of brand Price is definitely not cheap but compared to other raw bags of this size it was a on the lower side , and if you are in the market for these you know you know they just cost more . Worth it though for us at least to have lactose free , healthy fresh almond milk :) Will definitely buy these again !
5 #### Really good almonds and easy to make almond milk with .
5 #### Good product . We like our iced tea with the added Chai tea .
5 #### Love this Chai . The flavors are blended much better than most . Love that it 's decaf . Add English Toffee Stevia and you are all set ! Seller shipped Promptly .
5 #### All of the packs of the tea were there . It smell like a pumpkin pie . The color of the box is correct as well .
5 #### I love this brand of tea . I had the K cups , but decided to try the bags instead . I find no difference in the taste and the value is much better . Great buy .
5 #### Love the tea ! Got it fresh and not on the edge of expiration . Good price . Fast shipping .
5 #### I am using it to make almond milk for my daily smoothies . Excellent taste and texture !
5 #### These are really good , high quality almonds ! I will definitely be a repeat customer !
5 #### As far as freshness , quality , flavor and packaging is concerned , this product and all there other nuts that I have tried , rank the highest in my book .
5 #### Good tea . Wakes me up as well as coffee !
5 #### I used to be a die hard coffee drinker , but over past couple months I have been drinking more tea . In my opinion this tea gives you more kick than a cup of coffee , but without the dry mouth or heart fluttering sensation ! Tastes very earthy , not sweet . Great way to start the day or kick up your day anytime . I do n't steep more than 4 minutes or it starts to get too bitter .
5 #### Our favorite drink to serve company , winter or summer . Everyone likes it and it 's quick to brew up a pitcher .
2 #### Ugh . I really wanted to like this , but it just tastes weird . It 's incredibly sweet ( yes , yes , I see the word " sweet " in it 's name ) , much too sweet for me . I am a fan of other Celestial Seasonings offerings , but this is a miss .
5 #### Oh such nice tea ! I wanted this for Halloween and had it , and then when I went to my daughter 's for Thanksgiving she served this with dessert . Keep in mind that this is a type of black tea and therefore does contain some caffeine . ( as I am used to most Celestial Seasonings tea not having caffeine ) Was still able to drink this in the evening though without any problems sleeping .
5 #### you get your money worth will buy again and again
5 #### These organic , raw almonds are the real deal - and grown in Spain , which is important to avoid the pasteurisation process required in the USA . I soak a handful overnight for smoothies in the morning . They actually start to sprout if you let them , so you know they are alive !
4 #### I got these and put them in the refrigerator since I did not need them yet . I got them out a few days ago and ate a handful . ( After 2 months in refrigeration ) Most of the almonds were very good but some of them had a bitter , strong , artificial almost taste - tasted like someone poured almond extract on them . Later I ate a few more - wondering if it was a fluke - the same experience . I was so disappointed since the other almonds were so good . It is too late to return them . My advice to others is to taste them when you get them . This was a substantial financial loss - $ 20 plus dollars . 2 - 15 - 16 Update : I have received a refund on this product without a lot of hassle . I have been tempted to try them again since it seems my experience appears to be unusual - by looking at other reviews .
5 #### Everyone in my family agrees these are the best almonds we 've ever eaten .
5 #### Fresh - Perfect - Amazing ! Will buy again ! Highly recommend !
3 #### I thought I would love this more after reading the other reviews . I find it to be too sweet .
1 #### I adore iced tea , but dislike having to go to all the trouble of boiling water to steep it . This is especially a problem at work . I saw these cold - brewed teas , and since this particular brand had all the good reviews , decided to try it . I was tickled when it arrived today . Yuk ! Tastes like Kool - Aid , without the sweetening . It smells pretty good in the box , but once you " brew " it , following the directions on the box ( 1 -2 bags per 8 oz . of cool water -- I used two bags per 8 oz . because I like my iced tea strong -- and steep for ten minutes . ) After ten minutes I had a pitcher full of colored water with a weak slightly - bitter artificial peach taste . Really gross . Guess I 'm back to boiling water and making my pitcher of iced tea with a combination of black tea and Constant Comment -- yum ! I definitely do n't recommend this product . Now I 'm stuck with four big boxes of it . Maybe I can use it as sachet in my kids ' sock drawers or in between sheets in the linen closet or something like that . It really does smell nice when it 's dry in the bag in the box . Just do n't drink it . Ewww -- just took another sip . DOUBLE YUK !
3 #### Although I love Celestial Seasonings teas , this one was a little bitter with no pumpkin flavor .
5 #### Good product . If the price is good when you go to purchase , then you ca n't go wrong with these .
5 #### This is my favorite tea ! I am not a big fan of spiced teas so its hard to find a good pumpkin tea that is n't a chai or spiced . This is perfect . My whole family loves it . Super smooth with a splash of cream .
5 #### The enjoyment starts when you take the cellophane wrapper off the box . The smell is tantalizing . I got this yesterday , and I 've already enjoyed three cups of this delicious tea . Perfect for Fall .
3 #### I bought this to drink in place of coffee because I was concerned that coffee was causing health problems but was suffering from caffeine - withdrawal headaches . Luckily the coffee was n't the root of my problems so I 'm back to drinking every morning because this tea is not very tasty and does n't give me the pick - me - up I was hoping it would . It just tastes to me like plain black tea and I really prefer to taste something in my tea- cinnamon , mint , orange , spice , SOMETHING ! It might be ok with lemon or a dash of sugar and cinnamon ... I've got 6 boxes so I 'll try some variations and report back .
5 #### Yummy tea . We started buying these bulk deals on celestial seasonings iced black tea about a year ago when we decided to stop drinking sodas and drink something more healthy . This tea is really tasty and one order lasts us practically forever . The trick is to actually boil the bags anyway . If you do , it makes much more / stronger tea than regular non - cold brew iced tea . We bought a 5 gallon glass pitcher with a spout . We boil six bags of tea in a one gallon pot , then we dump that pot into the 5 gallon pitcher with four gallons of water in it . Since this is black cool brew tea that we boiled , 6 bags makes five gallons of tea for us . The pitcher fits neatly in the fridge , and so we have strong , cold flavored tea on tap for very little . When we are looking to do something fancy , we make Arnold Palmers with the tea by adding lemon juice and sugar . We got a nice little system down , you should try it . Make sure you measure wherever you plan to put the glass pitcher / dispenser in your fridge and you buy one that fits . Taller is better as the tea comes out easier and it takes less room . We have tried both the raspberry and peach flavors . We like the raspberry a little bit better , but the peach is a close second . Enjoy !
5 #### Product arrived in a timely manner and as described .
5 #### Wow ! I finally found another source for TRULY RAW almonds that are not pasteurized ! ! Yay ! Pasteurization kills the enzymes and even though they are still called ' raw ' in the stores they are not if they have been pasteurized . So , finding this great source is wonderful ! ! ! And I happen to think they are a great price too ! Do not confuse other fake raw products with these :)
5 #### Arrived sealed and undamaged , happy with purchase , would buy from again .
5 #### Love it . Keep a pitcher of ice tea in the refrigerator at all times .
5 #### I ordered these a couple months ago and just got around to opening them ..... I am so impressed . While eating them there is almost a subtle aftertaste , which you quickly realize is the actual flavor of the almond! ..... NOT present in almonds produced and widely sold here in the USA . You will immediately recognize the difference . I stopped what I was doing to write this quick review , thank you Food To Live for a fantastic , natural , organic product
5 #### I tried soaking the almonds to sprout them . They sprouted quickly ! Then dehydrated them . Now I 'm making almond butter . I never knew almonds could taste like pecans , but they do . Sweet and mild . No bitter taste . And if feels so good know these nuts are truly healthy . I will definatly buy these again .
5 #### This is a staple in our house-- this and the other flavors from Celestial Seasonings Cold Brew teas are the best cold - brew teas available . We drink these year - round , as they are flavorful and refreshing and SOOOO easy to make ! Our dinner guests enjoy them as much as we do ! !
5 #### i 've been using this tea for years and it 's the tastiest black tea i 've ever tried by celestial seasonings and the caffein gives a great lift .
5 #### To me this tastes a lot like an unsweetened version of Hawaiian Punch . Of course , whether you like this or not will depend on what sort of flavor profile you are looking for and I was looking for a very fruity tasting beverage without all the sugar ... so this is exactly what I was looking for . However , if you are looking for a subtle fruity flavor then this is NOT it as this definitely has a robust fruity flavor . After having purchased and tried quite a few different flavored teas this is my second favorite . The only one I like better than this one is the Celestial Seasonings Wild Berry Zinger which ( to me ) tastes exactly like a berry flavored unsweetened Kool - Aid so reminds me of my favorite childhood beverage . The only thing I like better about this Tropical Fruit tea over the Wild Berry Zinger is that this one is cold brew so the water does n't have to be heated first .
5 #### I drink this now every day . I have no craving for diet coke at all in any way . That 's kind of a miracle .
3 #### Pretty good , although as I ate these almonds after I sprouted them , about 1 out of 9 - 10 almonds were VERRRY BITTER ! !
5 #### Fresh , and NOT pasteurized- that 's hard to find . I ordered when the weather was cooler because shipping in hot weather is detrimental to quality . They 're great .
5 #### This vendor 's nuts are all of high quality and delicious , but I much prefer their organic ones , such as these almonds . If you want to really augment the taste of the almonds , and lower the phytic acid content , it is very easy to roast them . I did it in this manner : I have a small , square , Pyrex glass baking dish that fits perfectly into my toaster oven . I set the toaster oven for 350 degrees and turned to the Bake setting . I then spread a thin layer of nuts in the bottom of the ungreased baking dish . I place it in the toaster oven , and set a timer for 5 minutes . When it goes off , I remove the baking dish with a hot pad , shake the dish to resettle and redistribute the nuts , place the dish back in the toaster oven , and set a timer for another 5 minutes . At the end of this time , the almonds are deliciously toasted .
5 #### These are excellent quality , delicious almonds , but I ultimately decided to purchase the organic version sold by the same vendor . If you want to really augment the taste of the almonds , and lower the phytic acid content , it is very easy to roast them . I did it in this manner : I have a small , square , Pyrex glass baking dish that fits perfectly into my toaster oven . I set the toaster oven for 350 degrees and turned to the Bake setting .

2 #### UPDATE , 8 19 14 : No ! I have tried it iced , hot with sugar , hot with honey , with milk / cream , without milk / cream . I do n't like this tea . I will go back to Bengal spice , I REALLY love that one , no matter how I prepare it . ORIGINAL REVIEW : I picked this up from my local grocery store because it was only $ 13 for the same quantity . I like to drink Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice Tea at work . I use 3 bags , add 2 or 3 teaspoons of cream and 1 teaspoon of sugar for my 22 oz mug . I did the same with this and the taste was far too light , not enough spice . I will try it in my mug without the cream and perhaps in a few days , as part of my iced tea brew then update this post . I suggest the Bengal Spice , prepared as Chai . It satisfies even this coffee drinker .
4 #### My family really likes this . I purchased it for the coconut flavor . I ca n't really distinguish it in the flavor . It 's still a good tea . But if you are looking for that special coconut flavor you might be dissapointed . It is a smooth flavor though . It is hard to find in our area so I bought the case .
5 #### Almonds are always fresh and a great almond milk
3 #### I have been drinking this tea for a week & am not crazy about it . For me it is too generic . For health reasons I try to avoid adding sweetener . I agree with the customer who said it has the earthiness of a green tea . Kind of feels like I am drinking wet grass . I was also hoping for a more chocolate - y flavor . I 'm giving 3 stars because it is not terrible & has been worth a try . I can deal with my current stash . But I wo n't buy this again . Roastaroma is better .
3 #### At first I was n't sold on this tea . It definitely has an " earthy " flavor to it . I know that 's a weird description , but it 's the first word that came to mind . However , after having it in the morning the past week it 's starting to grow on me . It definitely has a richer flavor than most black teas . Usually I like having milk with my tea , but I 've found that I can drink this on it 's own .
5 #### This is like the expensive bottled peach tea but more convenient , less expensive , and you can use your preferred sweetener ( I use stevia ) . Try it , it 's great !
5 #### Try this chai with a blend of coconut - almond milk and whole milk , steamed , plus just a pinch of sweetener , and you have a real treat any time of the day .
5 #### First , when you bring a cup if this hot tea up to your mouth , you will immediately smell the strong scent of coconut-- it is NOT subtle . For an after -supper tea , it is wonderful , and my guests appreciate that it is decaf , and that they can enjoy the other flavors of typical chai spices !
5 #### Yum ! Once you go raw it 's hard to go back . I ca n't eat regular nuts now . I 've been spoiled . The price here is n't bad for raw organic . It flexuates so pay attention but it 's so worth it . I make almond milk with them and it 's delicious and so much better than the junk you can buy premade .
5 #### Available primarily in the fall , I love this tea so much I am grateful to Amazon for having it all year round . It is a lightly sweet tea with a pumpkin undertone that so compliments my freshly baked pumpkin bread .
5 #### If you like Raspberry Tea ............... Celestial Seasonings Ice Cool Brew Iced Tea is sthe BEST one the market . Real Raspberry flavor .
5 #### My wife switched from coffee to this black tea and Mate blend several years ago . Although Celestial has a large number of teas with caffeine , most people know them for their herbal teas . This is especially true of grocery store staff , so it is hard to find this tea locally . Being able to order it in quantity with subscribe and save is a plus .
5 #### Celestial seasoning has the best Chai in my opinon . A bit cheaper at Wallmart now but you ca nt always get it as they are lousy restocking or something . The decaf is good also though not quite as strong I think , almost .
5 #### What can I say ? I love this tea . It packs a bit more of a punch than your standard black tea . The mate gives it a slight earthy flavor , providing some extra depth and body . However , I find this to be mild , not to strong or overwhelming . The tea gives me a nice pick - me - up but it does n't keep me up at night . This tea is delicious with agave and milk , but most of the time I drink it black . It 's a staple for me .
5 #### I had searched high and low for a tropical tea- one that really tastes like many restaurants serve . I bought ALL kinds - peach , ginger peach , hibiscus , blah blah . Nothing . Then I found this online and I drink tons of it now . It is almost like punch ! It is decaf also . Another bonus . The cold brew is okay- but I have found it concentrates better if you use hot water to soak the tea bags .
5 #### I usually have to add some sweetener to my iced tea , but not for this one . So flavorful on its own . I use two bags for a 16 - 20 oz glass of water , or 4 bags per quart for a pitcher . Brews in just a few minutes , but gets a little stronger if you leave it longer . Stir it a bit before drinking to distribute the flavor evenly throughout the water .
5 #### They are good . Sometimes you will get some that taste like almond extract . A very strong and wild flavor . In the past I have typically only liked soaked and/or roasted almonds . These are great straight from the bag .
1 #### I got to finish about a half of the bag when I suddenly chewed into peach pit . I knew what it was by the bitter taste and strong " almond odor " ( of cyanide ) . I know that one peach pit would n't kill me , but I did n't expect it to be in a bag of almonds .
5 #### These are the best and the freshest almonds I have ever had . Tasty !
5 #### A friend of mine told me about this tea , her favorite , while visiting me . After she went back home to another state , she bought some in her town and mailed it to me . I was hooked . After what my friend sent me was gone , I looked for it in every local grocery and health food store I could find , without success . Good ole ' Amazon was right there with it 's usual reliability of finding just about anything you want . Including this Celestial Seasonings tea . Although I had to buy a good quantity , it was of little concern . I drink a lot of tea , and it has been a long colder winter and so I am well stocked with this delicious beverage . Even my roommate , an avid coffee drinker , enjoys cups of Chai Decaf , Sweet Coconut Thai Tea .
5 #### If you like real chai and you like coconut , you will enjoy this tea . Tasty , rich and satisfyingly delicious . I like my tea just a little sweet , so a few drops of ez - sweet or a packet of Truvia does the trick . Plus it 's decaf , so you can enjoy a cup ( or two ) before bed and not worry about staying up all night .
2 #### I 'm a South Asian , I know how real , true chai is made . That being said , this chai is overwhelming with the clove flavor . Authentic spice chai includes cardamon ( lots of it ) and this is lacking in that . There is an extremely subtle coconut flavor but it 's barely there . Overall I hate this stuff . It 's way to heavy on the clove taste and light on everything else .
5 #### I love this tea . A great combination of red and decaf black tea with fabulous spices that are just wonderful . I add a little milk and stevia ; it 's like drinking dessert . Heaven . This tea is hard to find in stores in my area . I saw this on amazon and " grabbed " it ! Thanks amazon !
4 #### Gave to friend and she loved it , pumpkin is her favorite tea so tuned out to be the perfect gift !
5 #### I 'm not a connoisseur of tea by any means , and I usually do n't drink more than one cup a day , but of all the teas I 've tried , this is my favorite .
5 #### This stuff tastes delicious . I wake up to a couple cups of it every day . I 'm no tea snob and my tastebuds are unrefined . I drink it with 2 spoons of sugar and a tiny dash of powdered creamer first thing of the day . It 's really good , just try it .
5 #### IF u luv pumpkin pies w/ a chai flavor , then this tea will be to ur liking ; the aroma exuding fr the tea cup smells so inviting . You 'll want to eat fresh cookies too . I bought box of 20 fr Walmt $ 2.38 today , so way cheaper than here , even if u buy the pack of 3 .
5 #### This is my morning beverage now . I desperately need caffeine in the morning , but found that coffee was leaving me with that acid stomach sick feeling more often than not . This does not . :)
5 #### This has become my favorite tea and I could n't find it in our store anymore . So glad you can get it on line !
5 #### Of course it came fast and packaged great ... no dents and it was a life saver for me because I had run out and was having withdrawals trying other brands and not likeing them at all . I ca n't find this flavor in the stores anywhere around here ! ! ! And its less expensive to order it here than if i did find it in the stores ! Win Win all the way ! !
3 #### It 's easy to make a mistake like I did . If you are looking for Food to Live 's Organic UNPASTEURIZED almonds , these are not them . These are good quality but not unpasteurized and as such no longer are sproutable which legitimately makes a difference in the quality and benefit of your almond milk . If you are going to be using almonds to make almond milk , spend a bit extra and get the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Food - To - Live -- Organic - Almonds - Raw - No - Shell - Unpasteurized-4 - Pounds / dp / B00JRMYZFI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Food To Live Organic Almonds ( Raw , No Shell , Unpasteurized ) ( 4 Pounds)</a>&nbsp;instead . These price of the unpasteurized ones here on Amazon is about half of what I get at Whole Foods . Nevertheless , as far as pasteurized almonds go ( which is what the vast majority are ) , these are a good option and a good price , especially as you get into bigger bulk .
5 #### This is my favorite tea . It has a strong rich flavor and yet not bitter . I drink it hot so ca n't say how it would be iced , but I think it would be about the same as far as richness goes . I think it also has a clean taste to it . I have shared a tea bag with tea drinking friends and everyone has also said they really like it .
5 #### Fall is my favorite season , and this tea reflects what I enjoy -- the orange color plaate , the spicy , sweet smell , the deep flavor . I 'm glad that Amazon.com makes it available . It also makes an inexpensive and thoughtful little gift to share with friends .
5 #### I love the delicate , refreshing taste as ice tea when this is cold brewed . My husband mixes it with black tea and hot brews it before cooling it for ice tea . But , we both agree that this is an excellent flavored tea . We often get compliments when we serve it
3 #### I love this brand but I poured these on a pan and roasted b4 I made almond butter .... there were tiny nut shells in our flourless brownies ... Wirth thing was , they were n't almond shells ... they seems to be walnut shells ... tint pieces ... sorta messed up my recipe .... I'll be sure to sift the rest
5 #### Fresh and have a great flavor . Will order again .
4 #### I purchased these almonds because they are organic and are from Spain so they are really raw , not pasteurized . There are quite a few broken nuts , but over all they are of very good quality and a good size .
5 #### For those looking for alternatives to coffee this is a very good substitute . I recommend this product for it 's warm and satisfying taste .
5 #### I chose this particular flavor because of Halloween and ' pumpkin pie ' is my husband 's favorite thing in the world . I ordered enough so he could have this all the time and I 've taken quite a liking to it as well ! It 's a great waking up tea .
5 #### The only tea I drink . Smooth and tasty . I still drink coffee , but this could be a replacement with little problem .
1 #### I ca n't imagine why but these almonds have a very " off " flavor , not quite like almonds . They almost taste burned although they are raw . I regret paying a premium price for them .
1 #### this is the second time I have purchased these ... I made the mistake of buying them this time . I had forgotten the brand name and bought them on accident . They taste horrible . They taste like they are rubbed in dirt . I know I am buying raw , natural nuts , but these are not as clean as other raw nuts that I buy on a regular basis . If I could easily return them , I would .
2 #### 2nd bag I 've purchased . I normally just throw a handful into my shake but today I popped a few in my mouth and immediately noticed a very rancid taste . Now I 'm concerned about the safety and quality of these almonds that are from Spain . USDA approved ; did they taste them ? Ca n't trust this company now or their products .
5 #### I love this in the summertime . It mixes well and has a great flavor . So good to be able to order it through subscribe and save .
5 #### Purrrrrfect in my view . I love this tea either hot or iced . Since it is decaf , I can drink it right up til bedtime . The coconut flavor is great . I do , however , add honey and lowfat coconut milk to add even more nummy taste . I will be buying this repeatedly !
5 #### One of my favorite teas of all time . I make it with almond milk instead of water and it 's better or just as good as hot coco . Use stevia instead of sugar and you have a perfect low cal healthy after dinner drink / dessert . This really does taste great .
3 #### I keep waiting for that caffein kick , and still waiting . I 'm surprised after reading all the reviews about how bright and energetic this morning breakfast tea will leave you . But alas , this is not so for me . And I 'm particularly sensitive to caffein . So much so that I ca n't drink coffee . The flavor of this tea is quite nice . It 's bold and sturdy . But i was also hoping for the energetic part ...
5 #### Delicious tea ! I am catteine free so am delighted to find this tasty , new product . I will always keep it in stock now .
5 #### This is hard to find locally , and even that happens , the price is not nearly so well - placed as from Amazon . Of course , the convenience of online purchasing versus chasing around to the right store goes without saying . Great taste for chai beverage . Go for it !
5 #### it 's very energetic and flavorful . The flavor is akin to a chocolatey coffee , with the herbalness of tea . It goes awesome with milk . The energy is good energy , none of that jittery crap they put in Monster drinks
5 #### Everyone in Colorado knows how delicious Celestial Seasonings teas are , and their ice tea brews are no different ! This one is a black tea , but with a nice and not - over - powering scent , perfect for a hot summer 's day ! Sip and enjoy !
2 #### I hate to write a bad review , but unfortunately these just are n't great . I am guessing it is because they are shipped all the way from Spain and I understand a third party can not legally sell unpasteurized almonds from a US farm . We just opened the bag and the almonds are very dry and shrunken . I can live with that knowing they are raw and organic , but several have been bad . My husband got a bad one and so did my daughter and now they are both gun shy and wo n't eat any more . I was trying to save a few bucks and did n't get them where I normally do , direct from the farmer ( Bremmer Farms in California ) via mail order . I learned my lesson and wo n't be buying these again .
3 #### Organic , unpasturized or not , 3 stars for poor flavor , for dry texture , for being void of any luscious , subtle , wonderful , fruity and/or bitter happy almond flavor . My guess is that with flavor missing , so are many of the little chemicals , phenols or whatever they are , that make almonds healthy . I received these August 2015 . The nuts are from Spain . California almonds are apparently heading to China !
1 #### Very bad spoiled when received had to send back awful taste . Company okay with return had expiration date June 2016 .
5 #### Quality almonds I had to watch myself not to over do it these are super fresh
5 #### Absolutely delicious . Unfortunately , I 'm not supposed to have caffeine and I did n't notice until after I 'd had a few cups . I gave the remainder of the box to a coworker who was over the moon for it .
2 #### Too many rancid nuts , but the seller will give you an adjustment without any argument on the price if you complain . I would rather get good nuts than a price adjustment .
5 #### Very nice . I like to soak and sprout , then dehydrate at 105o . they swelled up nicely . This is the best way to keep nuts long time without danger of going mouldy . Sprouting also increases the health benefits . with almonds . I skin half of them and leave the skins on half . I like food to live brand for this . Google has a lot of info about sprouting nuts etc .
5 #### We made a lot of delicious almond milk with these and kept some in the fridge for snacking . We soaked them for 12 hours before using them for the milk and snacking and that made them softer and released the phytic acid which made them easier to digest and you could see it in the water that we covered them with because it turned brown and then we rinsed them off after soaking them . Almond milk was easy to make . We just put them in the Nutribullet or you could use a blender and add 4 times as much water and blend then use a nut milk bag or cheese cloth to strain the almond milk out and then you can drink the milk and use the almond meal for flour if you put it in the oven on a baking sheet at a lower temperature .
5 #### Delivered on time and the almonds fresh and delicious . Will buy again in the future .
5 #### We have ordered these almonds several times from this seller , and they have always been fresh and tasty . We keep them in the freezer to make almond milk .
5 #### Morning Thunder has been one of my favorite teas for years . I like the fact that it has nutritional value . Antioxidants ... in my tea is a plus !
5 #### This tea is easy to prepare , ready in just a few minutes . Just pop a tea bag into a glass of water , wait 3 - 5 minutes , depending on preferred strength , then add ice and enjoy ! Nice flavor , no artificial taste . Not sweetened , either . A summertime staple in our house . Really worth a try ! Great for guests because you can make it very quickly , no boiling water or cooling involved .
5 #### I love the taste of this peach tea and I can not keep it in my household . I like the coloring and the flavor , how quickly it brews either weak or strong , that choice is yours . The tea is so easy to make , a child can make their own glass without supervision . I recommend this flavor for a change of pace from your regular sweet tea . I like mine sweetened with agave , sugar works just fine too . Everybody that drinks this in my home likes it and always request more . I would give it more stars if I could , this is how much we like it .
4 #### I was able to snag some of this off an obscure amazon seller so I could try it before it 's completely gone -- for some reason , Celestial Seasonings has discontinued all black tea products ! First , let me say that this is delicious black tea . I have never tasted a better black tea . I will add that the slight flavor of oranges is also very good . However , I believe the product is mislabeled or something , as I could detect no bergamot flavor whatsoever . Bergamot oil is what 's added to regular tea to give it the flavor Earl Grey is noted for . I have worked with pure bergamot oil and have had a number of brands of Earl Gray . Bigelow is the best I 've found for pure bergamot flavor and aroma . As Earl Gray , this tea just does n't measure up . However , because I enjoyed the tea so much anyway , I 've decided to rate it as " excellent " black tea with the subtle but distinct flavor of oranges . I would add this to my grocery list of they still made it .
5 #### I bought one box of this tea a while back , but did n't use it right away . When we ran out of our regular black tea that we used to make Iced Tea , I substituted this in its place . WOW ! Full - bodied flavor and delicious ! It is more earthy , as it has more herbs in it , but that only enhances the flavor ! Now , we only make Iced Tea using this tea ! And this Pack of 6 is a DEAL !
4 #### Good chai tea . You still need to add cardamom seed pods to have it taste as in India , but this has a slight flavor of it which is very pleasant . Can be had with or without milk , with or without sugar .
3 #### They were good but in every handful there was a bad almond that had a foul taste , hey arrived quickly
5 #### I drink this tea everyday , I love the spices , the flavor , it even makes my house smell yummy while its brewing ! But the taste is the reason I buy it , used to drink black tea , but now its this tea everyday , I 'll never go back !
5 #### This too , is a very extraordinary tea ! The fact , that it is decaf makes it even better , because I can drink it no matter how early or late in the day or evening it wo n't make me feel jittery ! You can DEFINITELY taste the sweet coconut in this tea ! I do recommend trying this & you decide !
5 #### I ABSOLUTELY love this tea ! I drink it almost every morning and it is by far one of my favs ! ! ! I would recommend trying it and too , you are able to have any time of theday and or evening due to it being decaffeinated .
5 #### These are great . Mild , caffeine free coconut flavor . Add a bit of creamer and sugar and it tastes just like my favorite Thai lunch spot .
5 #### I use this as a substitute for coffee at least a few times a day . Good flavor as very convenient way to make a hot or cold drink .
5 #### This helps me to relax . I add 2 packets of equal sweetener and sugar free french vanilla coffee creamer and I have a dessert tea . I really love this product and buy it in bulk quantities ! Treat yourself well and enjoy this tea !
5 #### This blend of matte and black tea makes a deep brown rich tea that seems almost like coffee . The taste of Morning Thunder is strong without any bite or bitterness . Tea lovers will enjoy exploring a brew that is richer than most others , while coffee lovers will love a new , easy way to have a caffeine drink . I recommend it as your regular warm drink ; for travel to hotels where in - room coffee is lousy ; and for all travel and camping . I recommend this for people who do not have time in the morning to brew coffee -- just drop a Morning Thunder bag or two into a travel mug full of hot water and you will have a great morning drink in a minute .
5 #### This is a robust chai that stands up alone or with milk and sweetner . Has a nice spicy bite , not too strong but pungent enough to cut through a heavy meal or as an afternoon pick me up , excellent tea .
4 #### If you are , or were previously , a coffee drinker , you would like this tea . It 's a black tea with a distinct smokiness to it - very flavorful ! It almost tastes like a cup of coffee . I can only drink it with a little bit of sugar ( which is n't really surprising!) ... and it absolutely gets me going in the mornings . Ca n't say that it will permanently replace my beloved coffee , but it 's definitely a contender .
5 #### Delicious almonds . Love the quantity . They make tasty almond butter . I ca n't stop eating them . I want to soak them and dehydrate them and fill my mouth with them . Who does n't love almonds ? ? ? ?
5 #### I soak over night in salt water , rinse , and dry out in a low oven . They come out crunchy with a hint of salt .
5 #### These Almonds are indeed organic and they taste great . If you are looking for best quality and taste , this is it !
5 #### I love this tea and use it when I use the decaf green tea to make iced tea as a flavoring and this is a wonderfully flavored tea so spicy and good with the anti - oxident green tea . Instead of drinking something that is not good for your body try these good teas ! And the Chai has the bonus of containing rooibos which is supposed to help us with our weight . If you want it a little sweeter add some stevia . Mary
5 #### We love Morning Thunder . Almost fifteen years ago when I was pregnant and off of coffee for awhile but still wanting some caffeine and antioxidants- I started with Morning Thunder tea . Makes great hot tea and tasty iced tea . Now , that baby is almost 15 and she asks for it for Christmas every year - so we buy it by the carton of 6 packs . The tea is so full of good flavors and the amazing buffalo on the box and classic name probably do lure us in a bit !
5 #### This tea tastes very good to me and I do n't even put sweetener in it . It 's super quick & easy to make , and if I am using a water bottle , I stuff a tea bag inside it , close the lid , shake , and a few minutes later I have " tea to go " .
5 #### I m very happy with the purchases i have made ... they all work for me and my family ... thank you very much !
5 #### Wonderful flavor , crunchy and fresh . No added anything , perfect snack any time any day . Love these .
5 #### these almonds are yummy and great for healthy snacking and making nut cheese . we all need raw food to live a good life and to treat our planet right . this company is on the right track . even the packaging is healthy and wholesome looking . great price for 4 lbs of organic nuts . want to see what else they sell and will be buying more almonds in the near future . thank you food to live .
5 #### Another excellent product . Fresh , crunchy and just enough moisture on the inside to let you know you can chew easily . I love these for a snack . I do n't like all the salt , etc . These are wonderful and well worth the cost .
3 #### I like the smell of this more than the taste but it 's just because I think there 's a little too much spice to it . It 's great once in a while but I ca n't drink this everyday .
5 #### This raspberry cool brew is delicious , caffeine - free and so easy to make . I put a bag into the bottom of a glass , put some ice on top and add filtered water . 5 minutes later it 's fully brewed :) I found that Amazon has a better price on it than I can buy it for in individual boxes at the market . This tea is refreshing , tasty , and if you search for the benefits of drinking raspberry tea , you 'll be pleased :)
2 #### Some of the nuts have a strange burning taste . I may have to throw them out .... very disappointed
1 #### I had the same experience as a previous reviewer . In the past , these almonds were delicious and fresh . This last batch had some that were so bitter I threw the bag away . They were shriveled and definitely not worth the money . I wo n't order again . I have ordered other products from this company and there were good , but something happened here .
5 #### Do not be fooled - Unpasteurized Almonds ( Organic ) is what you want ! and Food to Live is the place to get the best- WONDERFUL!@
5 #### I 'm a huge tea drinker . Every day , a few cups at least . Normally however , all I drink is straight black tea . I find I like the IDEA of flavored teas but they rarely live up to the scent they have . This one however is a great exception to the rule . I 've been drinking it for years but can no longer find it any stores near me so I was thrilled to find it in Amazon . This has become my bedtime cup . I love that it 's decaf yet does n't have that strange decaf flavor ( the same one that coffee drinkers say decaf coffee has ) . It has a wonderful spicy / coconutty ( yes , that is now a word :-P ) scent and the flavor matches the smell . There is no " bite " to this which some Chai blends can have . The spices are there but not all " in your face " . The coconut flavor is mild but definitely present . My favorite way to drink this is with a splash ( ok , a big splash ) of Coffee Mate Coconut Creamer . It brings out the flavor and has the side benefit of bringing the tea down to immediate drinking temp lol . All in all , this is a very soothing , very comforting tea , great to wind down with at the end of the day .
5 #### This tea I brought to our Thanksgiving Feast . Everyone loved this tea . The flavor is womderful and they do not sell this flavor here . Only here . I would buy again and have :)
5 #### I 'm really fond of this chai . I like a lot of chais , but this one is unique with the blend of red and decaf black tea , sweetened with coconut . It forgives a long steep or a wide range of temperatures ( though hotter temps bring out better flavor ) , and I find the blend of flavors quite nice , particularly for such an inexpensive brand of tea . As with most chais , this tea is not at all bitter .
4 #### This tea is designed to cold - brew . Do not question the packaging ! If you brew in cold water , you 'll get a refreshingly light fruity blend that 's lovely on a hot summer day . If you hot brew it , you 'll instead be met with a chemically - bitter , awful concoction that would be lovely mainly compared with dehydration . This is a lot of tea bags , so you need to be serious about your iced tea to make the purchase . If you are , I say go for it ! I look forward to someday trying the other flavors -- only five more boxes to go ...
5 #### I brew a lot of herbal ( no caffeine ) , fruit - flavored sun tea in the summer , as a family we drink 1 gal / day ( Note : we do n't drink black iced tea , so our taste buds are n't expecting that flavor ) . I usually use various flavored herbal tea bags , sometimes throwing in a few of these too , always sweetening with healthy , no - sugar stevia added to the whole pitcher . When we were caught without our daily gallon , I decided to make this " straight , " since it brews quickly . Turns out my husband and son love this by itself ! Told me it tastes ( good ) like some " bad for you " fruit juice flavored drink . As I pay $ 6 / box at grocery store & it seems I will need to purchase much more , found it here on Amazon for much less , of course :-)
1 #### I have been using Bigelow Thai Chi and once tied Twinnings , both were good , thought I was buying the Twinning , but not so . It was just not to my liking . Not a big tea drinker . Use the Thai Chi tea with powered sugarfree vanilla coffee creamer . For me , it is hot and has a nice flavor . I am not , a tea lover . This brand did not work for me .
4 #### Got the almonds in a timely manner . They taste very yummy ! ! I previously ordered Brazil nuts from this company . From my 2 purchases I am very happy with their products and will continue to order from them . I did give them only 4 stars this time since there was a little tear in the bag , but did't seem to have lost any product . And apparently no unwanted bugs entered since I 'm doing great after eating some . By the way these are about the price of the ones that are sold at the co - op where I usually do my shopping .
5 #### Excellent product , packaging and shipping . This along with other products from " Food to Live " have become standard re - order items in my household .
1 #### Almonds are almost certainly not organic or unpasteurized , and they have a stale texture & taste . Raw almonds , both organic & not organic from other vendors , are far superior in taste & freshness . Will not purchase any products from Food To Live again & I 'm perplexed how they have so many glowing reviews .
2 #### I 'm afraid I have to agree with some other reviewers about the downsides of this product . We eat a lot of almonds and it turns out it 's hard to beat our California almonds . These are grown in Spain so are probably a different variant of almond than were used to . They are small and we did n't like the taste as much or the dusty / powdery / dirtiness and washed them before using . There is a lot more of the skin that you have to contend with and once I bit into one that was like a stone it was so hard . We have decided to throw the rest out and not buy again .
5 #### I have been on a strict no sugar or processed foods detox program , I needed raw almonds , & these almonds were a big help during a very hard detox ! Some raw nuts i tried tasted rubbery , that 's from moisture in them from not being roasted . These almonds were crunchy & somewhat chewy , they taste like almonds ... i would buy them again ! ! They were much needed to help me complete the detox & these almonds were exactly what I needed ! 5 Stars ! Thx ! GOD bless !
4 #### Bought thinking it was organic , and did n't realize it was n't until I opened and ate some . They are good , but I will be buying the organic next time . It is n't the sellers fault , I was clicking a bunch to compare price - per - pound on organic almonds and clicked these on accident . Food To Live has excellent organic nuts and seeds
1 #### No real flavor , used up two 4 bags and still no real taste . If you want my future business remove this product from my list . I like the cold brew Lipton tea and will continue to buy it . Glass size only .
4 #### I 've been trying to find a good chai tea after my favorite online supplier ran out . I was looking for some more available and cheaper . I bought chai tea from Twinnibgs and Stash from my grocery store and they were terrible ! Undrinkable . On my next shopping trip i found Celestial Seasonings Indisn Spice Chai . I almost did n't buy it after the last two store bought brands . But i decided to give it a try . I 'm glad I did . Its really good , especially for the price . And i lice that i found it at my lixal store . Although i like it enough to purchase in bulk from amazon if the price is right . Give this one a try . You wo n't regret it !
5 #### I 've been eating these for a long time ... RAW ORGANIC SHELLED ... its a health thing . Its an " I try my hardest to NEVER eat sugar and now I can taste the subtle sweetness is so many things Thing . The fiber in almonds , when eaten on a regular basis , is better performing than psyllium seed .. which has no taste but " ick . " Its my candy now too and I am very happy to have made their acquaintance . Highly recommend .
4 #### Some of the almonds were n't good . About 5 % the rear tasted great
5 #### Food to Live nuts are always my choice . I purchase walnuts and almonds regularly . Sometimes I look at other brands available , but I always come back to this product . The nuts are very fresh , no shells ever and no tiny broken pieces .
5 #### I am a fan of many different teas , with my taste spanning from herbal , black , white , green , and roobios . I appreciate the kick of some caffeine , but when evening arrives , that " kick " will keep me up all night . Enter this wonderful Thai coconut chai , and I have a wonderful evening beverage . Add a smidge of milk and sugar and it is honestly perfection . The flavors are well - balanced , and perfectly - suited to any time of the day . My kids ( age 7 and 9 ) are hooked as well . It 's their favorite tea , hands down .
5 #### I can not keep enough of this in my home , this is a definite must in my household , my son and grand monster keep me making this 24/7 , 365 , this is how much we all like this tea . It is quick and very easy to make and it does brew within five minutes . This tea is very full bodied and flavorful . I sweeten this with the light amber agave to keep the taste light and fresh . I feel this is a much better alternative to other fresh brewed ice teas and sodas , which my household does not drink . If you do decide to purchase this tea , take advantage of the adding this to your account as a monthly shipment , you will save money and have this on hand always . Bearing in mind , we all have different taste buds , I really feel you will not be disappointed , I am not , never have been , I keep coming back for more .
1 #### This tea used to be delicious but the company recently changed the recipe claiming a " new bolder flavor . " Unfortunately it now tastes nothing like peach tea and do n't expect to be able to return it . They wo n't allow it .
5 #### " We live in a wonderful world that is full of beauty , charm and adventure . There is no end to the adventures that we can have if only we seek them with our eyes open . " ~ Jawaharlal Nehru I 'm sorry to have to say this but Celestial Seasonings Chai tea is better than Tazo 's . Normally I get a chai tea at Starbucks but lately I 've been making a lot of tea at home . Now that the weather is cooler I 'm trying out lots of teas . This chai tea is in little pillow bags so there is not waste . Since there are no strings , tags , staples or wrappers the company claims that they save more than 3.5 million pounds of waste from being put into landfills . This is really something . Anyway , this tea is made with black tea , cinnamon , ginger , cloves , cardamom , nutmeg , black pepper and star anise . It also contains some chicory and vanilla . Now I have to say I 've been enjoying this tea but did n't realize its full potential until I drank it while eating a piece of banana bread . The flavors were perfect together . I 'd recommend you really stock up on this tea because it is so delicous . ~The Rebecca Review
3 #### The packaging had a small hole in the bag so some of the nuts were in the box that it was shipped in . They are smaller than regular almonds but much more filling !
2 #### all these organic have no taste . I thought I would try ; my bad . Live and learn .
5 #### We enjoy almonds as a healthy snack and as part of many recipes and smoothies . Recently I was reading that " raw " almonds in the US are most likely pasteurized and treated with some kind of chemical gas .. mmmmm .. not . We decided to get a bag of these almonds to give a taste of . Delicious , a wider , fatter almond than ones we were purchasing from a local store . They have a lovely , delicate almond flavor . Will be buying again .
5 #### The Almonds were fresh and the packaging was just right . Great snacks , I will order again .
5 #### This is a good buy for sure . You want to make sure to let it sit so you will get as much flavor as this would give as the taste could be on the light side . It is probably because this one is decaf . I love this product .
5 #### This is my favorite cold brew tea I 've tried . The flavor is rich ( unlike some that can be very weak ) and it has a nice peachy / hibiscus taste to it . Its healthy & convenient to take anywhere , you can make it ahead or on the spot anywhere there is ice & water !
3 #### The first order I received was pretty good . The second order had quite a few half or broken almonds and quite a few bitter almonds .
4 #### I m using these for homemade almond milk . I m not sure how I feel about the taste . Its okay . I ve never had homemade almond milk before though . The sad thing is these can not be eaten raw . The taste just is n't what I would expect for an almond . Its raw and unpasteurized so I guess its what I ordered . I 'll just use them for almond milk and add maple syrup so it is a little more palatable . I want to give them 3 stars but I think its unfair because like I said , I m unfamiliar with the taste and some people may think its normal .
5 #### Almonds are bigger in size and very well packed n arrived in time
5 #### Excellent flavor and great for sprouting . Since they have n't been steamed , they form real sprout ' tails ' . They make great sprouted almond butter - a real treat if you have n't ever tried it .
5 #### I just got it in the mail and immediately put eight bags in two quarts of filtered cold water . Left it in the fridge for about 3 hours and then sweetened with Stevia and it is delicious . I could have taken it out at about 30 minutes but I wanted it strong . We will be buying the other flavors ! ! ! So raspberry and delicious . I know we are going to go thru two pitchers a day ! ! Bring back the lemon flavor ! ! !
5 #### This is the best pre - packaged Chai I 've ever found . Sure , you can get some really amazing blends in loose leaf , but they are expensive . The clove in this blend really blends well with the pepper and nutmeg . The flavor is bold but smooth . It 's also very high in caffeine and makes a great tea to sip on in the morning . If you really want to treat yourself , add some sweetened condensed milk to it . It 's so good , it 's a dessert all on its own . As a regular hot tea drinker , the economics involved in drinking prepackaged teas are an important consideration for me . As a result , I try to get 2 servings out of each tea bag whenever possible . For this variety , I can get 2 decent sized servings out of each bag though the second serving is a little diluted . It is still a good cup of tea . Celestial Seasonings tea bags do not come equipped with a string due to environmental considerations and to ensure that nothing compromises the flavor of the tea ( like a metal staple on a tag ) . This is a flavor worth putting on my " Subscribe & Save " list . My retail price in local stores for one box of this tea is $ 3.59 .
1 #### This made us sick . Perhaps we got a bad batch . We wo n't purchase this again and would not recommend it . Would like to add that Amazon Customer service was awesome in our correspondence with this product !
5 #### Let me start by saying I like unsweetened iced tea , and I have tried many methods and I really like cold brew because its the quick and the least trouble to make . I was staying with my boyfriend at the time and I was complaining that I wanted iced tea so he suggested we pick a box of tea at the grocery store , there were two brands of cold brew to choose from and the Celestial Seasonings was flavored so he suggested we try the peach , it was really delicious I liked the hint of peach instead of putting a lemon wedge in it , very easy to make , and my only dissapointment was that I ca n't find it anyplace closer to me , as it is over an hour drive to the grocery store we found it at .
5 #### I guess I 've never tasted real almonds before ! These are so delicious and fresh and the flavor is strong ! I just threw out my almonds from Costco .
5 #### Celestial Seasonings Chai Decaf Tea , Sweet Coconut is my favorite decaf tea . I drink it all day . Until I found this tea , I thought I would never find a decaf Chai that was full of flavor . If you love Chai , this is a winner !
5 #### This is such a tasty tea blend ! The flavors combine so nicely ; black is actually a very nice complement for the strong mate , as it enhances , but does n't overpower the flavor . Very tasty !
5 #### My favorite tea , and my only tea . Two tea bags easily makes a full quart . To this I add a heaping teaspoon of xylitol , which is a healthy and alkalizing sweetener . I especially like that this tea is caffeine free and features rooibos tea . Rooibos tea is as healthy as green tea , I 've read , and it 's far more palatable when combined with these delicious spices . I see one reader did n't like the coconut flavoring . Fair enough , but I recommend you try buying one box locally and deciding for yourself . I like everything about the flavor , as do many others who rated the tea . And the prices offered here ca n't be beat .
5 #### After trying several brands of chai , including Bigelow , Stash , and even some expensive Tazo , I have settled on this Celestial Seasonings blend . Most chais I find to be either too bitter or bland . This one is neither . The cinnamon and vanilla add just the right note of sweetness . If you have never been a fan of chai , try Celestial Seasonings India Spice , and you might just change your mind ! I ca n't get enough and I hope they never stop making it !
5 #### It brews quickly and the flavor is nice , unlike their tropical blend , which , IMO , tastes like some funky berry that 's probably going bad . As a tea - aholic , I greatly appreciate Cool Brew tea . I 'm not always home and often in places where making tea the old fashioned way or even microwaving would be , at the very least , complicated . But with this , I can easily have tea on the go . Good product . Good price
5 #### I have been drinking this pretty much every evening for the past year . I had a hard time finding this flavor in my local stores , and I was delighted to find it at Amazon . Yes , it might be a bit more expensive this way , but it 's worth it to me to have 6 shiny boxes lined up on my shelves , all ready for me to brew a cup . In a way it reminds me of an old flavor from Celestial Seasonings -- Pelican Punch . I agree with the person who loves chai spice flavor but sometimes finds that to be a bit too dark . This decaf coconut thai is excellent ! And in the daytime I love PG Tips , another black caffeinated tea that is available through Amazon .
5 #### This was on closeout for $ 1.99 for a 20 - bag box , and I thought I 'd give it a try . I brewed a mug , took it to work , and promptly forgot to drink it , but the next night , I opened my&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Thermos - E10500 - 16 - Ounce - Leak - Proof - Travel - Mug / dp / B000FOMP6I / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Thermos E10500 16 - Ounce Leak - Proof Travel Mug</a > , and there this was , so I poured it over ice . I may never drink it hot .... it 's that good . Normally I 'm not a big clove fan , but it 's got just a hint , and seems to have quite a bit of caffeine , since I felt a jolt akin to&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Morning - Thunder - Tea-20 - Bags / dp / B002677ISW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Morning Thunder Tea 20 Bags</a > . Yummy !
5 #### I 've had to cut back on caffeine , and diet soda in general , so I was on a mission to find an alternative . This tropical fruit tea fit all my needs .... good taste , sugar free , and caffeine free . I use an extra bag or two , and brew it a little longer , and it tastes just like fruit punch . The cold brew feature makes it so easy and convenient . I highly recommend it to adults as well as kids .
5 #### Love the taste and distinct flavor of Chai , decaf tea . Great price too , from Amazon .
5 #### but here it is . With Prime shipping and Subscribe and Save , we simply can not get a better price . We make our tea with a coffee maker and then make iced tea from that . The decaf chai provides a kick of flavor with our regular decaf bags .
5 #### This is my favorite chai flavor of all the different brands I 've tried . It does n't really taste like coconut , but .... it 's good nonetheless .
5 #### I found that coffee makes me jittery and it also upsets my stomach a bit , so I needed a strong replacement . Morning Thunder definitely fits the bill for me . There 's enough caffeine in it to really wake me up and since it 's a tea , you do n't really get nasty coffee mouth after you drink it . For me , there are n't any side effects other than being more awake . The flavor is very herby and grassy . It reminds me a little of the Asian grass jelly drink . It 's not something that I would order at a restaurant , but the flavor is passable for me so I do n't mind drinking it . The leaves come in fancy pouches that do n't have a string attached . I 've found that I can either let it sit for a while to get stronger or I can stir it to speed up the process . I do n't know if tea aficionados would object to stirring it , but I suspect that tea aficionados would be buying loose leaf tea anyways . Overall , I find it to be a great replacement for coffee or any other caffeinated drink . It definitely wakes me up and I do n't get any of the side effects of drinking coffee like bad breath , the jitters or an upset stomach .
5 #### The best , hands down . I soak in distilled water between 24 - 50 hrs until they sprout ; they produce the best milk , be sure to add Madagascar Bourbon Planifolia Grade A Gourmet Vanilla Beans and 2 drops of stevia;be careful you may require an intervention !
5 #### I bought this at a local store and was glad I did . It brews in five minutes and tastes great . I sweeten it with stevia powder . I love it .
5 #### I 'm trying to reduce the amount of sugar & carbonated drinks my family consumes .... Celestial Seasonings peach tea is tasty and refreshing - no sweetener needed ! Historically , I 'd pay $ 3 - 4 for a 20 - count box at my local market , with Amazon 's " subscription " it comes to a buck and change - saving over 50 %
5 #### If you 're out there looking for a tea that can rival coffee than this is for you . I like my black tea strong and hearty and this is my favorite . Just a wee bit stronger than Irish Breakfast IMO and with a great flavor . I am a bit picky when it comes to teas and coffees but had to give this one an A+++ for every catagory . You wo n't be disappointed . Also , you can actually find this on most grocery store shelves compared to some other brands and the price is compariable to others .
5 #### I used to make my own chai tea from a recipe I got off the internet , then I discovered I could get a good chai from Celestial Seasonings , and started doing that instead . I ordered this item because my favorite Celestial Seasonings chai had been discontinued . I am very pleased with this tea as a replacement flavor . It 's so rich in spices like cinnamon , cardamom , ginger , nutmeg that it almost feels like my tongue is tingling when I drink it ! It also has a touch of vanilla , which I love . I happily look forward to my two cups , morning and afternoon , each day . I ordered a 6 - box case at a much better price than I can get at a local supermarket . Thank you , Amazon !
5 #### A co - worker introduced me to this wonderful tea and I am hooked . Let me see if I can describe it . I like Chai Tea , but sometimes the " smokiness " of the chai can be overwhelming to me . This tea combines the lovely sweetness of coconut with the dark rich quality of the chai . The aroma is a treat as well . Everyone I have made this for LOVES this tea . When I brew this tea , I am able to use one tea bag for 2 - 3 cups of hot water and it still is flavorable . I drink it with a small amount of cream and one artificial sweetner , but many of my friends like it without any sweetner at all . I highly recommend this tea .
4 #### I bought this for the convenience of not having to boil water and heat up our camper in the summer . I love the ease and convenience of this tea , but wish the flavor were better . Not only is the tea very weak ( I need to use three bags to obtain the flavor of one traditional tea bag ) , it has a slightly " off " taste as well . That said , this is the best tasting of the current selection of CS cool brew teas . It is also a good product in that you can toss a bag into your water bottle before you leave home and have tea for the road with no fuss . We definitely prefer brewed teas to these cool brew versions .
3 #### I bought this for the convenience of not having to boil water and heat up our camper in the summer . I love the ease and convenience of this tea , but wish the flavor were better .

It is also a good product in that you can toss a bag into your water bottle before you leave home and have tea for the road with no fuss . It is n't undrinkable , and we 're finishing off our boxes slowly but surely ; but my entire family would much rather drink traditionally brewed Stash Peach tea .
5 #### Great product . One of my favorite teas . I buy it by the 12 boxes at a time for a year or two supply .
5 #### My wife loves to relax in the evening with a great cup of chai . This product is her favorite and since it contains no calories she can add as much honey as she wants !
5 #### Have a stronger almond taste than store bought almonds and great price
5 #### Absolutely delicious . Full almond flavour and I will order again .
5 #### I am addicted to this stuff it 's practically the only thing I drink these days . I admit at first I found the flavor a little unusual , but I 've come to love it and the flavoring is all quite natural which is nice . Just various fruits and whatnot . The big thing for me was the no caffeine though . I love iced tea but brewing pitchers of iced tea every day and then waiting for them to cool was a hassle so it was great when cool brew tea first came out back in the day , however , drinking a full pitcher every day ( which I often do ) could be an issue with all the caffeine , so finding this decaf flavor was perfect .
5 #### Not only is the taste great , you can make great - tasting iced tea in less than 5 minutes ! Highly recommend !
5 #### Good for salads and snacks . The price is a little better than what I pay locally for organic almonds so why not order them and save some money .
5 #### Taste great . Ordered cashews too . Good company and great pricing .
4 #### Reasonably priced , fast shipping , and VERY fresh -- very few nuts to throw away after soaking ( which is n't always the case with raw nut purchases , particularly cashews ) . In my experience , Food to Live has been a consistently great supplier of raw , organic nuts .
5 #### This tea is delicious ... a perfect blend of spiciness ... I'm beginning to break my coffee habit with this tea ! Celestial Seasoningss is a great company , kudos to them as mentioned earlier for responsibly packaging their product with recycled paper , and using less resources by no individual wrappers . Also , do n't throw the teabag out after making a cup --- I use a tall coffee cup , and it makes4 or 5 of those cups for me ... first cup , heat water and steep teabag partway with a few dips , second cup , heat water and steep teabag a bit more , 3rd time heat water and let teabag steep for a minute or so , 4th and 5th times , I put teabag in water before heating in microwave , and when taken out , stir around for awhile ... and still end up with dark , spicy tea ! I keep using the teabag this way unti it 's not so dark , and time to get another ! It 's a good thing the teabags make lots of tea per bag , you probably wo n't stop at one cup ! As good as it is , I 'm probably going to make it iced for those hot summer days -- I can tell that will be good too ...
5 #### I got turned on to Celestial Seasonings teas when I visited the factory in Boulder . I bought a box of this Chai tea and was immediately hooked ! I have bought other Chai ta bags only to throw them away because they were disgusting . This one has just the right mix of seasonings and a hint of vanilla . Like another reviewer said , milk is a must for Chai tea . ( I know -- I had never put milk in my tea in my life and it sounded gross ! ) Vanilla soy milk is great and enhances the hint of vanilla in the tea . I also sweeten mine ( honey is recommended but I use sweetner ) . This tea frequently replaces my morning coffee , and the decaf version is just as good if you want it at bedtime . I like it so well that I have ordered it by the case from Celestial Seasonings when I could n't find it in the store ! Kudos to Amazon for carrying it ! !
4 #### Morning Thunder Tea is the kind of tea with a kick . I do not know about anyone else but to me strong tea makes me feel pretty darn good , almost like I am getting away with something ( funny , since its perfectly legal .. ) and perks me up on my branch and all of a sudden I want to do things and stop dozing off . I want to create , to ponder on issues otherwise reserved for the acute minded , I want to get so high from that tea that I might start laughing for no valid reason , make a fool of myself . Can anyone tell I am on it right now ? I am as happy as a clam . Once I drink it early in the morning and I am a little moody for thinking I did not sleep well and I am Bitchy and un - accessible to the world the Morning Thunder takes care of setting my course straight . I am sure there are many strong teas and by God , I would like to meet them all , but Morning Thunder is under my roof so it gets 4 Stars for being there , help to accentuate the self for the productive side of things . Long Live America !
5 #### This is good tea . I steep mine longer than 5 minutes though more like 10 as like a stronger peach flavor and I use twice as many tea bags as it says for a cup . It taste really good with sugar in it .
5 #### This is my all time favorite decaf chai . The coconut undertone is subtle , but definitely present . This is a very smooth chai , with a full , but not strong taste , which I prefer at bedtime . As with all CS chais , I wish they would use a bit more cardamom .
4 #### This is one of the best decaf chai 's that I 've tried . I would have hoped for a bit more cardamom , but other than that it is an excellent bedtime drink !
2 #### This tea tastes more like spiced tea rather than coconut . Try CS vanilla maple if you crave an excellent tea .
4 #### is very similar to raspberry teas found at your favorite eateries . We found it necessary to drink with our sweetener . A refreshing drink , but has a slight after taste to it , maybe making this tea in large quantity is what did it ( 4 qts ) . I would have rated a 5 , but taste was a little off .
3 #### It 's flavor is okay , I was hoping for more of a spicy cardamon and clove flavor .
5 #### This is the best chai tea out there and decaff to boot ! I only purchase this tea for my hot tea , great way to start my day here in Alaska
5 #### Great to have a food that is not irradiated or pasteurized .
5 #### I love these ! They have an incredible marzipan perfume - like wispiness of an aroma that tickles my nose when I eat them or make lovely butter ... makes my eyes close , my face relaxes , and I smile ... enjoy happily .
5 #### There is no comparison in flavor and freshness . These quite simply are the best almonds I have ever had . I use a cup of them a day for almond milk , sometimes 2 . But I can not measure them out without taking a handful to munch on ! These are Organic unprocessed ! You ca nt get cleaner or fresher then that ! !
3 #### I am giving this 3 stars because I failed at getting any of these almonds to sprout . As is they are like any other almond , and I do n't see the use in spending the extra money to get truly raw almonds if they do n't sprout .
5 #### These nuts are excellent ! I ordered almonds recently from Sincerely Nuts , and they were awful ! I am so happy to have found a good nut vendor . These almonds were fresh and delicious .
5 #### Almonds are great after sprouting and dehydrating . Ca n't comment on the taste right out of the bag .
5 #### Well packaged , fresh and delicious ! I soaked and dried them , then roasted and salted . We enjoy them plain , with a slice of cheese , or with dark chocolate bits .
5 #### These almonds are so fresh . My husband and I both love them .
5 #### These are the best almonds I have ever tasted . I purchased them to make my own almond milk with ( such a difference in taste from what you buy in the store ) , and ended up eating 1/4 of the bag by itself . I am very happy with the purchase , and I will definitely be ordering again .
5 #### Products arrived promptly , seemed fresh and tasty , are as advertised , and I paid a reasonable price . What 's not to like ?
5 #### Very fresh and delicious . They make wonderful almond milk and are good to eat right out of the bag . I will be ordering more as soon as I need more .
5 #### Great quality and taste . These are really whole organic almonds . Will order again .
5 #### Great Almonds .... best price I could find ... would buy again
5 #### No complaints . The almonds tasted fresh and sweet . As expected with spanish almonds , there were a few bitter ones , but very few . I 've re - ordered these almonds at least 6 times over the past year and found the quality to be consistently excellent .
5 #### I had recently just learned that almonds grown in the United States are not actually raw . In fact there is no regulations protecting the labeling of raw ... ridiculous , I know ! As of a few years ago , farmers who grow almonds are required by law to treat almond with either steam , irradiation or chemically pasteurization . This applies to Organically grown almonds as well . I do n't know about you , but if I am going to spend this kind of money on nuts , they sure as heck better not be covered in propylene oxide ! I 'm glad to have found these almonds here on Amazon for the same price per pound I was paying at Whole Foods when I buy 4lbs at a time . However , it 's really unfortunate that we must resort to buying these from overseas . Luckily these almonds are by far the best almonds I have ever had . They are much larger , a bit softer and mellower taste than what I was buying before . I know I truly have never had a raw almond until now !
5 #### Love this products ! ! ! Ordered this product again and as long as this company provides quality such as this as I can afford , I will return ! ! ! !
1 #### These are the real deal , not pasteurized . The american almond has a hard crunch to them . These have a slight mealy taste initially but are moister in the middle . They have a sweet taste to them to , never had that in an american almond . If you want to avoid propylene oxide , definitely check these out . edit : I originally gave this 4 stars but I keep getting almonds that I believe are rancid . I 'm not sure what rancid tastes like but it tastes like the almond is soaked in nutrasweet and then it changes to something very bitter and disgusting like vanilla extract , except these almonds taste much worse . I had a few almonds that were off but I am now coming across almonds that fit my description of completely inedible . These almonds are expensive , I would have expected a better quality especially when the label says they are good for another year . I do n't know if I will buy these again .
5 #### Entirely different look than almonds you see in stores and nut medleys that are not organic . Honestly , I notice a discernible difference in taste as well . Thoroughly pleased , will purchase again ; highly recommend these if you 're looking to make something with almonds , or just have a healthy snack to eat throughout the day instead of turning to candy and sugary alternatives .
5 #### I gave them to a friend who said they were absolutely fantastic .
5 #### Our favorite nut and so fresh ! We dry roast them and also make almond milk ! They are a staple in our home !
5 #### Love these .... I cook and eat right out of the bag
5 #### Taste great , makes awesome almond milk , and is a perfect snack . Not stale at all .
5 #### These almonds are awesome ! We use them to make almond milk and for snacking . I ordered in September and just now am getting around to opening them in March . They are fresh , raw , unpasteurized ( from Spain - nuts have to be imported to be unpasteurized in the US ) , and organic . I 've repurchased direct from Food to Live because the price went up $ 6.50 on Amazon and FTL does n't charge shipping either .
5 #### After reading some of the reviews , I was a little concerned about the quality of the product I would receive . However I was very pleasantly surprised to receive an excellent product . The almonds look and taste great and are from California . They arrived in a plain plastic beg instead of the one pictured but who cares . I put some in the fridge and the rest in the freezer so they 'll last me a good long time . Thank you . :)
5 #### Great organic almonds without the petro - pasteurization . This is a very special find .
2 #### To many Almonds were busted in the bag for my taste . Needs better quality control at this price ! ! !
4 #### I already bought these almonds twice and like them . If you like sweet , larger almonds , and no few bitter ones - do not buy these almonds ! These are small almonds that pack a lot of the the great aroma of the original Mediterranean almonds ( prior to the development of hybrids that are larger and sweeter and dominant most of the almonds grow in California ) . So if almond aroma is important to you and you do n't panic when you chew on very very few bitter ones choose these almonds .
5 #### These are excellent almonds . I have ordered a few 4 lb . bags and every time they are fresh and no bad nuts . I highly recommend this quality product and it 's great they are raw and organic .
2 #### I wrote a previous review on this product , and I was pretty well satisfied with these almonds and the supplier . However , this particular batch was awful . In fact it was so bad , it was the exact opposite of my previous review in which the almonds from this supplier were fresh and tasty . So I re - ordered from the same supplier . This batch of almonds were old with little or no taste . Some were so old , they looked like they had decayed and had a bad taste . I am no almond expert , but I do know if the product tastes fresh or not , and this particular batch was anything but fresh . It was like these almonds had been sitting around for years before being shipped , so I wo n't be ordering from this supplier any time soon . The quality control is lacking . In fairness , every once in a while , I would luck out and find a single and somewhat acceptable almond , but then the rest of the handful would turn on me ! ! I wish the supplier would have more quality control .
5 #### Just what I was looking for , you just ca n't beat this price for truly raw unpasteurized almonds ! YUM !
5 #### As a professional Chef , I believe we ought to start with the highest quality ingredients possible when preparing the foods we eat . Price is not really a factor when I shop . These almonds from Spain have a wonderful taste , are organic , and have not been pasteurized . Five stars .
5 #### These are the best tasting raw almonds . I searched for unpasturized and found these . Glad I did .
5 #### Nice sized almonds that are shelled . The color is light . They also arrived on time . I put them into my Magic Bullet NutriBullet RX N-17 - 1001 Blender and they chop up nicely ; no grit at all ! They taste delicious and I am definitely going to order them again from this company !
3 #### The almonds from Food to Live are my least favorite nut for some reason . All their other nuts are amazing but these are n't great . I will buy my almonds elsewhere from now on but will continue to get the others from them .
5 #### Good food , healthy and tasty , and at a good price .
5 #### You could taste the difference with these almonds , everything about them were perfect !
4 #### Hoped they would sprout as they are non radiated . Nope . No such luch
5 #### Had a good experience with these almonds . I use it to make almond milk .
5 #### When you need a lot of fresh , raw organic almonds stat -- great pricing and packaging !
5 #### If you enjoy almonds , you 'll love these ! The best I 've ever tasted . Food to Live has wonderful , tasty nuts . I 've order these twice and my third order is on its way . Yum ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### These almonds taste pretty good , especially when you consider they are pre - packaged and delivered via UPS or other means of delivery , and thus are in storage in bags and warehouses for a period of time . I do n't particularly accept all the claimed benefits of " organic , " though I would like to believe all those claims . Many of those claims are bogus , and the assertions are mostly voluntary . It 's just tough for the average consumer to wade through all the various " facts " and contradictions . I do n't buy any that add salt ! I like them raw , and I eat them as an energy snack at work , raw and healthy ! !
5 #### These almonds were totally nutty . I used them to make almond milk , and almond flour from the remaining pulp . Then glueten free brownies from the almond flour . Yum .
3 #### I waited until I had finished these to right a review . I had too many rancid nuts to make this a product I would order again ... Back to Braga I have gone , where the quality is worth the extra cost .
1 #### Actually , I do n't know , it arrived broken and I never got to try it . Very disappointed
4 #### It 's Dave 's what more needs to be said if you have n't ever had Dave 's brand then I suggest you start with one of the more Milder you know Dave 's Insanity Sauce and work your way up to this Dave has been in the business a long time and you can count on their quality flavor and heat of their product to be right at the very top
5 #### Excellent tasting almonds ! Fast delivery and I like the resealable container .
5 #### Received these today . This is the second large order we 've made and we were very happy with the other 8 - pounder also .
5 #### Better than I expected . So good right out of the bag ! Love eating them with dark chocolate 72 - 85 % cacao .
5 #### This puts the insanity in Hot sauce ! I 've had a lot of different hot sauces in my life and this is , by far , the hottest ! I ended up not being able to use it as a typical hot sauce ( pouring it on something ) I had to use a few drops of it when making things like Chili , Marinara sauce and Beef jerky . Amazing stuff !
5 #### Good quality almonds ! ! Almonds are high in vitamin E , so I appreciated having a big bag to munch on every so often , and that they are raw .
5 #### The almonds are excellent ! They arrived promptly and in great condition . The flavor is noticeably better than what you can get in stores and I would definitely purchase again , especially since they are organic and raw .
1 #### I live on a plant based diet . I have soaked this brand almonds in distilled water for over 8 hr . I blend almond milk . the outer skin is still intact . There is absolutely no activity . These almonds are dead! .. , . I switched on this occasion from California almonds LLC . there almonds shed otter skin within 5 hr they are alive . It was not broke then why? ..... you live and learn . I will not drink dead milk .
5 #### Unpasteurized ( unprocessed at high nutrient killing heat ) , raw almonds are noticeably delicious . Vitamin B17 as its nicknamed in raw almonds was used to treat cancer and the FDA then made selling raw almonds illegal in California ( largest world producer of almonds ) , except for a few loop holes , so now almonds are usually imported from Spain or Italy .
1 #### Nearly 80 agents are currently authorized to certify farms and businesses to the USDA organic regulations . Most USDA - accredited certifying agents are allowed to certify farms and businesses anywhere in the world . Farmers , ranchers , and processors may choose to work with any USDA - accredited certifying agent . You can get the list on USDA Website and contact such entity to confirm if they have inspected and issued USDA certificate for such food producer or not ... Now look at this brand closely , do you see any certification stamp by an authorized USDA Organic agent ... Not only this brand does not sell any certified USDA Organic , there are hardly any producers who would even sell any unpasteurized almonds less alone unpasteurized USDA Organic almonds . 90 % of almonds in the world is produced by California . Any almond sold in the US is pasteurized so the only way to have any unpasteurized almonds are to get it from a producer outside of the US . Do you see any producer or origin of the country on this packaging ...
5 #### fixes any so - so recipe , instantly . Use sparingly , ghost pepper is no joke .
5 #### Delighted to have superb quality organic almonds delivered to my door . Could not be happier . Will order regularly .
5 #### Pretty hot . I put a couple drops on the hash browns and got after it . Oh my , the heat is a force to be reckon with . Taste is good . If you are a hot sauce pack rat , I would for sure add this one to your list .
5 #### Hot and tasty , purchased additional bottles to give to friends and they love it and now order their own !
5 #### Best eaten alone if u are brave ... But excellent as a condiment for massive hot overtones.the .best out there .any hotter than thiis David 's . u risk injury
5 #### Beautifully packaged , supurb taste , not a a broken nut in the package . Great !
5 #### I make a lot of recipes that call for raw almonds . The price for these was good and the company has a good reputation . I have been very pleased with the almonds I bought . Fresh , clean and tasty . Twelve pounds will last me a year and still taste good at the end . I will buy from this company again .
4 #### This is the first time I have purchased these almonds . I noticed other reviews that indicated a high level of bad nuts . So far , I have only found 2 nuts that were bad and I am half way through the second 5 pound bag . They are mostly good sized , high quality almonds and I would buy these again .
5 #### I 've made some good almond milk with this . Will definitely order again when I 'm out .
5 #### These are the freshest almonds I have ever tasted ! ! Sooo happy with the purchase ! !
5 #### Keep in freezer for freshness . Soak some overnight & make almond milk in blender .
1 #### I love Dave ghost pepper sauce . However I had to throw it out without opening it . It appeared a little discolored so phoned the manufacturer and was advised not to consumed based on age . Also it was discolored because of improper storage .
4 #### On my mission to find the best of the best hot sauces Amazon has to offer and I have to say this one wins in heat level so far ! I know my limits so I do n't want to get up into the Carolina reaper level because that just seems painful lol . I enjoy a solid punch it the mouth from time to time though and this sauce delivers ! The taste is not the best ( I have had worse ) but it is def not a vinegary and gross taste which is key for me . Worth trying for you hot sauce fans out there !
5 #### These arrived quite fresh and are delicious . If you 've only ever had California almonds , these are worth a try . I find them to be more flavorful , less watery than CA almonds . I am using them for nut milk and in raw date cookies .
1 #### This review is for only one issue - this company does not provide a proper mailing address for where the product is manufactured , and therefore does not comply with US Food Safety and Consumer Protection regulations . The food is good . Here is a copy of the email Food To Live sent me when I asked them to fix their label so customers could know where they do business : " Dear Sir , Below is the excerpt from the USDA Food Labeling Guide in regards to the address listed on the label . " Food labels must list : Street address if the firm name and address are not listed in a current city directory or telephone book . " In our case , our company 's address is listed in our city 's directory . Best Regards , Food To Live Team " Here is my reply : Dear Food To Live Customer Service , You forgot the part about how FDA requires a zip code , which is not on your label . Also , if you provide a street address or P.O. Box that would show transparency to your customers . What to you have to hide ? Look at the label of any other major food company , and you will find this information on their products . Why should I trust a company that hides where they make their food products ? Thanks for fixing your problems and builder customer confidence in your company .
5 #### These almonds are a staple in our pantry . Great product great price .
5 #### We first ordered this companys almonds a couple months ago after becoming unhappy with the nuts we were receiving from another Amazon source .. Our decision was based on the reviews we read while searching for a better alternative to overly dry nuts . We were quite pleased with the product we received , We really enjoyed their fresh flavor and pleasant texture and have since purchased the 10 lb . twice , the second time just a few days ago . These orders had the same high quality as the initial order - excellent . We will reorder this product when we finish these .
5 #### Best that anyone can buy and very healthy to boot . Roy
5 #### Product came quickly and was exactly as expected , delicious !
5 #### I 'm very happy with these . They taste great and are super fresh . I 've used them to make almond butter , almond milk , and just raw as a snack . Very tasty :)
3 #### Really really hot . Has a good flavor . But its insanely hot . No doubt about that . Reserve this for marinades , sauces , and soups or salads . If you pour this on a chicken breast , you will not be able to eat it .
3 #### I looove hot sauces . However , I found the Ghost Pepper one to be " meh . " It 's got quite a kick . Several drops will definitely do . I do n't mind the fire at all but I 'm really not that crazy about the flavor . It 's a lot like Tobasco . I did n't get the fruit flavor that others have written about . I personally prefer Cheyenne or habanero flavor but always want waaay more kick . I think I 'll buy another bottle of Frank 's and mix some of this to boost the spice level but keep the flavor I like . I 'd also really like to try other Dave 's sauce because they probably have a different one that I 'd really love but it seems they 're mostly unavailable now . Updated : I recently bought El Yucateco Black Label at Walmart and it 's amazing . Good flavor , nice spice , and a great smoky flavor . It 's also a lot cheaper than these .
5 #### I bought these for my son and he is eating them with no complaints . They look to be good quality nut and I like that they 're unsalted ; very hard to find unsalted nuts in the Navy commissary .
1 #### My travels have taken me all over the planet and on every continent , I 've sample the " best of " the locals ' hot sauces and hot peppers . I believe that a truly great hot sauce should of course be hot but not so hot as to temporarily kill the taste buds and make for a hideously painful and long - lasting unpleasant experience . That 's Dave 's Ghost Pepper Sauce . If I could have given it -1 stars or less , I would have .
2 #### meh ..... its very vinegary without the heat i normally like . i buy ghost pepper flakes in bulk and put it on everything . this tasted like ghost pepper - tobasco sauce . not very appealing . this i not really that hot and definitely not sustained heat .
5 #### love them they are great order and shipment were on the spot great .
5 #### Hubby says this maybe one of the best hot sauces . A little goes a long way .
5 #### All the heat you will ever need , I love it for making Mexican food and all spicy additions . keep from your eyes , serious !
5 #### Excellent , perfect heat and a very good flavor of garlic , the only problem is that it is a little thicker than most sauces and does nt mix with harder food like ravioli . But what the hell , 1 drop at a time . will fedinatelly buy this again !
5 #### First a warning , if you are not a true chili head , this sauce will overpower you and cause you pain ! Dave 's insanity products are called insane for good reason , they take hot up a dozen notches to thermonuclear ! This sauce could easily have adopted the old Brylcream slogan " a little dab'll do ya " cause this stuff you use one small drop at a time . Just a few drops in a quart of tomato sauce and it was too hot for several of my friends . So heed the warning about the heat . However , if you are a true lover of hell 's wrath in your body , this is the stuff ! Incredible heat , but it also has a great taste . If you are not faint of heart , give this a try !
3 #### A significant amount of the nuts in this bag seemed nasty . I like many of the other Food to Live organic nuts , but doubt I 'll buy these again .
5 #### I love these almonds , as they are so fresh and easy to chew . I use almonds several times each week
5 #### The almonds were very fresh . Taste was absolutely superb . I ground some up and made 2 batches of almond butter , one with a little fresh honey
5 #### Dark , twisted , mysterious taste : very different from the fruity taste of habaneros and reaper peppers . Followed by incinerating heat , building up over the next minute or so . Personally , I like to mix it into barbecue sauce . Also good directly on enchiladas . Pairs well with Indian and North African foods too . Highly recommended . Scoville 650k estimated from what I have read , so it 's about 50 % ghost pepper or a bit more .
5 #### Truly fiery , hella - lava packed in a sturdy 5 oz bottle . I do n't think plastic could contain it . Its industrial strength potency will not only cannibalize your insides , it also cleans baked on grease ; grill , oven , you name it ! Wow ! Not for the faint - of - heart . Leaves your tongue panting , hanging out doggie - style . I heard even Satan dilutes it before seasoning sulfur soup !
5 #### Dave 's gourmet definitely has the best bang for your buck when it comes to hot sauce . While this is n't quite as hot as I expected , it is pretty great . The ghost pepper flavor is really strong and overpowers most food . Update : The contents of the bottle must have separated , after a lot of shaking the sauce is now bringing some serious heat .
5 #### Very hot , amazing flavor currently number 3 on our hottest list
5 #### I bought this hot sauce for my son and he loves it !
5 #### I am a big Dave 's Insanity hot sauce fan . I have tried the regular Dave 's Insanity , as well as the Ultimate Insanity however , the Ghost Pepper is by far my most favourite . It is not terribly hot for my standards , but the taste is addictive ! If only there was one with the Carolina reapers ! !
5 #### There 's a lot of heat in this sauce and I love it I 've used it about 6 times already this is the hottest sauce I 've been able to get my hands on I like the heat .. I also sent a bottle to my brother in law I do n't know if it 's a punishment for him or if he likes it he 's into spicy too . If your looking for real heat you wo n't be disappointed
5 #### I love Dave 's Insanity anything . This Ghost Pepper is no exception . It 's extremely hot but I can handle the tongue and mouth heat . It 's what happens in the belly that can really mess you up with this stuff . Do n't use this on dinner if you plan on going to the mall the next morning .
1 #### I ordered Daves original insanity sauce because I normally use his temporary insanity sauce and I really like it but just wanted something hotter . This sauce is terrible . All you can taste is extract . I threw it away as soon as I tried it . The shipping was very fast though .
5 #### The scorpion sauce has a better natural flavor but this ghost pepper sauce is a bit hotter . If you really like it hot ( like me ) add a teaspoon to your dish , and blend it well !
4 #### Pretty good flavor , a bit vinegary . A bit disappointed with the heat , not hot enough for me but everyone 's palate is different .
5 #### GREAT HOT SAUCE ! Get ready to try a nice flavor & SMOKING HOT SAUCE ! I bought bottles for gifts ! I 'm half way through my bottle . Ready to order more , I normally get some from a friend who grows his own SCORPION PEPPERS & jars them & gives me some ! I know gave him a bottle of this , HE LOVED IT ! ! DAVES HOT SAUCE IS A MUST TRY FOR YOURSELF SAUCE FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I have Daves Original Insanity Sauce in the fridge . One drop on your tongue will put you on the floor rolling with 180,000 Scoville units of pain . Dave 's Ghost Pepper sauce is over 3.5x as hot , coming in at 650,000 Scoville units . The label tells you to use it one drop at a time . If you try to be macho and ingest any more in a sitting , you 'll hate yourself and have a story to tell others . One drop in a bowl of chili is more than enough . I have ordered two bottles that are on their way to friends . Free shipping makes this a cheap price .
4 #### I 'm not entirely sure if I could tell you the difference between this and Ultimate Insanity , if you put a gun up to my head . Still tastes good , if you like other Dave 's products , but I did n't really get much ghost pepper taste out of the sauce . It just seems like a slightly - hotter - than - Ultimate - Insanity Sauce .
5 #### Very spicy for those who like their food caliente ! No doubt , you must approach slowly and w / caution . As you adapt to your pain tolerance , you can go up in quantity . I like to add a pea amount to my single serving soups to give it a nice kick , or to salsa to give it heat . Highly recommend it .
5 #### This is a great , super hot , very flavorful , ghost pepper hot sauce . This sauce has been roasting my mouth for years now ! I like buying real hot stuff like this , and mixing it into my meals in very small quantities , then it lasts a lot longer . Be warned though , if you use too much of this stuff , it 'll ruin your food ! I go through a lot of habanero hot sauce , but this stuff it easily 3 times hotter than any habanero hot sauce I 've ever bought . Just be ready for the heat , or you 'll regret it !
5 #### I got these for a friend who likes spicy foods . I knew I could n't just get some ordinary hot sauce and so based off the reviews , ordered a bottle of this . He told me that it was so hot , it ruined some of the foods he put it on . Yes ! Exactly what I was hoping for haha . I would recommend the company put a smaller spout on this bottle , it really needs something closer to an eye dropper !
5 #### Love this hot sauce ! It is really really hot , but it also does have a pretty good flavor that is n't ruined by the extract that is in it . Also , the burn seems to come and hit you really hard really fast but it is n't as lasting as the burn of some of the other ultra hot sauces . If you crave extra heat you should really like this sauce . I am always looking for a sauce that will light my mouth up and this one does the trick and has a decent flavor . Also the price is really good for such a hot sauce that will last a long time . Great stuff from Dave 's .
5 #### Love this sauce , it is hot but not gut wrenching hot to me . If you are not used to spicy stuff I would not try this . A couple Mexican friends tried this and said it had a kick .
5 #### I have had this before and I will say it is hot , but it do n't kill me , truthfully while the heat is intense , it goes away shortly . I use more then the recommended drops and sure , my nose runs , I sweat but I am building up a tolerance to it . I am half Korean so I am pretty used to hot , spicy foods .
5 #### I bought this to challenge some Asian guys at work . They laughed at my last sauce . So I brought this in , they gobbled it up with ease . They said yeah , it 's pretty good . Then I was mad . How bad can this stuff be , I thought ? So I poured a couple nice size dabs on some crackers and munched them down . And I have n't eaten anything hot since . That was a month ago . This stuff burned all the way down , and out the other side . What was I thinking . Holy woah . I hate those guys .
5 #### Some of Dave 's sauces ( especially the extracts ) have a chemical / metallic taste to them , but I am happy to report that this one is a wonderful exception . The Scorpion Pepper sauce is basically just pureed peppers - and this stuff is simply incredible . There are some seeds , so it wo n't flow though your favorite Sriracha bottle ( I tried ) - and it 's about a zillion times hotter than Sriracha - but the flavor is absolutely sublime . I go through about a bottle a week now , budget allowing . If you can hang with the * seriously * hot stuff , but still appreciate a superior pepper flavor that is n't just " blind heat " - then this is the one for you . It 's got an amazing flavor , which ( unfortunately ) not a lot of people can appreciate because of the nuclear heat levels .
5 #### I bought this for my boyfriend to keep at work since he is always complaining that I do n't make his lunches spicy enough . I told him to use only a little at a time since the reviews I read said it is VERY spicy . He insisted he would be fine and then sent me a video from work of him pouring about half the bottle onto his chicken and rice . This was a decision he regretted . I laughed as he cried later in the bathroom .
5 #### Wow . This stuff lives up to the name ! EXTREMELY HOT ! I used 3 tsp of this hot sauce in 1/2 cup of franks buffalo sauce and after 8 wings I could not bear the pain , way worse than any pepper I have eaten ( including ghost chilies , keep in mind this is mostly an extract with just enough ghost pepper in it for flavor ) I recommend this if you love things hot . Just do n't use too much haha . It also tastes REALLY good . Great stuff , just do n't buy it unless you can handle hot foods ( no , jalapenos are not a hot food , and chipotles hardly start to fall under this category )
4 #### This sauce is hot so use sparingly at first .
3 #### Solid flavor , but not particularly hot . Would not pay the money for this again , as you can get cheap stuff at Walmart / Target with similar kick .
5 #### Bought this for my future son in law and he loves it .
5 #### I put half a drop on some pork and had to drink Tabasco to cool the hell that my mouth had become
4 #### it does bring the heat indeed . considering how much fire this brings , the flavor is not bad . my friend made some homemade hot sauce with ghost peppers and i have yet to find one that has rivaled it . the search continues but this still livens up any dish in a pleasant way for any person who likes to test their limits of spicy food .
5 #### Son ca n't live without Dave 's Gourmet Naga Jholokia ( Ghost Pepper ) Hot sauce . I tried finding it the regular grocery store in our area and after the third store I finally came back home and got online to Amazon . Nice , Amazon offers everything plus the last grocery store I bought Dave 's was a little higher . So I am happy and my son is not complaining any more . Thank you Amazon for offering such wonderful products .
5 #### Stuff is hot , and good . Took me a year to get rid of my last one and probably will be another year on this one . A drop will usually do the trick . Not as hot as scorpions but good never the less . This stuff will make you sweat . Do nt try to impress anyone or you could end up with an issue .
5 #### My husband loves Dave 's brand hot sauce . He is very picky and this is his favorite . This product is shipped fast and always packaged well . We have made many purchases with them and have not ever had a issue . Great product ! ( ... ) and if you have questions I did not answer feel free to leave a comment or go to my profile and email me . Thank you ! !
5 #### I 've only dared to use this sauce as directed , a few drops at a time , but I 've been very happy with it so far . A tiny quantity delivers a fair punch . What surprised me about this sauce though , is the complexity of the flavor profile . Even in tiny quantities , it 's easy to pick up on the sharpness , and surprisingly , a sort of aromatic sweetness . I do n't know if this is typical of ghost chilis , but the sauce is more than just hot . I 've been using it on everything that hot sauce out to be put on since getting it .
5 #### A little goes a long way . I was expecting it to be not so hot as regular store bought sauces but oh was I wrong ... A few drops on a chip and it made my eyes water , my nose run and it left my mouth burning for some time .
5 #### Do n't play around with this sauce ! This is hotter than h3ll ! Make sure you test it with tooth pick size servings . I did and it burned for ten minutes . OMG it was hilarious ! My mouth watered up like crazy ! Have fun !
4 #### great sauce . not quite as flavorful as I enjoy . good , serious heat . when i ( finally ) opened the package it was mailed in and added some to my bean soup , i was dismayed to learn that there was no control sort of dose release once you open the bottle top . no drip kind of cap . it just poured out . so i had some VERY hot soup . i 'm surprised by the lack of portion control on the cap and the bizarre packaging . other than that : love !
5 #### now this one is the one that totally got me I love heat , I chase heat , I chase heat big time this heat brought it and bit back and brought heat with it I love it big time
5 #### About two drops did the trick ! Its hot ... but good flavor too .
5 #### Gag gift for my brother who thinks nothing is ever hot enough . Got this for him , he put 1 drop on a piece of chicken and he was sweating for a few hours . Mr. Macho did n't want to admit that it was super hot , bottle is still full lol . It 's pretty damn hot . I smelled it and my sinuses were cleared ( for me at least ) . Enjoy your sauce , seems to be really good . He said it was n't vinegar tasting like most sauces are , it 's just really hot . Do n't touch it and then your eyeballs or anything else ... you 'll be super sorry ! Also milk helps alleviate the pepper taste , water makes it worse ( if you did n't know already ) . Water swishes around the oils from the peppers , while dairy dulls the peppers .... good luck and enjoy your sauce ! Shipped perfectly and it was well packaged / sealed . Thanks !
5 #### If you love extreme spice , this is great . It 's not the hottest sauce I 've got , but the flavor is smokey and fruity and wonderful on eggs .
4 #### Subtly spicy to complement the jerk taste . Does n't burn your mouth at all and has a lot of flavor .
5 #### My hubs is a hot sauce enthusiast and snob . He hates ones that have too much vinegar . And he also likes things really hot . He is no light - weight when it comes to hotness . He eats hot sauce that burns my nose hairs with nearly every meal . He tried a few drops upon receiving it . This stuff made him cry tears of joy .... and pain . He was thrilled .
5 #### I ignored the warning thinking it was just another sauce that says its hot and is nothing close Tabenero , Dave 's hurting Habanero ect . So I took a large drink of it plain like I do all my sauces to try . ( I do use a spoon ) WOW ! It hit my hard and fast . My tummy was hurting as sweat pored from my pores . In short , it was awesome ! This is a real hot sauce and is the first one I have tried that I would grab over Habanero Tabasco . I am use to really hot things so those who are not should use caution and not try to drink it by itself . The flavor is also wonderful and I enjoyed it on my simple salad of some lattice and dressing with this . It does need to be kept refrigerated which means I ca nt keep a bottle in my purse for when eating out like I do with Tabasco so that 's a shame . Otherwise , this is a new favorite . 9 out of 10 .
5 #### Yum , HOT , YUMMY HOT . Not for the squeamish . A little goes a long way .
5 #### Another Dave 's flavorful and spicy sauce ! If you want both flavor and spice , this is a great addition to your collection ! Highly recommended !
5 #### OK the hubby loves it , and boy does he ..... he loves all the Dave 's hot sauces , he swears they each have their own unique flavor . I am happy for him . I appreciated how well they came packaged and will not hesitate to order from this vendor again , they did a bang up job !
5 #### This sauce has wonderful flavor but is definitely not for the timid . I use about 1 tablespoon per 20 qts of beans when I make burritos which I then freeze . Much too hot to just slather on your dinner plate .
5 #### Awesome flavor not too hot not too mild heads a little bang but smooth
4 #### Very Very Hot . But we love it . It makes my nose and eyes water .. has my tongue on fire but it has a good zing to it .
4 #### WARNING . For some unknowable reason , this bottle does not come with a dropper or other flow limiter . If you are not careful , a good glop of sauce will pour out onto your food . DO NOT EAT THAT LAYER OF FOOD . Anything more than a drop at a time is too much . I made the mistake of eating half a glop an hour ago . My lips are still numb , I am still sweating , my insides are not happy , and I am dreading the trip to the bathroom tomorrow morning . Be extremely careful people .
1 #### Not as hot as other Dave 's Ghost pepper hot sauce product I have purchased . So the claim is false I tried a teaspoon and other than a tummy ache my 12 year old neighbor did n't even flinch , his overall reaction to it was " That 's the Best Dave 's hot sauces can do " and shook his head . Well Dave the gauntlet has been thrown down , is you product man enough to step up to the plate and answer the challenge ?
5 #### One of my favorites . Contains Cayenne , Habanero , Scotch Bonnet , and Jalapeo fruits . I just wish it came in bottles larger than 10 oz ! For some reason , a lot of the best sauces come from FL . If you want something hotter , my suggestion would be to try the famous Scorpion fruit used in Fat Cat ( brand ) Chairman Meow 's Revenge . But Gator is pretty excellent , and just right for those people like me who are a little picky about their hot sauces ( and have tried a ton of them ) .
5 #### Beware of this one ! ! ! It is for those who like food Hot & Spicy .
5 #### LOVE LOVE LOVE this hot sauce ! It is not ideal for all kinds of food but it delivers a ton of flavor and just the right amount of heat ... Firehouse Subs had it as a 6 on a 10 point scale and that is accurate ! It makes the BEST wings you have ever had ! ! !
5 #### My new favorite hot sauce thought i d go sparingly now have ordered several more bottles as i go thru this in 2 weeks i put it on everything awesome flavor and after burn with enough heat right off the top to satisfy any hot sauce palette in my opinion of course
5 #### This is the hottest hot sauce I 've ever eaten . I love it , but it will make your scalp sweat and say words you promised your mother you would never , ever repeat . Delicious !
4 #### I figured I would " up " the hotness of my sauces as I already had purchased Daves Insanity Hot Sauce . This sauce has a nice bold flavor , but honestly It is not nearly as hot as I was expecting . I used a drop as suggested in a bowl of chili.but found that I needed to add more,"pouring " multiple drops in for added heat . Although it was good sauce , I will be looking for a sauce that registers higher on the Scoville scale next time around . ( Maybe my taste buds are becoming desensitized to the hotter hot sauces )
4 #### This Dave 's hot sauce will take the top of your head off , but very good if you are a Chili head !
4 #### Since reviews for several different hot sauces seem to be lumped together here , my review is for Dave 's Ghost Pepper Naga Jolokia Hot Sauce . This stuff is hot . But for a seasoned hot sauce aficionado this is not the ultimate in heat or pain . If you have conquered Dave 's Original Insanity Hot Sauce then this is not going to impress you . This is disappointing because the whole point of buying ghost pepper hot sauce is for extreme heat . Do not be fooled though , this stuff IS hot . And if you are n't seasoned this is plenty hot to put you in serious pain . But since this is ghost pepper sauce I was expecting something hotter than original Insanity Sauce and this is not it . It 's a step below on the heat scale . Not a big step below but still below . With Insanity Sauce I have to be more careful about how much I put into my dish . But with this ghost pepper version I find myself erring on the side of putting in too much rather than not enough . This one is more forgiving . Also , while the original insanity sauce is thick like lava , this is runny like regular Tabasco Sauce . Whether that is better or not is a a matter of personal preference . That being said , this one is still good for those times when I do n't want to go all out so it 's not without its merits . But if you 're looking for ultimate in heat , this is not it .
5 #### Good flavor . Use sparingly until you learn how hot this is .
3 #### Never drink alot of this stuff . I thought I was going to die . Good think it made me sick , or I would have been burning the next day or so .
4 #### Trust the label when it says insanity . This sauce is the hottest hot sauce that I 've ever tasted . I made some hot wings with this sauce once and my friends and I kept forgetting how hot the sauce was , because the wings were so good . The bottom line is if you like super hot sauces , then try this .
5 #### This hot sauce made my friend throw up when he had a sample . I 'd say that 's pretty good . You might want to go easy with it in the beginning .
5 #### This sauce is not for everyone . obviously , if your looking at my review , then your on the road to being a pepper - head . My other favorite is ( Spontaneous combustion ) . Dave 's sneaks up on you , where as the latter , hits you hard and fast . Pick your poison ! PS , I mix this in with salad dressing to give it some extra kick ! Try it , you might like it .
1 #### Well , I guess I 'm the fly in this reviewer ointment , but Dave 's is the only hotsauce that I wo n't buy . It has a synthetic quality to it and a flavor that is almost non - existent . This is due to its being made directly from capsaicin extract as opposed to actual peppers . It offers a nuclear level of heat that seems to be a recipe for ulcers in my opinion . According to Wikipedia , its Scoville heat ( fire ) index rates out 50,000 units which can be contrasted with Tobasco 's 2,500 to 5,000 rating . Who needs that much heat ? Not me or most human beings . This stuff is lethal . No thanks .
2 #### My husband is a hot sauce connoisseur , and I bought 3 ghost pepper sauces for him to try and compare , one of which was this one . He opened it first and admitted that it was VERY hot . ( This coming from a man who eats whole fresh jalapenos raw as a snack . ) But I could tell he was n't wild about the flavor . So he opened another of the 3 bottles and was WOWED by the flavor . Dave 's is hotter , but the flavor just is n't there . So if you just want HOT , go for this one . If you want both , look further . I would recommend his favorite , Melinda 's .
5 #### How hot a sauce is quite relative adjective ; all depending on users capability to take it .. To me , this sauce is hot hot hot , but , not way too hot to force you jump into cold shower ... it leaves a very pleasant and torturous after effect that last no more than 15 minutes ... it actually tastes too .. I highly recommend this sauce to hot sauce aficionados ..
5 #### Naga Jolokia is a lot hotter than ' Temporary Insanity ' , it ca n't be dispensed like pasta sauce the way ' Temporarity Insanity " can . But a few drops on a single plate , or a quick pour into a stir fry sauce ( during cooking ) works great . I also love that beyond being just hot , it has a subtle yet distinctive earthy smell / taste to it
5 #### Do you have a friend who thinks he can eat any hot sauce ? Have him pour a little of this on his next taco , then sit back and enjoy the show .
4 #### This is for very experienced hot sauce eaters only , this is some of the hottest Naga Jolokia sauce there is , a few drops and then there is a delayed reaction of a few seconds before the heat and burn hits you but it will . This sauce can be managed but it demands respect . If your looking for the hottest sauce out there this does n't even come close to some of the other extreme heat sauces on the market which must be due to the way the make the sauce as the pepper itself is the hottest . The heat overpowers the flavor on this one also .
5 #### $ 6 a bottle may seem allot at first , but when you only use a drop or two , it is a real bargain . I love pepper sauces , I grow peppers and make my own , but I can never concentrate it to this level . I like to use a couple of drops of this Ghost Pepper and mix it into mustard or BBQ sauce for a great kick . Has a unique flavor , I am happy with my purchase .
5 #### If you like hot stuff , this one 's for you . Take it to lunch to spice up a bland meal . It 's so hot , it 's spooky ! If you know of any hotter sauce available , please let me know in the comments here . I highly recommend this for certain soups . I use it to give my tom yum noodles an extra kick . In short , this sauce has the fire , but you really have to want the fire . Finally , you will definitely perspire while eating this . Keep it in mind .
5 #### I told my son to apply one a single drop to try it out , not a glop of hot sauce -- which he instantly regretted . On a scale of 1 to 10 , 1 being faintly noticeable heat , to 10 being OMG I 'm on FIRE ! this is a 10 . Good s * * * .
5 #### Ok I am shocked at my response to this . It is n't that bad for me . I guess everyone is different . It has a pleasant heat and I get NO after heat . Is it hot ? Yes , but not too hot . And very flavorful , you do get the fruit undertones . The one criticism I have and it is something to be aware of , the bottle is a normal bottle . This means getting a drop or just a few is virtually impossible . It flows out . It is also a great price . So my advice is try a bottle . It may be too hot , it may not . But surprisingly to me my body handles it just fine .
5 #### This if very good trasting hot sauce . It goes a long ways since it 's very hot . About 6 drops in your noodles will do the trick . I love spicy food so I use this sauce on all my food . One bottle lasts me a couple of months . I have another bottle coming . You ca n't beat the price either .
5 #### but also very temporary Mega heat , without the lasting burn of other sauces , which means I can consume more in less time .
5 #### I love spicy foods but this counts more as a potentially dangerous chemical than a food . I put about 1/8 teaspoon in a pot of beans and the whole pot is noticeably spiced up . I tiny dab on the end of your pinky will send your mouth into fiery place . There is no need for their even hotter product . I figure one bottle will last me a couple of years .
4 #### I enjoy things spicier than most . This is indeed HOT , but eating it neat does n't feel quite as intense as eating a fresh habanero to me- my ears were not burning . The heat is quick to start , strong , and tingly , lasting for several minutes . The flavor of the sauce reminds me a little of tomato paste with cherries ( but not sweet ) and I do n't really taste chili peppers . Excellent for kicking things up without altering flavor too much . A staple in the hot sauce arsenal for intermediate - level hot heads .
5 #### Extremely hot ! This sauce is no joke . My dad tried a spoonful of it while he was working up in Alaska . Big mistake . He could n't breathe . It nearly sent him to the hospital . I was smart enough to put some on a spoon and then dip the tip of my tongue into it , not try and eat a whole spoonful . This sauce is extremely thick and concentrated . It barely runs out of the bottle without some shaking for encouragement . It has a very bitter pepper extract flavor up - front , with a touch of smoky habanero . If you can get over the nasty bitterness , you might even be encouraged to try some more . Do n't . Then , the burn hits . After tasting just a little of this , you will need milk . Like , five glasses of milk . And it 's oily and the milk just spreads it around your mouth and makes the burn worse , at first . If you like spicing up your food , this is very economical ; a teaspoon will make any dish almost inedibly hot for most people . One bottle will last a very , very long time . Do n't be dismayed by the gross flavor ; when diluted in a bowl of chili con carne , the bitterness vanishes .
5 #### Smack you in your mouth hot it 's for CHILI HEADS , NOT YOUR EVERYDAY PEOPLE.if you do n't enjoy the kick , burn , hot flashes the sweats , the pure joy of waking up your taste buds this is NOT for you ! Stick to the vinegar grocery store Frank 's /Louisanna hot sauce and all the other mass production of BITTER excuse for hot sauce
5 #### One of the best hot sauce on the planet . There is alot of flavor in a small bottle . Not that boring at all .
5 #### I 'm a huge pepper connoisseur so naturally , this was my next step . The feared Ghost Pepper ! I almost underestimated it 's kick as I used it for the first time . I three nice drops on my salmon and ate away like it was regular hot sauce . Let 's just say , good thing I had some tissue near by . LMAO . This pepper really has earned it 's name and reputation . It 's an awesome sauce for only the brave and those who truly enjoy spicy food .
5 #### This is a sauce to be used sparingly , too much and you will feel the burn . The sauce does actually have some good flavors if you use an appropriate amount and do n't over do it . I find that just a few drops is plenty for me to add loads of heat and really get that tingly hot pepper feel in my mouth . This bottle will last me quite a while at the rate I am currently using it .
5 #### My boss at work tried a dab of this on his finger and almost cried . It is crazy hot ... I told him to wash his finger well . He did n't and rubbed his eye an hour later while driving . He had to pull over and pour a bottle of water in his eye . Hilarious . Great hot sauce for those who can handle CRAZY HOT food !
5 #### if you like extreme hotness , this is it . One drop is all you need . I gave it five stars not because of the flavor , but because it is the hottest sauce I ever had . Its hotter than Dave 's insanity original sauce .
5 #### I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND OF MINE WHO TRIED THE GHOST PEPPER BURGER AT RED ROBIN , ANS HE REALL LOVED THE TASTE .
5 #### I bought for two teenage boys who think they like stuff hot . Hoo - boy ! It 's HOT . Be very careful . That 's it .
4 #### If you like straight Flame On heat this will do the trick . As far as taste , really lacks flavor . Do n't get me wrong , I like this sauce , I use a good line of this and it makes me sweat , my nose run and it burns going down the throat , but they could have added more ingredients to make it have flavor . If you are not used to super spicy heat , leave this stuff alone .
5 #### caused everyone to tear up , runny nose , needed milk , not sure if they will try again , but sure was worth it ....
1 #### This stuff hurt going down and for a few days later . I can not recommend unless you are suicidal , AND if you rub your eyes after using it or touching it in any way you 're a goner .
5 #### A must have for anyone who craves hot sauce . This sauce will raise your taste buds to new hights of deliciousness ! Buy now and enjoy the awesome hotness !
4 #### I know they make Insane sauce also , as I have it ! This stuff is HOT ! ! I use ghost peppers in cooking also , but this stuff will blister your fingers ! I can only use a dot - not a drop - a dot ! ;) If you like hot , with flavor , this stuff is it ! ! ! Use with moderation ! :) There are cautions all over the bottle !
5 #### WHOA NELLY It 's spicy all right . Wonderful flavor too . Just do n't do what I did and test it by dolloping a big blob on a corn chip and chowing down ( I was used to less - spicy sauce ) . Felt like I had a nest of angry hornets in my mouth . Cleared my sinuses out though .
5 #### People say that it may not be hot enough but this stuff has it in the hot department . It seems like the super hot sauces impact over bit of time and get hotter and hotter . Also , it may be good not to eat a lot before you know the effect on your body . It gives me some gurgling and peculating , hot in the butt and a fever glow to me entire body . I suggest putting a spoon of this onto regular wing sauce .
5 #### Great for my homemade hotwings ... highly recommended to get just the right amount of heat . Just a few drops will do ya '
5 #### I usually get their Ghost Pepper hot sauce which is much more hot but I decided to get this one this time . It is still delicious and flavorful . But one of the bottle had pepper oil / extraction sitting on top of it . Oh man that was really hot . I tried shaking it to mix it up and all but it still set on top of the sauce . But no complains here .
5 #### Very hot and very tasty . I highly recommend it if you like spicy food .
5 #### Just a small amount can set your food on fire . Poor people like me would typically put this in their ramen noodles . If you put a pea sized drop , you 're going to get a satisfying burn flavor . A tea spoon would be too much for most people , and it would make your food inedible . Unless you like Scoville units up the kazoo . This is something you really need to taste for yourself . I highly recommend it . Good price too , would buy again .
4 #### I do n't use hot sauce . Tabasco is almost too hot for me . But my husband loves hot sauce ... The hotter the better and he says this stuff is hot . He barely touched his finger to the rim of the bottle for a taste and said it was the hottest he had tried so far . That tells me one thing ... there is NO WAY I can eat this . Good news , it 's all his to enjoy which he said is just fine by him .
2 #### I will give Dave 's that this is pretty spicy stuff , but is really lacking in flavor . As much as I love extraordinarily spicy sauces such as this , the capsaicin extract flavor is really unpleasant . I 've found that sauces that use extract are of course very spicy , but generally have a pretty awful flavor . I 've tried plenty of different brands , and I see the same thing . Extract seems to completely ruin the flavor of the sauce . From what I 'd guess - using extract is the CHEAP way out for the manufacturer ( make things hot , for cheap ) . I grow several varieties of hot peppers at home , and have made batches of sause easily on - par with the spice of dave 's , but they have actual flavor ( really good flavor ) . It just takes a healthy dose of whatever hot pepper I 'm putting in ( butch - t 's , red savina , etc ) . I knew Dave 's had extract , but was sucked in by the rave reviews . If you do n't care about flavor but heat only , I guess this fits the bill . From now on , I 'm not buying any more hot sauces that have capsaicin extract . They do exist , but are usually a bit more expensive .
4 #### You may be thinking ... "Hey , this sauce is pretty cheap " but I promise you get a whopper of an experience with this sauce . I know someone who went to a function and put a big steak on his plate . He then just happened to " pour " a bit of Dave 's Insanity Sauce on his steak . Well he must have thought this was Tiger sauce or something for nothing could prepare him for what came next . He took a bite of his steak and instantly felt like his mouth was on fire . This experience lasted hours and hours . This person claims they will be more careful next time . A few drops is probably all you need . But the story was great and I remembered this sauce because of it . So unless you want a good story to talk about with your friends ... be very cautious . And have milk handy . ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### Just a drop will do ! I 've been adding this stuff to my meals for years . Love it .
2 #### It 's super spicy , which is why you want to buy it ( ultimate insanity flavor ) . The flavor is terrible , however ! Oily and weird - I prefer hot sauces that are made from pure pepper and delicious ingredients - and to be honest , I wish they were a touch hotter , but overall , this stuff does n't create a pleasant experience for me the way the natural ghost pepper and habanero sauces do .
5 #### Really good flavor and strong heat . Not as hot as Blair 's Beyond Death , but still solid . I typically toast 12 - grain bread , then coat it with this sauce , put Jarlsberg or Cape Edam cheese on top , then dump split olives on top of that . It 's a winning combo . Recommend this with Blair 's as well if you want it even hotter .
5 #### I love my Trinidad Scorpion ground pepper and I put it on steaks , mac & cheese , etc . I got this Ghost pepper hot sauce for breakfast treats . I tested with a quarter teaspoon of straight hot sauce and I was very pleasantly burned for almost 20 minutes . Very nice flavors - a hint of floral something , a little hint of garlic , a faint sweetness and then the napalm hits hard . Good stuff !
1 #### I love hot sauces , and am not shy to seek them out . I tried this one , because everyone says it 's so great and so hot . Well I tried it , about a 1/4 tsp or less , and it was one of the worst tasting sauces I 've ever had . It had a chemical and non - natural taste to it . It was hot , that 's for sure , my mouth and tongue were on fire for a little bit , which is fine , but what really hit me was my stomach . It felt like it shot down to my stomach and I had a pain in my stomach for about 30 minutes and discomfort for about 4 hours . From what I 've read and heard from some chilliheads , it 's the pepper extract that causes the stomach issues and taste . So maybe everyone does n't experience that , but from that experience alone , I am no longer going to consume sauces that are n't all natural . All natural sauces taste great , some are very hot ( with Scorpion peppers , etc ... ) , but aside from he heat , are mild on my system . To each his own , but I thought it was absolutely nasty , but HOT if that 's your thing .
5 #### Insanity is a great sauce to put a few drops in cooking it adds that kick that is needed . Not to use alone .
5 #### If you use too much you will want to rip your tongue out .
5 #### not me , my son loved it ... he loves HOT & this was hottest he ever had .
5 #### Finally , a sauce that actually tastes hot . Just a few drops of this will prevent non - hot - food - eaters from stealing any of your delicious food .
4 #### It 's going to be a joke gift is what I mean . This is an extract sauce . As if the Naga Jolokia pepper was n't potent enough , these people add caspian extract to an already stupid hot concoction . This is a comedy sauce that is fun to watch other people eat .
5 #### Finally I found a sauce that is just pure heat with good flavor , if you have dish or even a favorite hot sauce that is just to mild for some applications this is highly recommended as a little goes a very long way . This is exceptionally hot and not super high on the salt or vinegar or just otherwise off putting flavor , a teaspoon of this will not go unnoticed even if it in a pot of chili for 50 people .
5 #### Ca n't get enough of this sauce . We use it for chili , wings , and homemade jerky .
5 #### Yes it 's HOT . It 's not the hottest I 've ever had but it 's still hot . However , despite it being spicy and has a great flavor . A little goes a long way .
4 #### Extremely hot ! We love it .. it adds zing to our sometimes bland food :)
5 #### I always loved Dave 's Gourmet sauces and this is no different . Classic Habinero mustard sauce with a Caribbean twist . Try Dave 's other sauces .
5 #### Got this for the hubs who thinks he knows hot ! Well he loves the flavor but is having to dilute it down into some other hot sauce . But he is happy and when hubby is happy I am too . He did admidt he should go back to the milder Dave 's sauces ..... me ? no way in heck would I try it .....
5 #### I love the original Dave 's insanity I find it to be hotter than every other one of there 's I have tried and the taste is a lot better , at least in the foods I eat , I have tried the habanero and the ghost pepper ones , and while you think they would be hotter to me they are n't and also they tend to change the flavor of my food too much . I plan on trying some of the others they make but until I find one better this is my top choice out of the three .
4 #### I like Swedish Fish and the assorted package is pretty awesome . These were a little more expensive than other vendors but they arrived fresh and unbroken . I am cutting back on sweets so I do n't know if I will be buying more of the big bags . But if I do , Jaret 's Swedish Fish will be my choice .
2 #### These arrived stale with the last number of sell by date wipe off the still taste OK but are reely chewy
5 #### I was nervous about this order , as other reviews of OTHER vendors claimed that this product arrived stale from some of the other vendors and that the vendor was sometimes then unresponsive . As a result , I reached out to this vendor in advance , found them to be very responsive and professional , and they assured me that their product turns over frequently enough to maintain freshness . Sure enough , they told the truth . The product arrived just as assured , fresh as a daisy . It was a pleasure dealing with these folks and I will most definitely do it again .
5 #### This is a review on Swedish Fish the candy , not the online sellers . I do not buy my candy online if I can purchase it fresh in stores . I love Swedish Fish , they are firm but not hard ( when fresh ) . They have great flavors , and are cheap in stores . Great for children , and adults like me too !
1 #### Stale and tasteless . I love Swedish fish for a long time now but it is so hard for some reason to get a fresh bag from these sellers . I will not buy from this seller again as this was my second or third time and 2 times the candy was stale if not then it was going stale . When the candy taste all the same and not individually then you know they are on there way out .
1 #### I LOVE Swedish Fish . But sadly , this shipment must have been getting old . They were hard and some were so brittle , the tails had already broken off in the bag and were laying around in other parts of the bag from where the actual fish bodies were . Sad and weird . The " skin " of the fish was starting to sort of crack ; as they were no longer moist and fresh . They must have been getting pretty old as the taste was also bland and they were losing their flavor . Not the keen burst of flavor I am used to getting from the Swedish Fish at my local Safeway in the bulk bins . Those are fresher . I am going there from now on , after I try to finish off this big bag . I 'd send it back . But is it worth it ? I must be getting lazy . I really should send the whole 5 lb . bag back , they are really sub - par .
5 #### Use this for my homemade hotwings . Excellent flavor and just the right amount of heat . Will buy again . Highly recommend
4 #### I put this in the category of ' super spicy sauces ' - but - I do n't think it is by any means too spicy . Flavor is n't too bad , a sort of smoky tomato base flavor . More than anything , the heat comes through . This is pretty good for spicing up soups , chilies , etc . However , not really all that good for spicing up a sandwich or something , not because it is too hot , just do n't care for the flavor that much ' straight up . ' All said , this is better than your average ' super spicy ' sauce . Most seem to just have the awful capsaicin extract flavor ( and nothing else ) , which to me is inedible due to the terrible taste , not even the heat . Dave 's really is n't bad , but not my favorite either .
5 #### This is some hot sauce , even for me . I blend it in with my Amish tomato sauce for a smoking hot sauce .
5 #### Not for the faint of heart . Instructions warn to use one drop at a time . Following this waring is wise until you gauge how hot it really is .
5 #### This is my second bottle of Dave 's Original Insanity Sauce , and the first one lasted forever . I have tried several " red hot " sauces from the supermarket , and nothing is in the same ballpark as Dave 's . One drop in a pot of spaghetti sauce makes it nice and spicy . As others have warned , wash your hands after handling the bottle and before touching your eyes . The key words here are " use sparingly . "
5 #### This is an unusual sauce in that it has both very good flavor and very high heat . I use a few drops in cocktail sauce , soups etc . Most people only use a drop at a time . The thing is that you must use it sparingly or it will hurt you . If you dilute it in enough sauce , soup , chili or whatever you like hot sauce in you 'll find that it has a really great taste that blends well with most dishes . On the other hand if you just use it straight you 'll probably be sorry . For most people this would be considered an EXTREMELY hot sauce . The bottle has warnings for people with heart and respiratory problems .
1 #### O.k . , I 'm going to offer a counterpoint to all the positive reviews . I did not like this hot sauce , and I like hot sauce ! This may be good in chili ( and I will try it there as soon as I get a chance ) , but it is not a general hot sauce for your eggs , soup , sandwiches , whatever . It is very thick and has the consistency of tomato paste . The heat is derived from peppers and " pepper extracts " ( read : capsaicin ) . If you want flavorful heat you can use everywhere , try somewhere else . I recommend Melinda 's Naga Jolokia for one .
5 #### Yep , this stuff is off - the - scale hot ! The somewhat high price can ( sort of ) be justified because you only need a drizzle from this red liquid of fire to really go beyond spicy . Pros : * EXTREMELY spicy * Very , very , very , very , and even really , hot * Absolutely wonderful taste Cons : * A little on the pricey side * Medical attention may be required if too much used at one time
5 #### There are times when I want something with kick but do n't want the harsh taste of a lot of other hot sauces and this is perfect . As others have mentioned , be very careful of how much you add to your food as it has a serious kick . I also like to add this to other hot sauces to kick them up a notch . For example , this is great to add to Franks hot sauce .
5 #### Definitely hot , very flavorful . If you 're able to handle the taste of habanero 's and enjoy that heat , this is for you .
5 #### one little toothpick drop of sauce on a piece of chicken and I knew that I best place this bottle on a shelf only to be brought out when company comes over and someone starts bragging about how they can stand any hot pepper . I love extreme hot sauces can compete with the best of ya'll in withstanding the internal torture . I am however , not stupid . Use this stuff with caution .
4 #### I enjoyed this hot sauce . It does have a kick to it ( not a burn your mouth / throat kick - more like a low&slow burn ) . I found the flavor to be great & will use this liberally to make hot wings ( my 14 year old son & his friends loved it also ) . If you really want an extreme burn with good flavor try the after burner sauce from a company called Son - in - law out of Michigan .
5 #### i normally slice habaneros and add them to my food when i want something supremely spicy . i am an indian girl after all and can handle anything you throw at me in the spice dept . this was just as hot as habaneros and so much better than having to slice the habaneros and then worry about touching something and screaming from pain(ie taking my contacts out ...... ) delicious sauce that delivers the HEAT ! ! !
5 #### " Dave 's Insanity Sauce " is not to be taken casually or even as a way to add heat to individual servings , this is meant for larger dishes such as a whole pot of chili or a big batch of salsa since one or two drops will make a large amount of food VERY hot . That being said , this does have a really good flavor that adds a nice pepper tangy hit that complements most Mexican or South - Western dishes , but I would n't use it in Indian or Chinese style dishes . There are hotter sauces available , but this one is a good balance of flavor and heat . There are several amusing and somewhat painful to watch videos of people abusing this sauce on various web sites and a quick search will provide you with a lot of hits . Highly Recommended ! CFH

5 #### For most purposes , I 'm happy with Frank 's Red Hot , Tabasco , or Cholula hot sauces . But , if I 'm really feeling the need for something hot AND tasty , I 'll grab Dave 's . Careful though , a little bit goes a LONG way ... putting too much on will leave you uncomfortable for a good half hour .
5 #### My husband is such a fan of hot sauces , I ca n't believe he even has any tastebuds left . However , this is his favorite hot sauce . People are always bringing him hot sauces from their travels , or giving him unusual ones they run across . This remains his favorite . His gasping , eye - watering , favorite ! The warnings are real ... do use with caution ... even from picking up the ( apparently clean and dry ) bottle to put it back in the fridge , I 've touched my lips later and noticed a burning sensation .
4 #### Ok heres the deal . 1 pea - sized drop will have ur mouth burning for about a half hour . It 's an " extract " sauce , it says it in the ingredients . Which means the Capsaicin ( the " Hot " compound ) has been refined over and over again to produce the extreme heat . It might be considered cheating , and I 'm thinking this is probably what caused it to be kicked out of the National Fiery foods Contest . The 1 problem here is that if your looking for flavor , you ca nt get enough of it because you can only use a little portion . It 's great to spice up weaker sauces . Use it as an additive . It will last a long time . Bottle states it needs refrigeration after opening .
4 #### Come on , read the label . One of the manufacturer 's suggested uses is removal of driveway oil stains . For the last five years or so , I have always had a bottle of this sauce on hand specifically for those friends who swear nothing is ever too hot . The ultimate gratification comes from watching as they disregard any admonishments that direct consumption of any amount greater than a swab on a toothpick is too much . It is particularly helpful to quiet those who can not refrain from talking over movies or provide undesired running commentary during sports events . Invariably , for next hour their only objective is to regain the ability to breathe normally . The only downside is this ploy only works once . I like to mix about an 1/8 of a teaspoon with two ounces of regular hot sauce for buffalo wings , or add a dab to any taco sauce , however care is required because you can easily reach a point of diminishing returns as the unavoidable numbing of one 's tastebuds makes enjoyment of the food impossible .
4 #### decent sauce , not nearly as spicy as i thought it would be . if you have ever had a straight up naga jolokia and expect this to be as hot , you will be disappointed .
5 #### Low sodium hot sauce that tastes good . Need I say more ? 15 mg of sodium per teaspoon . Has a bit of a kick to it but it is not super duper hot . Really adds a good flavor to my food . And yay for Amazon having it .
5 #### If you like a great , hot , sauce then buy this . If spicy with heat is n't to your liking then do n't buy it .
5 #### I bought this for my Uncle , because he LOVES HOT PEPPERS ! He has a garden and always has a variety of peppers growing . He even started me on my own lil pepper plants . So how do I repay him ? With a bottle of death ... I called he says its good , just " alittle warm . " I think that translates to it gives you hot poop the next day .
5 #### this is a very nice hot sauce . very spicy depending on how much u use and how u use it . unfortunately its mild for me . excellent flavor . i wish it came in a bigger bottle . i highly recommend this product .
5 #### This is one of my favorites in a diversified collection of hot sauces . The influence of the red habeneros is felt and can be tasted . A must buy for the serious user . I really love this sauce ! ! !
5 #### Bought this one by accident thinking it was Dave 's Ultimate Insanity . Used it anyway and was surprised by its taste ! It is a little milder than the Ultimate Insanity but in a pleasing way . It is very flavorful and hot . That is a rare combination . A must buy for any Hot Sauce afficianodo who wants a diversified collection !
4 #### At a cookout , a friend showed up with this stuff . I was the first to take the plunge . I tried to pour just a drop onto a small plate of nachos , but more than I wanted came out - maybe a 1/2 teaspoon . I mixed it around and dug in ; it was good , but packs some serious 5 alarm heat . It is sweetly smoky , but this lasts only for the initial few seconds before the blazing , unquenchable inferno from the pit of hell begins . My eyes watered . Sweat formed on my brow . My nose ran . Brutal ... just brutal . Another friend poured this stuff on his burger like ketchup ( dripping down the side ) , and ate it like it was nothing ! I can only conclude that my friend has a cast iron stomach .
5 #### I really enjoy this sauce . It can kick anything up a few notches . But , if you eat hot sauce straight , DO NOT attempt that with this sauce . You will regret it . I will definitely buy this sauce again . ( That is , if I ever run out . )
5 #### I love Dave 's Ghost Pepper hot sauce . Most of the time when I make chili , I make myself an extremely hot pot of chili which involves adding at at least a dozen serranos and habaneros . The flavor is amazing . But I have to make a second pot for the rest of the family who wo n't eat anything that spicy . When I do not have time , or the local supermarket is short on peppers , Dave 's Insanity Ghost Pepper edition is the next best thing . I add about a dime size drop to my bowl of chili and it brings up the heat right to where I like it , and also adds a very pleasant smokey flavor to boot ! I should say that I like it hot , and most people would use only a drop or two for a bowl of chili of the same size . While this is an extreme hot sauce with a good amount of extract , the taste is quite passable , especially for what it is . Obviously if you eat enough at one time , you will taste extract but in use enough , you will taste extract , but it 's hot enough where you do n't need to use that much as a little bit will heat up your bowl of chili or salsa and add a very pleasant smoky flavor . I highly recommend this . But also , be careful . Use too much and you 'll be sorry . This is a hot sauce where one drop may be enough .
5 #### Wow and Wow . I love heat and this not only provided it , it inspired me to use this as a base and create my own hot sauce . I diced some peppers and garlic , added this BEAST of a sauce , and you know what ? I think the jalapeno and sweet peppers I added only cooled this down . So ...... yeah ! Oh , and although this is common sense I felt the need to remind everyone , WASH YOUR HANDS OR WEAR GLOVES WHEN YOU HANDLE THIS ! ! ! Rubbing this in your eye is the WORST thing in the world . I would rather be maced point blank in the face with my eyes wide open than get this devil sauce in my eye again . I cried a little .
4 #### I ca n't take too much of this at once , perhaps a half - teaspoon with steaks , chicken , etc .. But it adds a world of flavor , waking up both the food and my sinuses .
5 #### I like heat in my food . Every so often , I try to ramp up . A year ago , I tried my first habanero pepper . Boy , did that set a standard ! Forget jalapenos and so on . Then , as I read further about hot peppers , I came across references to ghost pepper . Habaneros are hot ; we grew some habaneros in our garden this past year . As you parse them into dishes in a sensible manner , you get heat and they also support flavor . I just got this product a week ago . I immediately used it with a pasta dish served at my place of employment . Two drops with the pasta -- stirred so that the pepper sauce was spread evenly throughout the dish . Oh , boy ! A nice heat . After finishing my dish , there was a light burn on my lips and at the back of my mouth . The sauce did not obscure the taste of the dish , but actually added an additional element . In addition , my forehead was moist from perspiration and my nose started running . But a small price to pay ! This is a fine addition to my kitchen . I underdid the portion earlier today with an omelet , but I got it right with diced potatoes and onions for dinner . I am still learning , but I think that I will be routinely ordering this in the future as my current bottle is emptied .
5 #### This is a well made hot sauce , my family enjoys hot food and we love trying new ways of spicing things up . Makes a great addition to cooking ( chili , stew , etc .. ) .
1 #### Ok , we love HOT sauces , but this is rediculous ! We thought that like a good hot sauce , this would go good on tacos , nachos etc with some nice heat , but this stuff is stupid hot ! I bought a three pack and regreted it the moment we tried it . This is their standard insanity sauce ( not the hotter one 's that Dave 's sells ) and we can not even tolerate a few dashes on our tacos . I 'm good .
4 #### Someone sitting next to me at a tacqueria doused their taco with this stuff , just like regular piquante , took a bite , and then paid the price for the next twenty minutes . Learning from his misfortune , I took a few tinefulls ( on the tip of a fork ) on my taco . . . not even a full drop as recommended . Just the perfect amount . Two hours later , I still feel a nice lingering heat . As for flavor , I think serranos have a better flavor , but this was n't bad . I definitely would put a very very small on any food where I wanted that perfect amount of " burn " . You also may notice that only people from Texas and California have written reviews . This sauce really is for people who grew up eating Mexican and Southwestern food . I do n't know if a New Yorker or someone from the Mid West would enjoy this stuff .
5 #### This sauce is HOT . It is obviously not made for just plopping on your food , more likely mixing in a large bowl of chili ( or for pranking your friends ) . Although this stuff is RIDICULOUSLY hot , it actually has some taste compared to other sauces of similar potency . I has an interesting smokey flavor and tastes like straight - up jolokia . Doing the toothpick test with this is bearable , but the heat sneaks up on you about 2 - 3 minutes in and it lingers for eternity . Wherever you placed the toothpick will temporarily feel like you actually burned it there . Yeah , its hot ! Please know what you are getting into if you buy this . It is a sauce with extract in it and is VERY hot . The especially sneaky part is that the temperature creeps up on you and takes a few minutes to really kick . This is not a sauce you would put directly on your food like tobasco or something . Be warned !
5 #### To say this stuff is hot is like saying you might get sunburn in the Sahara desert . My family enjoys hot salsa and pico . Many times the Jalapeno peppers are too mild to give us what we want . When that happens I put one teaspoon of Dave 's Sauce into a quart of pico or salsa and we have a nice heat that lets you know it is there . I have recommended this Sauce to my friends and have treated them with home made Salsa fortified with Dave 's Sauce . Everyone has liked the heat and the lack of objectionable flavor from the sauce . Enjoy but be careful at full strength you will burn baby !
5 #### All the other sauces were hot , but we wanted to try this one . We used 9 drops in home made wing sauce ( about a cup of wing sauce ) . This is powerful , using as directed is a must . We started with one drop and worked our way up to 9 drops in a cupfull of wing sauce . 9 drops are perfect for us . This most definitely has a heat and kick of it 's own kind . If you like HOT and I mean standing on the sun hot , this is for you ... but do use it as directed on the bottle and start small .
5 #### I love Hot stuff and this stuff really works . If your friends think they like hot stuff , give them some of this with no warning . It 's fun ...
1 #### I just tried this sauce moments ago . Someone had brought some in to work and it was being passed around . I love hot food , so I figured I might as well try it . I have not explored any exotic peppers or sauces - just the usual jalapeno , habanero , cayenne , and other ordinary peppers . I 'm no expert and would never claim to be , just to be clear . My initial impression of this sauce was " yuck " because it was so bitter and metallic and unpleasant to me . It is hot , yes , but not OMG - I'm - dying hot . Just ... hot , and with a flavor - if you can call it that - I would not want on my food . Also , the heat lasted only about five minutes or so , without me even drinking anything .
5 #### Let me start off this review by saying I love spicy food . If I go to an Asian restaurant , I 'm the guy who asks for spicyness at a level 4/5 or 5/5 . Ok .. now that we have that taken care of : this stuff is HOT . How hot you ask ? If I put a toothpick into it and put it at the tip of my tongue , there is noticeable heat . When it comes time to eat a meal , I prefer to put a drop or so into my individual portion to get really freakin noticeable heat . The stuff is no joke . If you use it like Frank 's Red Hot , you will probably die . 100 percent recommended if you like things HOT .
5 #### Jolokia peppers are rated as the hotest peppers in the world . This is a newer entry in the extreme hot sauce category and must be used with care . I once gave a bottle of a slightly less hot Dave 's Insanity Sauce to a friend who claimed he liked things hot . He used it like he would use his normal hot sauce and almost set himself on fire . This particular sauce should be used a drop at a time in chili or similar foods until you determine your tolerance . Keep a cold drink nearby , and be careful not to burn a hole through your chair .
5 #### this ghost combo sauce hits different areas of the mouth than the red / orange / yellow / chocolate Habanero highly recommended for a spice lovers aresenal for best kick results combine with another multi - Habanero sauce made in costa rica
2 #### This sauce has a nasty bitter flavor . I have no idea where all these people are getting that it tastes good , it does n't . If you use it as a sauce it is just horrible . The heat level is not very high either , do n't let anyone try to fool you on that . Oooh , let 's capitalize on the ghost pepper craze . Whatever . This is weak sauce , end of story . I like the other products from Dave 's but I say give this one a pass .
5 #### Dave 's Ghost Pepper Hot Sauce is the hottest sauce i 've ever had . All that is required to send your mouth on fire is one drop . I just had a dab and my tongue was on fire . This sauce is made with the Hottest Pepper in the World , The Naga Jolokia . It was n't so hot I could n't handle it but i 'm sure if I had more than that dab I 'd be in for more than I could handle . The sensation from the dab lasted a good 15 minutes . The sauce contains the ghost pepper , hot pepper extract , salt , vegetable oil , roasted garlic pulps and acetic acid . It 's a delicious addition to many foods- especially sauces , meat and ethnic foods . Not for people with heart / respiratory problems . Amazon has the best price i 've seen on the sauce so far . So , if you like it spicy and you want to try a sauce with the Ghost Pepper in it , I Highly Recommend it ... If you can handle it , that is .
4 #### My brother is a chiiehead and he warned me about Blair 's being ' hot ' . Blair 's make a whole range of hot sauces , some of which are indeed outrageously high in Scoville units . This one however is quite good and about 6 times hotter than a Jalapeno . This is noticeably hotter than Tabasco but the flavor is similar to Tabasco . So , if you like that venerable standby but want something more , give this a try . Shipping is a significant cost if you are buying a small quantity .
5 #### super tasty hotsauce . not hot all , but the flavor is amazing ! ! !
5 #### I mistaken bought this by accident , thinking that it was Blair 's Mega Death Sauce . I found out Blair 's make a variety of hot sauces . That mistake actually turned out to be a good one because the hot sauce is tasty with some kick . This hot sauce reminds me of Tabasco sauce expect that Blair 's has favor to it . Here are my thoughts : Pros : Tasty with good favors Spiciness is accurately described Cons None at the moment
5 #### The original Deatg Sauce had long been my goto condiment to spice up my life ... put it on everything and FEEL ALIVE !
5 #### The flavor is excellent , probably in my Top 10 of hot sauces . Do n't be fooled by the " Death Sauce " moniker . It 's pretty mild . Even people unaccustomed to hot peppers will find this sauce " medium hot " . True chili heads will find it very mild and more of a flavoring sauce than a hot sauce . Overall , it 's a superb mild hot sauce with unparalleled flavor and I recommend it highly , unless you 're seeking a truly hot hot sauce .
5 #### but also not too hot However it compensates for that with trucktons of chile flavor . Which make it perfect for more delicate foods such as plain yogurt , sushi , cheeses , sorbet , you name it !
4 #### Disclaimer : " hot " is a very subjective term and I am a chilihead . Mildly hot sauce with a strong mexican accent . If you do n't like garlic , chipotle or cilantro , then skip this one .
5 #### I use this for my homemade hotwings . Excellent flavor and just the right amount of heat . Better than any restaurant can do . Will purchase again . Highly recommend this hot sauce
5 #### This sauce was pretty expensive , but it is worth it if you like hot sauce . It is quite hot , but not so bad that you ca n't even enjoy it . I also wanted to support this company since they got hit hard by Hurricane Sandy .
5 #### I received a bottle of Blair 's original Death Sauce ( with Chipotle ) as a gift , and even though it says ' Death Sauce ' , that was not the case . When I spiked my bosses omelet with some of this hot sauce , not only did he not die , he fired me for attempting to poison him . He did remark , however , that the flavor was quite excellent , and proceeded to finish his breakfast with gusto . Crushed that not only my plan had backfired , and that I was now out of a job , I locked myself in my apartment . Assuming I had gotten the dosage wrong , I proceeded to drink the rest of the bottle , hoping to propel myself off this mortal coil with wings of chipotle flame . It did n't work .
5 #### This is not the hottest sauce out there , but it is hot enough to satisfy my desire for something hot . I also have Blair 's After Death and Ultra Death sauces and the Original Death Sauce is by far the best tasting .
5 #### this is really a delicious hot sauce . for me its the perfect balance of spice , flavor and heat . not over powering at all . a few drops goes a LONG way . add a drop or two to your ketchup , mustard , bbq sauce , or whatever you like .
5 #### I must have a dozen or so of these little skulls floating around my house now . Both my wife and I have them on our key chains . And a few are hanging as trophies in our kitchen . Because we love " Blair 's Jalapeno Death Sauce with Tequila . " It 's really yummy , and has tons of flavor . Look at that ingredient list : Fresh jalapeno , shallots , tomatillos , garlic , lime juice , agave tequila . Yum , yum , yum . I could go for some right now ! And because this is only a jalapeno sauce , it really is n't all that spicy . This is not one of those " Death " sauces that you parcel out a toothpick at a time and where a single bottle can last years . ( Although I own quite a few of those as well ! ) You can feel free to pour this sauce on in generous portions . I love this sauce on eggs . On tacos . On pretty much everything . But probably my favorite use is to make some toast with butter , then slather this jalapeno sauce all over it for breakfast . It 's awesome !
3 #### Not very hot , but has got a very original flavour . Very nice when you mix it with other real hot things like Sudden or Beyond Death , it becomes really spicy .
1 #### The sauce is delicious , but the bottle we purchased last here was 3 MONTHS EXPIRED prior to our recieving it ! The taste was yuck and the quality was worse .
5 #### This is quite an interesting hot sauce . I 'm a huge fan of Blair 's hot sauces , of which there are many types - at least a dozen . They are rank - ordered by Blairs in terms of heat level and this is the 2nd mildest sauce in their lineup . The taste is great : a very strong Jalapeno taste with hints of garlic and some other spice(s ) . Unlike some ( many ? ) hot sauces , which are all heat and little or no flavor , this one is all about the strong flavor . You can really , really taste those Jalapenos , and it goes fantastically well on things that benefit from an intense Jalapeno taste - eggs , chips , etc . This sauce is * extremely * mild , and by mild , I mean it has almost no heat . It has turned out to be the perfect sauce to offer family and friends who do n't like hot foods . The heat is so mild in this sauce that it 's really more of a flavoring sauce than a hot sauce . But that 's OK - the flavor is superb ; it stands on its own even without heat . It 's just that if you want some heat , you 'll have to add a real hot sauce to whatever food you 're putting this on .
5 #### By itself , with no spice treatments , I just do n't like Salmon but when an expert in spicing fish takes it on , it ca n't be beat . I do n't believe that anybody does it better than Omaha .
1 #### Mine came in a Jelly Belly bag and despite being listed as very cherry , they were just very sugar . No cherry flavor to speak of , not even when you first bit them . I was very disappointed . Sold by : ShippedFast
5 #### My favorite flavor and very additive . Love them . Wish the price was lower .
3 #### These were ok , but not totally thrilled about them .
4 #### Pretty expensive for just 1 lb . of candy , but okay ...
5 #### These are yummy and worth the wait to get them
2 #### I thought they would be sweet . But instead they were tart . The product description did n't mention this . At least then you would be " expecting " tart flavor .
5 #### They taste grate and the company has good costumer service
5 #### I prepare these baked potatoes in a toaster oven . They are the perfect compliment to a hamburger , steak or chicken entree . Try them . You 'll like them !
5 #### This potato has an exquisite taste . I really enjoy the flavour and texture of the potato . I wish they were bigger . They were delivered completely frozen on dry ice . Will buy again !
5 #### Excellent .. I recommad for elderly so easy take cover off on a plate ... pop into microwave!0
5 #### I purchased these for my sister and her family for the holidays : she told me that she " only put a small pat of butter on the potatoes and they tasted homemade . " She also said that they were the perfect addition to the steaks which I have bought quite a few times for them -- they love the quality . This is a nice present to buy for family members when you are on the other side of the world and can not have a holiday meal in person !
5 #### gobble gobble , crunch crunch , slurp slurp , yummmmmy , my goblens live these , they watch the oven waiting for the bell to go ding , potato piranhas , skins and all gone in minutes oh well time to order more
4 #### I bought these with a bunch of steaks and other stuff using some gift cards I got for my Birthday . I have to say , I actually like them ... * They 're super convenient - freezer , to toaster oven , to table * They 're not something I 'd go out of my way to make myself * They 're not terribly expensive ( if you order them with other stuff to save the shipping ) * They taste pretty good ( it 's a POTATO ! ! ! ) * Follow the directions and they cook up perfectly So what 's not to like ? Everything you make yourself is going to be better , but who has the time to bake potatoes , cut them in half , scoop out the middle , mix it with more stuff , pipe it back into the potato shell , and bake them again ? If you have the time , do n't buy these . But if you 're like me and you want something quick and easy to go with your steak or whatever , these are a good option to have on hand in your freezer .
5 #### These potatoes are pretty good . They can be eaten alone or served with a meal . Really like potatoes and this is an easy choice .
5 #### These potatoes are really very good . My husband and I both * love * them . And way too easy . We will be buying more of these .
3 #### Omaha Steaks 8 ( 5.75 oz . ) Stuffed Baked Potatoes ' '' The Stuffed Baked Potatoes were unimpressive and lacking in flavor . I tasted no bacon or chives . However , they do make an attractive addition to a meal .
3 #### THESE JELLY BEANS ARE OK , BUT THEY DO NOT HAVE A VERY CHERRY FLAVOR . I WAS DISAPPOINTED .
5 #### What more can you ask for ... your favorite flavor of jelly beans and a great brand . my son - in - law loved them .
5 #### These cherry flavored jelly beans were so good , they did n't last a week with my family
5 #### This is the best jelly belly flavor out there ! Jelly Belly always do a good job of coming up with a product that imitates the intended flavor really well . I swear I eat so many of these its not even healthy . Overall this is great for any themed party ( we used them for a USC party ) and you can mix them with another color ( flavor ) to create a unique decoration / party favor
3 #### Have n't opened to give a taste test yet , but such a small bag . Will look for better options next time .
2 #### I have been to the Jelly Belly factory several dozen times over the years . I lived relatively close to the place . I got that bagof jelly beans packaged by some company in Oklahoma . They did not taste like Jelly Belly jelly beans if they were originally Jelly Belly jelly beans they have been either mistreated or they are seconds . They had a very sbduded flavor and the coating was gritty . The only reason they got two stars was delivery time .
5 #### Item exactly as advertised ; would definitely buy from seller again !
5 #### The very cherry were delicious , came freshly packed and tasted like they were just made .
5 #### I ordered the Salmon on Thursday , January 11th and we received it on January 19th . The Salmon was delicious . The wooden box has a nice design and can be used to store items in the future .
1 #### The bag was open . Great product in the past . I work in retail and your business wo n't make it you do n't have employees who truly care . Wo n't be back .
1 #### This bag received with seal open and jelly beans rolling all over the box . Extremely poor packaging plus no food labeling - no ingredient list or manufacturer name / location ( China ? ) . I do n't think the brand name Jelly Belly would allow their product to be packaged this way , but there is no way to know the manufacturer since no labeling came with - or on- the product .
5 #### Expensive but delicious . I used some of it to make a pasta sauce and the rest was used on bagels with slices of tomato and sweet onion . When all I had was a little bit left I mixed it into the cream cheese and spread THAT on a toasted bagel . Yum !
5 #### Sent this to my dad for Father 's Day . He loved it !
5 #### My hubby 's eyes just light up when he sees the box with the " treats " from Amazon ! We both love this flavor . Ca n't wait to try Strawberry Cheesecake ! !
5 #### I 'm a cherry candy lover and when I found these I was super excited ! They came in great condition and tasted great ! No hassle trying to separate them from a big bag of multiple flavors , especially the bags with yucky ones !
5 #### I love cherry flavored candy , and this is good cherry flavor . I will buy this again .
5 #### Sent this well - boxed fisn as a gift . The reciever loved the fish and the box that it was packed in . Win - Win .
5 #### This is really good and much bigger than I thought . We used it for 3 different meals for appetizers with 4 people so this could be used for a party of at least 8 or more for an appetizer . The wooden box is a really nice touch and makes this a great gift item too . I have purchased many smoked salmons off amazon before and I must say this is by far hands down the best I have had to date . I will be buying it again .. Oh one more thing the date code on the box I got was showing it good until 2018 so it 's good to have around for a very long time before you open it .
2 #### Poor quality . We have had a much better product from Washington State . Deceptive packing , very thin fish , did n't like taste , I wo n't buy this again .
3 #### I chose the rating not because of the smoked Salmon . The quality of the salmon is " GREAT " ! I gave it a 3 because the box it came in was not the box shown in the picture . I had intended on using this for gifts , but the crudely made boxes of cheap pine would be an insult to present as a gift . I 've had ordered this product many times before and gave it out when the gift box was made of fine craftsmanship , sanded clear wood , with a hinged top . The price went on on this product , but the quality and workmanship went down . The cheap boxes I received were nailed together on all 4 ends , even had knot holes and splintered wood for covers .
1 #### Growing up on the Oregon coast , you get used to good salmon . This stuff was soggy , oily , and did not taste right at all . I ended up throwing it away after trying it . First time in my life I 've ever tossed salmon ! Disappointing . Wish I could get a refund .
5 #### I bought my husband both orange and cherry - these are his favorites !
1 #### I have eaten Smoked Salmon for sixty years , I love it , but the stink of this stuff was enough to turn your stomach . And , if possible the second package was worse than the first . Both tasted as bad as they smelled . . .
3 #### I like the presentation . I had in mind if I like it to give it as a Christmas gift . But I am glad I have tried it before . Although it came well packed with plenty of juice I found the fish quite on the dry side . I did not expect this at all . The meat had a good flavor but the dryness of the fish was a big desapointement to me . The package arrived well packed shortly after the order was made . Thanks to Amazo fine and efficient mailing service !
5 #### They 're Jelly Bells - what more needs to be said ? Very fresh .
5 #### Very good jelly beans . Arrived promptly with no problems . Will reorder .
5 #### Where I live you can only get these in a big bag of mixed tootsie products around Halloween time -- and there are only about ten in the bag -- I was hooked after eating those ten ! lol .... I searched online and voila ! A whole bag of these yummy fat free treats ! My friend found these at a candy shop by me and brought me a big bag - what a big disappointment ! They were stale . I like the ones online from Amazon -- they came fresh ! I bought them into my job - everyone loved them ... I'm partial to the vanilla !
5 #### Highly recommend .... If you 've had JB 's you know there great .
5 #### hmmm cherry ... Very tasty , prompt to arrive . Ill be buying more once my waistline can afford them .
5 #### Who does n't love a good assortment - came as expected
5 #### my favorite . Will order again . same as the rest of my jelly bean orders .
1 #### The only reason this retailer gets good reviews is because AMAZON will not post bad reviews for this retailer . My last review was denied by AMAZON because they did not like what I had to say .... Overpriced product
5 #### Who doens't love Jelly Bellys ? I love them even more when I can purchase the flavors we like vs getting a container of mixed flavors wher we throw most of them away ! Very Cherry is one of the best " classic " flavors !
5 #### No more digging around in the candy jar looking for the cherry jelly bellies . Now I can be confident I get which flavor I want every time .
3 #### they are good but how the hell do you not toss in some standard chocolate tootsie rolls ? I know , its the fruit flavors ( and vanilla ? ) but man if they could toss a handful of the original chocolate into this mix it would be perfect .
5 #### Got fast Prime delivery on these tasty treats , and it was quicker and simpler than going to a candy store to get these .
5 #### I was mildly concerned about getting these online because old jelly beans are hard as rocks and just not enjoyable . These are fresh with great flavor . Great seller , great deal . Actually more fresh than the ones at my local mall candy store .
5 #### Bought these for a " Pink " theme candy table at an upcoming Bridal Shower . I am sure they will be a hit
3 #### Great chery flavor ! It 's a great product but really wish the price was somewhat cheaper . I would buy more if it was better priced
5 #### Delish ! This is the real Tootsie Roll product . Excellent quality . Nice blend of 4 fruit flavors .
5 #### You ca n't find these in the stores . Great purchase .
5 #### These are my girlfriends favorite candy , so it 's always nice to get the best price I can find . This is my second time ordering them online through Amazon and it wo n't be my last . They were packed nicely and tasted great ! I purchased both time from Shopping eWorld , paid a few cents more but they are well worth it .
5 #### What is there not to like . They come in a package that fits my Jelly bean jar . The cherry Jelly Belly beans taste like cherry and are always dependably perfect . So , pick a flavor and go for it . A nice treat
5 #### Wow very fast delivery . Lots of different flavored . Soft and chewy . Will order again .
5 #### I will sure be getting more of these . They are a chewy bit of pure goodness . LOVE THEM
3 #### Fresh , decent amount , even distribution for the most part ( slight skew toward vanilla ) If you have had these before , then buy them here . If you have never tried these you will want to . Kids will love these and adults will get a low cal satisfaction for that sweet tooth . The sweet fruity flavor will make you wonder why you ever bothered with those could be chocolate normal tootsie rolls Update : I recently brought these again 6/16 and i was delivered a half bag of tootsie rolls fruit . Definitely not 3 pounds 2 1/4 lbs and it came without a label . Was still tasty but , bitter sweet since you know you got ripped off on the amount you were supposed to get ! Lowering a star
5 #### I love Tootsie Rolls but I really love these Assorted Fruit ones ! I can only find the small bags here locally , and since we like to keep them in a candy dish , we decided to buy this 3 lb bag . I do n't tell , but I do pick through and find the cherry and orange ones first , and then the lemon and lime next , the vanilla is my least favorite so i just hand those to the kids ! Will definitely purchase these or the 5 lb bag again .
5 #### love these flavors My grand kids just love the taste Very good love love love the
5 #### Love these little treats , and three pounds of them is like finding buried treasure .
5 #### My husband was telling me he loved these when he was a kid so I found them here and grabbed a bag . 3 pounds is definitely a big bag but it 's taking him a while to get through them at least ! I did n't really like that the bag had an expiration date sticker on it which expired and a new sticker was literally placed directly on top of the expired one . It seemed a little sketchy but they tasted fine .
5 #### If you like chewy candies flavored like fruit .. this is it !
5 #### Love these .... fresh , tasty , and nice alternative to other candy chews because of the addition of the vanilla ... my favorite .... next to original chocolate .
5 #### Delicious and also very gone . I would have shared , but there were only 3 pounds .
5 #### As a teacher , these are great incentives to get students motivated in returning necessary work , following rules , doing great work , etc . As this particular supply dwindles , more will be ordered .
5 #### These Tootsie Rolls Assorted Fruit Rolls are very good . They seem to be fresh & are n't hard like others I 've ordered from other places have been . Thank you .
5 #### They were delivered in 2 days , they were fresh , the bags were n't torn . Everything was as it should be . They 're even better than the original Tootsies . I put them in a canister and up high so I would n't be eating them nonstop . I actually bought those for my husband , since he had his stroke he has a big sweet tooth . I can monitor how much he eats of these . I would probably order them again . A great idea for Easter .
5 #### I did n't weigh it , but it seems like the full 3 pounds , and the candy arrived quickly . It 's also super soft and fresh , probably softer than when I buy it locally .
5 #### I have n't had these since I was young . Careful , they are wonderfully delicious . Great party favor add on , and a bit different from the usual .
5 #### We got these for our god - daughter in college and she and her friends enjoyed them ! The assorted fruit flavors are a treat !
5 #### These are my son 's favorites , and it 's hard to find them in grocery stores around us . He just got a new job and moved to a new city , so this was a great " good luck in your new city " present for him .
5 #### These are possiblythe best snacks for the kids next door that come to visit ! The are neat and easy to treat with !
5 #### One thing that makes me a bit leary about purchasing candy online is whether it will be fresh or not ... These tootsie rolls are definately fresh and do not taste any bit stale or hardened . If you 've never had fruit flavored tootsie rolls before I 'd say the closest comparison is Starburst with the texture of a fresh / chocolate flavored tootsie roll . I used them to fill up my candy jar at work - these did not last long .
5 #### I often purchase candy for the office candy bowl , and these are a hit ! I remember eating these and Frooties when I was younger , along with Smarties and Pixy Stix ( two other hits in the office ! ) . I found them on Amazon cheaper than the local candy store PLUS free shipping
5 #### I love candy and flavored Tootsie rolls are some of my favorite . If you like candy I do n't really see how you can not like these . But in the end candy likes are just a personal preference . I prefer Tootsie rolls and candies like that so I 'm good with it . And price wise compared to in stores , you ca n't beat the prices on Amazon . Shipping is the only thing that you have to look out for or otherwise you will loose whatever saving you get .
5 #### Been a long time since I had a fresh tootsie roll - these are GREAT ! !
5 #### I sent this as a gift and the review from my sister was very good . She and her family and all the kids loved it . She said it was sweet but baked very and tasted so good . So maybe I should have sent it to me .
5 #### Saw it being made on the tv looked good so found it on amazon and ordered it for Christmas.was absolutely delicious will order again .
5 #### Not much to say about O & H Danish Kringles , Pecan and Raspberry flavors are the bomb . We have enjoyed them in the past too .
1 #### These cookies taste OK . You 're not going to mistake them for regular cookies , but they 're good enough . They 're about the size of a quarter . My type 2 diabetes is well controlled and I rarely have numbers over 130 anymore even after a meal . I ate just six of these cookies and my count shot up to 200 ! I could have eaten a couple of much larger and tastier " normal " cookies and not had a reading that high . So , if you want to try these , do n't buy a large supply until you are sure they wo n't do the same thing to you .
1 #### I hated the taste and consistcy of these cookies . Not very good at all . I tried a variety of josephs brand sugar free cookies and did not like any of them .
5 #### Just because I sent an order of these jelly beans to my oldest son in Roswell , Georgia . He travels a lot and enjoys a snack while he is driving and he loves licorice jelly beans . This would make a nice gift for any special person in your life .
5 #### Hey good enough for President Reagan its good for me love the licorice got this for my daughter who has a soy allergy soy is in EVERYTHING including every chocolate item
5 #### Only negative is that the bag is empty now . They are just TOO YUMMY , AND , I ai n't never had too much licorice ( or too much fun ) . Great stuff .
5 #### These were way too delicious ! I ate too many and as my daughter would say , " they called to me " !
4 #### THESE ARE QUITE GOOD . NOT TOO STRONG , BUT A LITTLE BITE .
5 #### Nice to have a 2 lbs . size . What 's not to like about jelly belly ?
3 #### Not that pleased with the package of licorce , seems to go stale swiftly . I believe the Scottish one are better and softer . To sugary .
5 #### Son 's , Grandson 's , Mother - in- Law , gobble these down , before I get at least one or two . Fair pricing , fast delivery . Needless to say I 'm a repeat customer .
5 #### Yummy for my Tummy . They 're the Real Deal Licorice I grew up on . Highly recommend .
5 #### tastes exactly like a licorice jelly bean should ! love these !
5 #### I love licorice jelly beans and the Jelly Belly brand is just about the best . Their texture is the best when it comes to jelly beans . They have a pleasantly strong and genuine licorice flavor . If you do n't know , Licorice flavor remains in the top 5 of Jelly Belly flavors . You either love or hate them .
1 #### I LOVE BLACK JELLY B .THIS WORST PURCHASE ON AMAZON.THEY WERE LIKE''LITTLE STONE PEBBLES ''
5 #### I have celiac but love black licorice . These taste great and are the only way I can get a great black licorice
3 #### Not a pure licorice flavor , more like licorice and spice , but they are n't bad .
5 #### Wow , Jelly Belly licorice , my favorites , in a large supply for a good price . The real deal , fresh and yummie . I have a candy dispenser and this works great .
5 #### I love licorice jelly beans and the Jelly Belly brand is just about the best . They have the same great texture that I 've come to expect from Jelly Belly and they have a pleasantly strong and genuine licorice flavor . Even though they contain a lot of sugar ( as do most jelly beans ) , because each jelly bean is so small , a single jelly bean contains just four calories . A list of ingredients follows : sugar , corn syrup , modified food starch , contains 2 % or less of the following : natural and artificial flavors , color added , Blue 2 Lake , Yellow 6 Lake , beeswax , carnauba wax , confectioner 's glaze .
1 #### Although it has been some time since I last had Jelly Belly beans , these were not as I remember them from the time I bought some at the plant in Fairfield , CALIFORNIA . There was no Jelly Belly logo on them so I will not be ordering them again .
5 #### What can I say ? Black jelly beans are the best ! Any flavors from this manufacturer rocks for those jelly bean lovers !
5 #### These are treats for my husband and he loves them ! Have ordered twice and both times they 've been fresh and enjoyable .
5 #### You ca n't beat the flavor of Jelly Belly jelly beans ... excellent taste and flavor :)
5 #### " Not a sticky as the bigger ones , PopGene . But they taste better . "
5 #### Why did I buy 2 POUNDS of black licorice Jelly Bellys ? I 'm not even sure . They are 100 % delicious , as any other Jelly Belly is . These arrived quickly , and were fresh ! Now , I must go , to work on finishing these off ...
5 #### everyone love Jelly Belly now my husband does n't need to search for the black ones
2 #### Jelly beans were hard and lacked true licorice flavor . More bean than jelly if that makes sense . Seemed like there 's too much of the hard outer coating not enough of the soft center .
5 #### They are very very good . We are enjoying them .
5 #### I bought these for my wife ( 2 pounds ) ... she loves jelly bellys and especially the black ones - so I got her some black ones ....
5 #### These are good . Got them for a friend that searches for black when a regular assortment is presented to her .
4 #### Packed in box only no plastic bag or anything to keep sanitary
2 #### Does n't have the true licorice taste . I was disappointed . I wo n't order again .
5 #### These licorice jelly beans are the best . They were super fresh with super licorice taste . Even though they cost a bit more , they are so worth it if you 're looking for really great flavor . They ca n't be beat ! !
5 #### Happy with the price and taste or is it taste and price : ) Sent as a gift to a black jelly bean lover !
5 #### My daughters got me hooked on Jelly Belly after they took the factory tour in Fairfield , California . I 've driven past their factory many times and never had time to take the tour . But I did stop a few times just long enough to buy the licorice jelly beans in bulk - taste so good I eat them in moderation as a snack while watching my evening movie . And now that I moved to Texas I buy them via Amazon .
5 #### My husband loves licorice and especially this product , which he says is very flavorful . I am not a fan of licorice , but , I will continue to purchase this item for him .
5 #### These are the real deal . I ca n't find them locally , so this is a convenient way to get our favorites .
5 #### I was a little hesitant to buy this . Glad I did ; I love this vanilla product . From hot cereal and smoothies , to coffee and tea and hot chocolate , to baked goods and fresh fruit ... well , just about anything that could benefit from a little sweet richness without any alcohol . Now I keep a jar of it right next to the salt and pepper , I use it so often . It is n't fresh vanilla bean , but a close second . And it does n't drip ! :)
5 #### My daughter and I have Celiac Disease and needed a gluten - free vanilla with great flavor . This fit the bill for both . The flavor is excellent and can be used with all the receipes we make . It lasts about as long as the other quality vanilla 's and has a rich flavor that really enhances the resulting cake , cookie , candy , etc . I would n't go back to using any other brand . I 'm very pleased with the product .
1 #### Although this product has " I hate it " when you check one star , I do not hate it . However , it 's first ingredient is MALTODEXTRIN . So many people just assume the only ingredient is as listed on the label heading . Always best to check for additives ... " Maltodextrin can cause spikes in your blood sugar because it has a high glycemic index . You may want to avoid maltodextrin if you have diabetes or insulin resistance . " Obtained from Healthline.com . Healthline.com also indicates that the maltodextrine additive is considered safe by FDA ... It 's a shame they put this stuff in it because this is a good company and otherwise this product would be perfect ... If you are not sensitive to glycemic spikes , go for it !
5 #### Love this stuff - a great alternative to liquid vanilla extract for bakers . Delicious and high quality !
5 #### I make my own chia latte mix and I have started adding this too it . makes it a bit creamier and adds a wonderful vanilla flavor to the drink .
4 #### I like this powdered vanilla . It was used in my homemade hot chocolate mix I made as gifts for the holidays . Will try some in my baking soon .
3 #### this is not the vanilla powder like at SB .
5 #### We have determined that this is the best quality of powdered vanilla we have ever used . It is excellent in coffee , frappes , and foods of all types . It is also a good value !
5 #### I like this product for my smoothies and other stuff that I have used it with . I will buy more this product .
5 #### Perfect for making my mocha drink mixes . I am a repeat buyer .
3 #### I like this vanilla powder , but I wish the flavor was stronger . I use it in my home made coffee creamer as well as sprinkling on cookies and other baked items . It does not contain sugar , which is a plus for me . It just gives a mild vanilla flavor to whatever we use it on . I would buy again , but only because I have n't found something better .... yet .
5 #### I use this in my homemade mocha mix which is way cheaper than buying a mocha and I can use quality ingredients and have control over the sugars . I am sure I will think of other uses for this product in the future .
5 #### This was a gift for my mother , and she really liked it .
5 #### This powder is awesome . I paid too much though . One of those things where I was n't paying attention and got ripped off by the shipping . I wo n't do that again but I will continue to purchase this powder .
5 #### I purchased this to make my own shortbread cookies in a jar and give them away for the holidays . I have to admit , I was neverous about using a powdered vanilla and even more neverous about how my gift jars would turn out with this product . I put my jars together , test baked and they turned out perfect . I ca n't tell you if this product flavor weakens with time as it is a concern when I am making cookies or brownies in a jar for gifts .
5 #### Excellent product . I have used it for years and find the vanilla flavor is far better that the liquid form .
5 #### This is absolutely the best tasting vanilla powder available . It is delicious in coffee . I 'm addicted ! I just wish I could get it in larger containers because it is very expensive to keep buying in these small bottles . I 've checked the Nielsen - Massey website , and they do n't seem to sell it in larger sizes . Time to get a petition going for them to sell larger bottles of this stuff ! :-)
5 #### my go to when making my special cookies . people just love the flavors .
5 #### I love putting this in things . Tea , milk , sprinkled on toast , mixed into pudding , endless endless uses !
5 #### Excellent flavor for coffee , I wish they made it available in a bigger size .
1 #### This is maltodextrin powder . Really disappointed , thought it was vanilla powder
5 #### This is really the best Vanilla powder out there :)
5 #### Nielsen - Massey Vanilla powder is wonderful . Love it . Thanks a mil
3 #### The liquid tastes better . I did not like the weird flavor of this ... I tried to use this in french toast . Did not have a strong enough vanilla flavor . I would not purchase this again .
5 #### great color and taste - used for a batch of vegan matcha brownies and it tasted amazing !
5 #### I really was skeptical about this product when I first purchased it . After ordering it several times already I am convinced that this is a great product . I have always used natural vanilla extracts but this powder comes mighty close to realizing the flavor of vanilla beans .
5 #### You can use this in so many fashions -- google it :) I use it in recipes that call for vanilla extract , but also add it to sugar for coffee . It 's delicious ! ! !
1 #### Very expensive and no flavor what so ever . Also clumps up when used in coffee . Amazon refunded my money , do n't bother . I bought much better vanilla powder at Sprouts Market from the spice bins .
5 #### really like this vanilla powder . The taste is a little more subtle but lovely . I like using it in raw foods and smoothies . I 've gotten it twice now and the second time I 'm even more pleased than the first .
4 #### Good flavor but it takes a lot to give that vanilla taste I love . We do use it in our breakfast shakes .
5 #### Best Vanilla Powder on the market ! Great for adding to my hot chocolate mix recipe . Makes excellent whipped cream . Rich & Delicious .
5 #### A nice addition to my spice cabinet . I use it in my cereal , along with cinnamon , in the mornings . I 'm sure there are many other uses I could find , but this works for me . Glad I discovered it ! Try it , I 'm sure you like it !
3 #### This still has a slight chemical taste but is by far the best powdered vanilla on the market . Most of them have a tiny bit of vanilla and a ton of sugar . This is just vanilla . It tastes like the beans are old when this is made , but considering the lack of product choice , it 's your best bet .
5 #### This is the third time I 've purchased this product and we love it in hot cocoa , cappuccino , smoothies . Nice product and great taste .
5 #### The flavor is pure and clean , with enough subtlety and depth to be engaging . And the powder form has more possibilities than alcohol extracts . Great in plain yogurt , and sprinkled on toast with a little olive oil and sugar .
1 #### very deceptive . not what I wanted when I was thinking of powdered vanilla . Is is that difficult to be honest ? sigh ........
1 #### This is basically misleading advertising . They label it pure , but have a genetically modified ingredient within . Maltodextrin is genetically modified corn sugar . GMO corn is one of the worst things you can put into your body according to my research , along with Canola Oil(no matter how they claim it 's healthy ) , Aspartame , high fructose corn syrum , and other hydrogenated oils . Shame on them for labeling this " Pure " . You got my $ 10 , but I will never buy their products again
5 #### The problem with most vanillas is that you can taste the alcohol that is used to leach out the flavor . Not with this . It 's just pure vanilla flavor .
5 #### The problem with most vanilla 's is that you can taste the alcohol used to leach out the flavor . With this you do n't have that problem . Just pure vanilla flavor .
5 #### An all time favorite of mine that I could not find in any of the local stores . When you just have to have a little sweet goodness in your day . Well worth risking a diabetic coma over .
5 #### Everyone has a secret pleasure and mine are these wonderful red filled raspberry candies . I dole them out sparingly throughout the holidays .
1 #### Maybe it 's a taste you have to grow up with , but it was n't one that I wanted to get used to .
5 #### so good for my casseroles , paella and so much more
5 #### Excellent quality . Excellent price . Exactly as described . Highly recommended !
5 #### This is always a top notch product . Been buying it for years .
3 #### the taste was a little weak compared to other sausage like this . Might have a spice that messes with my head like KFC fries , I 'll need to try it again .
3 #### Meh . I have had many , many brands of chorizo and this was not the best . It had a decent flavor but the ones I got were very old and I questioned their age . I had mold growing on it . I would not buy again or recommend to friends .
5 #### I love the Mild Palacio Chorizo . W use to buy it from La Tienda but lately Amazon is our primary place to buy them . This type of chorizo can be eaten " raw " in tapas ( note that is a cured product ) , or it can be used in a variety of dishes , just use a bit of imagination . Finally , it is excellent to make a sandwich with a good crusty bread with manchego cheese !
5 #### Excellent , great flavor with the just the right spice . I use with eggs or in seafood dishes like Paella
5 #### A little different flavor than soy sauce , though it obviously has a soy sauce base . Very good in soups , stews and on meats .
5 #### Received Maggi seasoning on time . First time I have tried this and I love it . Has more flavor than soy sauce which I 'll never go back to . Plan on buying more of Maggi !
1 #### Attention - Attention - Attention Since my last review I ordered this item again . Lo and behold : It has ONLY 100ml instead of 800ml and you have to pay Sh&H. It is a page mistake . So please be careful when ordering . Getting a refund for returning and free Sh&H is NOT accepted . Fortunately amazon.com was responsible enough to credit my account for sending and advertising the wrong size of this merchandise . ( I wish they would correct this page ... ) ----------------------------------------------------- Various MAGGI seasonings are offered in groceries . If you choose free super saver shipping you find this size . Unfortunately the content is NOT mentioned . Well , it contains 800ml fyi . Compared with the 1Lt size ( and price plus SH&H ) you do much better to order this one . Being from Europe we are used to MAGGI products in any form and size and are happy to get it at this price from Amazon . Thank you !
5 #### My order arrived in good time & packaged well , I had been shopping for Christmas candy & found the perfect candy , I remember my sisters & friends grew up with this special candy , we never called it chocolate filled straws though ! ! ! ( just hard candy , lol ) the order arrived perfectly not one broken ! ! wished they added more choc .. but each piece had their own favor & very good , brought back memories of when we would all look forward to receiving this candy for Christmas . So good , ! ! ! so glad I was able to find this on Amazon , bought this as gift / memories for friends . tku Trish :o)
1 #### " Packaging is bad , small bag of candy in a too big box , candy is mostly broken , was not a gift bag , just a plastic bag , probably will not buy from again , received a day later than Amazon intended , was supposed to be delivered yesterday , received today . Edited to add that candy does taste good though . "
1 #### They are horrible , no chocolate in the candy and they came stuck together . The flavors are horrible had to throw them out . Waste of money
1 #### This is like chewing on plastic ! There was no flavor at all , And deffinately NO CHERRY flavor either ! I will not buy this again !
3 #### Flavor was OK . Not sure I 'd put them in the gourmet gumball category , but what gumball really is gourmet ? I 'd take good ole Double Bubble over these any day .
4 #### I do n't know why , but for some reason , this flavor is hard for me to find . So I bought a huge box full , gave some away to a sister that also loves these . I love the flavor and the bubblegum center .
5 #### yum I have n't had these for years , they were actually fresh and not old blow pops like some I have bought before . good price too
3 #### We were a little disappointed with this flavor . Not as good as we expected them to be . Will stick with the 100 assorted flavors from now on .
5 #### Omg ! THESE are the blue raspberry flavor that I have been looking for !
5 #### These are not the easiest to find locally . In fact , they seem to only be abundant around Halloween . So , if you like these and have already eaten all your kids ' razzberry blow pops - get a case for your personal stash . Ships fresh and ready to consume . Warning - your tongue will be blue / black for quite awhile after having one of these . Oh , color only - no harm .
5 #### The Charms Blue Razzberry Blow Pops are my very favorite Charms product . I buy many different Charms products from Amazon and they are always fresh and in great shape . ( not all broken ) These are very hard to find in the stores in my area , they only carry a small bag with 8 - 10 pops in each bag , so I also consider these a bargain . Thank you Amazon for carrying such awesome products .
4 #### Great flavor and turns your mouth and lips blue , who does n't love that ! ! !
5 #### Kids loved these , they were devoured in several days . They were a birthday gift for my oldest son . everyone loved them .
5 #### Delicious ! These were used as a candy table for my child 's Frozen theme birthday . It was a hit ! Great price ! Arrived perfectly packaged .
3 #### It tasted different from the ones I bought from Tootsie Roll !
2 #### Got here on time . Great flavor . But , when it was time to bite and chew the gum , it was too hard to chew . Gum is stale .
5 #### No broken or completely crushed suckers , did n't taste old like they 've been in a warehouse for years . Would buy again .
4 #### It is a good green tea . 4 stars since I did n't catch jasmine in it .
5 #### This is the only green tea I have tried from Harney and Sons , and I think it is top notch for the price . The jasmine is right where it should be without totally covering up the green tea flavors . Very nice .
4 #### I love jasmine tea and would buy this again . I usually go for jasmine pearl but taste wise I see no difference
4 #### I 'm a fan of Harney and Sons tea . Everything I get from them is great quality . I love to visit my local tea shop and purchase the fancy loose teas but I know that Harney and Sons is a great go - to , widely available brand . This Jasmine tea is light and fragrant . I 'm not a fan of green tea at all and most Jasmine teas are green tea . This is a pouchong tea which is a bit on the brown side and not such a harsh green tea flavor . It 's lovely . The tin does say to brew this with boiling water - do n't do that . You 'll just end up with bitter and undrinkable tea . You have to brew this like a green tea at about 180 * for about 2 minutes . You 'll have to figure out exactly how long of a steep time you prefer . This is most certainly a tea I will continue to keep on hand .
5 #### Love this coffee . There 's a nice strong taste to it wo unsettling my stomach . Certain name brands do that to me , but this one does nt . Flavor is good , and I made a coffee jello w it , you know one sweet layer dark , one sweet layer w cream . It was refreshing , and delish ! ! ! :)
5 #### Bought for my husband . He loves it . Great price too
5 #### Delicious ! I like strong good flavour & this hits the spot .
5 #### Great coffee ! ! ! ! As my German grandfather used to say " Puts hair on your chest " however my German Grandma said it " Took the hair off her chest " .
5 #### I bought 4 cans ! I had this coffee years ago and never forgot THAT cup of Joe . This is a thick and tasty coffee . I put all coffee into a coffee grinder and make it powdery , like expresso grounds . More surface area means more flavor .
5 #### This ends my lifetime search for great tasting coffee . Everyone I 've served it to has become a convert . My husband who is not a coffee drinker loves the smell .
1 #### We did NOT like the flavor of this coffee . It just tasted off to me . Expensive lesson learned . I threw it in the compost . Save your money .
3 #### You definitely have to be into a chicory taste to enjoy this coffee . It 's fine as an alternative cup , but not an every day coffee for me .
4 #### This was in my list of suggested items so I figured I 'd try it . Got ta say , it 's actually pretty good out of either a Vietnamese coffee phin or a french press . I 'm considering running this through my grinder just to see how it does out of an espresso machine . The can is kinda nice too . I 'll probably use it for holding nuts and bolts later .
4 #### Tastes like it 's 100 % coffee , which is OK since I like coffee ... but there 's another brand that tastes more of roast chicory , which I also like !
5 #### The Great Coffee recipe unique to Cafe Du Monde ... try it . Tip : mix some with you regular morning brew for a bit of New Orleans !
3 #### Not much to review here ; this tastes like any generic coffee I could randomly buy at a big grocery store . There is another brand of New Orleans - style coffee and chickory on Amazon that I tried and enjoyed much more .
5 #### I 'm , a tea drinker who drink , maybe , three cups of coffee during the year . Obviously , this is not habitual bleary - eyed morning Joe for me . At three cups a year , I want the coffee to be outstanding and , this suits my taste .
5 #### It tastes pretty good , if you like darker coffee with more flavor . The Chicory helps enhance the flavor of the coffee and provides some proven health benefits . Its not as harsh as your traditional French Coffee . More or less a Medium blend .
5 #### I live the chicory in the coffee . Nice cup nestolgia .
5 #### Delicious coffee . If you like stronger good tasting coffee than this is perfect .
2 #### Well . I always buy to drink Vietnamese ice coffee . This is too light . Lighter than regular ice coffee . Coffee powder sank . Is it because the powder is too small ? And also it took so long to delivery .
2 #### i liked the chicory flavor in this coffee.it was my 1st time drinking it , , , the cans empty in like 6 days lol ( the cans are small).liked the coffee but the out date on mine was july 2018 , , , , but this can was really dry , , not like other coffee when you open them.im a caffine freak,,i love my coffee 's cappachino 's and latte 's .. maybe i just got a bad can ? @ any rate i wo n't be buying this brand again,,if i did n't know better this stuff looks like it was roasted and swept up off the floor , , , , dissapointed for a 1st timer to say the least ...............................
5 #### A little stronger than I remembered , but good flavor .
2 #### I was disappointed . I had coffee in New Orleans & I loved it . This is not the same as I remembered .
5 #### Good strong coffee . Good departure from the regular coffee . If your not careful you can make it too strong .
5 #### Always wanted to try this , got it cheaper here than at the store I saw it at . Very roasty and dark / earthy / smokey . Great with plenty of sweetener and 2 % or whole milk . Probably would be heavenly with half / half or condensed !
5 #### So good ! And being half chicory , this coffee is n't nearly as acidic as the stuff I used to drink . I take it with vanilla soy milk -- it 's just SO good !
5 #### It took some getting use to , but now I love the Coffee and Chicory .
5 #### My favorite coffee , and I just saw Brunch at Bobby Flay 's and learned a new recipe for this . I fell in love with this when in New Orleans and always go out of my way to buy French Market coffee when I come back to the U.S.
5 #### Been to New Orleans and loved the charming Cafe Du Monde . So happy found their coffee online ! It is strong and I can just add more hot water if I want it more mild . The package tin is cute and the lid sit tightly as well .
5 #### I read about the health benefits of Chicory root , which is supposed to be good for the digestive flora , and generally giving the immune system a boost . But , I did n't want to give up my morning coffee / cafeine entirely . I bought this from Amazon because I have not been able to find Chicory in any local grocery or specialty food stores . I did not expecting that it would taste nearly as good as my freshly ground coffee . I can honestly say that it is not bad at all , and a little goes a very long way ! I am finding that I only need to use a couple of tablespoons per 12 cup pot of coffee . I wish that they just sold the chicory separately , so I could decide what proportion of coffee to use . Also , I had a little trouble opening the lid using a smooth edge can opener . I will definitely order again .
4 #### I really enjoy chicory and this tastes very good . It has a smooth flavor that is not too strong and I use it to make a cold brew I drink black throughout the day .
3 #### It was just a little too strong for me . I gave it to someone at work . Smelled GREAT though
5 #### So yummy and perfect . Except the last order I made had to be canceled because somehow Amazon ran out and could n't get more .
5 #### This is such good and unusual coffee . Everyone I have made it for , loves it .
5 #### my favorite coffee bar none ... of course , I 'm somewhat biased as I live in New Orleans !
5 #### So so good . I did , however , find it for $ 2 cheaper in my grocery store . So , I 'm taking it off my subscribe & save so I can save more . This coffee is so smooth and does really well if you 're into cold brewing as well . I love it . It 's all I will drink now .
5 #### Best coffee in the world ! ! ! ! On the Cafe Du Monde website , the Vice President of the company is on a youtube video . He says that you have to acquire a taste for it but once you do , you will love it . After my first cup , I loved it . Fabulous coffee and I do drink it as suggested with cream and sugar . Actually , I use a coffee creamer . I love the deep rich robust taste and will always love it alone or with beignets . Mardi Gras is around the corner so time for me to make Cafe Du Monde coffee and beignets .
5 #### Not a coffee expert , but this is my favorite
5 #### I LOVE this coffee . I ca n't get enough of this sweet and smokey roast . It is strong and deep without being burnt flavored . Must TRY if you are a true coffee lover .
5 #### LOVE LOVE LOVE Cafe du Monde coffee ever since my honeymoon in New Orleans ! We make it on the weekends . Be sure to make it correctly : fill your coffee cup halfway with milk , add some sugar , microwave 30 seconds , stir , then add the coffee . It gets a little bit of milk foam on the surface ! Sooooo good !
1 #### I am from New Orleans but currently live out of state . I love the coffee with chicory they serve at the Cafe Du Monde . I recently purchased a 3 can pack . It 's HORRIBLE . It taste burnt and bitter . I ca n't get through the first can . Just so you all know ... I buy and enjoy Community Cofee with chicory which is another local favorite . ... I also buy the chicory itself from Community Coffee which can be bought here on Amazon and add it to whatever coffee I am brewing . I mention this to merely point out I LOVE COFFEE AND CHICORY . I am awaiting delivery of French Market coffee with chicory now . ( which I have never tried . ) I simply ca n't recommend this to anyone . I know everyone tastes are different but this taste nothing like what they serve .
3 #### It 's okay coffee , nothing to jump up and down over .
5 #### I lived in New Orleans for many years . This coffee is just what I need in the mornings .
4 #### I was hoping this coffee had a sweetness to it ...... however , it is sort of on the bitter side . A darker roast , I would say . It 's okay ..... but , I doubt I would buy it again .
5 #### Great to be able to buy 8 cans of my favorite chicory ! Thank you ....
5 #### I have six different types of Cajun coffee in my kitchen cabinet and this is my favorite . Strong , slightly bitter and creamy all at the same time . Buy this AND buy the Beignet mix then close your eyes , eat , drink and take a quick trip to NOLA .
5 #### I love this coffee . I mixed this coffee with my favorite brand of Colombian coffee so I can stretch it out and was happy with the results ( 5 tablespoons of my regular coffee to 3 tablespoons of Cafe Du Monde with 10 cups water ) . It took the bitterness out of my coffee and made my homemade latte taste like coffee shop quality . I paid more at my local store for this coffee so in the future I will probably buy this coffee here .
5 #### I actually think the coffee is just okay . However - the can is AWESOME ! Which I use to make Boston Brown Bread !
3 #### Coffee is OK . French Market Coffee with chicory is better
4 #### Good coffee and plenty strong enough to wake you up in the morning . Has a pleasing taste , but it 's a little pricey for what you get .
5 #### Fabulous coffee ! I can relive visits to the Cafe Du Monde with every cup . They also make a beignet mix to make the adventure complete . With a little imagination you 'll be hanging out in Old New Orleans ( N'awlins to the locals ) ...
1 #### I tried this coffee today . as soon as i opened the can i noticed there is not even a bit of coffee aroma .. i guess its full of chicory and very less coffee . i have tasted lot of coffee and chicory coffee but this one tastes awful . i have to throw this can now . price is really high for this kind of coffee . waste of money .
1 #### Worst coffee ever . This stuff tastes like some cheap beans were roasted to ashes and the ashes mixed with some spice to cover up the burnt flavor . I ca n't imagine any coffee lover liking this . The best use for this is fertilizing the garden .
3 #### For a New Orleans - themed party , it 's what I expected but not a great tasting coffee .
5 #### I 'd rather drink this than fancy overpriced Starbucks . If you have n't tried , you owe it to yourself .
5 #### Just looked at my cup thinking , wow this coffee tastes good , then realized it was from my first can of Cafe Du Monde this morning . WOW . Remarkably good flavor , rich deep whole satisfying coffee .
4 #### The beans were well filled in a good package . I only cooked them once and they were good in the bean soup that I made .
5 #### Good quality beans that taste great . The bag is the right size to cook one pot of beans . The bag is nice looking enough to leave out on my counter .
5 #### tasty .. somewhat bold . To tone it down , I add a 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom to coffee basket before brewing . If you do n't have cardamom , use cinnamon . Once brewed , add milk & some sugar to taste . It 's a wonderful delight rich drink .
3 #### It 's ok- I would like more chickory in it .
2 #### There are several brands of coffee and chicory . If you like the stuff , as I do , you 'll probably have a favorite . I like this least of those I 've tasted . I like CDM better , and I like French Market the best . Your mileage will vary .
5 #### Love this coffee . Bought some while in Louisiana a few years ago and was happy to find it to order on Amazon for a great price .
3 #### Pleasant coffee but French Market is better ( stronger and you can use less ) .
5 #### Very good and tasty beans . I 'd buy em again .
5 #### First time making navy beans . I made a 4 bean white chili and these tasted fresh and went well in the chili .
3 #### It 's OK but expensive for what it is . Of course , opinions on coffee do vary and mine is just one opinion .
5 #### Makes me almost feel like I 'm back in N'alwins sitting at Cafe Du Mode .
3 #### I 've been drinking Cafe Du Monde coffee and chicory blend for years and ordered it through Amazon 's Subscribe & Save program . They do n't have a lot to choose from with chicory , and the bulk purchase of Community Coffee and Chicory medium roast ( my favorite ) is pricey . After I finish off the two Cafe Du Monde cans , I 'll return to Community even if I have to buy it in the grocery store . Taste in coffee is important .
5 #### Had been several years since I drank any chicory coffee . It was better than I remember . Will most likely order more .
5 #### I used to travel to New Orleans just about every week and was always offered coffee with chickory . I got used to it after a few years and got to where regular coffee seemed weak . Then I quit traveling to New Orleans and started drinking coffee without chickory . I was just fine , until few weeks ago we went to New Orleans and I stopped at the cafe Du Monde for coffee . Got back on the chickory " kick " once again and brought home a can of their chickory flavored coffee . We personally like he taste and my wife thinks it is too strong . It is very good coffee and if one is looking for an instant dramatic change to what they have been drinking they should sip on a few cups of this coffee . You will certainly noticed instantly the change and you might even prefer it over the regular coffee .
5 #### This has been my favorite coffee since 1981 . I drank it by the pot when I was a student in New Orleans . Cafe au lait is awesome made with whole milk and sugar , but it 's fattening , so I rarely have it . But that 's ok if you like black coffee , which I do . Then Cafe Du Monde is just the best . As stated in one of the reviews above , French Market brand does n't even begin to compare . The one criticism I have is that Cafe Du Monde is n't available in K - cups . I really , really wish it was available in K - cups .
5 #### Tried this coffee on my first trip to New Orleans at the Cafe du Monde itself . I had no room in my suitcase to carry home even one can , so I was very happy to find it on Amazon , so much so that I subscribed so that I 'll never run out . Normally , I do n't like French Roast coffee , and I was n't sure at first about what the addition of chicory would do to the flavor . I 've always made mild - flavored coffee . I read somewhere that the chicory mellows out the flavor of the French roast coffee . Well , maybe , originally , the chicory was added to stretch the coffee that was available , but it does not add an odd flavor to the coffee and , maybe , it does mellow the dark roast flavor . All I know is that I really love this coffee . A great way to start the day .
5 #### This is absolutely the best coffee . You do n't need much to brew the perfect pot , and therefore a can of Cafe ' Du Monde ' goes a long way and is more than worth the price . Its flavorful , robust , rich , and satisfying without bitterness . Even half - day old in the pot , rewarmed , is darn good . I have found my coffee , and have no plans to switch .
1 #### I really wanted to like this coffee , especially because I have such fond memories of the caf&eacute ; itself on Decatur Street in the French Quarter of New Orleans from days gone by . But there is no similarity between the heavenly coffee I enjoyed down there and this vile brew . When I opened the can I was disappointed by the aroma , which was redolent of old socks , and the coffee itself looked like roasted , coarse - ground weeds ; there were actually what could only be described as twigs in it . But I had to give it a fair go so I went through an entire can before I finally gave up on it . I tried various brewing methods and coffee - to - water ratios but one thing was consistent : No matter how I brewed it , the result was always harsh and bitter , and it left a nasty aftertaste that lingered on the palate for hours . I also tried Community New Orleans Blend , which was less astringent but more like plain old conventional coffee . Then I discovered French Market City Roast ( also available from Amazon ) and I had finally found what I 'd been looking for : rich , smooth chicory coffee that tastes like that " black liquid gold " that I remembered from the Quarter . If you want the real thing , it 's the only one to buy .
5 #### This coffee , with the hint of chicory in it , is deliciously strong and pungent . I like to mix it with the decaf . A good way to start or end the day .
5 #### If you like pre - ground coffee , this is a good one . However , I switched back to my whole beans . Like the flavor better , when I grind my own beans .
1 #### Perhaps the best coffee is in the US if this is any example . Not really fond of chickory but felt it was worth the try . Does n't taste like coffee to me - but maybe should be called something else - something weak and not flavorful .
5 #### Note that this is a very coarse grind , so do not try brewing it in a paper filter type maker , and definitely not in Keurig or espresso type makers . The grind is all wrong for those . Use with a French press or a percolator ( I use a&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Farberware - Classic - Stainless - Steel - Percolator / dp / B00005NCWQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Farberware Classic Stainless Steel Percolator</a>&nbsp;specifically for this coffee . Because the chicory in this blend is fairly prominent , I usually make my coffee au lait style . Actually , I make it more like cafe Cubano with scalded or steamed milk , but that is a personal preference . If you have never tried a chicory blended coffee you may want to at least use a little cream or milk and a touch of sugar , even if you normally take your coffee black . Once you grow accustomed to the chicory you can cut back on the additives until you can enjoy it straight up . I 'll forewarn you , though , that once you develop a taste for this you will get cravings at the oddest times . Chicory in coffee was practically the de facto blend when I was growing up in Virginia . It 's a traditional flavor throughout the south and especially New Orleans . I do not often drink this coffee , but when I have a craving this is the only brand that I trust . If you are from New Orleans I am guessing that you associate this with beignets . I prefer mine with a palmier or one of my favorites,&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Stella - D - oro - Original - Breakfast - Treats / dp / B003H2IDXE / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Stella D'oro Original Breakfast Treats</a > .
5 #### What is better than the smell of strong coffee in the morning ? This reminds you of mornings in New Orleans . If you love strong coffee this is the one for you .
5 #### I make coffee in Evo solo - this one makes good strong coffee - I also add cardamom a bit of sugar to the pot
5 #### I have been drinking the same chicory / coffee for the last few years . Every morning I make a pot of French Market chicory and take it on the way to work . I like the antioxidant benefits of the chicory and regular coffee is strong enough to hurt my stomach if a have more than a small cup . I realized that the only reason I have been buying that brand is because it 's the only one at my grocery store , when I saw Cafe du Monde on amazon I decided to give it a try . I wish I would have tried it sooner . It has a much smoother finish than my other brand . A less bitter taste as well , very enjoyable . I always mix my chicory with a bit of sugar and milk or cream , but I imagine this would do just fine on its own . Why is this so much better than the last coffee / chicory mix I have been using ? I have no idea but I 'm sticking with this brand and not looking back . Definite five stars from me ! Sidenote * - I 've been experimenting with making my own chicory and coffee mix of my own , and have n't gotten the combination the right way that this does right out of the can .
5 #### This is a much better Coffee than the French Market brand sole in our local grocery stores as chicory Coffee . It tastes like a higher quality Coffee and it 's just so much better once you try this brand of Louisiana coffee you 'll never touch French Market again . This is a mellow , smooth yet strong Coffee with a pleasant after taste that you will enjoy how it lingers after you 're finished with your last cup for the morning . French Market ( it 's only competitor ) is bitter , too strong , the last cup in the pot is almost undrinkable , and you need to wash your mouth out with something with something that will get the bitterness out of your mouth it 's so bad . I 've on occasion used peppermint tea after one or two cups of French Market . Not with Caf Du Monde , I can sit and drink an entire pot of this delicious Coffee and I love the lingering aftertaste . Weather with a typical breakfast , Donuts , Cereal or just plain toast this Coffee compliments the flavor of everything you eat . Just having it alone is like a treat ! If you have been drinking French Market please try this brand and find out what you have been missing !
5 #### I loved this particular coffee product . I gave to my nephew as a Christmas present as he just loves coffee .
4 #### This stuff smells like an ashtray and tastes like licking the tailpipe of an 18 - wheeler , but boy does it have magical energy . No mystery why New Orleans folks can prance through the hottest , stickiest summers . They drink this stuff and take off like rockets .
5 #### What can be said ? I wanted to try a chicory based coffee , I love the thought of Old N'awlins . This is almost as good as being there .
5 #### Take this coffee , get yourself a manual espresso drip cup , put 1/4cup of condensed milk in the bottom of a coffee . Put the coffee in the espresso drip cup , gently tighten the screen , pour hot water through . Let it do its drip thang , stir and enjoy a little slice of Vietnamese heaven ! ! ! Yum is the only word there is ! !
1 #### Amazon is my ' go to place ' for good prices , fast shipping and quality merchandise . While I love the coffee ( mixed with my regular brand ) and would have given it more stars , the price was not so great . Found it at a local Asian market for $ 5.49 ALL THE TIME PRICE . So , this was clearly not an ' amazon bargain ' for me this time !
5 #### The first time I tried the Harney and Son 's tea 's was when I got some of the peppermint from Barnes and Noble while there . I truly enjoyed it and when I finished the tin of tea I bought decided to try a few other varieties . I have to say this one is a light smooth tea that provides a refreshing taste and is not overpowering . It is good both hot and cold . I would recommend it to other to try if they are peach and ginger fans
5 #### This is one of my all time favorite flavors in the line of fruit flavored teas . There are little bits of dried peach and ginger among the tea leaves . Full of flavor , with a wonderful scent .
4 #### I 've tried many varieties of " ginger peach " teas , and this is probably my second - favorite . It 's not got quite as much of the sweet peach flavor as I like . It tends toward a warmer , spicier tea . In contrast,&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Sweet - Ginger - Peach - Tea-6 - Infuser - Bags - in - a - T - Mini - Tin / dp / B000OH6X3W / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Sweet Ginger Peach Tea , 6 Infuser Bags in a T - Mini Tin</a>&nbsp;is much sweeter , and&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Ginger - Peach - Tea - by - The - Republic - of - Tea-50 - tea - bags - without - Caffeine / dp / B002S3ZKZW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Ginger Peach Tea by The Republic of Tea - 50 tea bags , without Caffeine</a>&nbsp;is a little sweeter . It 's all a matter of preference . I feel this tea ( Harney & Sons Peaches & Ginger ) is good for warming up on a cold day , while I 'd prefer the " Sweet Ginger Peach " for a summer morning .
1 #### Very disappointing , taste is bitter and harsh , with some foreign to coffee notes . I was hoping for a mild to medium strength coffee , this is a dark roast .
5 #### We love this coffee , it 's all about the chicory which adds great flavor making this a rich tasting cup of coffee .
5 #### It 's summer . It 's so muggy you can see the steam rise off the pavement . Yep , you 're in the semi - tropics now . It 's New Orleans and the living is easy . And it is 8 o'clock in the morning . Time for cafe au lait made with coffee and chicory and a plate of beignets dusted with powdered sugar . It 's the chicory that gives cafe au lait its robust , mellowed down flavor . Chicory ? What is chicory ? Thought you would never ask . I just happen to have that answer right here : From Wikipedia : " Root chicory ( Cichorium intybus var . sativum ) has been in cultivation in Europe as a coffee substitute . The roots are baked , ground , and used as a coffee substitute and additive , especially in the Mediterranean region ( where the plant is native ) , although its use as a coffee additive is also very popular in India , parts of Southeast Asia and the American South , particularly in New Orleans . Chicory , with sugar beet and rye was used as an ingredient of the East German Mischkaffee ( mixed coffee ) , introduced during the " coffee crisis " of 1976 - 9 . " Chicory is also related to endive and raddichio . Cafe au lait is strong coffee mixed half with hot milk , and sugar added as desired . There is nothing like it , especially when drunk in the atmosphere of New Orleans .
5 #### One of the truly great sausages . I remember them from my days as a young paratrooper in the 82d . The service club down the way would serve them up , sliced , grilled on a bun with mayo . They were great . Just the right amount of heat amidst the wonderful flavor . Decades later I discovered Aidells . They are identical with what I remembered . These days , I grill the bun -- Texas Toast style -- with rosemary , oil and butter . A real treat to eat .
5 #### Spicy .. has a very nice taste . I have already purchased a second pack after wolfing down the first
3 #### Packaged well and everything , just does n't taste that phenomenal . The texture should be more tough instead of like polish sausages
4 #### Very nice product ! I just purchased this . I like sausage ( even though it is not a wonderfully healthy food ) . So , the thought of Cajun style andouille was irresistible . I heated this up ( it is precooked ) and enjoyed the end result a great deal . Issues ? 20 % of the daily value of saturated fat with just one sausage ; 17 % of the daily value of cholesterol ; 29 % of the daily value of sodium . Not great numbers . On the other hand ? Boy , this was fun to eat !
5 #### I appreciate the package saying , " All Natural * Gluten Free * No Nitrites * No Added Hormones " . The footnote to " No Nitrites " added , " Except those naturally occurring in Celery Powder " . With that I bought both this flavor and the Aidells Chicken and Apple sausage . Both were delicious but since I love spicy food I 'm giving this flavor the edge . It cracks me up that the marketing verbiage says , " Folks down there know two things better than most anyone how to eat and party . " I want more out of life than eating and partying but when I 'm eating or partying , this Aidells Cajun Style Andouille sausage hits the spot . The package also reminds me that this arrives fully cooked so if I want to slice up a sausage for lunch , all I have to do is pan fry it for a few minutes to give it the final touch . If you 're having guests over just add&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/this / dp / B009MKLVWU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">this</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/this / dp / B00B33W7UE / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">this</a>&nbsp;to help the party atmosphere along with classic New Orleans sounds .
5 #### I love New Orleans style coffee ; Cafe Au Lait . Mixing this chicory with a quality French roast coffee&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/COFFEE - PARTNER - Ground - Chicory / dp / B0000E5JKC / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">COFFEE PARTNER Ground Chicory</a > works great . It 's also a bit less expensive than buying the New Orleans style coffees . Because the shipping is less than the big cans of French Quarter New Orleans coffee . Works with all kinds of ground coffee , but I like French roast best with it . It gives the coffee a slightly chocolate taste and makes it less bitter .
5 #### I really like the kick this chickory gives to my coffee . And I never knew of the great benefits of drinking chickory . It 's very good for your digestive tract . I love the taste and I highly recommend you trying this product . It 's great with tea too .
4 #### I liked it because it made my coffee taste better
4 #### This is much stronger , per measure , than coffee . When mixed with coffee ( as recommended ) use much less of the combination than you would of the coffee alone . I like the slightly mellower flavor , and until I bestir myself to dry and grind some chicory roots from my own yard , I 'll continue to use this .
5 #### Chicory gives my coffee a perfect balance . Love It .
4 #### . I took the crappiest coffee ever , put some of this in it let it sit in there for about a week or so before using . The change was day and night . It took all the bitterness out of the coffee and made it taste like expensive smooth good smelling coffee . I found it pretty easily at one of the big box specialty stores in the whole foods section . they also have it at healthstores . It was very affordable for the amount of product I got .
3 #### Somewhat bitter even though I mixed with coffee and that 's what I was trying to avoid . Gon na continue to experiment with ratio of coffee vs chicory .
3 #### Noticeable difference ? Not so much . It claims to give coffee a smoother taste , but I did n't notice anything . At least it did n't make the coffee any worse , but those looking for a significant difference using this stuff , you will probably end up let down .
2 #### Regardless of the quality and the many reviews which praise the product , I was astounded when I got the package of beans and saw that I had paid nearly $ 17.00 for such a small bag . My fault for not paying closer attention , I suppose . However , I will not be buying this product again on - line . The next time I want large lima beans , I will check with my local stores .
1 #### I got a refund - so good on Amazon . I purposely purchased these in bulk with plans to share . But sadly , these are not even Jack - and - the - beanstalk worthy . No wonder his mother was mad . Two days after I received them , I put one pound of them in water to soak , after I had picked over them . They should soak overnight . I looked at them an hour later . And the pictures speak volumes . They look like aliens ! I know dried beans last a good long time , but these must have been processed when Jesus was born . I did n't bother to cook them because they were so split , all I would have had would have been bean mush . Needless to say I 'm disappointed . Happy that with no questions at all , Amazon refunded the costs . Still - I would have rather had 25 pounds of good edible beans . Find another source .
5 #### It 's hard to find these beans ! Great brand , great beans . Glad they are offered through Amazon , although pricier than they should be .
5 #### Love these bean and at an awesome price . Delivered on time . Will be buying more from this company .
5 #### They really look quality , have not cooked any yet , let you know , thanks , and God Bless .
5 #### I read a complaint that someone had received a bag of broken up lima beans and that they were the small beans instead of the large beans . I 'm not sure what may have happened there but I can verify that the 25 lb bag of Large Lima Beans I ordered have been absolutely fine ! I 've only encountered a few beans that were broken so far . They cook up really nice and taste great ! I got tired of paying ridiculous prices at the grocery store for a pound of lima beans and found this bulk 25 lb bag to be the ticket ! I am totally impressed with quality of the Camellia Brand and I will be purchasing these again in the future !
1 #### I am writing this again due to the fact that it was deleted twice ? ? ? ? ? the bag received with the beans mostly broken into pieces ? ? ? and this was supposed to be large lima beans , I am very disappointed with this entire order .
5 #### The beans were great ; however , the package was split open and beans had spilled in the box .
5 #### The best butter beans I 've ever eaten . They are large , smooth , and creamy .
5 #### I was born in the south and butter beans were very popular .... your beaans bring back some really good eating .... thanks
3 #### smaller bag than I thought it would be , should have gotten two .
4 #### My mother just loves these beans , so I sent her a bag for her birthday and they arrived on time and as described in Packaging I will use this vendor again in the future because my mother lives in a rural area and it is hard for her to get to town into the store very simply all I have to do is order and have it sent to her house
5 #### Large delicious starchy white beans . I cooked them in my pressure cooker without soaking and they came out beautifully . They were even more wonderful the next day when the starches expanded after soaking in the cooking liquid . For the price here ... they are laughably pricey for 1 pound of beans . But the quality and freshness was superb . Very clean . No split or broken beans . No rocks or soil . And they were worth it because I wanted to make a recipe and I got these shipped in 2 days with Amazon Prime . However , I think I will buy these directly from Camellia next time . I want to try more of their beans and it is cheaper to buy them direct . Plus Camellia offers free shipping when you buy a certain amount . I can stock up !
5 #### So my husband LOVES the giant beans you can get at the olive bar in the grocery but we never saw where you could buy these in person . So we found these , omg sooooo gooooood ! We made about half the bag and for the two of us that worked out to being enough for 3 meals ! They are indeed buttery and creamy smooth , even the skins are not tough at all . These are worth every penny and we look forward to buying them again ! There was no debris or anything either , very clean and just fab !
5 #### Excellent in the recipe I made . Highly recommend this brand .
5 #### I really loved these lemons . They were the right size and quantity .
5 #### I ca n't consistently find Meyers Lemons at my grocery store or Trader Joes . It 's great that I can always pick them up via Fresh !
5 #### These are choice ! It 's hard to appreciate any other lemon after trying a " Myers " .
1 #### These lemons taste like crap ... there 's no way around it . Never ordering again .
2 #### Out of the 6 that were in the order , 3 were squashed beyond recognition .
5 #### I used to grow Meyer Lemons , they take as long as a year to ripen and are pretty picky to conditions but it 's well worth the cost . To me they are by the far best lemon , they pair well with many cocktails and foods ( including salads ! ) . They are more on the sweeter side compared to regular lemons , so do n't confuse them for a " lemon lemon " . I pop one or two slices into ginger ale and it complete changes the flavor to a more complex tropical flavor . If you know how to use these lemons then they are great , but do n't buy them thinking they tastes like a regular lemon . If you plan on substituting these from regular lemons then be sure to use HALF the amount .
5 #### This stuff is really great , I use it on fajitas , and bean dip and in guac , and on eggs , etc etc etc .
5 #### I 've never had such a delicious seasoning ! All I used for my flat iron fajitas was frozen pineapple juice and this seasoning and Sous Vide it . Afterwards , I seared it on my griddle and the TASTE WAS AMAZING ! It was so good , I purchased the other four seasonings ! The other thing I LOVE is the extremely low sodium content because I hate salty foods . The company also creates a salt free seasoning which I use when I cook for my parents as they both have hypertension . I highly recommend these
4 #### takes a little more season than it says to use but has great flavor
5 #### Wife really loves to use product . And I like to eat what she makes with it .
4 #### My family members have used this delicious spice for decades , and I have found nothing to replace it . I try to minimize its use since it contains MSG and I am prone to migraines . If the msg were removed , it would be a strong five star , but then , it may not enhance flavors as well . ? ?
5 #### This stuff is the bomb . A friend had gotten me some on a trip to Texas , telling me how great it was . I use it on all pork products and some chicken too . When the bottle got low I was seriously stressing about being able to find more , so I 'm thrilled I found it for a great price !
5 #### Amazing price for a fantastic product . My family has used this for many years on meat and in recipes like " Texas Caviar " . Hard to find large size of this , definitely invest in it !
5 #### Best spice I have ever used ! ! ! Goes on any meat or fish , my absolute favorite ! ! !
3 #### I really like this flavor of this product but the one big negative is that it contains MSG .
5 #### I love this fajita mix ! We use this stuff on everything from chicken to home fries and it 's great to find it online since I ca n't find it locally after moving from Texas to New England .
5 #### This is the only spicy mayo I REALLY liked . Was skeptical , but it convinced me . Pricey , but tasty .
5 #### PERFECT , I use to live in San Antonio , TX . the Home of Bolner 's " Fiesta Brand " Spices . This is why i REQUESTED this Product ( TRUSTED ) !
5 #### Ca n't live without thise . it is difficult to find where I live .
5 #### I use this on EVERYTHING ( almost ) . It is fantastic on eggs and in / on potatoes ( mashed or otherwise ) . This stuff makes everything taste better . Even meats .
5 #### I suffered through symptoms of what I believe to be MSG overdose from this stuff . Maybe I got too happy with the sprinkles on my fajitas but I do n't want to have to worry about being in pain for aggressively seasoning my food . The MSG is clearly marked and discussed a great deal in reviews here . I read them and ordered it anyway , as I have never considered myself to be MSG sensitive . It 's disappointing that I ca n't eat it like I used it because I really liked it . I have scaled down the amounts I use and seem to be ok with it . Pro Tip : combine this with powdered Habanero when you make you fajita meat . wooo doggy ! update 10.27.13- I have been using this on chicken for fajitas and have not had any issue with headaches or illness . I believe I was simply being too aggressive with the seasoning and had to " tune it in " . I really enjoy it and will buy again .
1 #### I think this product is excellent and I even spice it up RADICALLY with Scorpion Moruga or Carolina Reaper powder . The thing I truly enjoy is that ( in spite of the fact it is made by Tabasco ) it does not taste like Tabasco sauce -- which I find has too much of a vinegar flavor . I 've used it for at least 10 years on just about any food from salads to burgers to pasta ( yes , even a peanut butter sandwich ) ! ! ! ! !
2 #### Me and the wife usually eat Miracle Whip Light . Ordered this hoping for a light but spicy spread with some kick . While there is a little kick to the spread , the aftertaste is thick and gross . I could n't get over it no matter how much I wanted to . Aftertaste is chemical - like and not appetizing at all . Do n't see anyone honestly enjoying this stuff even if they eat your standard mayo on the regular . Not recommended .
5 #### My wife use to buy this all the time when we would make Fajitas at home . For some reason the stores stop selling it . We liked it so much that even though it is a 32 oz . bottle I think we will still use it up . Enjoy !
5 #### This is really good mayo ! The Tabasco flavor is not to much and I am very happy with the purchase . If you like tangy , spicy ( and I do ) , one of the best tasting mayonnaise that I 've ever had . Not best price , if you are merely comparing cost and ounce to dollars and cents , and comparing this high - quality specialized one to a cheap store - brand generic one , but if quality and flavor matter to you , this is a very good product . Makes sandwiches or snacks taste extra good . Adds a little zing to life -- I 've used it on snacks , with pretzels -- just about anything you can think of,,,,and it only makes things taste better . Am sooo glad I tried this product and do not now want to be without it . I like hot food and often add Tabasco , , , , but this is not too hot at all in case you are wondering . Not anything like Tabasco by itself , in fact I find it very tame .
3 #### This product is ok , but nothing to brag about . It is made with Blue Plate mayo , which I enjoy , and I enjoy Tabasco pepper sauce . But the pepper flavor in this mayo is not a good , and does not have the typical aroma nor flavor of cayenne . The " heat " is average . There is a strange after - taste that remains from this mayo . I am a regular user of foods with cayenne added , but there is some other , more prominent , flavor in this mayo that is not appealing .
5 #### This is a great mayonnaise with a true , authentic tabasco flavor . It saddens me that it is not available at my local grocery . It really brings out the flavor of a great sandwhich with just the right amount of heat
1 #### I love mayo and all things spicy . Purchased this twice at my local grocer ; a dud . The initial taste is nicely spiced and tasty , but after the jar is about 1/2 used the mayo develops a funny unpleasant finishing taste . It did not smell or taste spoiled , rather finished with a stale , kind of dank taste . ( Think of wine that has been opened to the air for too long . ) I used it every day and never left the jar opened , so it was not as if the mayo had sat around for a long time in the frig and gotten old . I thought maybe it was an issue with the first jar , but same thing happened with the 2nd jar . Wo n't purchase this again .
5 #### Really tasty , just the right amount of spice . Arrived on time . Good experience .
5 #### I ordered these with Subscribe & Save and saved the extra 15 % , which made the price cheaper ( since I used free Prime shipping ) than any I had found either online or at any discount or grocery store ! I had seen negative feedback concerning freshness dates , but was so pleasantly surprised to find that these are good until Oct 2009 ! These are full , sound , tender pecan halves with good sweet flavor and excellent for baking , and the recloseable bag is so convenient . I am very satisfied with these pecans .
3 #### This had a gummy bite out of the bag but worked out fine roasted in the chocolate chip cookie recipe from Cookwise by Shirley Corriher . Amazon has a better price for nuts than both my local supermarkets one of which is gauging the cusotmers during the Thanksgiving Holiday with an end cap display of walnuts at $ 8 per pound bag .
3 #### The product is fresh BUT I have bitten into a few nut shell fragments and this is unsatisfactory especially from a dental viewpoint .
5 #### These pecans were really great . I was incredibly surprised at how fresh they were . Usually when I buy pecans I 'm always somewhat disappointed because my grandparents had pecan trees and I know what really fresh pecans taste like . While these are n't as fresh as " just picked " pecans are , they are the freshest shelled and packaged pecans I 've found so far . If you love pecans I certainly recommend these for your pies , trail mix , or even just for snacking .
5 #### I wanted something a little different than mayo , so when I found this item , I tried it . I love it , the taste is great -- not too hot , just right . Makes sandwiches or snacks taste extra good . Adds a little zing to life -- I 've used it on snacks , with pretzels -- just about anything you can think of,,,,and it only makes things taste better . Am sooo glad I tried this product and do not now want to be without it . I like hot food and often add Tobasco , , , , but this is not too hot at all in case you are wondering . Not anything like Tobasco by itself , in fact I find it very tame .
5 #### This is the BEST ! Just love it on sandwiches and in dressings . Spicy ! ! ! !
5 #### Thanks amazon , I have been looking for this product everywhere . This is for the person who likes a kick every now and then .
5 #### I used to challenge Thai & Mexican restaurants to make food to spicey . Then I had a gastric bypass , and spicey foods hurt me , but I still like the taste . I am easing into spice , and this mayo is wonderful . I have only found it here and tobasco.com .
5 #### Great . Awesome for trail mix , baking , or salads . I used in my homemade granola , homemade pecan pie , and salads . Convenient delivery through Prime as well .
1 #### Looks and tastes like they take the bottom of the aged tabasco barrels and mix it into mayonnaise . Awfully vinegary flavor , some zip , but the flavor is just hideous .
5 #### So you like mayonnaise on your sandwiches - who does n't ? Do you also like them with a bit of a kick ? Then get some of this Tabasco mayonnaise and enjoy !
3 #### Tasty , but not quite as fresh as one could want . I think Amazon needs to go back to the supplier and make them understand that Amazon 's customers know the difference between outstanding , which is what we expect , and just marginally okay . LSachs L.A. CA
4 #### These are not the best quality and taste pecans , but they are pretty good . Also , did not find the littlest piece of shell in the package , which is great . The pecans are fresh , unseasoned . I eat them raw as snack , use them in salads raw or slightly roasted , bake with them ; they can be used for many purposes . Roasting them a little in the pan enhances their flavor .
5 #### Diamond brand nuts of any kind are always high quality . They are my " go to " item for most of my baking . These pecans are also great toasted as a snack or even candied by themselves .
5 #### Love these as always . Always need pecans in the house and this is my favorite !
5 #### Great snack , low on everything except taste and health . I also use with warmed blueberries and strawberries for a extra kick
5 #### Sometimes I fell like a nut some times I do n't ! !
3 #### We have always enjoyed Diamond products . We did n't check the amount / cost . A lot pricier through Amazon compared to local grocery .
1 #### Not fresh - I did n't think about the age of the pecans - they are not that good and it is hard to tell when buying via internet .
5 #### Great for making muesli . Hard to find large packages like this in the store .
3 #### The product is pretty expensive considering the amount of pecans provided . I thought they tasted okay , but my family thought they were a little stale . I baked with them .
4 #### I love pecans . I like them best when they are fresh . This brand , or this packaging , seems to contain stale pecans . They are perfectly edible but not the best .
4 #### I love the product but the price was really high for such a small bag . Would n't buy again at this price .
5 #### I fed these to my parrots and husband and they all enjoyed them . How can you go wrong with pecans .
5 #### Nice , fresh walnuts . No off flavors . Very few broken pieces .
3 #### Tiny broken pieces . No flavor . Do nt waste your money .
5 #### Not yet opened . packaged well and looks ready for use and as fresh as an item like this gets .
3 #### They are nuts . They were fresh . They are pricey . Not much left to say .
5 #### I first discovered " golden syrup " in the beautiful green & gold tins . While not nearly as lovely on the shelf , the transparent plastic bottles are MUCH superior in measuring , pouring and storage . I found the tin imparted a nasty metallic taste to the syrup , if stored after opening . So , I started substituting dark corn syrup whenever possible :( Squeezing the syrup into a measuring spoon or cup is easier , tidier and more accurate than pouring or dipping . No bitter off - taste and better unit price ? GREAT ! I 'm stocking up !
5 #### A fantastic bargain on one of Britain 's best products . I miss the traditional can , but this bottle is more convenient by far , and the syrup is the best ! Highly recommended !
3 #### I like that this is from sugar . I also bought corn syrup to keep on hand because certain recipes require corn syrup but I try to avoid that ingredient otherwise .
4 #### My local chain supermarket no longer stocks European brands in their immigrant aisle so I am very happy to see that Amazon stocks both the golden syrup and the treacle . I was worried that I would have to make my own .
5 #### Ordered these through the Amazon Pantry and they tasted super fresh . Good price and good nuts .
5 #### These taste so fresh , I usually wait until Fall to buy my Pecans and Walnuts because they go stale so quickly , but I 'll use them for Pecan Scotties Shortbread Cookies .
5 #### I am an avid cook and baker ; pecans are a must have staple in my pantry . Diamond Pecans are always fresh and impart a delightfully sweet and nutty taste to my baked goods and my pecan - crusted chicken breasts . The large pecan pieces contained in this bag creates more versatility in your baking and cooking ; use the large pieces or chop them smaller . The pecans freeze well if you want to buy a few extra bags to keep on hand . A great Prime Pantry value .
5 #### It 's great . Same pepper I ate as a child . It tastes real .
5 #### Got these through the Amazon prime grocery shopping deal . These are very fresh and tasty .
5 #### these are excellent pecans . full flavor and not dried out .
5 #### I like it when the only ingredient is Pecans ! Nothing else ! Expensive though I am not sure I will buy again unless the price gets lower ,
5 #### High quality nuts are always fresh and full flavored .
5 #### pepper is pepper . this has been on my table my whole life
5 #### This was a good price and I needed peppercorns for my grinder .
5 #### Nice and fresh pecans to use for cooking or just as a snack .
4 #### Good but not great . Not quite as fine as the holiday pecan halves packed in a tin , but okay for cooking and baking purposes . Pecans have gotten so expensive it makes sense to economize when possible . Mine came fresh in a good stout cello / plastic bag .
5 #### I order these for my African grey parrot who gets only the best . He prefers pecans to peanuts , which are not really nuts but legumes . It is convenient for me to get our nuts through Amazon . I like these especially because they are packed as people food not bird food , and through Amazon I can get them year around ..... However , while I order them for my parrot , I must admit that I have dipped into the supply myself a time or two , and the treat requires reordering before the Christmas rush is on . We also add pecans ( and almonds ) to our morning granola . Nice crunchy addition . Nuts are good for you .
4 #### Perfect size to keep at work for my salads . It is pepper , what can you say .
5 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/McCormick - Ground - Black - Pepper-3 - oz / dp / B00T0NDFS2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">McCormick Ground Black Pepper , 3 oz</a > McComick has always been my go to for Pepper . They have n't disappointed yet after decades . How do you actually review pepper ? I must not be qualified other than to say I enjoyed the product , found it at a very good price point . Pepper is very underrated IMO . I use it on almost everything . French Fries , Pasta , soups and pizza . I seldom add salt because everyone cooks with too much salt these days from my standpoint . But it seems like every dish can use a bit of pepper to liven it up and tantalize my taste buds .
3 #### Smaller bag than I thought it would be . A bit pricy for the amount you get .
4 #### These were pretty fresh and pretty tasty , fully polished you might say . I put them into a jello mold and probably ate a quarter bag before any got into the jello .
5 #### Pecans are my favorite nut and these do not disappoint . I have always found Diamond brand to be excellent . I bake with pecans so the chopped ones are good for me and save me a little money over the " halves " . If you like pecans and need some , this is an excellent source .
4 #### Great for baking and not too much so that you need to worry about the leftover . The Amazon price is hugely better than the local supermarket .
5 #### Always buy this to use in place of standard American corn syrup .
5 #### Black pepper is so tasty ! Normal size jar , delivered right to my door .
5 #### I use this on my steaks . I love pepper and like the course grind which gives a much more intense pepper flavor . I 've been using this brand and grind for years .
5 #### These are wonderful tasting multi use nuts . I like the Diamond brand and have n't ever been sorry with the quality of the nuts . Great for cookies and sticky buns .
5 #### And good for me -- better for me to pop these nutritious tasty crunchy nuts as a snack than to open a bag of M .... 's and get hit with sugar shock . A little pricey but it 's impossible for me to eat a whole bag at one sitting -- a small handful suffices . So it 's a healthful bargain .
5 #### Diamond is a great product . Found them on Amazon less expensive than in the stores . Great gift and healthy too .
4 #### I am on a gluten free diet and I use nuts to replace gluten . I like to toast the pecans and use them to sprinkle on vegetables and salads . I also grind them in the food processor to make pie crusts .
5 #### Good purchase and would buy again . 3 Bags and a good price . Recommend this -store in freezer for desserts ! ! ! !
5 #### The squeeze bottles are so much easier to dispense than the metal tins ; I always feel like I 'm not getting all of the product out of the tins . I grew up using golden syrup on my pancakes instead of maple syrup , and even though maple syrup is the norm , IMHO pancakes always taste better with Lyle 's .
5 #### I just wanted to fill out my order so I decided to try these . So glad that I did because they are delicious .
5 #### I 've already rated these Pecans . We use them when we bake or make salads . They too are a good health food source .
5 #### Fresh , and good for you too . I was going to make a pecan roll with them , but I decided to opt out of the sugar . I ate them with my cooked cereal .
3 #### The order appeared to be fresh but the nuts were tasteless . Only good as topping for salad as greens gave it more appeal .
4 #### GOOD PRODUCT ! ! FRUIT CAKE TURNED OUT GREAT ! ! I WILL BUY AGAIN NEXT YEAR . WHAT ELSE TO SAY ? THANK YOU
5 #### This product was shipped quickly and packaged well . I used it for holiday baking and it was fresh and I will be purchasing again . It is so much better than waiting in lines at grocery stores .
5 #### Very good . Came super fast . Very fresh and tasty . Cheaper then in the store . I am a shut in so these were great .
5 #### They were a good deal form pecans at the time , being the Christmas season and all that , good deal .
5 #### Received one 8 ounce Chopped pecans . Great for baking or storage . You may want to order more if you enjoy baking or have more room to store more than one bag of 8 ounce pecans .
5 #### It is very good pepper . Use in my electric grinder , works fine .
2 #### Disappointed in these . Costly and stale . I guess for the price , I expected a greated quality . All lthree bags were the same . Also lacked taste . Gave half of them to the squirrels . I do n't recommend these to anyone who wants to bake with them or just snack on them .
4 #### I use these in cakes and pies . Helps make a great Sock To Me Cake . Good to eat also by their self
4 #### These nusts were nice and fresh and most of them were halves not small bits . Great for Banana Nut Muffins . Very happy !
5 #### I just love pistachios and pecans ... my FAVORITES ! I eat more ice cream than I SHOULD , but I certainly LOVE a light sprinkling of this on my dairy treat ... or even rice pudding ... with a little squirt of that < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Smucker - s - Magic - Shell - Caramel - Flavored - Topping-7 - 25 - Ounce / dp / B003O5JVLW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Smucker 's Magic Shell Caramel Flavored Topping , 7.25 Ounce</a > or < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Smucker - s - Magic - Shell - Ice - Cream - Topping - Chocolate - Flavor-7 - 25 - Ounce - Bottles - Pack - of-12 / dp / B000KOSLG6 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Smucker 's Magic Shell Ice Cream Topping , Chocolate Flavor , 7.25 - Ounce Bottles ( Pack of 12)</a > . Mighty tasty ! As with ALL things , the PROOF is in the PREPERATION : = = = = > You MIGHT have to " nuke " the coating in a microwave , and , = = = = > Insure the pecan " chips " are nut meat and no shells ... small shell fragments are just roughage ... as me mum'd say ! Have a nice day !
4 #### nuts from a tree . I ate them . they were good . what else can I say but grab some nuts people .
5 #### I love pecans ! ( In case you were wondering . ) These are so handy for baking and cooking and are even good for nibbling out of hand . I like to mix them into a fruit cup too . And the Diamond brand is always good !
4 #### these were quite tasty for the price but i think you can also buy them at Walmart for less . I was just too lazy to actually leave the house .
5 #### my local Publix is always running out of this . Now I can order when needed .
5 #### I was tired of grinding pepper and getting flakes that were not the right size . This coarse ground pepper has the perfect size for me .
2 #### Not like it used to be . Was [ bought in cans ] light yellow golden with a unique taste . This stuff tastes like partially caramelized refiner 's syrup , with generic taste one might find in dark corn syrup .
5 #### This stuff is delicious ! No high fructose corn syrup . Just lovely sugar cane syrup . I 'm a Southerner and cane syrup to me is a black , molasses tasting syrup , which I love . This is the light , refined version . I ca n't wait to make a pecan pie with this ! I 'm ordering a case next time !
5 #### The best tasting syrup without high fructose corn syrup . Your waffles and pancakes wo n't be the same without Lyles . Will continue to order .
5 #### I love these pecans ! I use these in my oatmeal in the morning and at noon with my yogurt and fruit for lunch . I alternate these with walnuts .
5 #### I had to make several dump cakes for the holidays . I needed a large amount of pecans . This was right on time . I was able to make 4 cakes with one pack . I probably could have spread it out a little more , but I love pecans in my baked goods , and so does my family . These arrived within a week . It 's so much easier when things arrive at your front door .
5 #### Used the pecans instead of walnuts for baking and other cooking . They hold up fine . They are softer I think than walnuts and of course the flavor leaves me wanting to add sweet maple . Sorry to hear that it was n't taken off the subscribe and save list . Thank you amazon for your fantastic service and delivery and packaging .
4 #### and at a good price too ! This is a really good add on item . I will purchase this again I 'm sure !
5 #### I was hesitant to buy pecans over the net . I love Diamond and I thought " What the heck ! ! ! " Diamond is chopped just right , not to small and not to large . They were fresh , cheaper and delivered to the door . I 'll do it again in a heartbeat .
5 #### PECAN HALVES ARE GREAT TO ADD TO MY BREAKFAST CEREAL IN THE MORNING . I ADD FRUIT WITH THIS TO BETTER THE MEAL . FRUIT , CEREAL AND PECAN HALVES ARE DELICIOUS AND HELP KEEP ME REGULAR ..
5 #### What is there really to say ? It 's black . It 's pepper . It tastes like pepper . It 's ground pepper . It dispenses wonderfully . It tastes good on hamburgers , eggs , potatoes and many other thing . It 's in a metal , recyclable can . Yay !
5 #### Great pepper . Lots of flavor . Pepper helps a person absorb nutrients . I like the coarse ground better than the other kinds since it has more flavor . Great brand that is gluten free .
4 #### Great nuts , fresh , but started out on subscribe and save with Amazon and go the 4 pack for $ 10.70 or so . In less than 6 months , price shot up to $ 17.50 or so . Conclusion ? buy that at the store .
5 #### I keep ordering this product because they add so much to my baking . They are always fresh , delicious , and beautiful . I especially like a few arranged on the top of my muffins to show which muffins have nuts . It works great if you have family members who do not prefer nuts . The bonus is that the nuts on top come out of the oven light , toasty and delicious .
5 #### Diamond pecans are always wonderful and fresh . I keep a supply on hand to sprinkle on brownies as they cook . They toast while the brownies cook . Chocolate and toasted pecans ... Nothing better than that . I also add them to cookies and scones . They are the most important ingredient in my Grandmother 's delicious buttery , pecan and coconut frosting . She used it to frost her homemade German Chocolate Cake . ( My personal birthday favorite . ) I use chocolate cake mix to make mine now but I never buy store bought frosting for this cake . Only real butter , coconut , and fresh pecans will do . People gather in the kitchen and offer to lick the spoon , bowl and platter when I start cooking this .
3 #### I thought it would be a little coarser but it 's good
3 #### I ordered it specifically for a frozen yogurt recipe I wanted to try . The recipe called for Lyle 's as a first choice . I really have no other use for it . It is very , very sweet and the caramel flavor does n't go with tart yogurt , at least for me . I gave the syrup to someone who loves it for pecan pie . Some people think it 's great , and that is understandable .
5 #### I used this to make frozen yogurt -- for me , I 'd choose this over Karo every time !
5 #### Great alternative with a Maple Syrup allergy ! Tastes wonderful !
5 #### GREAT I PREFER THIS BRAND---- REAL BLACK PEPPER ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I was introduced to coarse ground pepper at a nice restaurant and since then I use it on most of my foods , especially salads . McCormick coarse ground pepper is very tasty and this size is a good value on Amazon .
5 #### It 's just standard black pepper in a size I wanted ! Not much else can be said about it !
5 #### Delicious syrup that is perfect for baking . Very good in dairy free caramel recipes .
5 #### Black pepper and a large can for a great price . I wo n't run out for awhile and it is very tasty .
5 #### Made amazing marshmallows with these ! I like healthier alternatives to everything and this was a great option instead of using corn syrup !
5 #### Nice deal online . Saves me a trip to the grocery store . The grind is coarse as described so I use it sparingly .
1 #### I find that the generic store brand spices have more flavor than McCormick . In Philadelphia , Chicago and Boston . It 's not worth spending the extra money for this brand .
5 #### I use a lot of black pepper in everyday cooking and usually we do a custom blend of fresh ground pepper corns - because my husband took a class and got persnickety about pepper . That 's a good thing for the most part , but sometimes you just want a quick dash of pre - prepped plain black pepper over a burger or fries . I 've tried the generic versions , but McCormick has the best flavor , even heat and it does n't clog up in the can if you do n't use it daily .
4 #### love this syrup - bottle is way better than the standard tin can that is so messy because you always drip trying to get it out
5 #### I ca n't have any corn products so this is a great alternative . Now of course I would use this product anyway as it adds a richness and depth you do n't get otherwise .
5 #### Had a recipe and this was part of it ! I really have nothing to tell you but the recipe was good , since I have never tired this Golden Syrup before !
5 #### Lyle 's golden syrup is like the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow . It has a flavor that is somewhere between toffee , caramel and heaven . It is super sweet so a little goes a long way . I use it to make homemade hot fudge . It 's hard to keep the jar in the fridge because everyone will just grab a spoonful to eat plain , it 's that good . I do n't think it would be as good without Lyle 's syrup . I have a few other recipes that call for it and always have it on hand .
5 #### The cookie recipe recommended Lyle 's Golden Syrup and it does make a difference .
5 #### We can not seem to purchase enough of this syrup ! It is loved by our kids of all ages and by the adults . Highly recommend ! It is also sold in can form but we prefer the bottles since it tastes a tad different plus it 's much handier for using .
2 #### I ordered this twice . And both time got the pancake syrup instead of the cane sugar syrup I wanted . We do n't like the pancake syrup as much . I do n't know if it is really different to have partially invented sugar syrup versus cane sugar syrup as ingredient . But it tastes different to us . I looked back in my past orders . British delights is the new supplier that sent me the pancake syrup ( not as good as the original one ) .
5 #### Ca n't wait to make another pecan pie and see what this does for the flavor the flavor .
5 #### This syrup is great , I use it to make granola all the time , great taste .
5 #### Authentic golden syrup ! Now I just have to find the perfect recipe to make flapjacks . The flavor is exactly as expected , shipped fast , and the plastic container is easy to use and store .
5 #### We use this as a replacement for Karo syrup in recipes . Due to a corn allergy . It has worked well in all of the recipes we have tried over the last year .
5 #### This is the best syrup in the world . In year 's past , I could buy this in my local grocery store , but they quit carrying it 4 or 5 years ago . It is so good . I am going to make my pecan pie with it this year . It taste like the best syrup with lots of butter in it , but it does n't have butter added .
5 #### Lyle 's golden syrup is a real treat . It 's great on steel - cut oatmeal . I used to buy it occasionally in those tin containers , but it was kind of a sticky mess after the first use . I 'm glad they finally decided to sell it in this much more convenient squeeze bottle .
5 #### I have been using Lyles syrup since I was a child in England many years ago . There 's nothing that tastes like it at all . Wish my local grocery store had it in stock but Amazon usually does . It 's great on toast or pancakes or English muffins .
5 #### for cooking and baking it is light and NO Corn syrup to ruin it . It makes a superior pecan or macadamia nut pie .
5 #### I hate plastics and avoid buying food packaged in it . But this stuff I actually buy in the plastic squeeze bottle . I bought it in the metal can once and the experience of cleaning the sticky can off every time I used it , and never being able to re - close it properly , cured me of that . The squeeze bottle is best for containing and using Lyle 's . if you 've never tasted Lyle 's golden syrup , you should . I use it as a recipe substitute for corn syrup , , since my daughter is severely allergic to corn .
5 #### I used this syrup for a pecan pie recipe . It was heavenly . I also put it on waffles . yum . I love British confections so for my next bottle I may make sticky toffee pudding . Ca n't wait .
5 #### I 've been substituting the cane syrup for granulated sugar whenever I can - it tastes much better . And in my ice cream recipes it guarantees a smooth quality . I bought a new ice cream maker here on Amazon ( Cuis . Ice-100 ) and my old recipes were coming out grainy . I substituted the Lyles for the sugar and it 's much smoother .
5 #### I got this as a lower glycemic index product and was just hopeful that it was a good replacement for maple syrup . It tastes great and I know it 's a better choice for our health .
5 #### This has such an interesting flavor to it , much different from Karo syrup . In recipes calling for karo I use this instead and its really good . I made a chess pie with it and it completely changed to the flavor of the pie . It sort of reminded me of the flavor of butterscotch , only not .
5 #### Love this product ! I originally bought it to use when making homemade marshmallows and now use it in multiple recipes . It is so tasty and works great . Glad it is available on Amazon .
5 #### Tried this out of a " tin " I ordered on Amazon a couple of weeks ago . DELICIOUS flavor & quality ! Use this syrup on toast , scones OR oatmeal ... ( and I have n't even tried to bake with this syrup yet ! ) . Nice for the sweet tooth ( w/o being " too " sweet ! ) . Only problem was the tin . Nice and decorative , but apparently did n't make the trip across the pond without some " leakage issues " and you sure DON'T want this syrup on your clothes ! ( though it might make even THEM taste good ! ) . I searched a little more and found this deal of six " squeeze bottles " on Amazon ... Received them yesterday . Texture seems to be " lighter " ( guess so it 's easier to " squeeze " ) but the flavor is still GREAT ! Try this item ! Our British " cousins " have a " winner " here !
5 #### We use this all the time in my house and I am so thrilled to find it at a reasonable price on line . I love it . I highly recommend it , if you like to make English desserts ! !
5 #### I had never tried this syrup before , but had heard good things about it . I was delighted when I tasted it ! It has a rich clean taste , and the only ingredient in the product is cane sugar syrup . I did n't think I needed half a dozen bottles , but the price was right so I ordered them . They make an excellent little hostess gift , paired with a small container of ' " designer " pancake mix .
5 #### This syrup has replaced corn syrup in my pantry . A friend suggested I try it and I am glad I did . It tastes different than corn syrup and I like it better .
5 #### I bought this as it was called for in a peanut pie recipe , and I really like it . It has a nice flavor and smell , and is great for baking .
5 #### I just resently heard about this item and thought I would give it a try . I love it for baking . Gives my pecan pies a wonderful flavor without being so sicky sweet . Going to be a staple in my pantry from now on !
5 #### I love hot sauces , this one is the type most anyone can eat , it 's not to hot , it has a good mellow flavor .
5 #### I copied this from a post I wrote on my blog a while back . I only changed the price to XX . This has become my preferred hot sauce . I had never heard of the brand before but saw it on the shelf at WalMart maybe a year ago and bought a small bottle to try . I really like it so it is now what I use mostly as hot sauce , several times a day usually . It comes in regular and extra hot . I have tried both and prefer the extra hot , although it is not that hot . It is about right for me . I go through a bottle or 2 a month . Ingredients : Water , Chili Peppers , Vinegar , Salt , Spices , 0.1 % sodium benzoate as a preservative . As an added bonus , the 1 liter bottles are < $ XX . Made in Mexico . it comes in a smaller bottle as well , but I get the 1 liter size . I have one at work and one at home .
5 #### I love Lyle 's Golden Syrup ! I use it for pecan pie especially instead of corn syrup . It 's great to add sweet with a touch of a caramel flavour .
5 #### We purchased Lyle 's Golden Syrup in the tins . It is hard and messy to get it out of the tins . This will be easier since these are squirt bottles . We enjoy making our own granola ( recipe from The Homemade Pantry , yum ) and the recipe calls for this syrup . Much better than corn syrup . in my opinion .
1 #### I purchased the Lyle 's Golden Syrup because my grocery store quit selling it and this seemed a great alternative . The package of 6 bottles arrived this morning and upon opening the poorly packed box I found a bottle had been broken in transit . Had there been proper packaging I 'm certain I would n't be frustrated . Hopefully , this will be rectified or I will cancel my subscription to this item . I pay for 6 bottles I expect to receive 6 undamaged bottles . Ordinarily I would give this product 5 stars since I have used it for decades in place of that nasty corn syrup .
5 #### I recently started using golden syrup as a vegan replacement for honey in certain of my recipes . I have found that when baking my No - Knead Extra Virgin Olive Oil and Honey White Bread that I can substitute Lyle 's Golden Syrup for honey at a 1:1 ratio , with no change in the quality of the finished loaf . My latest project in a housemade lacto - fermented tomato ketchup , in which I use Lyle 's Golden Syrup as the sweetener . It provides a depth of flavor which would not be attained with table sugar alone , and puts my mind to rest , as I need not worry about the antibacterial properties of honey preventing proper fermentation . I also plan on trying this with a mixture of Golden Syrup and Black Treacle .
5 #### This made the best pecan pie ever . Not just sweet like corn syrup . Actually adds a great flavor to the pie .
5 #### Though I had heard of Lyle 's Golden Syrup , I had never tried it before . I 've now had it on waffles(delicious ) and poured over and mixed with plain yogurt ( also delicious ) . Goldem Syrup has a flavor unlike any other . I 've not tried using it in any recipe . Once I can convert the metric directions to our mearurements , I will try cooking with it . All in all , this is an interesting and flavorful experience .
5 #### I use Lyle 's syrup for making my Norwegian mother - in - law 's homemade bread recipe . When we moved to a small town in Arizona , I could no longer find it in the local stores , but was happy to find it on Amazon . It 's great syrup , and is good on waffles and pancakes as well !
5 #### I absolutely love this stuff and am using it in place of molasses ( which has too intense a taste for me ) in all recipes . I have also used it in place of either light or dark corn syrup as well , and am experimenting with substituting it for maple syrup since pure maple syrup is even pricier than the Lyle 's . Amazon 's price for the 6 - pack is definitely less per bottle than the prices in my local supermarkets , so once again Amazon comes through with flying colors for stocking my pantry !
3 #### The canned version is better ( for everything ) as it is thicker and tastier . The bottle version seems to be looser and not as flavorful . It is admittedly more convenient , but I do n't think the convenience is worth the loss of flavor .
5 #### The consistency of corn syrup but with a light carmel taste . Britain is the largest and oldest producer of this syrup , which is the byproduct of the cane sugar refining process . Golden syrup is also referred to as light treacle . Lyle 's Golden Syrup is hard to find in the United States . Thank you Amazon .
5 #### We had never tasted this sauce until we were living in Mexico . I grew up using tabasco . This sauce is richly flavorful and only a little bit spicy . It is usually on the table in restaurants in the districts where we have traveled . It is a marvelous sauce to have around . It 's just right with any latin foods , but also great with eggs ! A natural for beans , of course . Delicious on chicken ... We were so sorry when we moved on southward and found ourselves outside Valentina territory . When we came back up through Mexico several years later , we made a point of buying a couple of bottles of Valentina to bring back to the States with us ... only to find that it had arrived in California grocery stores while we were away ! Thank goodness we can get it through amazon , now that we 've left California for New England .
5 #### Best hot sauce ever YO ! try it for real .
5 #### First , I ordered on 3/2 and received on 3/4 . Now that 's service ! Second , this is incredibly good stuff ! I had been looking for golden syrup specifically to make a recipe called British Flapjacks , but it was not to be found anywhere near where I live , not even at Whole Foods . I made the recipe using brown rice syrup and was pretty pleased , but I really wanted to make it " authentic " as the golden syrup is supposed to make all the difference . So I decided to check at Amazon , and here it is . I should have known . I must say that the packing was not the best , 6 bottles just rolling around inside a box , but all were intact and no leaking , so I lucked out there . So I 'm off to make my British Flapjacks with my golden syrup . Yum yum .
5 #### What can I say reference this product ( Valentina ) ? I have been using Valentina for over thirty years . Try it on fresh Fruits ... !
5 #### Good product . I use it all the time . I might have to buy more when i run out because i use a lot ...
5 #### This is one of my favorite hot sauces . Good vinegar flavor and moderate heat . This is almost as hot as the El Yuc . XXX , but without the fresh pepper flavor that some folks do n't like .
5 #### This is the go - to hot sauce at our house . We use it in EVERYTHING . Frankly , it 's one of our secret ingredients . The brilliance of this is that it is NOT vinegary , so does n't add acidity to your dish , but does add an underwarmth , not a KICK . If you use too much , it might be too spicy for some , but I use it in almost everything to give it a warm feel on the tongue ... let 's call it a " finish " of warmth . People who are n't familiar with it , love the subtle change it can make . Recently won over an American lady when we made a huge batch of cole slaw for a bbq event . I said , let 's just add a touch to a " sample " and see what you think . She could n't believe the lovely change ... clearly did not make it spicy , but the difference is remarkable . I put it in : homemade salad dressings , homemade mayo , every type of soup and stew , caramel sauce , salsa , guacamole , spaghetti sauce , ham glaze , grilled cheese , chowders , chinese , omelette fillings , cheese sauces , rib rubs , etc . My daughter wishes it came on a key chain like sriracha ... and I had to give her a bottle to keep at her boyfriend's ... as everything tastes better with it . If you use cayenne and/or red chili flakes to add just a teeny touch of heat to things , say , macaroni and cheese or au gratins , try this as an alternative and revel in the difference !
3 #### It 's interesting . Has ok flavor / heat . Makes me want to try some others of this brand .
4 #### You 've graduated ; Hooray ! ! You 've spent a fair amount of time exploring the likes of Sriracha , Frank 's , Crystal and Tabasco , but honestly , you need more oomph . This sauce is a great place to continue your fiery journey . Just beyond the horizon of Cayenne peppers , which they use to produce the mild , aforementioned mass - produced Louisiana - style sauces - lies a big family of chil peppers waiting to meet you . In this case , El Yucateco took the unripened green Habaero and made a sauce out of it . And it 's darn good ! Like many folks , you 'll most likely discover this for the first time on the tables of smaller , more authentic , out - of - the - way Mexican restaurants . Yeah the color 's a little too Kermit - like , but the sauce is smooth & tangy with just enough bite around the corner to lift your mouth spirits . It 's not a direct assault - but it will linger for a while , like a grade - school crush . Let me also recommend two things : Firstly , you should definitely be able to find this in Latin supermarkets for a ridiculously good deal - like $ 3.00 for the 8 oz bottle - or - check the ' Ethnic ' food aisle at any generic supermarket - if you 're in luck , they 'll have it . And while your in said aisle , pick - up ya can or two of Chipotls en Adobo(sauce ) . Start adding a few of these smokey delights , chopped - up , to recipes that are lacking depth of spice . iAye Chihuahua ! ! !
5 #### Okay , so maybe this hot sauce is too green even for a salsa verde , like the kind of green that looks not at all natural , BUT ... OH MY GOD . This sauce is AMAZING . Yes , it 's HOT , even for someone like me who has been raised on heat , and that 's why I LOVE it . ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT .
5 #### If you want to kick things up a notch AND taste amazing flavor , this is the one . Test it out first in small amounts . I do n't like hotness for the sake of being hot , i like to add flavor . Typically i eat this on nachos with salsa and it takes it to the next level .
5 #### I am a hot sauce maniac . I 've gone through many hot sauce obsessions and this is my favorite one of all time . Perfect kick to it and it goes well with almost everything . I put it on my eggs , pizza , rice , sandwiches and of course tacos and burritos .
5 #### This is my favorite hot sauce . It has a real kick to it , spicier than pretty much any other general purpose hot sauce I 've found while not being overwhelming , and the intense greenness of it ( it has added coloring ) makes a lot of dishes prettier .
5 #### My favorite hot sauce . Period . Unlike other hot sauces , this one you can taste and smell the intense peppery smell with the heat without the annoying vinegar that you get with Tabasco . I put this stuff on everything .
5 #### The best value in hot green sauces on Amazon .
5 #### This sauce is very hot , and I LOVE IT . I love spicy food and this has a big kick even with a small amount and great flavor , I have also tried ghost pepper sauce , which is very hot , but loses the flavor . I add this to the top of my burritos , I put it on tacos , and also it is a great addition to Hot wings ! if I make a pan of hot wings I mix about 6 drops of this to a package of wings and it gives it a great kick with extra flavor . VERY GOOD , VERY HOT . I have tried many other hot sauces as well and they just do n't have that kick I am looking for while maintaining the flavor of the dish . you only need a few drops , so the bottle lasts awhile , Overall great product , it is made with Habenero peppers and has a wonderful flavor , I have even brought some with me to mexican restaurants in my purse to spice up my dish !
5 #### Amazing hot sauce ! It 's so spicy and tastes great on many different foods ! It will spice up chilli or eggs !
5 #### This sauce is definitely hot , but it has so much flavor , and the taste is so much brighter than other , more vinegary hot sauces . It 's great on anything fresh and you just ca n't beat it on anything with avocado .
5 #### Both my Son & I love this Co. 's Green Hot Sauce . Does not cause heart burn like many hot sauces do for us . This one is very flavorable !
5 #### Hot , hot , hot , with flavor . Love this stuff , if you like sauces , you need to try this . It will not disappoint ! !
5 #### This sauce is great ! The first bite has a great complex flavor . But then the heat comes . Not overwhelmingly hot unless you use too much . Love it .
5 #### This is absolutely my favorite hot sauce . But it 's really hot . Not for the faint of tongue . It goes great with burritos , steaks , and hotdogs , adding just the right blend of hot and peppery flavor . Taste and hotness combine into a very potent and delicious combination . You might be able to get a better deal at a local Mexican or Hispanic grocery store . That 's actually where I get mine . Compared with Tabasco , I think Tabasco has more of a vinegar flavor . El Yucateco 's hot green sauce has more of a pungent peppery flavor .
4 #### If you like a drop of heat on your food , this is the product for you !
5 #### My title says it all . This sugar is porous enough to absorb bitters and disolves quickly ; it 's just perfect for making cocktails . Love them !
5 #### Bought these for my daughter for her dorm . She sometimes has tea and does not like honey . I decided to give these a try and she really likes them . Made from 100 % pure cane sugar . Highly recommend and will buy again .
5 #### Until discovering these at a local international foods market I assumed that sugar cubes were all alike . How wrong I was . Compared to the brand I had been using -&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Domino - Sugar - Cubes - Dots / dp / B0005Z7IAA / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Domino Sugar Cubes Dots</a>&nbsp;- these are a little denser and imparts a slightly different flavor . I use them with espresso ( rarely for me , but frequently for guests ) and they have elicited remarks and questions about the sugar . This piqued my interest because I served the cubes in a dish and they looked like any other cubes . I did a side - by - side comparison and these did impart a slightly different flavor to the espresso . They dissolve quickly , which is a big plus when serving it with Moscato d'Asti , which has a very gentle fizz . If you are considering these and do not have a good pair of sugar tongs I recommend also checking out these&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Stainless - Steel - Sugar - Tongs / dp / B0000CFTNR / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Stainless Steel Sugar Tongs</a > , which are perfect for serving the cubes .
5 #### I pop a couple of these in my cup before I make a Nespresso espresso and they add just enough sweetness to the drink .
5 #### These sugar cubes have a unique and delicious flavor . I bought them specifically for coffee and I find that they add a smooth complexity to my coffee in comparison to the usual C&H Sugar . I even let one rest on my tongue , just to get the pure flavor . It was utterly delicious . The cubes are n't truly cube - shaped , but they look lovely in a sugar dish for company , and they dissolve beautifully in any hot liquid . These are now on my buy list . Elegant , refined , and delicious !
5 #### These irregular shaped sugar cubes are so much more attactive then square sugar cubes . I use them on my slotted Absinthe spoon . They are also very attractive in a small serving dish .
5 #### This is great sugar . I use it in recipes instead of regular sugar . There 's a big difference . About to order a second box .
3 #### The product arrived promptly . It 's OK but tastes a little artificial .
3 #### I got this at the local store . And it is not bad tasting , but not exactly like authethic Horchata . This product is very sweet compare to real horchata . This can be good for a person drinking it for the first time or kids it may work . The taste is closer in taste to Vanilla than to authethic horchata . The product taster better with milk and terrible with just water , which leads me to believe they emphasize the vanilla portion most when making this product . Overall the product is not bad tasting but not what I was expecting . It more like a vanilla shake rather than horchata
3 #### Used red ricardo for years and although this had the flavor I expected it was a bit dried out and hard to work with . It is great on grouper or snapper mixed with a little mayo , lime juice , garlic and butter . Just spread mixture and bake the fish wrapped in foil . Yum !
4 #### It 's fun to have this drink as a memory of Peru ! Inca Kola has a taste leaning toward ' creme soda , " with a look like Mt. Dew . However , when in Peru , I tried to drink the diet version whenever possible ( which I could n't find very often ) . Whether HFCS or cane sugar , these are empty calories our body does n't need .
2 #### Coca - Cola owns Inka Kola now and the taste is not the same . Coca - Cola put high fructose corn syrup instead of the cane sugar that was always used in Peru . If you get it in Peru it still has real sugar and tastes good ( not " fake " sweet ) This brings me back to my childhood for sure ...
5 #### Shipped promptly and simple packaging . Mild flavored carbonated cola , that reminds me of Mountain Dew , without the caffeine Packaged by coca cola
4 #### I had a recipe that called for this paste so I bought some . I 've never tasted it before so it was quite a surprise . It seems to have a bit of sweetness to it but , on the other hand , it has a very good flavor . I 've only used it once so I need to try it in some other dishes to tell if I really like it or maybe do n't really like it .
5 #### my daughter in law liked it who is from peru where they drink this . guess it is very sweet .
5 #### My son loves this . Santa brings this every year ! !
1 #### Tastes absolutely disgusting . Not sure what is in this but I felt ' wired ' for a couple of hours after drinking one very small glass . Did not like this at all !
5 #### When you live with a Mayan , this is very important to have . Great for pork shoulder and turkey .
3 #### The prices here are outrageous ! You can pick this up at Wal - Mart for less than three bucks . Anyway , you probably want to know about the taste . The taste ? It 's not amazing . Not bad either , but it is your run of the mill soda . And it does n't taste like Coca - Cola . It is not a yellow Coca - Cola . The taste is closer to kola champagne or cream soda -- except it has a hint of lemon / citric acid .
5 #### This is a unique soda pop , I 'm not quite sure I 've had one like it before . For the record I 've never been to anywhere in Latin America , just the States and Canada . Anyway , it is very much worth trying at least once . Some people describe the flavor in reviews as like bubble gum , I 'd say that close but there 's something else there too . For something as " simple " as soda pop the flavor is very subtle . It is VERY sweet though , not sure if my bottle uses sugar or corn syrup ( the ingrediants on the bottle I got says either High Frutose Corn Syrup or Sucrose was used ) but regardless , it is very sweet , probably up to the level of Jolt way back when they still used cane sugar if not more . It 's not something I 'd want every day , I 'd grow tired of it , but that is probably true of almost anything . But it is a nice unique treat to try , and despite the price and shipping ( It was packed very well as an aside , and shipped quickly so I do n't think the shipping was overpriced considering that ) I know I 'll order it again when the mood hits to have this .
5 #### This is a great , convenient product for the home gourmet . Even in California , we ca n't always find the right Yucatan - style ingredients , and this package gives you high quality product with the ease of home delivery .
5 #### This is exactly what I was looking for -- but it is expensive here . I have found achiote paste at a local Mexican grocery for much less . However , when I was first looking for this , I was glad to find it at Amazon , and willing to pay the extra . It 's the real deal . There is no other flavor like this . For those who have never used this , it comes in a very firm block , and you must break off pieces to mix with oil and/or lime juice to use for a marinade . Blending with those ingredients in a small food processor makes it easier to mix . I only used about 1/3 to 1/2 of a block for a whole chicken . But I 'm a novice with this , and still learning , so listen to tips from others who know more than I do .
5 #### Some time ago I ran out of chicken - flavored bouillon cubes and the store had none . However , they had 7.9 ounce jars of same . Well , I 'd never tried the jars before but why not ? As it turned out , I preferred the jar to the cubes . Well , next I was out of beef bouillon cubes and ran into the same problem . Same solution too . I bought the 7.9 ounce jar . It 's excellent . Just yesterday I made a beef - flavored soup / stew and used the bouillon as a flavoring agent . Everything turned out perfect . This stuff has a real high sodium content , so I eliminated salt as an ingredient . The result was excellent ! Gary Peterson
3 #### Soft ; Tart & spicy . If you like it that way then get it . Liked the tartness but did n't like the lingering spicy taste .
5 #### Used this to make Guamanian Red Rice . Gorgeous color and easy to use !
5 #### I use this on fish and it was great . I will order again .
5 #### Great product , love the bigger size than what you get at the grocery store .
5 #### SO much better than those little cubes in foil wrappers .
5 #### I saw this at my local grocer one day and bought it on a whim . I did not hold out high hopes but this stuff gave me a very pleasant surprise ! The smoky flavor of chipotles is the main star in this sauce of course , and has a lovely tangy / sweet balance . This sauce is very versatile I have found , being good right out of the bottle with cheeze and crackers , or as a condiment with cooked meats . The heat is rather mild , allowing you to get as much of the great flavor of this sauce onto your dishes as you wish . I highly recommend this sauce .
5 #### My students were thrilled when they saw the reward they 'd earned for their hard work . It was fresh and arrived as promised .
4 #### My local Safeway sells this exact size / brand / flavor for $ 2.59 , non - sale price . I like to use this in crock pot beef recipes instead of beef broth because it 's easier to keep on hand than cans of broth .
1 #### What is wrong with this item ? I always buy the Knorr beef bouillon cubes , I thought this would be more convenient but it tastes nothing like the cubes . This product ruined my soup . There is no beef flavor and it 's not even salty . I had to use 3 times the amount I was suppose to use plus a bunch of salt to get it near the level of flavor the cubes give the soup . I do n't know why this product differs from the cubes when it says it 's the same dang thing !
4 #### Not sure what achiote is supposed to taste like but this works ok in the recipes that I have used it for .
5 #### I am married to a Mexican and , one time while visiting in Mexico , he offered me some candy . I 'm fat , and I love candy , so I thought I 'd give it a go . This stuff tastes like the oldest , most putrid , rotting vomit to have ever been discovered . It is , easily , the most disgusting thing I 've ever put in my mouth and that 's saying a lot , because I 'm a pretty liberal ( and frisky ) gay person . My husband , though , loves it ... so , if you 're looking for a taste of Mexico , this is it .
5 #### Thick , smokey , spicy and rich . First bottle arrived open but was quickly replaced by seller . Second bottle was perfect . Flavor is very nice !
5 #### I found this stuff in a small mexican supermarket . Bought a few of them , figuring the mexicans know their hot sauces well . My instincts were correct . This stuff is delicious on a variety of foods : pork , chicken , burritos ... just about anything really . It has a nice vinegary smoky chipotle pepper flavor . Works for me , and the price is right at about 2$.
5 #### Love the flavor of this product . Great addition to my kitchen pantry !
5 #### Great for soups , meat loaf and lots of other recipes you want to enhance beef flavor .
5 #### Purchased to include in Christmas gifts ... any leftovers to be used in recipes coming from my kitchen ...
5 #### It is difficult to say very much about the product itself ; it 's bouillon after all ! However I am pleased to share that the product was exactly as advertised , was delivered safely in a very timely fashion , and when combined with Amazon Prime is an incredible value . I recommend it to anyone who may be interested .
1 #### It seemed like forever before this item got here and when it did the bottles were much smaller than I was expecting . Knoor usually make a decent product but this tasted a tad stale . I 'll stick with Tones .
5 #### I went looking for beef flavoring in the stores and no one had it so i got it on line thank you
4 #### at first it tasted so weird . the sour with the pepper then the sweet , my mouth did n't know how to react to it but after a few more bites i fell in love with them
5 #### Perfect for the recipe I was making ! I could n't find this anywhere locally so this resource was a lifesaver !
5 #### I really love this sauce on chicken and rice , eggs , pizza , quesadillas , grilled cheese sandwiches , Steak , Fajitas . I ordered 15 bottles last time to save on shipping , I m down to 5 bottles now and going to order soon , ca n't believe the price dropped more . $ .63 + shipping each . WOW
5 #### Pulparindo is the classic Mexican candy . It has a tangy taste of tamarind , hint of spiciness , and is not overwhelmingly salty . Each bar is individually wrapped and labeled . For those familiar with Pulparindo , this is legit . Came fresh and sealed in plastic wrapping . Expiration date is far out , so I got plenty of time to eat it and savor it !
5 #### I do n't know why but I like chili in my candy . Hot and Sweet
3 #### I do n't know how much to use but when I do a little research i know i will be very pleased . Thus far , I put it in stews and rice and beans .
5 #### I 'm a mexican chef living in Panama so I was craving to prepare some tacos al pastor and ordered this achiote paste , my friends and family were thrilled on how the tacos turned out , I 'm extremely happy with this brand and for sure will buy it again .
5 #### This is a good product , delivered promptly . It 's hard to find annatto where I live , and for so me dishes it 's indispensable . Highly recommended .
5 #### These are like a grown - up version of Fruit Roll - Ups , and I only wish I had found them sooner . Each individual bar is roughly 1.25 " by 2.5 " but they are jam - packed with flavor ! The second that one is out of my mouth , I am already craving it again . These Pulparindo are sweet and full of that lovely tamarind flavor , but are not cloyingly sweet the way many American candies are . There is a hint of saltiness , as if they have been infused with saltwater ( they are n't ; they are made with sugar , tamarind pulp , corn syrup , iodized salt , citric acid , ground chili , and sodium benzoate ) . I am a big fan of salt , so others may find it a bit salty ( honestly , I would love them just as much without it ) , but it is subtle enough I do n't think it is enough to be off - putting to anyone . The spice level is also very low . I like things a bit spicy , but can not tolerate higher levels of spiciness , and this did not bother me at all . The chili is really a subtle back note , so unless you have extreme sensitivity to spiciness , you will barely notice it . It brings out the earthy , richness in the tamarind in a lovely way . I may try the spicier version of this at some point , but I have a feeling I will return to these regularly . Do not be turned off by the purported spiciness , as it is very mild . I highly recommend them to everyone ! !
2 #### I bought this to save some time when making Mexican dishes that call for it . Making it from scratch with anatto seeds in a blender is kind of messy and time consuming but the flavor is a million times better than this stuff . It 's also really too dry to even be called a paste .
4 #### I have not used this product before . I am on a mission to try to find out how my favorite Mexican restaurant makes a chicken dish . I used this once on some grilled chicken and it was good but I still need to figure out how to use it properly .
5 #### This paste is wonderful in so many different foods . I combine it with lemon and rub it on a roast chicken or baked cut up chicken or on a thanksgiving turkey . I combine it with chipotle peppers with some adobo sauce and spread it on thinly sliced pork for a few hours then grill it for tacos al pastor along with grilled thinly sliced red onions and sliced grilled pineapple . I use it as part of the seasonings for the chicken that goes in tamales . I use it for about a dozen other recipes . This stuff is amazing and brings life to so many dishes . This spice blend originates in the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico ( according to my Mom ) and is widely used in Mexican cooking . It was originally a Mayan condiment but has spread in use . It consists of Annatto seed along with a number of other spices . It is commonly also called Recado Rojo . Once opened , I store the leftover paste in the refrigerator for best results . That keeps it tasting fresh and helps keep it from drying out .
5 #### Love this product ! Fresh and ready to eat " )
5 #### I am from Hawaii I 'm not Mexican or have I ever been out of Hawaii but one day I tried these from a friend from Mexico and I just had to search these and buy them their so different but delicious . The quality is great as well .
5 #### Is it much to say these are an underrated legend of a candy ?
5 #### Love the flavor and it 's priced reasonably . The enamel on my teeth think otherwise . I will definitely buy more , when my mouth heals .
5 #### I used to live in southern California and could buy this all the time . I now live in upstate ny where they do n't sell it . I was so happy to find out Amazon sold this !
5 #### Mexican candy is n't like the American candy we 're used to . It 's usually not all that sweet , and is very often spicy . This is no different ... it 's sort of like fruit leather with sugar , chile , and salt mixed in . Sort of . I think it 's an acquired taste , because most people do n't like it the first time I give it to them but it grows on them if they give it a chance . It 's a much different taste than you 're used to- in a good way !
5 #### I already know what to expect , unlike a lot of people purchasing candies like this . It does have an acquired taste , I was brought up with candy like this . They have a different , tangy , spicy taste to it and the texture is almost like an airhead , but a little more granulated and not smooth . I honestly love the taste of this , reminds me of when I was a little one . The Mexican stores around where I live stopped selling these and made me very sad . I 'm just glad I can actually find my Mexican candy on Amazon ! ! I can not rate the vendor because I have not purchased it from anyone through Amazon , however , I can rate the item and I give that 5 stars . It 's a little piece of childhood ! For those who do not like even mildly flavored foods , I recommend you not to purchase . It is spicy if you 're not expecting it . Gave a piece to my friend , he started sweating , I did n't know he did n't like / couldn't take spicy foods ( lol ) .
5 #### this candy is so good you have to try it i ate the whole box in two days it is worth the money
5 #### I keep this in my gluten free pantry ! One time a friend made the nestle choc . chip cookies bars in a 9 x 13 pan with this instead of flour ( not knowing it was not flour ) and they actually turned out excellent ! I make them almost every weekend now for the kiddos or to take along to gatherings ! Gluten free !
5 #### Looking for a cheaper gluten - free flour ? Look no further . They do n't mill wheat , so it 's gluten - free with no chance of cross - contamination -- unlike virtually every other brand of corn flour out there , except Publix , which is only available in four U.S. states . However , this is masa harina , not corn flour , so you can make tortillas , arepas , tamales and skillet corn bread with it ... and not much else . Edit : Masa Harina Socca ( With many thanks to Mark Bittman . ) One and 1/2 cup water to one cup masa harina -- let sit for several hours , covered . Preheat oven to 450 . Find a flat cast - iron skillet without sides -- like a flat fajita grill . ( A regular cast iron pan with sides will concentrate the heat too much on the edges and burn the edges before the center gets cooked . ) Pour enough canola oil into the pan that it sloshes a little . Spoon the dough into the pan . Finally , put the pan into the preheated oven . Leave for an hour to an hour and a half . Flip halfway through . L'Chaim .

5 #### Delicious homemade corn tortillas ! I followed the basic recipe on the package with the addition of 1/2 teaspoon of salt , as recommended by a couple of websites . After measuring and mixing the dough , let it rest for 30 minutes . Also , use heated filtered water and level cups of masa . Perfectly pressed tortillas popped out of my Victoria press , between two sheets of parchment paper . No muss , no fuss !
3 #### We used this for a few rounds of tortillas , but it 's non - organic and full of that nasty GMO corn . I 'm abnormally sensitive to GMO food and had a bad rash reaction to this . It 's not Maseca 's fault , but we wo n't buy this brand again .
3 #### the flower is great for my tortillas and tamales and they 're delicious one of the best flower corn , i love the smell
3 #### It makes tortillas but I add some salt to make the taste a little better otherwise they taste a bit bland to me .
5 #### It was fun to make on my new press and they were delicious ! Hard to form into tacos , so I made tostadas .
5 #### This was a reccomendation by a friend of mine and she says it makes great soft Taco Shells ....... that from a Mexican Friend of hers ........... so I ca n't wait to use this product .
5 #### Seriously the only corn flour you need for tortillas . We have tried a few different types but we keep coming back to Maseca . It was the one most of our friends used in Mexico .
4 #### Since I bough this , I cooked several times for corn tortillas and tamales . It works great for both and very yummy when it 's done . Nothing complain about except the shipping . well , Due to living in NYC , it is hard to find local market . anyway product itself is pretty good quality and works fine for me . ^^ ; ; ;
5 #### This hot sauce is so tasty with Mexican food / Tex Mex that for me personally , nothing even touches it . This is n't a hot sauce that I would use for Buffalo Wings or home fries . This stuff lends itself to tacos , nachos , burritos etc so well that it 's hard to describe . I 'm a hot sauce fanatic and I love habenero hot sauces , but habenero hot sauce just does n't work on a taco like this stuff does . I always thought it did , and it is very yummy , but not like this stuff on Tex mex or Mexican chow . I live in Upstate New York and travel a lot for business . I buy this stuff on the west coast for $ 1.29 a bottle at the grocery store , bubble wrap it and bring it home in my luggage . I think about this hot sauce some times . It 's amazing . To put it in perspective for you west coasters , I hate Tapatio . It 's got too much vinegar . This stuff does not . I would like to thank the creator of this hot suace , because it 's that good . It really stands out on Tex Mex especially . Mmmmm . YUMMY ! ! ! !
5 #### Probably my favorite hot sauce . Not that spicy , but I 'm a fan of the flavor .
5 #### This is a favorite in my household . We put it on everything from eggs and hashbrowns to chicken and tacos .
5 #### This is by far the most flavorful and delicious hot sauce I have ever come across . Before this I would swear by Cholula . This has dethroned that , and is now sitting on the throne of hot sauces . Do try to find it at your local Hispanic market however , as they sell for about a dollar at retail locations . No need to buy it at an 800%+ mark up .
4 #### Noticeable different from the start Thicker like a chocolate sauce Think we have a winner ( less vinegar than all ... and a sneaky heat .. hit me when I was done .. true middle of the road heat )
5 #### Just tried this for the first time today . This stuff is very good . I generally like the Liousiana style or Sriracha style hot sauces more , but as far as Mexican style hot sauces go , this is probably my favorite . It 's not very hot which is fine , and has a bit of a taco sauce taste to it . Looking forward to trying this on some nachos or tacos .
5 #### This was a purchase for my son . This is his favorite hot sauce .
5 #### Had this at a local Mexican Joint . Excellent flavor and a great value on Amazon .
2 #### Just being honest . I went out trying to find the best hot sauce on Earth and this one was recommended to me . I tried it on a few dishes and realized it did n't even taste like a hot sauce , more like just a sauce . It 's not very good and I will probably be throwing the bottle away . Not good and would not recommend .
4 #### I love hot sauces . But at first I did n't like this at all . Hard to describe , but it 's flavor is peppery like black pepper . Not anything like what I was expecting . It has grown on me . Sometimes I use a little of this mixed with traditional hot sauce . I 've found that there are certain uses , like making chili , where I like it fine . I think I 'm likely to get another bottle when I 'm done with this one . If you want a hot suace with a different flavor , you should try it -- it wo n't be wasted .
3 #### I like this salsa , but if you 're looking for something with some heat , this is not it . I did n't detect even the slightest bit of heat in the Hot version of this stuff .
4 #### This is a fairly decent - tasting store - bought salsa . BUT what it REALLY shines as is a " base " for making your own homemade salsa . Take this salsa , add in some roasted and chopped tomatoes and jalapenos and green chiles and garlic that you roast in your own oven . Add a little fresh cilantro and maybe a bit of sweet onion . BINGO ! ! Awesome homemade salsa . I just made some yesterday and had some just now and DANG it was GOOD ! ! I make it like this ALL the time . Wally World has larger cans for a good price .
4 #### We use our immersion blender to make it less chunky , and more like the authentic restaurant style . Best in taste as far as jarred salsas go . Spicy ! We mix it with the Casera Mild for a less spicy appetizer . Best with Santitas chips .
5 #### This is an extremely tasty sauce , not a chunky salsa as the name would lead one to believe . " Salsa " is merely the spanish word for sauce but a lot of us have come to think of it as the chunky kind we top tacos and other foods with . This is great over red beans and rice and anything else that you want to add a very flavorful medium hot kick too . Just enough burn to make it fun and a whole lot of flavor . Glad to have found it after trying a lot of sauces that sometimes had as good a flavor but had all the spicy heat of a jar of baby food .
5 #### Bought for my family since we are stationed overseas and ca n't find in any of the stores provided for us . My boys put it on everything ! :)
5 #### Definately Hot , but does n't blister your tongue , No bitterness ... reminds me of hot sauces from years past . and you ca n't beat the price .
5 #### Tajin is so yummy ! I 'm completely hooked but no one carries it in my area . When I found it on Amazon , I was overjoyed , only to find that it is no longer available . What gives ? I finally found it on Gourmet Sleuth and ordered enough to do me for awhile . Problem is , it wo n't be here for a few more days . :(
5 #### This is liquid fire ! It 's really tasty too . But , only use a drop !
5 #### This stuff is perfect for fresh fruits ! I LOVE cucumbers and this makes them even more amazing . Yes cucumbers are fruit . Mix in some honey crisp apples and oh my gosh yum ! Put it on oranges , mango , watermelon , pretty much any fresh fruit and you wo n't be disappointed . I always have a stash of this in my pantry .
5 #### Our local newspaper ran a story of a local Firehouse and their chili that has won awards for being so good . The secret ingredient for the chili happens to be the Tajin Seasoning according to the head cook at the firehouse . So figuring that fireman probably know their chili thought I would give it a try . My husband likes adding additional flavoring to his Mexican food and this is set on the table like salt / pepper .
2 #### Ripoff , but I bought it for free shipping . Tastes good .
5 #### Best hot sauce on the market . I literally have over 50 kinds of hot sauce at all times , but this is by far the favorite of my sons and husband . I 've reordered and reordered . El Yucateco produces several flavors , but this is our favorite .
5 #### A tasty seasoning to sprinkle on or add to dips , such as hummus or guacamole . A bit pricy .
1 #### not happy .. VERYYYYYY salty and it was CAKED up in the bottle like it was OLD and dried up ! ! ! no expiration date could be found i was hoping for more taste not PURE SALT ! ! to the trash it goes !
5 #### Love it ! I got it to rim glass on bloody mary 's but have n't done it yet . Turns out it 's delicious on salad . I made a cucumber and tomato salad and sprinkled this on top and it was delicious . It 's mostly peppers but not super spicy and it has some tang to it , from natural lime flavor .
5 #### Great product ! Tastes great - not too overwhelming . I use it on mango Popsicles , but would be great on all sorts of fruits , veggies or meats ! !
5 #### Exactly what I was hoping for . A VERY strong flavor . A little goes a long way . I was looking for an alternative to the unhealthy ingredients put into the chili - lime powder sold by a major brand for popcorn . I loved that stuff . This product tastes much better , fresher , and has no unhealthy poison crud like the other stuff . At the time of purchase this was also less expensive . Buy it !
5 #### Another excellent hot sauce and I mean HOT HOT sauce
5 #### Bought this hot sauce to try the Hot Ones wings Challenge . I ca nt wait !
5 #### So delicious but is n't spicy - just a really nice limey flavor . I put this on everything .
5 #### This is amazing . I 'd never heard of it until a friend in Texas told me to get some . I did and sprinkled some on my salad and it 's great . Ca n't quite decide what it is , but whatever it makes everything taste amazing .
3 #### Just tastes like a slightly flavored salt . I expected it to be a bit more spicy and flavorful . It is not . I do n't like hot , hot food , so I was not looking for that . I just wanted that extra flavor component , but it just is n't there . Kind of blah .
5 #### I love extremely hot sauces from time to time but for a normal meal where I do n't want my head to explode , this is my go - to sauce . It 's loaded with habanero and is right on the edge of overpowering the meal with heat . I like that because you can use more or less and , depending on your tolerance of heat , crank things up to 11 while still having the option of going easy on the pain . The flavor is the best part . It 's really good , the same way that sriracha has a really good flavor and the spiciness is just a bonus . I always have a bottle of this on hand .
5 #### I love this blend . Its unusual . NOT HOT . I got a fresh fruit ckup in FL and this was sprinkled throughout the fruit . It was a surprise taste but I really liked it ! Its great on eggs or anything you want to boost . Ingredients : Chili Peppers , Sea Salt , dehydrated lime juice , silicon dioxide ( prevent caking)l No artificial colors or flavors added . So the main flavor is pepper and lime . Love it .
5 #### Yummmm . Tried this on broccoli - it 's great . The bartender at our local Mexican bar said she loves it on cucumbers . Ican't wait to try that ! Very little heat and lime flavoring . Really different and good !
5 #### Everybody should have a bottle of this stuff on the counter . It 's salty - touch of heat -sour from the lime . Perfect to sprinkle on fruit , sandwiches , rice and beans , salads . The more we have this around , the more we use it . Our Mexican friends have a point with this stuff .
5 #### Someone left this behind at my home once . I decided to give it a try , using it as a seasoning not only in my cooking , but in my cottage cheese ! It is fabulous . I love the little bit of crunchiness it has , adding a delightful texture to an already delicious seasoning !
5 #### OMG , if you have not tried this ... DO ! I learned about this at a food festival . You use this on fruit , I know , I had the same reaction . Dude , it 's spice ! But you sprinkle a little lime juice and this on a cucumber slice and you are in heaven . It 's great on almost any kind of fruit . Super great way to mix up the diet !
4 #### I love this style of fruit / snack seasoning ever since I had it at a fruteria in San Antonio . This seems to be the classic brand but I feel like the chili flakes are not as fine as I 'd like them to be , which can make the dried pepper flavor overpowering . It 's more of a flat / bitterness issue than a heat issue . I was spoiled by the market - made version that I found in the fruteria , I guess ! Trader Joes just came out with a TJ 's version of this spice and it 's great , the lime and sugar flavors are more prominent .
5 #### El Yucateco hot sauces are great . I 've been enjoying the red and green for a long time . I also tried the other ones , the Carribean which is good , and the Habanero Extra Hot sauce is exactly what its called , it is hotter than all the others . I think the best El Yucateco I 've tried was the Chipotle one , which sadly is not included . Overal El Yucateco has some real good hot sauces which are not just hot but big on flavor .
3 #### I love El Yucateco , but you are better off just buying Habanero Red and Habanero Green at the local bodega . The Caribbean Habanero has an odd flavor that is too fruity and clearly not El Yacateco 's strength . The Kutbil - Ik or Habanero Extra Hot sauce is , well , extra hot and lacks the balance of the standard Habanero Red . If you want hotter sauces , seek out the products of the specialty producers , but if you want a standard well balanced hot sauce without vinegar as a base nobody beats El Yacateco .
5 #### Another item that I could n't find in stores ! Hot as Tabasco but with a lot more flavor .
1 #### This would have become my new hot sauce as I love it . It has no vinegar taste and is a great flavor but since it has Red # 40 in it , that ends it all . There is no need for this colorant . It is so bad for anyone 's brain and my son is allergic to red 40 specifically . There are plenty of organic based colorants for foods that are safe .
5 #### Picked up a bottle of this on a whim at the grocery store and fell in love . It 's a must have on corn on the cob now . I also love it on watermelon . It cuts that too sweet flavor just enough to make the perfect combination of sweet and salty and hot . I must admit , I 'm not crazy about the amount of salt in it - as someone trying to cut back on sodium intake , it means I ca n't use this as often as I 'd like to . But like most things , moderation is the key . And this stuff is tasty enough to be worth cutting back a little on salt in other things the days I use it to compensate .
5 #### I put this on literally ALL of my fruit now . It 's good on watermelon , apples , strawberries , mango , cucumbers , peaches , freaking EVERYTHING ! ! The little bit of salty / spicy flavor makes everything taste sweeter and just MORE . I really do n't know what I was doing with my life before I had this stuff to put on my fruit . Now , I ca n't be without it .
5 #### Holey Moley- this sauce will brighten up any meal you put it on . Nice hot flavor for everything but breakfast cereal and chocolate milk .
3 #### The hot sauce is a little thick and chunky . It is hard to get out of the bottle sometimes , even with heavy shaking . Once it is out though , it is a nice smooth heat to it .
1 #### This was by far my favorite hot sauce until the University of Nevada at Las Vegas released a study identifying this brand as having 0.21 PPM of lead in it along with others - FDA limit for lead in food is 0.1 PPM . It got some publicity so do a search for " hot sauce lead " to read up . Aside from the lead , the use of artificial colors also bugged me . The study concludes that simple adjustments to the manufacturing process , such as washing the peppers , or not using salt from the earth , but rather the sea could remedy the problem altogether . If they 're not even washing the peppers before processing them , then they are probably covered in pesticides as well .
3 #### I really do n't care for it , but that is just me .
5 #### It gets 5 stars just for the no vinegar part .. I like tabasco but I do not love any hot sauce loaded with distilled vinegar , this is fabulous because I get to really taste habanero and no vinegar . I love habaneros they might not be the worlds hottest chili but oh the flavor , If you add this to some roasted salsa ( put habs in that for sure ) but add some of this if you did n't have any and it would be great . My only gripe is coloring added I know its food coloring but still it did n't really need it .
5 #### My absolute favorite brand of delightful habanero elixir . Hot enough without being overpoweringly hot and very tasty . I love the green habanero , as well as the red and I 'm very much looking forward to trying the carribean . Now , I do n't have to worry about whether or not my local stores will have it in stock .
5 #### We like this seasoning . We add it to our cooked meals on vegetables , rice , into soups and stews . We also use it on grilled ribs as a dry rub . We love to put the ribs on the top shelf of our infrared grill and slow roast them without any sauces until they are golden brown and tender . This spice is one of the things that makes the ribs just taste perfect . We also like to use it as a seasoning for different meats used in tacos , soft tacos and burritos . It adds the zest of lime into the flavor and a very small hint of spice and salt . It works great with pork , beef , chicken and fish along with vegetables and fruit . I have included photos of the bottle , the ingredients and the nutrition data . It comes in a shaker bottle . It is made in Mexico . There is even a low sodium version available . This is a good spice and we like it a lot .
5 #### It 's the best one to use for Margarita 's , Guacamole , and with mango is simply delicious . I had my first taste during my first trip in Mexico and now I ca n't live without Tajin ... The opinions / thoughts in this review are solely mine and have not been altered or suggested by the seller . Thank you so much for your time in reading this !
3 #### A Mexican friend recommended this so I thought I 'd give it a try . He told me to sprinkle it on fruit . I liked the tangy , salty taste . It 's something different and interesting but not for all the time .
1 #### The Coca - Cola company contributed $ 1,700,500 to defeat the California Prop 37 also known as " The California Right to Know Genetically Engineered Food Act . " . Do you really want to buy from a company that does not want you to know that GMO is in your food ?
3 #### My order was packaged extremly well , with lots of bubble wrap . Thank you for carefully wrapping each bottle . It was appreciated . But ... The soda arrived flat ... no fizz . I really wanted to enjoy this , but the flatness ruined it . My guess is that it was flat when it was shipped .
5 #### I love spicy food and usually find these products in Mexican groceries but I found these salsas in here and a big more variety that in the store ! ! and I enjoyed them very much !
5 #### Best hot sauce on Earth . Okay , maybe not , but worth a try . They all have heat and flavor , which are usually mutually exclusive .
5 #### Hot and very flexible in use . Put it on chicken , Mexican and chili . Add it to regular taco sauce for some extra blast . Do n't bother with it if you do n't like hot hot sauce .
4 #### I love this on fruit but could n't find it where I live .
4 #### great on fruit , veggies , meat , rice , well , everything but ice cream
5 #### I have been eating this hot sauce for years . It is one of the few habanero sauces that I have ever tried that really packs a wallop ! I usually use Scorpion or Ghost pepper sauces , but sometimes I do n't want terrible diarrhea , so I reach for habanero sauce instead . This sauce offers a bright , fresh flavor that allows you to really taste the habaneros before it burns your face off . As some people have mentioned , you can find this hot sauce in Mexican markets for about $ 2 / bottle , but it is usually only the red or green sauce . I can rarely find the Caribbean sauce or the Exxxtra Hot Sauce . To be honest , the green is by far the hottest of the 4 , and tastes the best . They are all extremely hot , hotter than Tobasco by far , but Green is my favorite . My next favorite would be Caribbean , which is sweet and almost like a jerk sauce . Next comes the Exxxtra Hot Sauce . It has a great smoky flavor that reminds me of Native American cooking . Finally the red sauce . Friggin hot and tasty , just not as good as the other 3 .
5 #### Interesting , unusual variety ! Perfect gift for a hot sauce lover !
2 #### El Yucateco makes some decent hot sauces but like many companies , they produce a confusing array of hot sauces - each different - hoping to capture every possible segment of the hot sauce market . This brand is rarely great but usually reliable - hence my two star rating which may be a bit harsh . The Chipotle and Jalapeo varieties are excellent - 4 or 5 star . This sampler will give you a good introduction . The brown Habanero is quite potent - mostly fiery heat . The red Habanero is almost as hot but has some tomato mixed in . The green Habanero has a bit of garlic and is still quite potent . Yet the brown is the hottest - mostly pure heat . I personally prefer the green . The Chipotle sauce is in an entirely different class , made from a smoked dried jalapeo pepper . No where as hot as the above but truly excellent . El Yucateco almost makes a superb jalapeo sauce that is not included in this sampler , which is a shame .
5 #### I purchased these trying to find the one that I had in a restaurant awhile back . I found it in this 4 pack and I was thrilled ! The green habanero sauce is wonderful in my split pea & ham stew , on pasta and other dishes . The other sauces went well with just about everything else I put them on - it was a tasty experience ! I will definitely purchase these again , especially since I have used them all up already !
5 #### Goes well on fruits and vegetables . If daring , sprinkle on plain yogurt .
1 #### I bought these as gifts to give to some of my couriers , so I ordered 5 or 6 sets , and what I got delivered to me was one single box with each of these different hot sauces individually placed in the box , not put together in a set as you see in the pic , I ended up putting them side by side as you see them in the pic and using packaging tape to hold them together . Obviously did n't look very professional and was very disappointed . The Title says " gift pack " as in they are packaged together , they were n't they all came loosely . Never again will I buy from this seller !
4 #### My Dad got me these hot sauces for Christmas -- they are excellent . So far I have used the hottest one in a wing recipe at New Year 's that added just the right amount of heat for those that like super hot wings . I use the green sauce on eggs primarily and add the red sauce to chili and tacos . I have not used the chipotle but plan to use it for bbq sauces and marinades for summer grillables . Only reason I did n't go 5 stars was that its an open top instead of one with one of those dribblers so you do n't overdue it . The thicker consistency may make this a bit of an engineering problem . . . but I 'll leave that to the engineers to figure out .
3 #### I am kind of disappointed . I was thinking they would have been hotter . For me , it was n't hot enough however for other they might be too hot .
4 #### One star off for price -- but otherwise , great on fruit .
5 #### I get a real kick out of 90 % of American consumers that think everything spicy with a Mexican name is TexMex . El Yucateco products come from the Yucatan not the border . The wonderfully ripened chilies and the fresh flavor they produce is what sets this product apart from their competition . I beleive this is the finest brand of Mexican hot sauce on the market because you can taste the chilies as if they were picked yesterday . All 4 in this set pack some powerful heat however it is a digestable heat that will not trouble you down the road . Get the burn on your tongue and enjoy without any complications . I have been using these products for at least 10 years and they are quite common in our local Hispanic markets here in Arizona . This is a very good Internet price for the gift pack .
5 #### Mixed with Lucas Chamoy Sweet and Sour Chamoy Flavored Powder and it will blow your tastebuds away . Wonderful flavors ! Test to your flavor and you will not be disappointed . I ca n't get it local or regionally so I order from Amazon to get my fix of this spice .
5 #### The green is my favorite hot sauce I 've used while dining in Mexican places . They ship 4 different sauces in this kit . The XXX hot is just a little too hot for my taste . The red has good flavor and is actually not as hot as the green unlike most other sauces the green is more mild . IMO the green has just the right amount of heat and flavor . The last one is the Chipolte and was not very hot and has a little smokey flavor to it , I found it nice on certain foods you do n't want to heat up too much . Overall I think next time I will just buy the green .
5 #### We had the Green Chile Habanero one at a local restaurant and we loved it so much and decided to buy our own . Was very excited to see Amazon has it as a gift pack , so we get to try all 4 flavors . It 's definitely spicy comparing to other regular hot sauce you can purchased at grocery stores .
5 #### Great stuff ! ! ! ! I keep experimenting with it , seasoning different dishes with it , and I have never been disappointed yet . The reason I got it was I saw a recipe for " kale chips " and anything I can find to enhance the flavor of kale makes me happy . I have used it to garnish the tops of deviled eggs ( nice ) . I use it to saut chicken and many other things . Tajin always wakes up the flavor in foods . But do n't use too much or you will be citrused out by the lime .
2 #### I think this is purely personal taste . This seasoning was recommended to me by a lovely southern woman I met on a plane . I really do n't like it on anything I 've tried . I just threw it away after a few months .
3 #### It 's REALLY strong . Like surprisingly strong in the tangy department . It has good flavor but a little goes a LOOOOOOONG way . Have to skimp on the seasoning so the tang does n't overwhelm everything and leave you with nothing but a sour lemon taste in your mouth , which does limit the flavor it does possess from the chilies . In any case , it 's still an interesting flavor and used in moderation can add that lime taste with a very slight hint of pepper . Again , I ca n't reiterate enough , this is powerful and limits the true taste of the chilly flavor it was intended for . Should call it Lime Explosion ! , ( w/ a hint of chilly ) .
5 #### So many uses , micheladas , top ramen , cup of noodles , cocktails , etc ....
5 #### Glad I found this stuff on Amazon ... used a lot for Ghanaian cuisine . Enhances the flavor of stews , meats , and soups !
3 #### FYI .

4 #### I had seen a lot of people rave about this product ... it is quite tasty and with a faint difference from soy sauce but not a whole lot . I would buy it again .
5 #### This stuff is really tasty ! It goes on just about everything . My husband loves it on eggs and any kind of potato .
5 #### This stuff is fantastic ... we use it on everything ! ! ! I might buy 5 bottles next time ! ! !
1 #### Not a good choice if you value your health as Nestle is now producing this product in CHINA ! Keep an eye out on any and all Nestle products as they apparently value corporate greed more then their customers well being ( let alone the employees who likely lost their jobs ! ) .
4 #### This is a favorite seasoning of mine and I like the small size since I have a limited space for storage in my kitchen .
5 #### Amazon has the best price I 've ever found for Maggi Domestic Seasoning so I only buy it from Amazon ; otherwise : Best cooking seasoning you will ever use ! ! ! Once you use this you will never stop . It 's one of the three or four seasonings I HAVE to have in my kitchen to cook ! ! My Mother always used it and to my memory going back to the 1950 's and it has n't changed at all . You wo n't be disappointed in Maggi ! A few drops directly on all meats and fish , in all sauces , all gravies , all vegetables , any grain / noodle dishes and it enhances the flavor 10 fold . If you ever taste a drop on your tongue you 'll think " Oh heck no ! " But put it on the food you 're cooking and it is just magic how it enhances the flavor of all foods ! ! ! Again : You wo n't be disappointed , use it once and you 're stuck ! You will love this stuff ! Turns any bland dish into a flavorful one with just a few drops !
4 #### I really like this , its a very good universal spice , tasts great in soups and salads also great on eggs . I grew up on the stuff and always loved it .... I think its like Marmite , you either love or hate it :-)
5 #### This is a staple that 's been in my frig the past 45 years . Thank you Amazon for keeping it in stock as I 'm having a tough time finding in my local store . I use it in stews , roasts . Even my homemade mac & cheese .
5 #### Love it , it adds a lot of flavor to everything . Will be buying again .
5 #### I use this as a soy sauce substitute , an ingredient in marinades and alone on steak . Versatile and magnificent . No cook should be without it .
3 #### I was hoping this was going to be the same product I 've seen sprinkled on fruit and vegetables on food carts . Unfortunately it 's not and while I usually love the flavor of lime , I did n't like it in Tajin .
3 #### I was hoping this was going to be the product I 've seen sprinkled on fruit and vegetables on food carts but it 's not . I usually love the flavor of lime but I did n't care for the way it tasted in Tajin .
5 #### It 's salty , spicy , and delicious . I sprinkle Tajin on sliced cukes , and I sprinkle it on fish before I broil it . @tasty
5 #### I found out about this stuff at a BBQ a couple years ago , I 've tried it with fruit like it suggests , I 'm not a huge fan , but it 's amazing on everything else . Chicken tacos , Guacamole , salsas , blackened fish . Anything ! This is my " go to " spice and everyone always asks what I used to cook ! Heck I even bought my sister some as a birthday present
5 #### Chili Lime powder to sprinkle on anything . Tart and spicy- really improves simple foods like beans and rice , rotisserie chicken , steamed veggies , etc . Fixes anything that is bland .
5 #### I love this seasoning . It goes great on everything I put it on . I use it as a replacement for salt . It adds a nice mild to kick to everything I use it on .
5 #### I love this seasoning . It goes great on everything I put it on . I use it as a replacement for salt . It adds a nice mild to kick to everything I use it on .
5 #### This product wakes up the taste on every thing I 've tried it on .. fruit , eggs , salads etc spicy , but not like a hot pepper .
5 #### First I used this great , traditional , Mexican , seasoning on Mango . Then it was cottage cheese . Then it was cucumbers ... and on , and on ... I 've become addicted to this . Chili is tasty and leaves a little after - burn , but still on the mild - ish side . You can taste the Lime and Salt , and that gives the tang . Really good !
5 #### This is a very different spice good for fruits & vegetables . It really does give it a tangy kick to whatever you sprinkle it on . If you like tangy & something different for your fruits & vegetables you 'll like this .
5 #### I sprinkle it on everything ! It 's salty and lemony and a little spicy . . . It makes cucumbers taste like a fancy appetizer !
5 #### Who knew someone had already combined these flavors I love ! ? ? Have sprinkled this on fruit ( mango and blueberry - yum ! ) , guacamole ( zippy ! ) and chicken and love what it does to each . Just zesty , not hot . Perfect !
5 #### I actually first had this stuff in Disneyland , of all places . My husband bought a bowl of cut up fruit at a snack bar and there was a little packet of this stuff in there . I love it . It 's spicy , not unbearably hot ( I can only take so much heat in my food , and this is bearable ) , has a bit of sour from lime and counterbalances the sweetness of fruit with salt . I eat a lot of apples with this stuff on it . I slice a whole apple up , and sprinkle it on . I probably have about 7 - 10 apples a week now , because I prefer this type of snack to chips or ice cream ! Have n't tried it on anything else ... I actually use a Creole seasoning for other food ( if you like Tajin , try this one ) . It 's called , " Zatarain 's Creole Seasoning" ... it 's yummers .
4 #### Lime and chile powder to sprinkle on popcorn , etc . Nice lime flavor , not too spicy , and nothing objectionable in the product .
5 #### Good product . I use it all the time . I might have to buy more when i run out because i use a lot ...
5 #### This Tajin fruit seasoning was very delicious on my bowl of fresh cut oranges and mango ! I recommend this item to anyone needing a little spicy boost to their fruits ! Thank you for the speedy delivery !
5 #### I am a HUGE fan of salt and flavored salts to boot . I found this stuff at Walmart and wanted to try it on my home made tortilla chips instead of my usual coating of lemon juice and salt . It was perfect ! So good I actually started eating it from the bottle ! I already mentioned I love salt so that should n't be such a shock ... anyway ... if you love salty , tangy , lemony , hot things , you 'll love this seasoning !
5 #### Yum ! This stuff is great ! I use it on jicama , cucumbers , corn on the cob , fruit -especially watermelon , and the rims of margarita glasses ( guests love it ) . You will find lots of uses for this tangy seasoning . It is not at all hot or spicy -mostly tangy . If you like sour ; you will love this !
5 #### Spicy and tart seasoning for fruit and vegetables , like sliced cucumbers and tomatoes . Tajin seasoning transforms avocados with an amazing burst of flavors . Delicious ! ! Tajin product arrived promptly and in perfect condition from this seller . I will order again , since I have not been able to find this product locally .
5 #### I 'm amazed that this seasoning has so many varied applications ! Do n't be afraid to sprinkle it on ice cream !
5 #### This is one of my favorites . So light and refreshing . Want to add a special touch , create a parfait : mousse , strawberries , fat free cool whip , mousse , strawberries and fat free cool whip .
5 #### This is an excellent product . It tastes like the mousse products you get in Europe , but are hard to find in the USA . Best of all , it contains no sugar . It has an amazingly good taste considering that it lacks sugar . Even tastes good when made with skim milk . It is also very easy to make . I also recommend the lemon flavor of this product . However , the key lime flavor had a bit of an artificial taste to it .
5 #### These are a dieters best friend ... I 've been on a fairly strict low carb diet since January and needed something sweet as a reward . These are sinfully delicious yet sugar free , filling and rewarding ... need both packages for 4 people however . They are very good but also pretty pricey .
2 #### Sorry , nice texture but no flavor ! Slightly bitter no chocolate taste to speak of . Makes very small quantity .
5 #### Taste great , good for my diabetes . If anything , it is costly , more than if I bought it from my local store . Which is hard to find , where I live .
5 #### I love all the flavors of this product . I can use it for an individual or to make other ways of using it , such as in the form of a pie , layering it with other flavors , and even adding fruit or sweet candies such as chocolate chips . Great product .
5 #### Wow , this is very tasty ! It has a nice fresh strawberry flavor , and a terrific texture . This would be wonderful served in a dark chocolate dessert cup .
5 #### I am one of those people who love sweets and a meal is n't finished until you enjoy a sweet finish . I am also one of those people who , maybe because I love sweets , have to watch what I eat . This Mousse mix provides a feeling of fullness and is a satisfying sweet to finish a meal or even for an in between meat treat . I have only used the chocolate Mocha mix and I really loved that . In fact I ordered some Libbey 6 1/2 ounce glass covered containers to be able to stock up in the frig so these will always be on hand .
5 #### I like all the Sans Sucre products I 've tried .... but this strawberry mousse mix was REALLY good ; it did not taste at all like a low sugar / low carb product . I mixed it per the package directions , then folded in finely chopped fresh strawberries and filled a pre - made graham cracker pie crust with the mousse . Hubby pronounced it the best strawberry mousse pie I ever made . I can not find this product locally ; I will certainly be ordering more . Thank you , Amazon !
5 #### Yummy yum ! I love these mousses . I get several flavors . The cappuccino is the best for me . I also like the cheesecake ( I add cream cheese to it ) and the strawberry and lemon .
3 #### Most of the pieces arrived broken and I had to " glue " them back together with icing . If not for that , I liked them and they looked cute on the cupcakes I made for the baby shower .
1 #### Many of these came to me broken . They were packaged well so I am not sure why . I have purchased these before but did not have this problem .
5 #### I used these on cupcake favors for a baby shower . Put 3 on each cupcake . Guests loved them -- they're adorable . And edible ! None of mine came broken -- they were very carefully padded and boxed . HIGHLY RECOMMEND !
5 #### I have to LOL at everyone complaining about the price . Pay attention . When you se something unusually expensive , with " free shipping " , that means they have already calculated in the shipping cost . Wake up ! ! Wickles are the best ! ! ! If you ca nt find them at Walmart , get walmarts Private Selection " Snackers " the are identical .
1 #### Not for me . I was trying to find a substitute for Famous Dave 's Sweet & Spicy pickles . Threw them out .
5 #### These are the best . Great with Tuna sandwich or on turkey
5 #### The Sans Sucre Lemon Mousse Mix is a very good tasting and light diabetic friendly snack . The lemon flavor is not overpowering and does n't have a " fake " taste that other diet products seem to have . The suggested serving size is a little small as we got 3 reasonable size servings instead of the four indicated on the packet . We also discovered that if you over whip it , the mousse mix makes a nice topper as well . We also like the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Sans - Sucre - Mousse - Mix - Chocolate - Cheesecake / dp / B0000ESTGX / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Sans Sucre Mousse Mix - Chocolate Cheesecake</a>&nbsp;a lot ! Recommended !
5 #### This is an excellent product . It tastes like the mousse products you get in Europe , but are hard to find in the USA . Best of all , it contains no sugar . It has an amazingly good taste considering that it lacks sugar . Even tastes good when made with skim milk . It is also very easy to make , and the cost per serving , which works out to 35 cents per serving is incredibly low ( but I think most folks will eat a larger serving than what is suggested on the box ) . I also recommend the strawberry flavor of this product . However , the key lime flavor had a bit of an artificial taste to it .
5 #### Taste great , good for my diabetes . If anything , it is costly , more than if I bought it from my local store . Which is hard to find , where I live .
3 #### The splenda flavoring was too strong . It ruined the taste of the lemon .
5 #### This sugar - free delight has a nice lemony flavor ! Would make a great pie filling , too !
5 #### I am one of those people who love sweets and a meal is n't finished until you enjoy a sweet finish . I am also one of those people who , maybe because I love sweets , have to watch what I eat . This Mousse mix provides a feeling of fullness and is a satisfying sweet to finish a meal or even for an in between meat treat . I have only used the chocolate Mocha mix and I really loved that . In fact I ordered some Libbey 6 1/2 ounce glass covered containers to be able to stock up in the frig so these will always be on hand .
3 #### I would prefer a stronger , more natural lemon taste . The last batch I made of this flavor did not get thick enough , despite my care in using cold skim milk , etc .
5 #### I love Sans Mousse Mix , but I wish they used a natural sweetener , nevertheless I highly recommend this and all her flavors .
5 #### I use alternative milk like rice , soy , or coconut for lactose intolerance . The chocolate and mocha flavors are very good too .
5 #### Too expensive , but really good . I use them with other recipes . I would recommend them to a friend a rich one .
2 #### I typically like anything lemon ; however , this is a big disappointment . It has a " fake " lemon flavor and is a bit too sweet . Sometimes makers of products containing non - sugar sweeteners have a tendency to overdo it . Although the chocolate and chocolate cappuccino flavors are wonderful , I would definitely skip this lemon version .
4 #### I really like this as a pie or tart . I often add fresh berries as a topping . When I use it for company it is always a hit . So nice to have a sugar free , low fat dessert that really does taste good .
5 #### I love almost all of the flavors , be it cheesecake or mousse . I do not enjoy the chocolate ones as much . I use a blender to mix them because it is less mess .
4 #### I love these Sans Sucre desserts , but only give 4 stars since this one was not too " cheese - cakey " tasting .
5 #### The flavor of this cheesecake mousse is outstanding . This product contains real cheese powder and I love it . I do not make the mousse mix ; I put 2 or 3 tablespoons of the dry mix in my vanilla whey - protein drink each morning and it 's so good that I bounce out of bed every morning and ( well , after doing morning - type things like washing , etc . ) almost run for the kitchen to make this drink and take my vitamins . What a treat ! I know it contains Splenda , and Splenda gets a bad review in certain circles , but 2 or 3 tablespoons of this mousse mix ups my drink from good to heavenly so it stays . Please , eDietShop , keep selling this and I will keep buying it . Cheers !
5 #### Delicious . Being that it 's sugar free it had a good natural flavor without the bad after taste like other sugar free mixes . Just follow directions .
5 #### I was on an Atkins diet for six months , and this product helped me stay on my diet . It 's delicious and flavored with Splenda -- which is a big plus for me since aspartame gives me migraines . While on Atkins , I modified the mix by using half cream and half water instead of the recommended skimmed milk . It fluffed up faster that way and had less carbs . After I had gastric bypass surgery , I tried eating it using skim milk but found that the added whipped air in the mousse did n't sit well on my post - surgery stomach . ( Air / gas is not a gastric bypass patient 's friend . ) It 's been over three months now , so I 'm willing to give it another try . I would hate to give this stuff up because it 's the best I 've found ( Jello brand sugar free cheesecake pudding tastes like wallpaper paste -- a horrible consistency and flavor ! ) Here 's hoping that I can tolerate the whipped mousse again !
5 #### I stumbled across this once in the grocery store and my stepson begs for it . All you add is skim milk . I whip up two packages , spoon it in four wine glasses and top with canned pie cherries . Chill for a couple of hours before serving . It 's low in sugar . My stepdaughter wo n't eat it as she tastes the splenda , but the rest of the family loves it .
5 #### I add real cream cheese to the cheesecake one and it really adds a good flavor . To lighten it up I FOLD in some thawed Cool Whip or whipped cream . It 's too thick otherwise . I also add less milk than what they all call for to make it thicker and then add the fluffiness by folding in the whipped topping . Try it you will like it . With the Cappicino one I also add a T. or more of strong instant coffe or instant espresso . It makes it much richer . Let your imagination go with these . I have added some in the center of cakes too .
5 #### I 've been eating Cross & Blackwell 's chow - chow since I was a child , and there 's nothing like it and no replacement that I 've found . It 's impossible to buy in groceries where I live , but now I can buy it online ! It 's not quite as great as it was when I was younger , when it had whole pearl onions and largish chunks of cauliflower in it , but the taste is the same . It would be even better , though , if it were more as it was before . It 's a great condiment .
5 #### My wife is from London UK and she loves this stuff . good product
5 #### I 've eaten Crosse and Blackwell Chow Chow for most of my life . My parents loved it , and so did my British grandfather . But it 's hard to get here , so I 've tried other pickles that call themselves " chow chow " and boy have I been disappointed . They range from bland to a peculiar metallic sweetness that makes me want to yak . I 've never encountered anything quite like the C&B mustard pickle , and I 'm just grateful that I can order it online . This is perfect with cheese , or on a roast beef sandwich . I like it with fried fish , or sometimes just on a cracker . It 's got a fantastic bite to it , and the ingredients - gherkins , onions , cauliflower - are nice and crispy ... And now I 'm craving this stuff . This is n't for the faint of heart . You bite into it , it bites back . If you love that kind of thing , give it a try . If you do n't , just stay away .
5 #### i love this quinoa . this is the 3rd time i buy it . I love cooking it . There are some great recipes online
5 #### Its best price I found just be sure to risen very well or it will taste bitter . Nice change from rice .
5 #### This was my first time trying Quinoa , and I loved it . I found the product itself to be well packaged , and delivered as advertised . I will be eating a lot more Quinoa , and I will stick with Eden .
5 #### I just made the Chocolate Mousse : very , very nice . Has a nice dark chocolate taste . Easy to make : combine powder and fat - free milk in your mixer , then chill . 70 calories per serviing of half a cup . Even has some fiber in it ! I do like dealing with eDiet shop . Very nice people and fast shipping .
5 #### Excellent product . Easy to make and good to eat .
5 #### This stuff is fantastic , silky smooth and yet light , BUT , it 's not cheap and you need both packages to serve 4 people .
4 #### This is yummy considering there s no sugar added . Whips up nice and moussy .
5 #### this is the best tasting stuff ever ... even better than thej ello instant pudding . i am a lacto vegtarian because i just ca nt stop cheese but i do n't use milk i make this with so delicious unsweetened coconut milk and it comes out fabulous . my blood sugars are in the high normal(110 - 125 ) but that s been the last year or so and i monitor and try to watch carbs and sugar or sweeteners .. i have tried all flavors ( except cheesecakes which i do n't like and not yet the lemon ) my least favorite was the mocha cappuchino.i am sorry to say i do n't buy here at amazon because its so expensive . netrition.com has the cheapest even with the $ 5.99 shipping .
3 #### needs a mixer . Strike one . Not much better than sugar free pudding
5 #### I eat these all the time and love them !
5 #### This is delicious and has a rich , dark chocolate flavor ! Great for low carb dieters . I made it using unsweetened soy milk , and it was absolutely , sinfully , yummy ! I love the creamy texture .
4 #### I wo n't lie to you and say it 's amazingly yummy - but it is definitely quite good for a healthy option . Light texture light flavor , nice product . Just nothing can really beat good ol' cream and sugar ;)
4 #### If you 're cutting carbs or sugar but still want a nice treat this is a good choice . While there is a bit of an after taste there is no gastric distress after eating . Nice treat .
4 #### When you ca n't have much sugar in your diet but would like to have a bit of mousse now and then , this really meets the need . Easy to make in a hurry and just tasty enough to make up for not being allowed to eat deserts with real sugar in them .
5 #### I love Sans Mousse Mix , but I wish they used a natural sweetener , nevertheless I highly recommend this and all her flavors .
4 #### I love chocolate . This satisfied my craving . It 's light and airy while filling . I would serve it to friend and family .
1 #### If you 're like me , you ordered this product to reduce your blood sugar . Unfortunately , the second ingredient is maltodextrin , whose glicemic index ( 110 ) is nearly twice that of table sugar ( 65 ) . Add to that the hydrogenated palm kernel oil and you 're not looking at health food . The funny part is that it is sugar free . Instead , they 've substituted something that is far worse for blood sugar than table sugar .
4 #### Have tried the Choc and Choc / Cheesecake flavors . Sometimes make low - fat Mousse from scratch ( tip : the liquid lecithin in my recipe is what makes the difference ) . If you use this stuff according to label ( the right milk , blend it right ) it makes a tasty mousse that does n't make me wish I did it from scratch . If you make it and it is n't smooth / creamy enough for you do n't add cream , try a tad of lecithin :)
3 #### I made the mistake of eating Jell - o brand NON sugar free first , so while this probably is awesome ... after having had the Jell - o brand that is 120 calories a serving ( but I make it with skim milk so it comes out somewhere less than that - maybe 100 ) This Sans Sucre stuff falls a little short on fullness of taste and texture . BUT ... what I have taken to doing because I know this is so much better for me is I take a pack of this and a pack of the jell - o and I make two batches together at one time .. a double batch . So I 'm getting a little bit of the better texture and taste from the Jell - o brand but still saving a few calories . On it 's own , the Sans Sucre is passable but really bland for me the taste is sweet but not full or rounded , because it 's just hard when you 're palate is used to the sugary fattening stuff . So I recommend if your palette is NOT used to anything start out on this , then you 'll save yourself a lot of calories and not know the difference .
5 #### I really like this for a light low fat treat . I thought this was going to be low carb for some reason , but its not . It is sugar free and low fat .
3 #### The Jelly Beans are good . But the price is very high for the amount of jelly beans in the box . I would never buy this box again .
2 #### I bougt these for my diabetic girlfriend and they were not the hit I was hoping they 'd be . She ate less than half the box in matter of few weeks and threw the rest away . The taste was n't good and she stated they left an aftertaste . I would not recommend this although I do n't know of any sugar - free candy that does taste good .
3 #### Of the ten flavors , only the juicy pear , licorice and sizzling cinnamon are worth eating . The more subtle , pure fruit flavors are spoiled by the hard , chalky shell IMO .
3 #### Having diabetes , I have to purchase items that are sugar fee . As an old Jelly Belly fan , I saw these and thought that I would give them a try . They are not the Jelly Belly 's that I remember ! The outer shell is very , very hard - seems harder than hard candy , in fact - but if you suck on them a bit , you still get that wonderful taste .
5 #### Good flavor . But very expensive for the quantity . Would not buy again
5 #### great tasting product . only problem was that i could not stop eating them . Make sure you do n't do that or be prepared to stay near a bathroom . Yet they are great .
5 #### Lawry 's Seasoned Salt is great on beef but this is the first time that I have bought it in years . These days we recognize the need to reduce salt consumption . There are dozens of low salt and no salt seasoning mixes available , and I will use Lawry 's sparingly .
5 #### Lawry 's is my favorite seasoned salt . On almost everything . I can use Lawry 's and my hot sauce of the day , to cover almost anyone 's bland cooking . You 'll never go hungry if you have Lawry 's . I can make cardboard edible .
5 #### Used for past 4 decades ( & then some ) , as did my Moms before me . Lawry 's Seasoned Salt is 2nd to none .
5 #### I love this Lawry 's season . I received from Buzzagent for an honest review . I used the Seasoning with beef and a can of tomatoes sauce stir and mix . It 's that simple . Makes yourt delicious . My food has never tasted so much better ! The spices do not upset my stomach and are not too spicy . I will buy again . I got one pack of this seasoning from Buzzagent during their campaign . The packet was easy to use and the beef turned out pretty tasty . I added a can of tomatoes sauce . They turned out great ! The best thing is that it does n't have any MSG , nor coloring
5 #### Lawry 's has always been a great seasoning that has been passed down throughout generations of my family . I absolutely love it for turkey burgers , chicken , shish kabobs , pasta , you name it ! All it takes is a very light hand and the entire family 's taste buds will be awakened ! I received this complimentary from BzzAgent . All opinions are my own .
5 #### I just started using Lawry 's Seasoned Salt recently , after getting a sample from BzzAgent . Found out that it tastes great on ribs , chicken , casseroles , and even deviled eggs . Uses all of the spices and salt combinations that I normally use when cooking . This blend is perfect for every meat dish or casserole that you can cook , grill , or bake . My family loves Lawry 's Seasoned Salt .
5 #### I recently discovered an unopened container of Lawry 's Seasoned Salt , origin unknown / unremembered , when cleaning out my cabinet and started using . I usually season food I cook from scratch very well ; however , this has come in so handy to give less than adequately seasoned foods instant flavor ... so much so that I am coming to the end of the bottle and just ordered another one from Amazon . Especially handy to give flavorless frozen vegetables a boost .
5 #### I grew up on this . This is the ONLY seasoned salt to use , nothing else passes this for flavor and blend . I use this on virtually every savory dish I prepare instead of plain salt and pepper .
5 #### This has good flavor but be warned it is quite HOT as well . Enjoy:- )
5 #### Wanted to try something different than the usual hot sauces and was not disappointed . Very hot at first but one you get over the initial heat it is delicious
5 #### If you like it hot , this picante wo n't disappoint . I regularly use this brand hot sauce at home because the flavor is quite good . I came across this XXXXtra hot model , could n't find it locally , so ordered it from Amazon just for a try . Quite good .
5 #### I love Hot Foods ! But it has to taste good . This is Very Hot but has a terrific and very distinct flavor . ( Almost like a refrito smell to it . Unlike any other Hot Sauce I 've ever tried , and I 've tried Hundreds of them , I 'm a spice junkie ! ) If you like heat , but are tired of every Hot Sauce tasting like a cross between Tabasco and Buffalo Wing Sauce , you should give this a try . It does n't take much to spice up a bowl of Chili or soup . A little bottle goes a long way . Between this and Sriracha sauce , they top my list of Favorite Hot Sauces ( Sriracha is # 2 ) It is very hot , but not stupidly so , like " Nuckin ' Futts " or " Mega - Death Sauce " , but it is still hot , so , if you are n't sure if it 's too hot for you , it probably will be .
3 #### This is way better than Tabasco and far cheaper too . Buy it at Walmart , since that is where it 's cheapest .
4 #### I love this stuff . I 'm on my second bottle . Not too hot that you ca n't pour it on your tacos ( YMMV ) . Slightly garlicky but not overbearingly so . It 's not vinegary like Tabasco and it 's thick kinda like ketchup . The green color is quite bright and appealing . I give it four stars because it has preservatives and artificial colorings .
4 #### El Yucateco ( " one from the Yucatn " ) is a powerful hot sauce . After traveling extensively in the south of Mxico , I had a hankering for the heat and tastes of the foods typical of that area . I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this . There is a good deal of heat , not overpowering , and not to the detriment of the taste of the sauce . As far as characterizing the taste , I would describe it as very " earthy " . You definitely can detect the habanero , but there is a complex multitude of other spices that come out after the initial heat subsides . Other sauces this hot I find sacrifice unique taste for heat . A good sign is that if this sauce was not spicy , I would still use it . I am not a very technical cook , so I can not honestly tell you what dishes this sauce is most appropriate for . I can tell you however that it enhanced every dish I used it on , from adding heat to burritos , to making some plain rice more interesting . I would advise those sensitive to hot sauces to first test this on a toothpick . Also when cooking with it , make sure to pour the sauce into a spoon first , because a little bit of this sauce goes a long way , and the heat does take a minute or two to start to dissipate , you would n't want to ruin an entire dish by adding too much heat . I would most definitely buy this sauce again !
5 #### Io adoro " Baci ! " Great tasting dark chocolates with hazelnut cream mix and nuts . Lizioso !
5 #### One word : delicious . Not as good as bought freshly , but it still hits the spot .
5 #### The best chocolate ever ! Italians know how to do it .
5 #### The best chocolate out there ! ! ! ! Truly , honestly , you will love it ! ! ! Great gift ! Great taste ! ! ! Yam : )
5 #### This is chocolate at its best , I had 3 bags .... none left , all gone !
5 #### Great chocolate treat . Delightful milk chocolate with crushed hazelnuts , coating a whole hazelnut . Delicious ... kinda reminds me of Ferrero Rocher but much tastier as the chocolate is creamier and the hazelnut is fresh and crunchy . Also comes with cute little love notes in each chocolate . What a delightful gift .
5 #### I bought the galllon , taste great , most likely I will die before I can finish this but at least I never have to worry about having enough liquid smoke at my home ....
4 #### I remember Wright 's Liquid Smoke from when I was a teenager . Now I find that it predates WWI and I have some old Wright 's brochures from about 1910 ( they carry no date , but quote 1906 - 1907 testimonials ) . The product is slightly different than the one I remember from years ago , perhaps because this product is no longer made by Wright 's . That notwithstanding , the product performs well in actural use . It also has a reputation among amateur sausagemakers and bacon makers , as the best of the liquid smokes . I use mine in meat curing and sausagemaking . The only decent alternatives would be powdered smoke or a smokehouse .
5 #### Great value and taste . I use this for BBQ pork , which I make in bulk and freeze . I am so glad to have found this !
5 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Wright - s - Liquid - Smoke - Hickory-1 - gal / dp / B0000TA3SK / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Wright 's Liquid Smoke , Hickory , 1 gal.</a > This is a great saver . I am a vegetarian , and this product seasons beans and soups . I use this gallon size because it saves me trips back and forth to the store . The flavor is very good .
5 #### Delicious product when it comes to making smokey flavors
5 #### Beenusing Wrights brand of liquid smoke for years is far better than the collagen brand in terms of strength and taste .
5 #### very pleased with the smoke flavor and price , something I ca n't find in my town stores
5 #### I did not want to purchase a large bottle , but for the price of a 3 1/2 ounce bottle costing so much per ounce , I could n't pass it up .
5 #### Best liquid smoke I have ever used . I bought a small bottle and went through it very quickly . Buying the gallon was a great deal and it has a pretty far off expiration date .
4 #### You get a good deal for the amount you get compared to the cost . However , the scent / flavor is n't as strong as other brands I 've used .
5 #### The best liquid smoke there is . You ca n't beat this brand and hickory . It is all natural smoke . No chemical bs ! !
5 #### Good liquid smoke product for cooking and barbecue sauce .
5 #### I use to buy the small bottles at the supermarket . They were expensive . Now I found this on amazon at a great price . I just refill the small bottles when it came empty . The flavor is great . I add a little to any thing that I want BBQ flavor and presto it 's like I smoked them for hours . I keep it in my garage which is cool to cold . This gallon jug will last me forever .
5 #### I never used but it sounds good . I will find out .
5 #### THIS WRIGHT LIQUID SMOKE HICKORY FLAVOR GIVES YOUR MEAT AN GREAT TASTE . YOU CAN USE IT ON MORE THAN MEATS . GREAT SMOKE TASTE.GREAT WHEN YOU BARBEQUE .
4 #### Will use to improve flavor of plant based food .
5 #### Taste like it should and I refill into a smaller bottle .
5 #### Nothing like the taste of smoke for bean with ( not ) bacon soup !
5 #### Good price and quick delivery for a flavor additive that I 've used all my life and formerly paid a lot more for a tiney bottle . Thia is probably a lifetime supply .
5 #### If you make jerky or BBQ sauce , ribs , etc . , this is essential for that fabulous , smokey flavor . Even the package smelled wonderful . If you buy this by the gallon you will think of many ways to upgrade the everyday recipes you use for meats & sauces . Kitchen smells wonderful . LOVE it .
5 #### liquid goes right into making bbq smelling and tasting like great smoke hit it . i use gas grill and this aids in flavoring of the bbq . like good old days of smoking it .
5 #### I am so grateful to have found this - the quality of Huckleberry Haven has long been known to me , and this will taste good on my toast , but also as a glaze for my broiled salmon ! Wonderful company , wonderful product .
4 #### Jam was a little too sweet but Hubby liked it .
5 #### This jam is absolutely delicious ! We first tasted wild huckleberry jam this May when we traveled to Glacier National Park . Now , we enjoy our memories of the trip with our jam and biscuits ! Incidentally , this jam is made in Kalispell , Montana -- about a half hour away from Glacier National Park !
5 #### This is a really wonderful jam . I bought it to go with a dessert recipe ( grilled pound cake with jam and brie ) and it was an excellent addition and was great in a simple PB&J later in the week .
5 #### My favorite Jelly in the world ! This jelly is hard to harvest as the bears on the mountain side love the berries as much as we do .
3 #### Coating has good flavor balance and enhances the pecan flavor . More of the pecans are pieces and chunks than there are of truly recognizable whole pecans which disappoints .
3 #### I 've had better glazed walnuts from Aldi 's . However , they 're not always available , which is why I tried this product . I love the plain Diamond walnuts !
5 #### Arrived as described and timely . Throw a few of these into pretty much anything to improve the taste . Works well with baked goods , salad , etc .
5 #### Love this product . I subscribe to get one package monthly because I ca n't find it in my local stores .
5 #### Delicious in a salad with strawberries and spring mix ! YUM
5 #### this tea is just wonderful ! i had purchased it here in town a few years back , but unfortunately can no longer find it anywhere in my area . i was so glad i was able to purchase it thru amazon . i 'd like to try more products from this vendor , as their huckleberry tea is a real hit . i 'm a coffee drinker & rarely drink tea , so when i do have tea , it has to be a warm , fuzzy memorable experience . this tea has just the right balance of huckleberry flavor , & is a very good , well made product . this tea would make a wonderful gift for the tea aficionado .
5 #### You ca n't beat its price anywhere in my town . Glazed nuts seem to be SO expensive and are a great addition to salads . I use them constantly and love the taste . Very reasonable price and with subscribe and save I never run out of my favorite salad topping .
5 #### I used to purchase this tea on the coast of Oregon about 20 years ago - how wonderful to find it on Amazon , now that I live on the opposite side of the country ! I love it !
5 #### These are delicious on a salad , will definitely buy again .
2 #### Since I did n't like the flavor of this tea I am not a good person to judge this particular brand . There are so many black fruit teas that I love , such as Black Current , Peach Coconut and Pumpkin Spice to name a few . I would always reach for those before I would go for this tea . Luckily , I only had to purchase one tin so unlike many other teas on Amazon where the cost reflects 6 boxes , this time I took a chance and it did not pay off for me . I do wish this company and other companies would indicate whether the flavorings in their teas are natural or artificial . I have a feeling that if the flavoring in this tea is artificial that would negatively affect the flavor but I ca n't say that 's the case because the tin does n't make that clear . If you know you love Huckleberry Tea then you should give this one a try .
5 #### I bought this for my ex - wife who likes herbal and fruit flavored teas . She said this was very good ! I recommend it .
1 #### If I had known this is tea with flavoring , then I would n't have ordered it . I get sick from green tea and black tea . That 's why I gave it one star . I thought it was elderberry tea , which it is n't .
5 #### A very good tea . Had my first cup this afternoon . I normally do n't like flavored teas , but this is a mild Elderberry flavor , not overpowering like some flavored tea . Just right ! A great way to relax in the afternoon . I expected loose tea , but these are teabags . I will be buying more of this and it will make nice gifts .
1 #### When I opened the tin for the first time my nose was assaulted with a strange off putting smell likened to a wet rag with a metallic after taste . I 've had elderberry tea before which has a bit of a tart taste but this tea has an indescribable bitter after taste . I do n't like the taste & will not buy again . Unpleasant smell & taste . Disappoint with this product & it 's not cheap !
5 #### First , I loved the tin this tea arrived in . I will enjoy it for many years to come . Second , the delivery was fast and well packaged . The tea arrived in pristine condition . And the tea is wonderful . It tastes freshly picked and infused . I will be buying from this supplier again .
5 #### I have been looking for the Elderberry Tea for my immune system . I love the tin that the tea is packaged in and I will give some for gifts . Thank you
4 #### I liked the elderberry tea , it does have a flowery taste but is not overpowering . It is pricey but I was willing to try it for health reasons . The tea is supposed to help your immune system ward off things like the flu . I used it for a time , set it aside and then caught 3 colds in succession lasting 6 weeks . Not being much of a tea drinker , I wo n't use it regularly and never did while sick !
5 #### The wife and I are big on making meals from scratch and making our own sauces . Chili is a favorite meal at our place and leftover chili goes into chili dogs for a second meal . If you have ever had a chili dog with sauerkraut , then you know what heaven is . Anyway , we have discovered that this chili sauce makes better tasting chili than anything we can put together using spices from our kitchen and my own home made tomato sauce using my own garden tomatoes . What we like to do is mix 1 jar of the spicy sauce , 1 pound of hamburger , a can of chili beans , and a can of beer . Let it cook down and you have the best chili ever . If you do n't like spicy , there is the original flavor of this mix which does n't have such a bite . We like the spicy ourselves .
5 #### Best chili starter out there . I would definitely recommend this for a spicy ( but not too spicy or hot ) chili base . I can not find it in stores and was so glad Amazon can get it for me .
5 #### Sometimes I just do n't have the time to make chili from scratch and really want chili so I thought I 'd try this . It 's delicious ! I sauted some onions and ground beef then added this jar of goodness and voila ! My chili was ready to enjoy in less than 10 minutes . I 've ordered 3 more jars to keep in the cupboard for chili emergencies .
5 #### I just picked up a jar of this at our local supermarket . I added approx 1 lb of browned / ground beef and a can of black beans . It looked and smelled good but from the look of it I felt like added a cana of tomato paste & equal amt of water . I loved the result . I think I do like my chili a little more tomato - y than some people , so you might be just fine w/o the addition of the paste . It was a little spicier than I ususally like , but not over the top , still very good . I served in a bowl with a piece of cornbread on top . Everyone liked it except my youngest daughter , ( 8yo ) , will make it again .
5 #### This is the perfect base to start chili . i add some browned chopped meat and a can of beans , a small can of chunky tomatoes , and it is perfect .
2 #### Someone gave me a jar of this and , after trying it , I wo n't be buying any in the future . Needs to be doctored up BIG TIME ! I added fresh sauteed onions , peppers , and jalapenos as well as some chile de arbol . Also lots of oregano and cumin and garlic . This sauce has no heat despite the Tabasco label . Very disappointed . I do think it would make a good base for a salsa with fresh cilantro , green onion , and jalapeno or serrano peppers added along with a bit of lime juice . I live in New Mexico and we do n't need starter for our chile !
5 #### Love this stuff just ca n't find in stores . Makes a good base for chili . Comes in the original recipe and spicy . I use both when I make a big batch of chili . I would highly recommend this for anyone making chili .
5 #### I love easy . This makes yummy chili super easy ! Brown some onions and meat , toss in beans if you like ( I prefer my chili without ) add this sauce and warm it all up and chili is done !
5 #### Low carb but big taste . Do n't let the Tobasco name scare you off if you are heat averse . It is the perfect level of spice for our family . I just add kidney , red , and black beans with a bag of Morningstar Grillers crumbles for a delicious healthy meal .
5 #### The product arrived today and I have already opened it and cooked a batch of chili . It is heavy on tomato but we love tomatoes so no problem there ; it is well balanced and perfectly spiced , and I am sure it will be even better tomorrow . I normally make my chili from scratch and bought this because I got tired of my flavors and wanted something different ; I am glad I did and I will definitely get more of this for my pantry .
5 #### Tabasco chili recipe sauce is very tasty and you can make chili in a hurry by adding cooked ground meat . The original blend is not overly spicy and goes great with sweet cornbread muffins or if you 're more daring , jalapeno cornbread .
4 #### I discovered Tiger Chai a few years back at a little cafe , and have been enamoured with it 's flavour ever since . It 's a bit of a far cry from either homemade chai or the more common instant ones ( Morning Glory or Oregon ) , but it 's really quite addicting . I have to be careful not to drink more than 2 or 3 cups once I get started ! The only drawback with this powder is the inclusion of the nasty , super - processed instant creamer . They do n't put enough of it in the mix to really make the product creamy at all - you have to still mix it with whole milk to really make it into chai . However , you can still taste the awful artificial stuff . It would be so nice to get a version without the instant creamer - you could add some milk and this would qualify for being hands - down the best instant chai on the market . Mixed with milk , it 's still very good , but I do n't recommend using just hot water .
5 #### It 's rich and creamy , sweet but not overly or sickly sweet . I 've tried it hot and cold , both ways were delicious . It 's like drinking dessert and tastes like a gingerbread cookie . If you enjoy sweet chai tea you should certainly try it !
5 #### I was buying this chai from World Market , but they stopped selling it ! I have tried so many other brands and varieties , and nothing comes close to this delicious mix . So , Here I am on Amazon buying it because this is the only place I can find it . I am getting the 4 lb bag because it will not go to waste . All of my friends who have tried it love it . My coworkers who sit near me just smell the open canister and comment on how delicious it smells , so I have to buy some for them too so they do n't drink all of my chai ! If you are in doubt , buy this one , you will love it ! If you do n't love it , send it to me :-)
5 #### Nuff said . I love tiger spice . They use it at saxbys . Add milk , water , anything you like ... even make it dirty with a shot of espresso . Woof , amazing .
5 #### This Chai is very good , but paying [ ... ] for 2 cans ( including shipping ) is just too much . Great product , just too expensive .
4 #### Pretty good and sugar free . That 's important enough to buy again . I like another brands flavor a bit more but it has a lot of sugar . Really good in the evening with a top off of Bailey 's or St. Brendans cream .
5 #### Love this stuff ! I make it with coconut , almond or soy milk , and it is superb !
1 #### I love Chai Lattes and was hoping for a sugar free option , however this product is bitter and has a bad after taste . I still love the other products by this company and rate other products 5 stars , just not this one .
5 #### I tried this Chai at my sister 's when I visited her in Costa Rica and fell in love with the taste . I ordered from Amazon and now I can enjoyed it at my office and at home . Happy !
5 #### Good tea . I make mine with hot water and 2 tsp of tea mix . If you like it stronger you can add more , or for a creamier , use milk . I would buy this again and again .
2 #### This is okay but I do n't think I 'd buy it again . I was looking for a low carb chai and this is n't all that . Plus I was expecting bigger cans and it tasted really watered down no matter how many scoops you added .
5 #### This does not taste sugarfree . It has a rich creamy flavor and smells so yummy ! Took it to work and co - workers all enjoyed it too . I love this stuff !
5 #### If you love cheddar cheese , you will love this assortment from igourmet.com ... The cheese manages to be sharp yet sweet to my pallet ... For cheese lovers only ... An excellent gift ... 5 star rated ....
5 #### Very impressed with the different cheese and how wonderful they tasted . I would order this and others as well . Thanks
5 #### This cheese made it to Afghanistan ! I love cheese and being deployed that 's one of the things I missed . I gave it a shot and order it and it arrived to me in perfect condition . Well packed and vaccumed sealed . Great taste ! ! !
5 #### My igourmet order was quick and easy , and arrived in good condition . While I prevaricated about spending this much for cheddars , I 'm glad I did . It was a nice treat for a special occasion --- these are unusually flavorful and delightful , and each type has its own flavor notes . The important thing is to find recipes or uses that do n't in any way obscure the amazing flavors !
5 #### I am usually not overly impressed with these samplers of specialty cheeses , but I do run a cross one now and again that simply stand out . This is one of them . I fully admit to being almost addicted to good cheddar so perhaps this is part of it . The quality of this cheese , even after being shipped all over the place and from heaven knows where , is absolutely excellent . My sweet friend Brenda sent me this one and it is going to take some hard work to figure out how to top her on this one . Secret for you : I plan to purchase one or two of these myself soon horde it away , and simply not share ! I do recommend you give this sampler a try ... you will be absolutely delighted .
5 #### I get this one and the Mango and mix them in a large jar . I use this to make my iced tea and it tastes wonderful without sugar , which is a huge plus .
5 #### This tea is very nice . I love all the China Mist teas I 've tried so far . I used it in an iced tea maker and it turns out perfect every time . I sometimes mix this tea with the China Mist passion fruit tea and that is also very nice . It reminds me of the tea served at the Cheesecake factory-- not exact but close enough .
5 #### This is my second box . Since I use a home iced tea maker , I cut a few pouches open at a time and store in an air tight container . You could use the whole pouch but it 's a waste of tea . I put 4 rounded teaspoons in the basket with a coffee filter . I always use filtered water instead of tap water , and the clear cubes from the grocery are hugely better than tap water cubes although I usually end up using tap water cubes and the result is still great . To my taste , it does n't need sugar . I love this tea so much that I go through a pitcher every day . I even take it and my iced tea maker on vacation . Once you 've had China Mist , there is no going back to mediocre tea . This tea was what enabled me to get off the Cokes .
5 #### First had this at the San Diego Zoo and it got my attention right away ! It 's soooo good without being sweet ! ! Hunted it down and bought a bunch , love this stuff ! !
5 #### The taste of this tea is extremely wonderful . Not too sweet and is just right . Will buy again .
5 #### LOVE this tea -I drink it iced all day . This is so refreshing w nice soft notes of blackberry and jasmine . I do n't need sugar in it .. its so yummy unsweetened ! * Note : pitcher sized bags .
5 #### Love , love , love this tea . Hard to find in stores , so this is a great outlet to purchase it from . Thanks .
5 #### I searched for it after having it at P.F. Changs restaurant once . The only thing that I did n't pay attention to is the fact that these are bags that are big enough to make a large quantity ( 2 quarts maybe ? ) of tea and there is only about 5 bags per box . I thought I was getting individual tea bags . But I did n't read the description well ! But I make a jug of this stuff and it 's very refreshing on a hot day !
5 #### I gave up diet coke last year . I drink water but it gets old after a while . I do n't like sweet tea , but I do like to have a little flavor . This is has such a wonderful , light flavor . Even my kids like this tea ! I 've been stocking up so that I have plenty at all times !
3 #### It is OK , but I still prefer Kona from Trader Joe 's both for the quality and for the price . If I am out of Trader Joe 's Kona , this would be my next choice .
5 #### This is amazing I 'll never use anything else again .
5 #### Easy to use with the vodka . Gets a nice finish . Shipped super fast as well .
5 #### This product exceeded my expectations . I 'm really happy with the rich gold color I was able to obtain using this applied on fondant . It did take a couple of coats but even the first coat still had a nice opacity that would 've been fine on it 's own . Are use this to color a unicorn horn for a cake and it was fantastic . The gold was very bright and beautiful , it took about 3 coats to get it the way I wanted but it went on easily . I applied it dry and mixed with lemon extract or vodka and both methods worked well .
4 #### Works well but have to use a lot of the product to achieve the color .
4 #### Bought this to make my cookies a bit fancy . I used cheap vodka to make the mix and the result is stunning . Vodka dries quickly and no tazte
5 #### This a beautiful color . I put just a little in a shot glass either a little vodka to make a paint . Gold always makes you bakery items look extra special . ( Do nt our out shot glass of paint . Let the vodka dry up and use it again because mostly likely you will have gold left over . )
3 #### This adds a nice shine but is not very pigmented like the gold luster dust is . I had to start with a very dark gray fondant to get it to actually look silver . When mixed with vodka to make paint the pigmentation is even less . Not great like the gold , but I still made it work .
5 #### Love The Shine- Great Product and coverage . I have been using Wilton luster dust and this is by far better for coverage . Highly recommend .
4 #### Just what I expected , the perfect silver " blush " on my homemade chocolate candies . I never imagined that using the silver dust [ fine powder ] could be so easy , look so good . Just remember to turn off the ceiling fans first , especially in a dry climate like mine , or you might look rather priceless .
5 #### I mixed it with clear liquor ( rum ) and painted the paste on tempered chocolate to make a giant ferrero rocher . Make sure not to use too much of liquor though otherwise it takes very long to dry , and also the paste will be very thin and does not stay where they should be . Pictures do n't necessarily show the true color due to lighting change ( the second one had direct exposure to sunlight and therefore look more shiny ) .
5 #### Love the color the ease at getting it to cover .
5 #### Mix with vodka and this creates a beautiful true silver that dries quickly on fondant . Tip , your fondant piece should be dried if you want the paint to dry .
5 #### As a cookie artist , I 'm always needing items to fancy up customer orders . I have used the gold for a while and finally ordered the silver . I love it so much ! Ck products are one of my favorites and they never disappoint !
5 #### Mixed with Pharohs gold to get the tone I wanted for a cake I made . Worked well as a paint with a bit of lemon flavoring .
5 #### This was actually VERY silver ! It was perfect for painting a fondant ribbon . My client was very happy . It is a little tricky to use , but I think all lustre dusts have a learning curve . I am happy to have this in my arsenal . Truly impressive !
5 #### I purchased this luster dust in Nu Silver and could n't be happier . I used this on decorated royal icing cookies and used the technique where you mix the luster dust with everclear and brush it on the hardened icing . In the little container , the color does n't look very bright or shiny , but if you use this technique , you 'll see super shiny results that look beautiful . If this was any shinier , you 'd be able to see your reflection . Great stuff , would definetly recommend .
3 #### There is so much glitter in the Aztec ( Pharoah 's ) Gold version of this luster dust . This one almost seemed more fake ( yes , I know it 's not real ) compared to the other one . It does not have the glitter - like aspect with it and I felt that it just did n't have as much pizzazz . I go with the Aztec Gold , hands down , every time when I 'm asked to do gold confections .
5 #### Amazing ! I used it for a fondant covered baseball bat -- did not have to even use alcohol , brushed it on dry .
5 #### Works like a charm , a little goes a long way .
4 #### I use a fine hair brush to apply dust to my homemade chocolates .
5 #### Looks exactly as advertised . We 're going to be using it in an indie , in place of gold dust . It looks good on camera .
2 #### The picture shows that plastic cube to be full of the product , but it is only about one third full , a very small amount .
5 #### It arrived earlier than estimated time of arrival . It looks exactly as what 's in the picture and qualiy is great !
4 #### Used it in vegan ice cream ( uncooked ) . Used it up in no time ;) - taste is good , but gone fast lol .
5 #### We use this flavoring in several types of fudge that we make and it is amazing ! Just a little goes a long way ... This would also be great in ice cream or other desserts .
4 #### I only wished it came in a larger sized bottle . It 's a little tough to control the amount of drops that are dispensed .
3 #### I like the fragrance and the taste is not overpowering despite the title of the flavoring . I expected to have a bit more of the cheesecake flavoring which it did n't quite have for me . Maybe someone else 's palate may be different . I did n't want to use too much because of the size of the bottle and the batch of cupcakes I made were standard 6 - 12 count so it was hit or miss with the amount used . Overall , not bad I would try other flavors to see which one I really like .
5 #### I used this in a double batch of Wilton icing . I was making a red velvet cake and covering it in fondant . I choose to use this due to safety concerns . Worked perfectly .
5 #### This is a great vanilla and I always use it when I 'm baking something with more expensive ingredients or that I 'm serving to people . I do n't waste this on my smoothies , etc - for that , I use the medium priced vanilla .
5 #### My wife will only use this product in what little baking she does , wish it was more but so be it .
4 #### very fine vanilla extract . Great scent and flavor . Just wish the bottle was designed a bit differently . Drips a lot when pouring .
5 #### This is without doubt the highest quality extract . It 's so good I actually do n't even want to tell you that it is amazing .
5 #### I do n't think I 've ever purchased a Nielsen - Massey Vanilla product that I was n't happy with and this one is no exception . Very nice .
3 #### For a Madagascar vanilla , I was expecting more flavor for the cost . I probably wo n't purchase again . The ice cream I made the vanilla came through weaker than other brands . I can not recommend .
1 #### I 've been using Nielsen Massey vanilla for many years and go through about a quart a year , maybe more . I 'm very familiar with the color and strength , it 's a fabulous , non gmo gf vanilla and would n't use anything else . This vanilla appears to have been watered down . It has none of the opaqueness it should and despite using more than usual , it is missing the vanilla flavor I paid a small fortune for .
1 #### I do n't know what kind of vanilla this is , but I opened it today and it has NO vanilla smell whatsoever . I 've never in my life seen vanilla like this . In disgust , i rummaged around my cabinet and found another brand that I had from THREE years ago , opened it , and it smelled delicious . Three years later ! This Nielson Massey one is going in the trash . I recommend looking for a Mexican vanilla .
5 #### I am very happy I can purchase this product thru Amazon . Will be a repeat order in the future . Thanks
5 #### Very good vanilla . I will only buy this brand from now on .
5 #### When real vanilla beans are n't available or practical , this extract is great .
5 #### Vanilla is something I use fr baking and French toast has to be pure has to be good and this vanilla so worth it .
5 #### My favorite vanilla with Trader Joe 's being a close second
5 #### What can I san Nielsen - Massey has a great product . It has a very nice and complex vanilla flavor . I want to try the vanilla paste also .
5 #### With all the baking that I do , I found this to be my " new " vanilla extract of choice . This stuff is even better than Costco Vanilla which was my old number one extract . The difference you may wonder ? Its the fine bits of seeds . All other extract is pure runny liquid . This stuff has small flecks of vanilla seeds and its " not " a runny extract . Rather it is a thick syrupy extract that is less bitter and sweeter than other Bourbon Vanilla Extracts . It 's really good stuff , you will not be disappointed .
5 #### I started getting this brand because it 's what Georgetown Cupcakes uses in their recipes . I ca n't really tell the difference , but everyone has liked my cupcakes so far , so maybe it 's helping ? Sure , let 's go with that .
4 #### I really ca n't tell the difference between this and Mccormick 's 100 % Vanilla which is a lot less expensive . I think I fell for celebrity chef hype . If you 're not on a budget like I am , then go for it . It 's like putting top shelf booze in a drink with sugary soda - you really ca n't tell the difference between that and the cheaper liquor .
5 #### I love this vanilla extract , use it for almost everything , a drop in my coffee or in hot cocoa . I 've even tried it in tea and it tastes great too . I used in mulled apple cider as well . I want to try a drop of this with cooking something and see how that tastes too . Its really unique and I really like it .
5 #### Very fragrant but not as sweet as the Mexican vanilla .
2 #### It was just okay . I expected a stronger vanilla bourbon flavor . It was very mild and just like off the shelf brands . Not bad but not great .
5 #### The best vanilla for baking . My friends & family count on my baking to be of a VERY high quality . This is a key component .
3 #### It is good , but I think I like Mexican vanilla better .
5 #### This has a very strong alcohol content . I bought this , twice , to make my own vanilla bean paste.bi am not sure I would actually bake with this , as is , because of the very strong alcohol .
5 #### it smells delicious . it does well in my recipes .
5 #### I 've tried store brands , brought back stuff from Mexico , Penzey 's with the bean in it ( actually not too bad ) , but THIS is my go to Vanilla . For ever and ever .
5 #### I use vanilla extract in just about everything I bake . I usually ca n't find fresh vanilla beans locally , so a high quality vanilla extract is a good substitute . I was tired of buying super tiny bottles with super huge price tags at my grocer , so I came online to do some research . So happy to have found this brand ! This is absolutely wonderful Madagascar vanilla . Pure and delicious , the difference in taste is noticeable , at least to me . The bottle was much larger than I 'm used to getting , and I love the old fashioned looking label and glass bottle . I am happy to have found such a great quality product at a fair price . I 'm off to order more !
3 #### After seeing much debate in the reviews about which vanilla extract tastes the best I decided to try for myself . I would have to say that I prefer Rodelles . Rodelles has a stronger vanilla taste . Nielsen Massey is good - but it has sugar added - which I find unnecessary when baking , and it tastes like there 's more alcohol than Rodelles . It seems that with Rodelle 's , you 're getting more Vanilla for your buck - Plus its organic . Ca n't beat that .
3 #### so far i have found no code dates on any of the neilsen massey vanilla extracts on amazon . i have been using this product for over 25 years and its wonderful , but per the company it has a 3 year goodlife expectancy and a code date that should ( per the company ) be on the side listed with the batch # of the product .
5 #### Product is the go to Vanilla Extract for me
5 #### WONDERFUL vanilla ! We have been using the standard grocery store teeny bottle for years , and as we started baking more , figured it was time to invest in some quality vanilla . The difference is noticeable ( to us at least ) and as always , a tiny bit goes a long way . Rich , full , natural taste . It is an extract , but is not meant to be overpowering or very strong , more to add a hint of quality flavor . ( basically - something strong does not mean it 's good ) For 4 oz , a little over $ 10 is really about the same as the equivalent amount of the lesser stuff ! This bottle is nice too and looks fancier :) Very happy with this product and will continue to buy it from now on ! Also , the Barefoot Contessa uses it , and like everyone else I am abnormally obsessed with her and everything she does has to be right just because - haha !
5 #### Been baking for years and years and it is the best ! Little on the expensive side but well worth it !
5 #### Good vanilla flavor . Try a few drops in freshly brewed coffee .
5 #### CLASSIC . Real Vanilla taste . No bitterness , weird aftertaste , or overpowering of more delicate ingredients . It 's the real thing . The choice of professional bakers everywhere . I buy assorted brands of vanilla ( only the good brands ) but this is the Queen of them all . Rich and deep . True flavor . My Very , very favorite .
5 #### I just love this stuff . The smell of a fresh bottle of quality vanilla like this is hard to beat . This brand is among the more well - respected for a reason . Get smaller bottles when you can as fresher is better .
5 #### You ca n't beat this vanilla for quality , smoothness , and flavor .
5 #### Some vanilla extracts taste more like alcohol than vanilla , but not this one . This is an essential pantry item for those who love true vanilla flavor .
5 #### I 've been using Nielsen - Massey extracts for several years and have always been pleased with the quality . The vanilla is excellent and true and I would highly recommend it .
5 #### Amazing , my favorite vanilla extract . Delicious flavor . A high quality product . Madagascar vanilla beans are manufactured into extract at two locations : USA and The Netherlands . Nelsen - Massey is a trusted company with safe processing . There is nothing like real high quality vanilla extract and I wo n't risk using products made in a third world country who may be cutting or tainting the product to make a higher profit . I was told by my grandmother when I was just a little girl to never skimp and use imitation vanilla extract . Life is too short and when you 're baking from scratch you will never be disappointed with high quality ingredients . I rate this 5 stars = I Love It
5 #### This is a real vanilla extract and not imitation so it has a great flavor . It is so much better than the average store bought imitation vanilla flavors . If you like to cook , get the best you 'll be glad you did .
5 #### Been using it for years - excellent product - only one I use
4 #### Like the almond extract that I recently reviewed , the Vanilla Extract by Nielsen - Massey , does not disappoint . It 's potent , delicious and adds that little something special to my raw fruit and nut balls and bars , as well as my raw smoothies , raw soups and other raw delectable dishes . Beware if you do not consume alcohol , as this one contains 35 % alcohol . But as stated in my review for the almond extract ( which is 90 % alcohol ) , as a non drinker and eating 75 % raw foods , I do n't mind adding a tiny bit of extract to my recipes . As well , this extract is kosher , gluten free , allergen free and GMO free . So why only 4 stars if it is so wonderful ? Well , they added sugar to this extract -- an ingredient that is so not necessary . I am going to have to slow down and pay more attention because I would not have purchased this had I known about the sugar . I use my vanilla paste now to add to recipes -- which is free of sugar . Otherwise , if you do not mind the sugar content , this extract is good .
5 #### This is my second bottle . I find this vanilla makes many things better , with my most often use being stirring 1/4 tsp . vanilla and 1 T chia seeds into a container of Greek yogurt .
4 #### I have always used good vanilla , never artificial . However , the first time I used Nielsen - Massey vanilla I could tell the difference . Your baked products willalso show the difference . It seems , only the best vanilla from the island of Madagascar is intense enough for Nielsen - Massey . it has long been the choice of bakers and ice - cream makers , this vanilla adds depth and flavor no other vanilla can match . It has a rich intensely flavored extract . I have also , purchased the vanilla beans which are whole 7 " pods , each equivalent to approximately 1 tablespoon of extract ; two pods per jar . Pure vanilla paste is convenient to use and infuses baked goods and ice cream with flavorful flecks of vanilla bean seeds . Highly Recommended . prisrob 06 - 17 - 13
5 #### Nielsen - Massey Vanilla beans are hand - picked and the extract tastes like heaven . Try it and you will never purchase regular store - bought extract again . Apparently , a cold extraction process slowly draws the delicate flavor from the vanilla beans . Vanilla extract is made by macerating vanilla beans in a mixture of alcohol and water . When purchasing a bottle , avoid the artificial versions as they they tend to have a weaker , often tinny aftertaste . Splurge for the real stuff here .... worth every penny . " Bourbon " gourmet beans , from Madagascar and the nearby islands , have the best reputation for quality and flavor ... and to my mind , after experimenting , this extract is the best - rich and creamy . The Mexican vanilla extract is stronger and it would be my 2nd choice . I buy this from Nielsen - Massey also . Nielsen - Massey vanillas has been in business for almost 100 years . They produce some of the finest vanilla extracts you can buy . The company offers a selection of Madagascar Bourbon , Tahitian & Mexican vanilla extracts and they are 100 % Organic . I have tried all three and prefer Bourbon " gourmet beans , from Madagascar , which have the best reputation for quality and flavor , but everyone has his / own preference . I was lucky , a friend gave me a mini gift pack of all three so I could taste the difference . This vanilla extract is gluten - free certified , kosher certified & allergen - free . Try it , you wo n't be sorry . Btw ... I also use a capful in my coffee sometimes . Beats regular , artificially flavored coffee any day .
5 #### Yes this is very expensive but it does n't hurt me when I pay 20 bucks for a bottle . The extract will make or break your recipe . It does n't matter what brand of flour , butter , eggs , sugar you use but if the vanilla is cheap , it will ruin your creation or make it taste cheap . This is the best vanilla worth the price of saffron . It will taste like vanilla and will make your house smell like vanilla , no alcohol aftertaste . However , the price on Amazon varies so check your local prices before purchasing it . You might not even save anything if you just walk into Zabar 's or any baking store .
5 #### After using Nielsen Massey 's Pure Vanilla Extract I would never be able to go back to using cheap artificial vanilla . There is just such a flavor difference . In fact friends ask me to put double the vanilla in my baked goods because they crave the flavor . I use this in banana bread , chocolate chip cookies , custards and ice cream . Basically anything that calls for vanilla is better with this more expensive brand . In fact , I do n't want to run out of it so I currently have four bottles . I guess I ca n't live without it . ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### The silver luster dust gives off a beautiful sheen . The colors are more prominent when wetting the dust versus a dry cover , but nice either way you choose to do your project . Do n't be fooled by the small container ; a little goes a very long way ! If you choose to use this product In an airbrush machine , be aware that it may clog your needle if it 's a small one . I premixed my dust with extract / vodka and put it into a squeeze bottle . This works pretty well because you can shake and mix the dust up each time you want to put some in the airbrush cup .
5 #### Just used this for the first time for engagement cookies and BOY what a difference between this and Wilton dusts . Super impressed with the coverage with just ONE layer . Its a little tiny container that is super hard to open so be careful . And yes a little goes a long way .
4 #### Good finish , but if you 're heavy handed you could end up overdoing it . A little goes a long way .
4 #### I use a fine hair brush to apply dust to my homemade chocolates .
5 #### Perfect for the badge candy I made and it looked so shinny
1 #### I disagree that Wilton is easy to roll out - perhaps that was on an extremely hot day in a very humid house ? ! I ca n't tell you how crappy this fondant is to work with . it is so stiff . My husband and I tried it several times ( thinking maybe at first we just got a bad box ) we both sat with half the box each and worked it until our hands were sore to get it vaguely softened . Then I tried to roll it out , it was so stiff I was using my whole body weight to roll it . My husband rolled it out with difficulty . By the time you 've managed to roll it thin enough ( all that effort takes time ) it has dried out and cracks as it folds over the cake . Terrible fondant . SATIN ICE is much much better , more pliable , easier to roll out and much nicer flavor . Wilton flavor is kinda ok , it 's not discusting like some say but SATIN ICE is so much nicer and also comes in many different flavors like vanilla or buttercream - even chocolate ! whereas Wilton comes in one fake flavor . Stay away from Wilton ! ! ! !
4 #### this stuff is so good , ca n't believe it . if its too hard , just put it into the micro wave for a few seconds and go to town . i was able to add it to my cakes while it was warm and guess what , on one of the cakes , i did n't add icing first and it adhere to the cake with not problem . the other cake i added frosting to the cake prior to and you could not tell the difference , people love the cakes . remember just add it slightly warm to your cakes . I will buy more because I use it often .
5 #### Love this stuff ! I know most people have an issue with the taste of this product , but it does n't bother me at all . I personally like the flavor . And always make sure to put a nice layer of icing under it that way people can choose not whether or not to eat it . Makes the cakes look fabulous . It is so easy to use . You could always make your own which is great too , but this is a great time saver . My only negative comment would be the price . i usually buy mine from Michael 's with a 40 or 50 % off coupon which makes it considerably cheaper .
2 #### For the price of 80 oz this is a GREAT deal ... however , it tastes awful . In my opinion it is not worth the good deal . I 'd rather pay a little more for better tasting fondant .
4 #### Cute and they taste good , but I found it disappointing that 3/6 of the cells were just coloured sugar ... Still though , I 'd recommend it . It 's a cute buy and not even just limited to V - day ; I just used them to make cute birthday cupcakes for a friend and she loved them ! :)
5 #### While these are a little pricey , they are perfect for Valentine 's Day . They are color coordinated with a well matched purple sanding sugar for contrast . Packaged very well to ensure they arrive undamaged .
5 #### this went to Florida and the gdaughters had a great time using it .. thanks for the fast shipping ..
4 #### it 's hard to get clear flavor inthe store . Works out great to get everything in one place . might just stay with this flavor .
4 #### I thought this was pure clear vanilla extract and it is imitation . I will continue my search for pure clear vanilla extract .
1 #### Clear vanilla taste test of four top brands ( mixed into basic white powdered sugar and milk " sugar cookie glaze " icing , which I use to ice cookies ) [ 1 ] Wilton - sweet one - note plain vanilla , with a faint chemical edge that tangs the back of my throat [ 2 ] McCormick - thin one - note plain vanilla without any artificial extra dimensions or after taste , innocous . Like if the genuine McCormick vanilla had all but one dimension removed . [ 3 ] Penzey 's - I disliked - the best way I can describe it is a combination flavor with aspects of flower , artificial coconut - pineapple blend , and cheap mallow filled pastel coated easter candy . [ 4 ] Watkins - tasted mostly of a strong filled out familiar vanilla with a second faint note of artificial toasted marshmallow - that artificial marshmallow extra is not something I want in anything I make It came down to a VERY close race with McCormick and Watkins neck and neck , Watkins had a lot of points for its fullness in contrast to McCormick 's thin plain simplicity , but in the end McCormick won because of what it did NOT have - no after taste chemical or otherwise , no non - vanilla flavor additions . It may be thin and simple , but it has nothing that takes away from the basic vanilla that it does have , and it does n't even taste artificial . One pro , no cons .
5 #### I need to remember to read all of the information . These were the smallest bottles of vanilla I have ever seen . But the are still of top quality and I actually find them a lot easier to put away
5 #### Very good item , perfect for buttercream icing . You can trust Wilson to deliver a good product . Will buy again for sure .
5 #### I have n't used it yet but , since it 's Wilton , I trust it will be perfect for my baking needs . It came timely and was delivered in perfect condition .
5 #### wow it 's wonderful , give your icing the best taste . Will be using it or the holidays in my cookies . wilton has great stuff .
4 #### I purchased this butter flavor for $ 8.93 in October 2011 , which was a good price / oz compared with other offerings . I used 8 drops in an ice cream called " Savannah Buttermint " , and it added a substantial , deep butter flavor . The ingredient seems perfectly good for home cooking , though since 8 drops delivered so much flavor , I do n't see how I 'll ever use the rest of the bottle .
5 #### Good butter fat flavor substitute for a vegetarian . I will imitation butter flavor extract in my vegetarian meat substitute , dairy - free ice cream , and other recipes where can be replaced with a vegetable oil . I did compare Wilton ( this product ) and Watson 's and to my nose Watson 's smells sweeter and stronger while Wilton 's smells saltier and weaker . Wilton 's smell 's more closely what melting butter smells like but they need to strengthen it a bit I think . I 'll have to adjust the amount by trial I guess .
5 #### Best butter flavoring I ever used . I was taken by it 's enormous size , I 'm used to tiny bottles . A great purchase and bargain .
5 #### I was constantly buying the smaller containers of the butter flavoring to make my cookies . So nice to have the larger size . I got two , will last a while . Happy to have
5 #### I got this as an add on item at a great price . I use it in shakes and baking .
2 #### I had to use WAY MORE than the recipe called for to even taste this , kind of disappointed
5 #### Great for my air popper and makes me not feel the guilt of real butter !
5 #### Perfect for adding butter flavor to white icing made from shortening . Real butter is n't very hospitable to airbrush colors , the water tends to spot . So for airbrushing , I always use shortening & butter flavor . But it must also be as white as possible , and unlike other brands , this is clear .
5 #### Works great in my baking . Has just as nice of a flavor and fragrance as the brand I have used for over 20 years , until now ( Watkins ) . Will buy this brand again , but this bottle is so big it will last me a very long time . Extremely pleased with this flavoring .
3 #### I tried this and another brand , I think it was called something like " LorAnn " or something like that . I found the flavor weaker and less authentic in this product than in the LorAnn , plus they have a whole assortment of flavoring , . I like the : sweet roll "
5 #### Great ! You get the butter flavor without the color . I pipe alot of white roses .
5 #### This adds a nice buttery flavor without adding fat . I 've used Wilton butter flavoring for years .
5 #### I use the Wilton no - color butter flavor in baking , pancake , waffles , but not by itself . For recipes that call for butter , I use half or 1/3 the butter that 's called for , and substitute the rest with vegetable oil . And with that alteration , I add the Wilton butter flavor to supplement the butter flavor . I love butter and use to eat loads of it all the time . But some recipes call for so much of it , I want to cut down . This butter helps me achieving that . Since this is not real butter , it is understandable such substitution may not suit every recipe . Some baking would not come out the same without fluffy butter . But for the ones that simply requires the butter flavor , the Wilton butter flavor helps . It is not the same , but it helps . I have not used this in things that are not cooked . So ca n't really speak to that . For anything artificial , I only use in moderation . So far , it 's been working great . This is not easy to find in local stores . Luckily , Amazon has in . For anyone who 's trying to cut down on butter or animal fat , give this a try .
5 #### Works great , and tastes great . Prevents discoloring of eg .... wedding cakes , white cakes , ice cream etc . Love this stuff and it was shipped in a very reasonable amount of time .
5 #### Nice and buttery . I personally use it in my Harry Potter butterbeer . It involves A&W brown cream soda , Myers dark rum , this butter flavor ( of course ) , and a dollop of whipped cream on top .
5 #### I usually find this at the expensive Michaels craft store and pay the same amount for a tiny 2 oz bottle as I paid for this . I love this stuff . I add it to a multitude of dishes as a fat free , calorie free and SALT free way to flavor anything with the real taste of butter . LOVE this stuff .
5 #### I will most definitely order this one on a repeat basis . I use butter extract when making pancakes or other baked goods to cut down on calories that usually come with lots of butter on top of the cooked items ; now with a tablespoon in the batter , I can get away with a squirt or two of spray butter on top and still get the flavor of butter . At the regular grocery store a 1 - ounce bottle of butter extract was almost $ 5 , so for the MUCH larger bottle it works out to a fantastically better deal !
1 #### Bought these to write on candy melts .. they just do n't work . I would draw one " eye " and it was sort of okay , then onto the 2nd " eye " and it would just not show up . I tried wiping it with paper towel in between but that did n't even really help . Wasted $ $ $ I 'm going to get the Americolor Gourmet Writer ....
2 #### I was ready to throw the set out after one use and wish I had not wasted my money on this particular Wilton product . I highly suggest that you put the money toward another brand such as KopyKake pens or Americolor . The Wilton tips are too thick , yes including those labeled " fine tip " , and although sufficient to fill in colors or make thick lines , you will be disappointed using on any design that calls for a thin line . If it were the only one of it 's type out there , that would be a different story but it is n't .
4 #### These markers are perfect to write on small pills that look alike .
3 #### A little hard to use and DO NOT taste good .
4 #### Fun to play with on food surfaces ( Yup , not just for pastry ) . Very easy to use fo Cakes & other pastries or for markers at the Edible Tic - Tac - Toe gamr .
4 #### Arrived as expected . Product is good . Only strange thing is the equivalency information was scratched out . No big deal though ... I was able to get the information on the Internet . I just thought it was strange that thr equivalency was scratched out just like the picture on amazon .
5 #### I add vanilla extract to everything ... my granola , cookies , cakes , ice creams ... it is so nice to get it in such a large quantity and save myself the $ $ and trips to the grocery store . This is the best vanilla extract I 've tried too , it is especially delicious in my vegan coconut milk ice cream ... the little flecks of vanilla are amazing . I recommend this product to anyone who uses a lot of vanilla !
4 #### These work great , but they are not nearly as thin as it makes out in the picture . It 's hard to get a thin line with them .
2 #### Only use the red one for 1 batch of cake pops ( candy melt ) . The 2nd time I tried to use the red one on white chocolate because the candy melt was too sweet for me . But it did n't work . it was very faded . I dipped the Wilton food coloring gel using the marker to write on the cake pops instead , it took me forever to draw the lines on the cake pops . I had to clean the marker tip every now and then and after that it wo n't write anymore . Now i store it away , hopefully next time the tip will be wet and able to write again . These markers should be hard to use . Maybe they are not meant to write on chocolate ( contains too much fat to write on ? )
5 #### I use these in a unconventional way . I take quite a lot of medicine . There are 4 pills that are round and all the same size , and white in color . So I put the pills , same kind in a small bowl and use a color to mark them . Just by turning the pen around in the bowl with the pills It marks them . Then I use a different color for the next set of white pills in another bowl and so on until I have all the different medicine with white pills marked different colors . It just makes a marble tone on the pills . I take a plain white sticker and put on the bottle with a circle of color on it . Than way I always know when I put them in my daily pill holder which ones are which if they should get mixed up . Sherbear
5 #### Purchased for our bakery business to make a " scribble cake " for our customers . Cake looked just as if a baby had scribbled on it and was a big hit . These markers are very high quality .
5 #### These worked perfect to write on fondant . I hope to use them in the future to decorate sugar cookies and for my boys to decorate .
2 #### I hate to write negative reviews . Hopefully though someone else will save money on my mistakes . I dipped mini marshmallows in yellow chocolate to make little lego heads for a lego party . I needed something to write the faces with on the chocolate . These are not expensive and you can buy them just about anywhere . It took me a very long time to write faces on the chocolate . The black marker was black and it worked but it worked slowly . I had to keep marking on a piece of paper in order to keep it working on the chocolate . I have n't tried others so I ca n't direct you to any other types of food markers . But my guess is that there are others out there that do a better job . If you had a small job these would be fine . If you had to write a lot , it will not do a good job . It certainly wo n't live up to the picture on the cover of the box . This shows a pen making a pretty butterfly in one long swoopy line . That is simply not going to happen with these .
3 #### I bought these for writing on foods other than icing and fondant . They are next to useless on cheese . Okay - ish on hard - boiled eggs and peeled oranges . Terrible on bread . I hear good things about the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/B - C - EASY - WRITER - FOOD - DECOR / dp / B000VW6FTM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">B.C.EASY WRITER FOOD DECOR.</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Americolor - Food - Marker - Writers-10 - Color - Pack / dp / B0020ZURDI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Americolor Food Marker Writers- 10 Color Pack</a>&nbsp;from people who draw on other foods like I do who have used one or both of those , plus these ones . I will be buying those next .
5 #### This is as good as scraping vanilla beans and it 's so much easier . I make lots of Financiers from Shirley O'Corriher 's book " BakeWise " and this product has been wonderful . I buy it in the largest size and it lasts me a long time in the refer . Love this stuff .
5 #### Excellent vanilla taste . Love to substitute it for vanilla as it has the vanilla bean flecks in it that add to the taste .
5 #### This is the only vanilla I use it tastes great .
5 #### Ahhh ... amazing taste . Much better then any other brand and type . No bitterness . Pretty much the same results as with real vanilla beans , but without all the headache .
3 #### I fantasized that this product was just ground up vanilla beans & bourbon . When I got it and read the label , the first ingredient was SUGAR ! I was going to use it to make healthy almond milk . Now , this HUGE , bakery size bottle is being given away . It would be great in baked goods . Tastes really good .
5 #### I love this stuff use it in everything I bake .
5 #### Best vanilla on the planet ! To bad the price went up !
1 #### Sent it back .. was supposed to be vanilla paste
5 #### Holy Grail of Vanilla Paste , worth the high price because nothing compares to this quality
3 #### I really love this stuff ... but Prime Pantry used to carry it for under a buck an ounce , now the price has doubled even though the US dollar is at its highest level in years ....
4 #### This is beautiful vanilla , but it 's just too expensive . You only need a little but it does n't make that big of a difference for the price . It should be $ 20 cheaper . Had to stop buying it since it just added too much cost to my goods sold . Too bad .
5 #### I think this is a great addition or replacement for any vanilla extract in a recipe . I love vanilla cupcakes , and making it with the vanilla pasta makes it more vanilla . The specks are a great perk too .
5 #### I was complaining to my friends in the cake community about how much this brand has gone up in price , or in general , how much good vanilla has gone up in price --- but this is just worth the money . I ca n't say anything negative about this brand , besides ( again ) how much you must be willing to invest to get your hands on it . At one point this heavenly paste was under $ 40 , now , you are lucky to get it under $ 80 . The price has almost doubled all over the country , and believe me , I have been looking for it . I use this for cakes , buttercreams , anything I bake that requires vanilla . I only refrain from using it in chocolate cake / brownies , anything dark enough that the true beauty of the vanilla specs wo n't be noticed or appreciated . I use the legit Nielsen - Massey Pure Vanilla for those items . The first time I tried this brand I was hooked , and honestly it is going to take them taking it off the market to stop me from ordering it . If it ever goes back down in price , I am buying it by the case . Please , stop using that super market crap . Try it . Your customers will love you for it ! Questions ? Ask me :-) ! Did you find this helpful ? If so , please click the YES button .
5 #### It 's super flavorful . It 's kind of large . So I often use generous amount for recipes . Vanilla flavor is very strong and rich .
5 #### Where has this been all my life ? ! ? I 'm an avid baker AND a huge fan of vanilla beans . This provides the same flavor and appearance as fresh vanilla beans , but without the fuss . Love it !
3 #### Great product , but price has become ridiculous . Was very satisfied when was able to purchase for $ 30 , but $ 50 is crazy .
5 #### Love this brand . sad vanilla prices keep going up but its a great quality product
5 #### This adds such a lovely vanilla scent as most people here can attest to . I bought this bottle while dabbling in baking every week and it 's lasted me 1.5 years . However , in 2014 the price was $ 30 with Prime shipping and now it 's jumped up 170 % to become $ 52 ? ? ! ? ! ? What in the world ... ? ? ? Was there a bad crop of vanilla last year that I do n't know about ? Boo !
5 #### Delicious wish the bottle was bigger ! I loved the flavor , I put it in everything !
4 #### I like this product so far . I had never used this product before in baking and wanted to give it a try . So far , I am very pleased with it and may upgrade the rating to 5 stars after trying out a few more recipes with this product .
5 #### Top of the line product . You 'll never go back to the other type again .
4 #### Love this stuff . It 's a mildly sweetened syrup of vanilla seeds and full of flavor . I mostly use it as a sweetener for my homemade yogurt , but have baked with it too . Only down side is that the price has risen dramatically over the last couple of years . Regardless , I 've ordered it at least four times to date and will again .
5 #### This is the best vanilla paste I have found . I ordered some others at the same time . Even organic and they do n't compare . Some smelled funny and I probably wo n't be using them . Do n't want to ruin my homemade raw ice cream ....
5 #### As far as the actual vanilla bean paste goes - I use this in everything and no longer use plain extract . The flavor is incredible and lends a rustic look to your baked goods with the vanilla bean caviar in there . I find myself actually looking for things to use it for , it is that good ! If you have a little jar of their vanilla bean paste in your kitchen , do yourself a favor and buy this to refill , it is insanely cheap compared the the $ 12 a bottle you usually pay , and at $ 28 for this huge refill , you are saving a ton of money .
5 #### I have been using this product to years . It replaces vanilla beans . Takes just as good and much less expensive .
5 #### This is so much bigger than I thought it would be . I use it to flavor my homemade soymik . Tasty !
5 #### I use this to make coffee creamer and it ALWAYS taste delicious .
5 #### This is a regular purchase . You begin by using it anywhere you would use extract , but then you find it is heaven poured over pound cake , ice cream , etc . If you start to pour it you will be buying the quart .
5 #### I 've used this for a number of items like creme brle and cheese cake . It was great
5 #### This is my favorite vanilla . I works well with ice cream , coffee creamer , and baked goods .
5 #### Awesome product ! Great quality & taste . I use it in so many things !
5 #### This is my " go - to " vanilla . My taste buds are not refined enough to really tell the difference between this and regular vanilla , but it is aesthetically pleasing to me to see the real vanilla bean seeds in it . I like using the finest quality ingredients .
5 #### a great tasting vanilla paste - definitely top shelf . i think i 've bought about a case worth so far and they are all great quality and consistent .
5 #### I love Vanilla . And I love you can add this to items that wo n't get cooked to get the vanilla taste without the alcohol smell of vanilla extract . I use it in coffee , smoothies , a touch on oatmeal or cereal .
5 #### This is a wonderful alternative to regular vanilla and much cheaper than buying vanilla beans . I love the rich vanilla flavor and the flecks in this paste .
5 #### Nice quality vanilla . Much better than McCormick natural vanilla . This vanilla has a soft , gentle fragrance . The McCormick vanilla odor is sharp , almost acrid , in comparison .
5 #### This is great vanilla . I did order the paste by mistake , and I found that it has it 's uses , but does n't meet the needs of the extract . So , be careful that you order the right type , unless you purpose to buy the paste .
5 #### Tastes just like the real thing in my little&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Bialetti - Moka - Express-3 - Cup - Espresso - Maker-06799 / dp / B0000AN3QI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Bialetti Moka Express 3 Cup Espresso Maker 06799</a > ! I usually make a nice caffeinated latte in the morning , and it 's nice to have the option of an espresso or latte in the afternoon or evening , too . The Illy Decaf has a great robust flavor without the caffeine . Perfect !
5 #### makes our homemade chocolate milk taste like melted ice cream . Even used it in a tofu vanilla shake and it tasted like melted vanilla . Best part is it 's not artificial flavor from castoreum - from beaver butt glands ! ! Gross ! Who wants to eat fake vanilla now ? This is the real deal and worth the $ $ $ ! ! Amazing , just not amazing when tastes straight from the bottle . Too strong a flavor , supreme when mixed . I even add it to the pancake mix ! !
5 #### This is really good for desserts , the flavor is more pronounced . There are bean granules throughout bottle , it lasts a long time and is much more economical than purchasing small bottles at the store that are not as high quality as this product .
5 #### I love this stuff ! I 'm on my second bottle in less than a year . One of my favorite uses is in a cherry smoothie . Just milk , frozen cherries and vanilla bean paste and you have heaven in a blender !
5 #### I went to a famous fancy restaurant for a treat 40 years ago and was introduced to this delicious coffee and have never looked back , nor do I stock anything else in my home . I always get compliments from company about the coffee and even the caffeine dinners do n't know the difference ! Try it , and you 'll never go back to your old coffee again .
4 #### If you like coffee but watch your caffiene intake pick some of this up . Tastes great , could be priced more aggresively . The taste is full and rich with no bitterness .
2 #### I never tried this before . It is not a substitute for vanilla extract . It only adds brown specks to your ice cream . It has little flavor .
5 #### Very good Vanilla Paste . I can highly recommend it .
5 #### This bottle is HUGE ! I love cooking with Vanilla beans , but the expense and time consuming nature often leaves me pouring in vanilla extract . Having a large bottle of vanilla bean paste allows me to enjoy the full flavor that vanilla beans give with the convenience of pouring it out of a bottle . I use this in Creme Brle , vanilla bean cupcakes and vanilla bean butter cream . I just made vanilla bean cupcakes today and they are amazing ! The specs of black show the vanilla love ! I highly recommend this ! I will be making 300 cupcakes this week and this is essential for making them taste wonderful .
5 #### It 's great . Vanilla bean flavor and flakes without the high price of beans or the risk of spoilage . Would give this as a gift for the foodie / baker in your life .
5 #### Great way to class up your food :-) . Perfect for making ice cream and green tea frappuccinos ! ! !
5 #### Lots of real beans in it . Taste great , one of the best paste I ever use . Make sure you looking for paste not extracts , they are different .
5 #### I love this as it seems to carry more flavor than regular pure vanilla extract !
5 #### Just plain good . Home made vanilla ice cream with this and other regular vanilla makes a huge difference . Again , the difference is HUGE . Panna Cotta , pastry cream , whipping cream ... just everything turns out like a pro quality .
5 #### Smells good and is used just like vanilla extract .
5 #### taste as good as expected and reminds me japan
5 #### I am not the biggest mayo fan , but I enjoy putting it on burgers and hotdogs . Recently I played Splatoon 2 and sided with Pearl for team Mayo . I have become aware that Japanese mayo is different and had to try it . I like the squeeze bottle a lot , and the cute design . It 's very easy to spread and made cool shapes on your food . To me , an American , it tastes more tangy and warm . It also feels very light , compared to heavier mayo . I do n't use a lot of mayo but I 'm gon na try to put this on everything .
3 #### Just so so . The flavor is ok , but I bought better ones ( different brand ) at local store at better prices . The size of the bottle also makes it difficult to use .
5 #### This mayonnaise has a nice flavor and a silky texture . I like it much better than American mayonnaise . I tried it on the recommendation of a Japanese cooking blog and I 'm very pleased .
5 #### delicious , arrived quickly and intact . use it all the time for asian dressings - I approximate a dressing that Daikokuya ( ramen restaurant in LA ) uses : Mirin , rice wine vinegar , soy sauce , kewpie mayo - if you can add masago proportions of these ingredients to taste
5 #### love this stuff ..... has a more " developed " flavor than the usual jarred stuff .
3 #### Thought it would be different , but taste like regular mayo that is extreme my expensive .
4 #### Tastes good , but basically just Hellman 's with a little hot sauce and sugar at four times the price .
5 #### I 'm never without this in my arsenal of wow factor for baking . I initially ordered a small bottle . That lasted about one month . We were using it in everything ! It 's absolutely delicious . Now we keep 1 - 2 mottles of the 32 ounce size at all times . In chocolate cake , Vanilla Cake , Cream Cheese Frosting , on ice cream ... it is delicious and adds a shot of amazing flavor wherever it goes . I highly recommend this wonderful product !
5 #### This mayo is really good much better then dukes
4 #### Was excited to try . Its not that much different than the mayo I already use , so probably would not go to the trouble to order it again .
5 #### The real thing - perfect when I am serious about making sushi .
5 #### If you like a mustardy Mayo , this is your product . You could make it on your own , but if you do n't have the time this product is a must .
5 #### You will love this vanilla . I love to bake and I usually use vanilla made in Mexico . This works in cakes and cookies very well . I also like to use it in coffee . It gives it a gourmet taste .
5 #### Love this stuff . Fresher tasting than generic ' store ' mayonnaise . It does have a small amount of MSG - which I usually avoid - but the quantity per serving is negligible . Uses rice vinegar .
5 #### I bake a lot and once I tried this bean paste , I have never used anything else . I bake with it , put it in coffee , make puddings etc . Great taste . Oh , its a must when you make fresh whipping cream to put over strawberries !
5 #### This is great vanilla .. it makes the best taste in anything you want to cook ... Yummy I love it .
5 #### I live and bake by this product , I am a home baker and ever since I started using this paste I have given up the traditional extract , which has a more alcohol flavor . this is the warm vanilla flavor that you are looking for as it uses actual vanilla beans in your dish . The paste is more liquid then you imagine when you think of the word paste , but this makes it better for pouring , measuring etc anyway . It mixes in better this way as well . I have this on auto subscription , as I really do need this every 3 months . Use it in pancakes , waffles , cakes , any pastries or dessert dishes to give it a warm delectable vanilla flavor . My next thing with this will be vanilla ice cream , which I ca n't believe i have not done yet . Definitely a necessary product in my pantry . Buy it ! You will never want to use extract again .
4 #### Good stuff to buy every now and then , just a little pricy for mayo .
5 #### Love this vanilla . It is nice and thick and smells delicious just know that the first ingredient is sugar then water , vanilla extract , vanilla beans and gum tragacanth ( a thickener )
5 #### The typical Kewpie maynnaise from Japanese . Ca n't go wrong with this .
5 #### A must have for Japanese food ! Looks like it 's in a bag but do n't worry it 's a bottle inside a bag so yes you can close it . Oh & to the people worried about the temperature when shipping . They do n't keep this in the fridge in Japan so do n't worry , well we do n't put it in the fridge in the US until it 's open so as long as it 's not opened it 's fine to be out of the fridge .
5 #### Really , really good . It makes whatever I add to ten times better . So much flavor !
5 #### What a difference this has made in my baking . The vanilla flavor is more pronounced versus pure vanilla extract and you get the lovely flecks of vanilla seed . Since I have found this stuff I have used nothing else for three years .
5 #### wow- great vanilla flavoring and so economical - use it daily to flavor my healthy smoothy drinks
1 #### This is the oddest tasting stuff . It 's tangy , but not in a good way . I 'm just used to American mayo and I did n't like it .
5 #### This is honestly the tastiest mayonnaise I 've ever had . I 've never noticed how bland American mayonnaise is until I tried this . Japan really does get nearly everything right . I use this for sandwiches , making spicy mayo , over fried chicken , with my fries , and in my salads . I highly recommend this !
5 #### What can i say great PRICE and GREAT product . Ca nt loose if you bake often .
1 #### Not PURE . Not PASTE . Not VERY GOOD and full of additives . I do n't understand the high rating . The advertisement says " pure vanilla bean paste " . The actual ingredients seems to be missing from the description so I can only conclude this company is out to fool people and it looks like they have fooled plenty who are n't paying attention but who ARE paying way too much for this faux vanilla . An obvious con job .
5 #### Wonderful rich creamy flavor , too bad I only have about a month to enjoy it ; as the use by date is too soon .
5 #### Never ever ate mayo as a child . Hated it . But Japanese mayo is THE BEST ! I love this on anything breaded and deep fried .
5 #### again i listened to youtubers and thought this was going to blow my mind ... i do n't knkow why .... i actually hate mayo but bought this anyway thinking it would be a desserty type of mayo ... it 's not ... it 's great if you like mayo tho . i put it on my youtube endorsed spicy ramen ( spiciness overdramatized ) ... was good . it 's more eggy than USA mayo and i guess a bit more tangy ... i thought it would be less eggy and more sweet cuz they put it on desserts ... Great seller though , would purchase from seller again ... since i bought 3 bottles i may start enjoying it more , buy more , and weigh more in the coming months .
5 #### I love this stuff as much as I love their vanilla extract ! This has made some incredible cinnamon rolls and puddings lately . The only thing is that it leaves little specks --- but if you want a homemade touch that 's a good thing . I will buy this again but 32 oz ? ? Holy wow , I 'll never get to the end of this bottle . SO GOOD
5 #### this stuff is the best . use it all the time .
5 #### Use the product all the time . Beautiful in a custard as well as baked goods .
5 #### I do n't think I can ever go back to regular vanilla ! ! ! ! ! The stuff is amazing ! It tastes great I love the little specs of vanilla being it leaves in the recipe . And it 's thick and easy to blend in . This huge bottle lasts for almost a year and we do a lot of weekly pancakes and baked goods .
5 #### If you do a lot of cooking or baking I highly recommend this vanilla . It adds another level of flavor that makes each dish phenomenal !
5 #### Use a dribble of this every morning in my smoothie . Delicious ! Also love it for whipped cream .
3 #### Tastes a lot like Dukes mayo to me . The bag it comes in is kind of weird . However it was tasty and has a nice texture . Does n't keep as long as regular mayo so keep an eye on date .
4 #### Buy this paste . Wife loves it and tastes better than alcohol based extracts .
5 #### Not the " taste " I was expecting , but it 's good . Just like everything else , it will have a spot in my fridge .
4 #### This was fun . I bought it just to see what Japanese mayo is like , since I am a big fan of mayo . This was nice and the packaging was unique and entertaining ( a clear very thin plastic bottle with no markings in a labeled bag ) . The mayo itself was fine . But , I find that I personally prefer American mayo . But , that is just a matter of personal taste .
5 #### LOVE , LOVE , LOVE This ! ! ! ! This stuff is amazing . If you want to take your baking to the next level of taste ... buy this ! Great price and it 's the real stuff . I 've been using this brand for years , and I could n't be happier . It makes all my cakes and desserts taste just a bit better than the rest !
5 #### Hi I am very happy with coming on time and is great taste absolute recommend to every one to like to cook
5 #### Nielsen - Massey has some of the best vanilla for the price ... and the price on Amazon is better than we have found anywhere else
2 #### Meh . Love the package , a soft squeeze bottle which makes it very easy to manage with one hand . But the taste , not so much . I was hopeful that the MSG content would mean the flavor was lively and fresh . But its heavy , dull , very chemical in smell and taste . Even the aftertaste is a disappointing experience . Homemade is best , Hellman 's is second best . This is just weird .
5 #### I love Kewpie mayonnaise and I 'm glad that it is offered on Amazon.com . I lived in Osaka , Japan for four years and this is the only mayonnaise that I ever used there .
5 #### I do n't use this for baking . I keep the 32 oz bottle stored in the fridge and drizzle it over vanilla ice cream ! ! ! I know it 's a little extravagant but hey it 's the bomb . I also mix it in with eggs when making french toast ! The sweetness added is all you really need , of course you need creme fresh or a dab of unsalted butter ! You can also whip this into whipped cream for a pancake or french toast topping .
5 #### My favorite Mayonnaise :P its so good on yakisoba especially I do say it has its place and limitations . Where turkey sandwiches stand i would vote not this but if it were say tuna rice then yeah this is great . I also think this is good with frys but very good in a whole and lasts a good amount of time .
5 #### If you 're looking for authentic Japanese mayonnaise this is it ( but personally I like Best Foods better . ) I included this in a Japanese Pancake gift pack so I wanted the authentic .
5 #### If you have never tried vanilla paste and you bake a lot you will be thrilled with this . Due to the rich flavor ( without the alcohol taste of extract ) I use it in place of extract in all recipes . Purchased to make ice cream but now use it in all my baked goods . It is fabulous in vanilla based or cream cheese frostings !
5 #### Love , Love , Love this Vanilla Bean Paste ! This is my second purchase of this product . I bake A LOT ! This just makes everything so much more delicious .
5 #### I was introduced to this amazing substance in cooking classes at The Rolling Pin near Tampa , FL . I am an addict ! ! I use it instead of vanilla extract in everything I make ! I put a huge blob of this paste and 1/8 t of SweetLeaf stevia sweetener in 1/2 c of Fage 2 % yogurt , stir it up , and YUM ! :-)
5 #### Have been using this paste for the past 4 years in our cupcakes , macarons and other treats . It is very strong so not much is required to get a yummy vanilla flavor and vanilla bean specks . It 's also nice to purchase in the large quart size , saving us some $ $
5 #### FAST shipping ! Cheaper than on eBay too . Kewpie has been my family 's favorite since our dwelling days in Japan and even while in US and traveling abroad ! Yum to the max !
5 #### I love this Japanese mayo . Taste better than that American mayo . The Japanese makes the best stuff . Meiji chocolate , Kewpei mayo
3 #### I waited to write my review and I have to say I am still on the fence with this mayo given the previous reviews I expected it to be ( magical ) Is it Tangy ? Yes . But how does it taste ? I do n't know . I am an unabashed Hellman 's mayo lover , Miracle whip is not mayo and it is WRONG just plain wrong ! I am going to have to classify Kewpie in the nice fad category but I can very easily live with out it . Btw the mayo I received expires in 2 months ( who in the name of all that is holy can consume that much mayo in under 2 months ) So check your expiration dates and check the seller ...
5 #### Got ta love the Japanese Mayonnaise . ;) This is a must have coming Japanese food so I 'm always buying it though it lasts long . The taste is great and I use it with Saracha for sushi rolls . Never had a problem . Better to ship it quickly with two or one day shipping to ensure freshness . Make sure you put it in the fridge .
3 #### This received lots of good reviews so I had to buy it . I have to say that I find it weird . The bottle wo n't stand upright , it is sploogey , and the consistency does n't work for me . It has a weird mouthfeel . Nope .
5 #### I 'm so glad I learned about the vanilla paste . All of the beautiful flavor of vanilla but without the excess liquid that can come with imparting a nice strong vanilla flavor .
5 #### Great price ! I love that I can add vanilla pod seeds to anything without having to mess with the pods . The aroma is wonderful .
5 #### This tastes a lot like Miracle Whip . If you like that flavor then get some . It does take a while to ship but I have used it in noodles and sandwiches so far and it does taste good .
5 #### Very yummy , perfect for sushi and probably anything you would like to use it for , slightly different taste from mayo here in the states so this with some chili pepper sauce and I use it for spicy sauce for my home made sushi .
5 #### Amazing product , my baking is over the top when I use this ! Highly recommended - smells amazing , too !
5 #### This stuff is awesome ! I have bought more expensive vanilla extract for ice cream making and found that regular McCormick along with a tbsp of this makes more of a difference than buying expensive extract . My kids like the visual bits of vanilla in their ice cream , too . Seems more authentic to them !
5 #### great buy , second time I have purchased this item . Great flavor
5 #### This is like heaven in a jar . It will be delicious on ice cream or anything . I was expecting this to be a paste but it is more like a syrup . It does say that in the description but I must have missed that .
5 #### My wife lives this paste . Better than beans and quality if flavor . Easier to use and concentrated . My wife is Swedish and bakes and knows what she 's doing . :)
5 #### I saw this in an article , along with the sesame dressing , which I bought . I was n't sure I was going to like it but I do . It is a different , more tasty version of mayonaise . Since it has a different taste than the usual mayos , taste it first before you add it to any of your recipes since it will alter the taste of them slightly . I use it to dip things in so far . Good stuff !
4 #### Delicious mayo . Perfect for making my newest challenges in cooking , Japanese Kani Salad .
4 #### let me start off by saying that this mayo is utterly divine if you are a lover of mayo . it 's much richer and creamier than your typical mayonnaise which is perfect in itself ! i sadly noticed , however , that every single time i try to eat this delicious spread i get horrible stomach pains after 5 - 15 minutes . maybe it 's the MSG , maybe it 's not . either way , it 's worth the tasting if you 're willing to take a gamble . sadly , this may be the last time i order this product despite it tasting so heavenly .
5 #### This really is a great mayo . It has a sweeter and slightly more tart flavor than typical store - brand American mayo . It has a lighter texture , but a very rich taste . I 've never really cared for mayo until Kewpie . Delicious on Takoyaki and Okonomiyaki .
5 #### These are great . Honest to God . GREAT Value for the money . Thanks Amazon .
3 #### I bought this because Chef Marcus Samuelsson uses it in his deviled eggs , and I figured they would come out just like his . I think it works well for that recipe , but I find it too tart for use in other dishes , like my version of tuna salad .
4 #### love the squeeze bottle as well as the mayo .
5 #### Excellent . Glad I was able to find it on Amazon . Taste is wonderful . Adds an extra something to mayo .
5 #### Received item on time and in tact . Love the taste of it better than Hellman 's !
5 #### This has a lovely flavor . I 've used it to make cream soda so the flavor is good on its own !
3 #### other than the seeds I could get the same result with regular vanilla . Did not find it to be as intense as I imagined .
5 #### Would never bake without this . The flavor is incredible . Especially in my cheesecakes .
5 #### GREAT STUFF , THICK AN TASTY , WORKS GREAT IN EVERYTHING I HAVE MADE
5 #### Love this stuff for baking and the size / price is a good value .
5 #### I kept buying little bottles of this and had to buy them quite often . I bake a lot of cookies and just love this vanilla . I finally bought this giant size bottle and am so glad . I do n't worry about running out and tend to use a little more than a recipe calls for because I love the taste so well ( and I have plenty -so why not use a little more ) . This is so far superior than most store bought vanilla . No comparison really . Just keep in mind there are tiny black vanilla bean specks so if you use this in something white - you will see the specks ( such as cream cheese or white icing , etc . )
3 #### This mayo is fair . It has an overwhelming taste of oil
5 #### Picked up my love for Japanese Mayonnaise in Osaka , Japan . This Kewpie mayo is available in every restaurant in Japan . Makes the best BLT sandwiches ever . It is also my secret ingredient for deviled eggs or egg salad . Give it a try . Pricey but worth it for special occasions .
5 #### It was perfect and I found the little baby adorable . The outside was a lot softer than I thought but it was great when I made sushi . XD
5 #### I 've wanted to try Kewpie " Japanese " mayonnaise for a while , having read about it on a lot of recipe sites . People speak so highly of it that I was really curious , but I could n't find it anywhere locally . The flavor is not what I expected , it is much eggier and tangier than regular Hellman 's mayonnaise . Th flavor is somehow also lighter , and does n't linger as much in your mouth . It is much less oily . I love the fine - tipe squirt bottle , especially for Japanese food . It makes it easier to " frost " food as a topping . I do n't know that I would call it a replacement for regular American mayonnaise , and I 'm not particularly fond of it with meat , like on a sandwich . But it gives a great tangy creaminess to veggies , sushi , omelets , and sauces .
5 #### I love this mayo and I can not even pinpoint why . I 've used hellmans forever till it turned me off for some reason . Then heard about this and I 'm a convert . Love making sandwiches with this mayo and anything and everything .
5 #### If you know about Kewpie , then you know there is absolutely nothing like it . In spite of the recipes online that claim to make something like it , there is no substitute for the real thing . If you do n't know about kewpie then try it . You 'll either love it or hate it . Either way it will make an interesting addition to your condiment shelf .
3 #### This Vanilla Bean Paste is a good alternative to extract . Purists will argue that the other additives overwhelm the taste , but I find the gum tracaganth less objectionable than the strong alcohol in most extracts . This contains NO alcohol . Ideally a freshly scraped bean is best , then pure ground beans , but for a quick , and lower cost alternative , this is good , particularly as a substitution for vanilla extract in your baking , ice cream and other desserts , as there is sugar added . WonderfuI , natural vanilla flavor , with lots of tiny vanilla specs in every teaspoon . This arrived quickly , great value ! ! !
5 #### What is not to love about this stuff . I do not use regular Vanilla extract when I have this on hand hence the purchase of the big ass bottle .
5 #### I use it for make a sushi , Thai food . I mix with sriracha sauce for Japanese style . bake it . I mix with sugar and lemon for bakery and Thai food . So yummy .
5 #### We love sushi and we love to attempt to make restaurant quality sushi at home . We ordered this mayo then put it into three smaller squirt bottles and added different pepper blends and/or food coloring just for fun . My kids have loved adding this to the top of their sushi rolls .
4 #### I love Hellman 's Mayo but this stuff has it beat . It 's a hard taste to describe other than it has a bite to it and it is very tasty . I think it 's got a lot of fat content which is why I did n't give it 5 stars . I want to put it on everything !
5 #### This stuff is great ! Way better than american mayo . Its got more of a salty flavor than american mayo . Try it !
5 #### I make onigiri at home , and like ot use this sweet mayonnaise in the tuma and salmon fillings I prepare . Also good with tuna + seaweed frukake ( can even add rice to this to make it a whole meal ) , and good with potatoes + salty fish ( like anchovies or herring ) + pickles .
5 #### It always surprises me that so many people hate mayo . I love mayo , and this is probably the best I 've had . I 've been trying to recreate the spicy crab salad you get in sushi restuarants and I think this gets it almost perfect . It has a great flavor and I put it on just about every sandwich I make . Sometimes I mix it with mustard and dip pierogies in it . Delish !
5 #### A strange and wonderful mayo from the far east . I saw this on some cooking show and figured to give it a shot . It 's quite tasty in a different sort of way . I like it .
3 #### I loveeee mayonnaise , especially on sandwiches . Compared to the many other brands I have tried , I 'd put this one near the bottom of the list of my favorites . I think it has a funny after taste . I believe the MSG in the product is probably responsible for the off - putting aftertaste . I have tried MSG on it 's own and used it in cooking many times so this is a fairly educated guess . Others may disagree but I do not feel that MSG compliments the taste of mayonnaise . I enjoy the taste of MSG in a lot of dishes and I absolutely love salt in my mayo so it came as a surprise to me that I did not enjoy this product . I found the packaging very interesting , if only for it 's novelty . Wish I could buy Hellmann 's in a bottle like this .
5 #### Excellent in home baked goods , rich vanilla flavor and love the vanilla bean specks .
3 #### It 's fun to try new things . A couple of years ago , I bought a Whole Foods gift basket from Amazon , and it had the most delicious jar of mustard in it . I never had a mustard " wow " me before , but that one did . I finally tried sriracha sauce this year , and I really like it . I was hoping to at least like this Kewpie Mayonnaise . I did not . It does have a definite egg taste to it ... but it also had just the least bit of a sour or tangy tone to it , which was off - putting enough for me to finally discard the bottle after a few weeks . I tried it on sandwiches and in different salads ( green salads , chicken salad , etc ) . I did n't find anything that tasted good when this was added to it . Each time , I thought " I wish I had used regular mayonnaise " . However , the container is pretty cool . Very thin - feeling plastic bottle , and the product comes out well , spreads well . I just thought it tasted kind of yucky .
5 #### This vanilla was recommended by a Craftsy class by Colette Christian . It 's a huge bottle ! ! ! I may never buy vanilla again . I never knew vanilla could taste so good . WOW ! Makes me want to bake more and more and more .
5 #### I was introduced to this in my classes for vision impaired ( Cooking classes ) I like this far better than just the runny vanilla ( that is commercially produced ) the taste is far more intense .. it does provide a great addition to a number of desserts and other ingredients .. just try this .. the bottle really does last quite a bit of time too ..
5 #### Works great when making delicious sushi rolls . It expires fast though so you should use it as quickly as possible !
5 #### I 'm not even that big of a fan of mayo , but this stuff is really good . Great on sandwiches or mixed with wasabi power as a dip . I buy mine at an International grocery store and it think it 's less expensive there . The bottle lasts a while , even though I do not eat mayonnaise every day , I have never had this product spoil on me .
1 #### OK .... I thought I 'd put a bit of punch to hubby 's sandwich , instead of the ho - hum Best Foods Mayo --- ohOoooOh -- FAILURE ! One bite and he said --- Please ! DO NOT EVER SERVE THIS TO ME AGAIN ! I guess it was that - bad ! I 'll see if my neighbor will be able to use it w / her family . If you are a BEST FOODS lover --- walk away --- do NOT purchase this product !
5 #### Your baked goods are as good as the ingredients you use . This vanilla paste is top notch and this size of bottle is very economical compared to buying it 4 oz a time at a store , for twice the price .
5 #### If you love vanilla , you will love this vanilla bean paste ! I use it in place of vanilla in baked goods ( I usually put slightly less because it is vey strong in flavor ) . I just used it to make homemade vanilla bean ice cream and it was delicious . I love it and it will remain a staple in my kitchen .
5 #### I ve ordered several bottles of this vanilla bean paste over the past couple years . Prior to that , I was using a different brand . Similar quality and taste , but Nielsen - Massey is a better value . Thank you for a wonderful product and good value ! Love the free shipping through Amazon !
4 #### This is a great staple to have in the pantry , quality product . Would have given 5 stars but a little overpriced . Wo nt regret the purchase .
5 #### This is the only mayo we use . It has a tangy flavor unlike any other mayo I ever tasted . It 's creamy and does n't taste heavy or oily . I love the squeeze bottle , the larger size has a star tip when the red cap is removed or mayo can be squeezed out through a small hole by lifting up the top of the red cap . We use it in potato and macaroni salad and mixed with soya sauce and wasabi when eating fish . My husband read the ingredients on the package and it does n't say it contains MSG , but we do n't know if all ingredients are listed . We use it in moderation once or twice a week so the amounts of sodium and MSG are not an issue for us .
4 #### I use this for sandwiches , salads , and of course sushi . Great stuff . Love the ook on someones face when they try to guess what s different about that ham and cheese .

5 #### This is the best flavor for whipping cream ! ! You do see the specks of vanilla bean , but then you know it is the real thing .
5 #### Best of the best ! I love this stuff and am pleased they offer it in such a large size . It 's the only vanilla I 'll use . Truly an amazing product , makes a big difference in baked goods , ice cream , etc . high quality .
5 #### We lived four years in Japan and love Japanese food . Was so happy to find this on Amazon as it 's the only mayo we use . It makes yummy potato salad . We boil potatoes in a large pot , drain water , pour on some Japanese rice wine vinegar , add some finely sliced onion , cover and let this sit for a while . When it 's cooled a bit , we add chopped hard boiled eggs , some salt and pepper , a bit of Frenches mustard , and Kewpie mayo . We prefer the potatoes in our potato salad to be more creamy than chunky , so tend to cook the potatoes a bit longer and stir everything together adding more mayo til it 's the consistency we like . This way is similar to what one buys in Japan . Kewpie mayo also makes great deviled eggs !
4 #### After reading other reviews on this mayo , I had to give it a try . I grew up on Hellman 's mayo , and as another review observed , you will probably prefer what you are used to . Kewpie mayonnaise has its own distinct flavor , I ca n't exactly put my finger on what gives it its taste . I want to try making some deviled eggs with it , I think it would give a nice twist on the flavor . I also tried Duke 's mayo , which is a lot like Hellman 's , only with a more pronounced vinegar flavor . I 'm glad I tried both of these , I expect I will use up the Dukes , not sure about the Kewpie mayo . It recommends using within one month after opening . But ultimately , I think I 'll end up staying with what I am used to , which is Hellman 's .
5 #### I always used to hate mayonnaise , and could n't imagine using it as a regular condiment . Turns out I just hated American mayonnaise . Japanese mayonnaise is made with rice vinegar and a spice called ajinomoto , which gives it a hint of the flavor called umami . Umami is a special flavor , found mainly in Asian cooking , that can be detected by the human tounge outside the four basic tastes of sweetness , sourness , bitterness and saltiness . Japanese mayonnaise is much better for cooking , especially for making salad dressings . That hint of umami makes all the difference . Kewpie brand is the most popular brand of Japanese mayonnaise , and so it is a bit of a comfort food like Heinz ketchup is to Americans . Aside from tasting great , it is just nice to see the familiar bottle sitting in the fridge , knowing you can pull it out at any time and make your tacoyaki taste just that much better .
5 #### I purchase this mayonnaise regularly , usually more than one bottle at a time . I use it for making Japanese dynamite sauce , although it is very nice in sandwiches as well . This mayonnaise has a flat taste to it , and is not at all sweetened like American - style mayonnaise . The product is tops but the packaging is a little odd . The mayonnaise itself comes in a squeeze bottle , and the squeeze bottle is packaged in the red - printed cellophane bag you see in the picture . Well , when you remove the bottle from the cellophane bag , you are left with a plain bottle , with no markings on it whatsoever . You will know what is in the squeeze bottle , but others wo n't , so you just need to communicate that to anybody that has access to your refrigerator . A nice little bonus is that the cap on the squeeze bottle has a rosette tip , so you can make fancy little mayonnaise decorations straight out of the bottle if the occasion arises .
5 #### Because it has MSG . People are vastly over - concerned about MSG : it 's a very small percentage of people who may have a legitimate reaction to the stuff , apparently . Consider that the Japanese put it in tons of their food , and it 's all over our food too ( anything made with bouillon , for example ) . This is the best mayo . It makes everything it touches delicious . Sometimes I have to force myself not to buy it because we end up putting it on everything , and I worry at the thought of consuming that much mayo ( ie , for fat and cholesterol reasons , but msg concerns ) . Try this , you 'll be hooked .
5 #### So good and the flavor explodes with vanilla . With the cost of foods exploding at the market and everywhere , this is one product that is a decent buy to have on your shelf . You will save some money . Love it .
5 #### This stuff is good . I mean , REALLY REALLY good . It 's thick , not thin like traditional vanilla extract . I have used it one - for - one in replacing vanilla extract or vanilla flavoring in any recipe . I put it in my coffee in the morning AND my plain Greek yogurt . I 've gone through about 3 bottles of this stuff because I keep giving away " testers " to all of my friends .
5 #### Love Nielsen Massey ! They 're vanilla bean paste is my secret weapon for the best vanilla ice cream . Such a good price for quart of it ! I highly recommend this product !
5 #### This is the best vanilla you will ever have , get the paste , you wo n't go back to regular vanilla ever again ! ! ! !
5 #### I have used this vanilla bean paste for years instead of liquid vanilla in most recipes . It 's the best I have found . And finding it in this large size is just perfect - not only is it cheaper per ounce , but I do n't have to store all those little bottles ! Yes - I use a LOT of it - baking every week ! ! !
5 #### The paste is different than the extract . This is more like a syrup , full of tiny beans and ideal for vanilla ice cream or cream brulee
5 #### This has got to be the best vanilla I 've used . It is so much easier than cutting scraping vanilla pods
5 #### I use vanilla bean paste almost exclusively in the baked goods that I sell . This is a great product at a great price . I was paying MUCH more for it in the stores . HIghly recommend . Great flavor !
5 #### Will never use imitation vanilla again . Love the vanilla bean specks and flavor in cakes , puddings etc . This stuff keeps on giving in everything I cook .
5 #### This is the top of the line . It makes all the difference in how your baked goods taste . It 's even better than making your own vanilla extract with Madagascar beans . I 've been buying it for years for myself and for gifts and have never been disappointed .
5 #### I will never use regular vanilla again in my baking , this is amazing stuff . And the price for this size bottle ca n't be beat
5 #### Heaven in a bottle ! Excellent flavor , easy to use . No more fussing ( and huge cost of ) vanilla beans . This adds an amazing flavor to all my baked goods , true vanilla bean . Love this more than any vanilla extract I 've used .
5 #### I 've tried a whole bunch of vanillas but none of them are as good as this one . The 32 ounce size is a money saver for anyone who uses a good deal of flavoring . Love the look of the seeds in this as well . Rich flavor and you do n't need to use a lot of it .
1 #### Nielsen - massey bourbon vanilla is the worst product I have ever purchased . No matter how little a recipes calls for the bourbon flavor is so pronounced you can not get past it for the additional flavors . Even when you bake with it , it still has the nasty bourbon flavor and not much vanilla flavor . I purchased two additional vanilla beans which I have submerged in this product hoping someday I will be able to use it . The Bourbon flavor is so pronounced that not much vanilla flavor comes through . So disappointed
5 #### This paste works well in smoothies -- in other words , it does n't water down my smoothies , and I think the vanilla bean taste is great .
5 #### A true vanilla - holic I use this vanilla every day . I do n't even measure I just dump it in . Love the flavor , aroma , and bean flecks . I use it in place of vanilla extract all the time . This is a fantastic price for a great quantity . I will be purchasing this again as I 'm sure to run out at the speed I 'm using it . Its more of a syrup than a paste really , but it exchanges for extract beautifully . I usually just take out a bit of sugar from whatever I 'm using it in as the paste does contain sugar .
5 #### As I believe someone else had mentioned , I put vanilla on my vanilla ! This is my kind of vanilla . I even open it up sometimes just to smell it ! And it 's great in pies . We also make a vanilla fruit dip and it 's terrific ! I am just wondering how I am going to scrape the inside of the bottle to make sure I get every drop of it ! My husband even drizzled some over his vanilla ice cream . And I have put some in my hot vanilla chai . Like I said , I like vanilla on my vanilla ! I love that you can actually see the bean specs also . It 's definitely the best I have ever had !
5 #### Really good Vanilla makes all the difference in your baking , I will never go back to Vanilla extract ! Try it you 'll Love it and such a large bottle at an amazing price point !
5 #### This was recommended for all kinds of baking needs . It looks so super and we appreciate its availability through Amazon.com .
5 #### you ca nt beat the taste or the price for that matter on this Vanilla Bean Paste ... you use it as you would regular vanilla , teaspoon for teaspoon , however you get the beautiful little seeds as you get when you use a vanilla bean .
5 #### In my opinion , this is the best vanilla out there . The flavor is good , you can buy it in huge bottles and it 's got those cute little specks of vanilla bean in it . I put vanilla in everything I bake , it 's my favorite flavor . Does n't cook out , stays strong in your baked goodies . Highly recommend .
5 #### It has lots of specks of vanilla beans in here . The taste is wonderful . It is fabulous mixed in to plain yogurt .
5 #### I have been using the very product for about a year . I was purchasing it in the 4 oz size . This quart size is really perfect if you bake a lot . For at least 15 years I was ordering the actual Vanilla Beans in bulk .... 50 at a time . They are expensive . Can run $ 1.00 - $ 2.50 per Vanilla Bean . They also require a deft hand when it comes to splitting the bean and scraping out the tiny vanilla specs . This product has the vanilla bean specs in it . So simple , so easy to do .... just measure . And by - the - way , it even makes your baked goods taste terrific . No more Vanilla Bean purchasing for me . This product is every bit as good as a vanilla bean , with way less work . And so much more economical .
5 #### This is my favorite vanilla for baking , by far ! ! ! I love that it is not a thin liquid but more of a thick , syrup consistency , so when added to anything you are baking ( especially in quantities that are over and above the quantity called for in a recipe , which is a must for me ) it does not alter the end product the way traditional thin vanilla extract does . In addition , like all Nielsen - Massey vanilla products , it has a robust vanilla flavor . Accept no cheap substitute . This is worth the price ; your taste buds will thank you .
5 #### This product has been great . It has a great flavor , the bottle is huge and I would absolutely buy it again and would recommend this product to anyone else looking for a Vanilla Extract or Paste .
5 #### Once you try vanilla bean paste , you will NEVER use grocery store extract again . I love using this in cookies , cupcakes , cakes , cheesecake , creme brulee . We raise chickens so I bake with our fresh eggs and it would seem a shame not to use the highest quality ingredients in my baking . This product ranks up there with the best . I was glad to find this HUGE bottle too - great value ! Lisa Fresh Eggs Daily www.fresh-eggs-daily.com
5 #### It smells great . I have some cookbooks written by " famous " chefs and bakers and have seen several recipes calling for vanilla paste . I went through the first small bottle in no time but I believe this 33 oz . bottle will last a long time . This can be used whenever you need vanilla . It is not really a paste but it is thicker than regular vanilla . Now that I have all that unused regular vanilla I may dab it behind my ears .
5 #### I actually discovered vanilla paste in the smaller quantity here on Amazon and ordered it several times . I absolutely love it and decided to upgrade to this larger size because it is a much better value . The savings are incredible ! I recommend this to anyone that cooks with vanilla extract . Try it ; you will like it !
5 #### This vanilla is wonderful ! I recommend this product to all those bakers who enjoy good quality tasting products . Great for cakes , cupcakes , cookies , butter cream and anything else that requires vanilla !
1 #### This product is very misleading . The bottle states it is pure vanilla bean paste when in fact it is sugar , water , vanilla extract and a thickener added to it . The result is a very sweet vanilla flavored sugar paste . This is not usable for all cooking and absolutely can not be used for anyone prepping food / drinks for someone with blood - sugar issues . This product should be removed from Amazon until the description is updated with the correct description and the proper nutritional information . Update : You can purchase vanillla bean powder ( through many suppliers ) and anything you add after that is completely up to you . If you prefer paste already made , I 'd recommend the vanilla queen . No sugar added ! ! ! vanillaqueen.com/shop/madagascar-bourbon-vanilla-bean-paste/ vanillaqueen.com/shop/tahitian-vanilla-bean-paste/
5 #### To quote a blogger on pinterest.com , " I am cooking with this like it 's a food group " . That sums it up for me as well . I wish it came in an industrial sized bucket . It 's such a pure taste and vastly improves everything I put it in . So enjoy and feel free to use it whenever vanilla is called for . It just seems so gourmet . You will get compliments for certain . Also , it may seem pricey at the outset but to get the result you get from this you 'd have to use three times as much of the grocery store vanilla . I have no problem paying for this as I am tasting the real vanilla .
5 #### I had never used vanilla bean paste before , but I am so glad I ordered it . I use it for everything from cooking to flavoring my coffees and hot teas . Absolutely no complaints and would recommend to anyone !
5 #### I love to make homemade yogurt and ice cream . I have to remember that when I use vanilla past not to use the same amount as vanilla extract . This product is more concentrated and should be used in moderation for the same flavor . It is like using vanilla beans without the hassle of the bean . I love this stuff .
2 #### So far I 've used this to make cookies , pecan pie , banana bread , and whipped cream . This definitely has the flavor profile of Mexican vanilla but it 's very weak . I need 2 - 3 times as much to get the desired flavor . This makes it very expensive to use . As a result , I ca n't recommend this product and I will not be repurchasing . I bought the 2 x 4 oz bottle deal that Amazon had , so I have another whole bottle of this . I 'm considering getting some Mexican vanilla beans and soaking them in it as a way to pump up the flavor . As I said , it has the right flavor , it 's just really weak .
5 #### mexican vanilla . mmm the best . smooth , sweet , good flavor . far superior .
5 #### Best vanilla ever . Just wonderful . Amazing aroma and flavor .
5 #### The flavor in my baking when using Nielsen - Massey productions is amazing
5 #### I use this in making all sorts of raw chocolate , adding cinnamon and cayenne to take the raw cacao even deeper in flavor . Also great for smoothies , like cacao - peanut butter - banana with coconut or almond milk .
5 #### This extract does not even sit on the same scale as any other vanilla extracts .
4 #### It is good . I am looking for real Mexican vanilla . I think I 'll have to find a " Mexican market " somewhere . This vanilla is much better than the standard vanilla , one buys at a grocery store
5 #### Vanilla has different " flavors " and this Mexican vanilla is smooth and adds so much to my recipes .
5 #### This is my favorite . I have purchased a four pack of different vanillas from the same company , and the Mexican vanilla was my favorite . So , this time around I purchased the larger size container . We use a lot , as we make a lot of french toast for our kids , and I bake a lot of banana bread . This has a wonderful aroma and flavor , and I 'm willing to pay a little more to know that I am getting the same quality every time .
5 #### This stuff is high quality ! I use it as my secret ingredient-- in baked goods ( even mixes of brownies , etc ) , pancakes , etc . The mexican vanilla extract is complex and delightful .
4 #### I needed a replacement for some vanilla I got in Mexico about 5 years ago . Could n't find the same brand so went with the Amazon suggestion . Great product , and perfect vanilla flavor .
5 #### Did some research on what the better tasting vanilla 's are and this one from Mexico has the most flavor .. and that 's why we buy it , right ? I add it to plain yogurt with a mix of other healthy ingredients and a little stevia to taste and I 'm in better control of what I choose to eat . Yummy ! !
5 #### Good product- very satisfied . Delivers a strong , yet mellow , vanilla flavor and aroma to baked goods . I will buy this product again .
5 #### I have never been a big fan of maple syrup but I set up an Amazon subscribe and save subscription for this product because everyone else in my family loves maple syrup and I wanted to get an organic product since we go through it so fast . Also , my husband kept complaining that the maple syrup I was buying at Costco just was n't all that great . You can imagine my surprise when I tasted this maple syrup and discovered how amazingly good it is . I never used to put syrup on my pancakes but now I want to make pancakes simply so I can eat some of this syrup . It is that good . I highly recommend this product .
5 #### We love this as it is the real thing and healthy for you . It should n't be wasted on the plate without enough pancakes . It 's too expensive to waste ! Use it like gold and it 's well worth it .
5 #### We use this for pancakes and waffles every morning and it is absolutely delicious ! If you are looking for real maple syrup instead of an artificially flavored table syrup , this is the way to go . I tried&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Highland - Sugarworks - Pure - Organic - Grade - A - Dark - Amber - Maple - Syrup-32 - Ounce - Jug / dp / B0013E21V8 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Highland Sugarworks Pure Organic Grade A Dark Amber Maple Syrup , 32 - Ounce Jug</a>&nbsp;but found that the Coombs Family brand has a smoother , more maple - y taste . This Grade A Dark Amber provides a flavor similar to a table syrup , without the artificial chemically taste associated with those . If you are considering a maple syrup for baking or just like a stronger flavor , I would go with a Grade B.
5 #### While this stuff would be a breeze to make at home , the convenience factor is very high . Tastes great , and will save you time . Very good for a pre - prepared product .
5 #### I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED AT THE FRESHNESS OF THIS PRODUCT . MORE IMPORTANTLY , IT LASTS A VERY LONG TIME UNLIKE THE FRESH GINGER . ON THAT NOTE , I HAVE TO END THIS REVIEW BECAUSE I AM GOING TO ORDER ANOTHER BOTTLE RIGHT NOW
5 #### I have been searching for good pickled pork hocks , meaty but with the nice rind of fat on a decent portion , not soggy , not too sweet ( not sweet at all , blah ! ) . I came West from Iowa , and pork is n't in great demand out here . The jars available are slimy globules of fat , a tiny small bit of meat sometimes , with otherwise decent juice . I do n't drink the juice , so ... that left me with nothing . Then , on an impulse , I checked Amazon . Could n't be , no way , but ... there they were ! It has been so long . I thought that was my favorite brand , but could n't recall . In hope I ordered . A Christmas treat for a grown up gruff - bag ! Delicious . I took both with one hand tied behind my back and in two weeks or less . The length of time due only to as much constraint as I could muster . It 's been half a decade since I 've had my favored man - treats . Yum ! Too broke to order another set until January , but then ... I 'll order two per month until I am out of feasting mode and can store a year or two worth of the delectable . I am easy to please , if you are perfect in your presentation . These , by size and flavor , are it .
5 #### I purchased these based on previous love affairs with pickled pigs feet and pickled pork tidbits by Hormel and other positive reviews of this particular companies other pickled products . Well , I can attest that these are the BEST - tasting and meatiest hocks I 've ever had ! Expensive , yes ... but most definitely worth it ! These bad boys are so good I feel reluctant to share them ! I will most certainly get some more when I get to the second jar !
5 #### I love these . not too vinegary and have a lot of meat
5 #### These were awesome ! Excellent quality - big glass jars .
3 #### They 're OK I guess but they are awfully lean . I like pickled pig 's feet with all of the fat and gristle . These things are lean pork with vinager . Not quite what I was expecting . I got 2 jars . They will last me 2 years .
5 #### I love dried fruit , and these apricots are some of the best I have ever had . Moist , favorful and of the best quality .
5 #### If you like tart and tangy , get California apricots ( such as these ) . If you prefer sweet , bland , and flavorless , get Turkish apricots . These are exactly to my liking , perfect blend of tart + sweet , and a wonderful texture . I will be back for more !
5 #### I buy these regularly and love them . This batch is much dryer than last time but still tasty . Last batch I would , have given 10 stars .
5 #### Best California dried apricots I have ever tried . Will purchase again .
2 #### I 've been buying California apricots for decades ( and occasionally trying Turkish apricots ) . Wherever these are from , they are more like high - quality Turkish than like any California apricots I have ever tasted . As Turkish they are good ; as California , they are not .
5 #### Tangy and delicious . Beautiful bright color . A wonderful alternative to the insipid supermarket apricots . Tart dried apricots are so hard to find and absolutely necessary for some of my favorite recipes . I particularly like this icing for a yellow cake : COOK over medium heat , stirring CONSTANTLY , for 3 minutes : 2/3 cup dried apricots , cooked and mashed ( tart sulfur cured apricots are best ) - 2/3 cup light brown sugar - 2 Tbsp butter REMOVE from heat . ADD : 2/3 cup flaked coconut While warm , spread over cooled 9 x 9 inch cake .
5 #### I love blood oranges . I hate waiting all year until their brief window arrives , and usually I can find them locally ... but not this year . No one had them . So I went with ordering from Melissa 's . I am not sorry I did . Melissa 's oranges came from California , not overseas somewhere , and were SO very good . They shipped extremely fast and arrived well packaged . If you 've never had blood oranges ; you 're missing out . Generally not too different from regular oranges , often more tart and with a richer , more complex flavor hinting at raspberry . They also have even more vitamins and are extremely rich in antioxidants . I 'll just order from Melissa 's again next year to be certain of getting my yearly fix !
1 #### Sorry I could n't eat them , they were partially covered with a chemical substance . No refund .
2 #### these oranges were not sweet . The skin on them was withered . They ended up costing $ 30.00 and I was very disappointed with the taste as well as the selection sent to me .
5 #### This was a lovely treat . We love Blood Oranges . These were perfect and devoured with relish . Looking forward to ordering more .
3 #### They were small and some were molded when they got here . Tough to peel Flavor was ojay not as good as I expected .
5 #### When I opened the box the fabulous smell of these super fresh fruits filled my nostrils . They were superbly packed , top quality and so so so juicy ! I would totally recommend these to anyone looking for these tasty fruits .
5 #### I have become very fond of good balsamic vinegars over the years . I have been using it on salads and some fruits and thought the one I used was the best I have tasted until my wonderful sister - in - law send me a bottle of Fini Modena Balsamic Vinegar WOW what a flavor ! Yes , price is high but when you try it you will not go back to the $ 10 bottle or vinegar ! The old expression " You Get What You Paid For " is a perfect fit . So , if price is the most important thing then by the grocery store vinegar but if you want the best and do n't mind paying for it buy Fini 's ! It is going to be in my pantry from now on . A nice present for me from me!<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Fini - Italian - Balsamic - Vinegar - from - Modena - pack - of-2 / dp / B00162MGJO / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Fini Italian Balsamic Vinegar from Modena - pack of 2</a >
2 #### This taste like it was watered down . Terrible . Would never order again . I like deep rich aged Balsamic and this does nt go near anything .
5 #### Awesome balsamic vinegar - also gave as gift to son and wife - who also love .
5 #### go to balsamic for cold dressings mainly . also great for cooking slow roast meats , etc . adds nice balancer to sweeten hot and savory dishes too .
5 #### By far the BEST balsamic I 've ever tasted . The aging makes it so mellow , with no bite like other , cheaper brands .
5 #### This is my go - to balsamic . Nice balance though getting a bit more pricey .
2 #### My husband and I found the vinegar to be very bitter and would never use it as a dipping sauce . Sure hope after it is mixed with olive oil the taste improves . We had a great balsamic vinegar by Chef Rudi Sodamin on a Holland America cruise and am looking for a thicker , sweeter tasting balsamic that does n't need something added to it in order to improve the flavor .
5 #### Excellent ! I love the taste . Not too sour . Just right for sandwiches and salads . Packaging is also very nice . Will buy again
2 #### actually i just do n't like the bland taste of this vinegar and then there the cost which is a rip
4 #### I had blood orange juice every morning in Italy when we went to northern Italy on vacation . This is not the same taste , more like a mix of grapefruits and oranges , so I was surprised . However , I wanted pure 100 % blood orange juice and that 's what you get here . I am also new to canning preserves and am making a lot of jelly from pure fruit juice . I made 3 half - pint jars using one bottle , with a bit leftover , and using reduced - sugar in my jelly which I like to do ; it came out great , especially since there is no tartness now . It depends what you 're using it for . I wanted it to for jelly , so it needed sugar anyway , and I wanted ONLY juice and nothing else . Not sure I 'd like to drink it regularly , but for my needs , it is perfect . The expiration date on bottles was this July 2014 .
5 #### What can I say . I 'm from Paris so I maybe biased . This is the real stuff and is very good . Keep in mind that it is sweet as it is intended to be and that 's one of the reason why I like it .
5 #### I made Nigella Lawson 's chestnut cheesecake with this , fabulous .
5 #### The taste of my childhood ! Mixed with whipped heavy cream or vanilla ice cream , it 's absolutely delicious . I also like it spread on a crpe .
3 #### It 's great that it is low carb . I usually like ginger a little more spicy and hot . This is a good garnish on the side , but not quite the star that other pickled ginger is .
5 #### I eat tis with my sardines . It 's not sushi but the pickled ginger adds a nice bite to any fish , really . Gives a fast snck tht Japanese restaurant feel .
5 #### I started making my own sushi , and this pickled ginger is a perfect accompaniment . It has a very nice , sharp tang ( and it 's not the really fake pink of some pickled ginger I 've seen in restaurants ) . I ca n't find this in my local stores , so it was a good buy for me .
5 #### Yum , not too happy with the price but this stuff tastes exactly like the stuff you get at mid range sushi restaurants .
4 #### My previous ginger was a Rolands product , AIR . That was OKish but not the best . This Welpac is superior .
5 #### I have been craving pickled ginger for ages but live in the boonies where they do n't know what sushi is much less pickled ginger . This is EXACTLY what they serve in the great sushi places . It 's thinly sliced , spicy , sweet , and crunchy . I throw it in stir - fries , I eat it straight out of the jar . I 'm so glad I took a chance and ordered this , it 's wonderful . And I will be buying many many more jars of it . Highly recommended from a very picky eater !
1 #### Ewwwww ! It has aspartame ! I used to buy a different kind from an Asian market , but was in a hurry and picked this up recently from my local supermarket . Yuck , terrible aftertaste .
4 #### I enjoy the taste of this pickled ginger , especially on plain white rice . I 'm not bothered by the taste of Aspartame that others complain about ; for me , it tastes just like what you get at sushi bars .
5 #### This is the best brand of pickled ginger we have ever tried , so now it 's the only one we buy . Besides eating with sushi , I enjoy snacking on it as it comes from the jar . It looks and tastes just like the kind available in fine sushi restaurants -- perfect even thin slices with just the right flavor . I like that it has Aspartame ( Equal ) as a sweeter because of the need to watch my glucose levels . Unfortunately , so many people have been taken in by controversies spread through elaborate health scares and Internet smear campaigns involving hoax e - mails . Fortunately , Aspartame is approved in over ninety countries throughout the world , so I am not worried that nay - sayers will cause it to go away . Our entire family has been using it since it was first marketed . Equal and Splenda are the only sweeteners we trust . On the other hand , high fructose corn syrup , which has been proven a problem for many people , is in almost all processed foods , even ones that do n't require sweetening . So happy it did n't find its way into Wel - pac .
2 #### I do n't know which is funnier ... these reviews or the price of this product . This can not be for real . Anyone who 'd pay $ 59.95 + $ 20 shipping for a dead rabbit is ... Hmmmm ... I guess I could put up a competing product for $ 59.95 and FREE SHIPPING .... Why , I 'll make a FORTUNE !
4 #### My friend at the Wizard 's university kept getting banished to the Forbidden Zone for doing horrible experiments to reanimate the bodies of the deceased with dark , evil energies that he could not truly control . After the fifth escape , he finally listened to me and got about 50 of these . They are small , so they 're easy to store in a freezer and they do n't contain enough dark energy in them to tear a hole in the thin fabric that separates our reality from the mystic aether when their tiny frames are shot through with eldritch magic and move not of their own accord but the will of my friend , who forges pacts in blood with long - forgotten dread gods . Zombie bunnies only eat vegetables so you do n't need a helmet to protect your brain and 300 of them work just as well as any 50 regular zombies . A GREAT VALUE FOR ANY NECROMANCER
3 #### Perhaps I should 've looked more closely at the picture , but with my seasonal allergies , my contacts were blurry and I thought I was just looking at a very short haired hare . My three year old son wanted a rabbit for a pet , so I ordered this for his birthday . Overnight shipping , of course . I 'm an animal lover and member of PETA , and I ALWAYS order my pets with overnight shipping . Especially during the summer . When they say " fresh " I think they need to be more clear about what that means . I also think they need to look up " whole " in the dictionary , because as my son pointed out between crying jags , this rabbit is definitely missing some of the more adorable pieces . While I 'd normally give this a one star rating for ruining my son 's birthday , I 'm going to add two stars because it WAS indeed delicious : delicate and nutty in flavor .
2 #### I 'm hopping mad just seeing this . We should all paws for a second , and lettuce think about this . Would n't you really just rather have a chicken ? I 'm all ears if someone disagrees .
1 #### Imagine the horror my son felt as he unwrapped his Christmas present to find this bloody carcass instead of a plush toy . It is NOT fuzzy although it is pink .... sorta . More like a greenish red color . There was a stench too ! Now THIS after Hostess took away his twinkies ( Amazon has been wheeling & dealing in $ 500 a box Twinkies , so they must be in cahoots with Hostess ) . This has contributed to his anxiety , which means MORE XANAX to tone that boy down . Very very hard for a 42 yr . old boy to deal with ! He did say , however , that it DOES taste like chicken . An icy cold glass of Tuscan milk makes it perfect .
1 #### I think I must have ordered the wrong rabbit . The rabbit I supposedly ordered came with pearls . I looked all over for the battery compartment and only found one slot that would fit C batteries . Well , the rabbit never turned on and I could n't get my batteries back out of the compartment without using extra lube . To make matters worse , judging by the smell of the rabbit , I think it 's already been used . I have to say I 'm disappointed in this product and I will be exchanging it at the Adult Megaplex for a new one .
5 #### Like most country folks , I spend a lot of time trying to get the wild livestock on my property , arrows and atatali tend to be hard to use to hit small critters like rabbits and squirrels , shotguns and .22 tend to be noisy and scare the others making it difficult to get enough to feed the host of people that are waiting back at the house for dinner . This is a real time saver for only a few hundred dollars , I can feed all . It would be better if it came with the fur and head so I could tan those and make a nice coat , hat or bed cover , after tanning the skin . The best part of it is now my flower bed is over run with squirrels and rabbits .
5 #### My backyard houses the fattest , best - fed rabbit in the world . Bunnykins has eaten dozens of costly perennials and organic veggies in my garden for the last year . I spent 50 on a " cruelty - free " trap , and baited it with fresh produce , and the rabbit still refuses to be caught . If I ever catch it , I now know how to dispose of the carcass .
4 #### I really like the idea of a food source that is n't chicken , turkey or beef raised in feed lots , but it is much more practical to plant a prize winning garden and wait for some rabbits to move in and eat up your prized plants , and then sneak out and tag a few with lightweight transmitter collars in the middle of the night . That way , you have a wild , free range food source . Your herd will get the best free food possible by going out and eating all of your neighbors flowers . Marigolds really impart something great to the flavor of the meat . Sunflower plants also give them a really nice mild flavor . That way , it cost you nearly nothing ( except of course the cost and toil of raising your lovely garden initially ) to have a readily available and fresh food source at hand . With the radio collars , you can easily track where your herd is currently foraging . Whether it be down the street on cranky old Mrs. Hagersteins prized flower , or on your hippie neighbors cherished " Organic and sustainable " vegan garden . Plus , everyone knows that wild , so called " nuisance " pests are the absolute lowest fat , and have the best diet . Good idea though , all the same ! I just like my food source to be " free range " . Mark :)
4 #### I 've already apologized for my miserable luck at keeping fish and other domestic animals alive ... I 've admitted I 'm no good with pets ... so stop pestering me already . When this " fresh whole rabbit " fad caught on , I asked myself , " Could this be the solution to my decades - long run of defunct critters ? " And it was . But be warned , I would categorize this little rodent as " less responsive " than most pets . It seems to be most obedient with the " Stay ! " command . Pets with heads are overrated .
1 #### There once was a rabbit named Clover Sold by Amazon , over and over When they said he was fresh They did NOT mean his flesh Which would make a coyote * keel over When I saw he was missing his head I surmised that old Clover was dead So I took out some cheese Which I melted with ease And served some Welsh rarebit instead * pronounced kahy - OH - tee Note : This item does not come with Amazon 's easy - open packaging . It took me quite a while to find it hidden inside the shiny black top hat , even though the instructions stated quite clearly that it was a riddle , wrapped in a mystery , inside an enigma . In the end , I used the knife , in the kitchen . Amanda Richards , August 31 , 2010
1 #### The manufacturer of this innocuous looking animal has seen fit to hide a rather disgusting form of DRM in it without disclosing this fact to us paying customers . I purchased this rabbit for my daughter , as I thought it would be nice for her to have a more realistic toy than her current stuffed teddy bears and dolls . To my astonishment , it began to smell very bad after only a few hours , and eventually degraded into a hard , wrinkly lump of brittle rabbit flesh . Totally unsuitable for cuddling . It is obvious that the manufacturer expects you to then buy another to replace it . Well not this guy ! Once I have been burned I do not return to the flame for more . I will not be purchasing another Cloverdale whole animal , and I suggest that none of you do either . If we continue to accept these practices , things will only become worse ! What 's next , Cloverdale ? Bears with claws ? * EDIT * It has come to my attention that this animal is intended to be either frozen or consumed immediately at time of receipt . I believe Amazon should be more thorough in their descriptions of products such as this ! I do not think it is unreasonable to assume that people will be buying this animal for reasons other than consumption . Until Amazon changes their description , I will stand by my 1 star rating !
2 #### Well , I ca n't speak for others who may have had a different experience , but my&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Fresh - Whole - Rabbit / dp / B00012182G / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Fresh Whole Rabbit</a>&nbsp;did NOT arrive whole . No head , no entrails , no paws . For just a few dollars more I could have purchased a fully intact one at my local pet store . Granted , I did go with the " Buy it Used " option , to save a few bucks , which may account for some of the wear - and - tear . Buyer beware .
5 #### My only complaint with this product is that other animals do n't come in this form . Please , PLEASE start marketing other fresh , whole food animals , such as deer , elk , water buffalo , and angels !
5 #### This has got to be the most unappetizing picture of any " food product " I 've ever seen on the ' net . For those die - hard veggies who think that this is cruelty at its worst , look at the bright side . This graphic image of a fluffy happy bunny being stripped of its fur , its head and its bowels , could be enough to push me to the veggie side of life and then forever abandon my occasional meat - eating tendencies . What will Amazon sell next ? Uranium in a jar ? Oh , never mind . They 're already selling a handy one - use size jar of Uranium Ore 238 on this site for people who might choose to cook their bunnies in a conveniently sized mini - nuclear reactor . Hey , it 's a swell idea for those fun folks who live off the grid in those isolated cabins high up in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest . You can have your well - cooked bunny and have it glow in the dark , too . God bless the internet .
5 #### The virtues of consuming flax seed are much - extolled , but many people do n't realize that you ca n't get any nutritional benefit from eating the seeds whole ( they simply pass through your system ) . You could ground the flax seeds yourself , or you can buy a great product like this one by Spectrum . Ground flax is a wonderful addition to your diet -- just 2 TB adds protein ( 3 g ) , fiber ( 3 g ) , and healthy fats . Plus , flax has a delicious nutty taste that is perfect on cereal , yogurt , salads , or even as a filler in things like meatloaf . Finally , if you store it in the freezer , it will keep for months -- highly recommended !
5 #### This product is so good for you . I sprinkle it on my cereal , salads , in yogurt , etx . A nice nutty flavor . And the health benefits are outstanding . I highly recommend this product .
5 #### So many great uses ! Taste like wheat germ and is great on yogurt .
5 #### This is very helpful in reducing my bad cholesterol instead of fish oil supplements . I have fish burps all day from the fish oil so I am grateful for another supplement to help my cholesterol ratio get better . I ca n't give test results because I 'm on Obamacare and my plan only lets me get one blood test per year .
5 #### A great way to increase daily fiber intake . Tastes just like ground walnuts . I put it in my smoothies .
5 #### Great product . I put flaxseed on my breakfast every morning and Spectrum is one of my favorite brands .
5 #### Put these in my smoothie for extra fiber ! Great nutty taste !
5 #### Pros : - Absolutely wonderful taste , and texture ! - The health properties are great ! - Great packaging ! Cons : - None ! - -
4 #### I actually bought this for a coworker who does not " order on line " . Since she keeps ordering same product from me time and time again , I assume that they seeds meet her expectations . Personally I prefer seeds that had not been ground .
5 #### Great product . Use it in most recipes where I 'd prefer not to use an egg .
5 #### These taste so good . They give a really nice earthy flavor . I usually add it to my oatmeal in the mornings . They 're not high in calories but packed with amazing nutrients . Definitely going to be a regular buyer .
5 #### Good stuff ! Got a little nutty taste and texture . I put a scoop in each shake I have daily .
3 #### I feel this could be grounded up a bit more . I put this in my smoothies everyday and I hate having the grainy feeling in my mouth . Overall good product , just feel they could grind it up a tad more .
5 #### I like putting it on my cereal . Has a nice nutty flavor too .
5 #### I had an impossible effort to find this locally in my rural area . This is fresh tasting and blended right in with my recipe .
4 #### The only complaint I have is with the bag . It is a zip lock top and because the ground flaxseed is so grainy , it gets stuck in the zip top if you pour any out and will not re - close . The flaxseed itself is wonderful and fresh . I use it , and I also put it in my dog 's food as it helps with older dogs and kidney problems . If you read the kidney formula canned foods , other than meat and vitamins , is flaxseed . So , I make a homemade food for her and add this when I serve it to her .
5 #### Great Product , I use it in baking and smoothies .
5 #### Great quality , use it with the vitamix in smoothies . Males should NOT use flax oil , however , flax is healthy , but the oil is not for men , produces estrogenic effects in oil form . This form , or whole flax seed , is the best way for men to get it in them . Will purchase again . The health benefits of flax for men and women are OUTRAGEOUS . Cancer preventing like a m'fer . go search for flax at nutritionfacts dot org and you 'll see . this is a staple to consume daily .
5 #### I use this everyday . Sometimes several times a day .
5 #### PERFECT ground flaxseed that is one of the most healthy supplements you can put in your body . Added to so many different foods ... from morning cereal , to salads and more . This product is so well packaged , and seals well for refrigeration and constant use . I will continue to buy this product from this company for years to come ! Outstanding !
5 #### Compared to any of the other brands , I prefer this brand the most . Many of them taste like sawdust . This , to me , tastes almost like granola , sort of like walnuts , and I strongly prefer it . I have always received this fresh . I have never had any trouble with it . Once I open it , I keep it well sealed in the refrigerator . It is gone in a week or two , so it is n't sitting around in my house . I think it is a great source of fiber . I need fiber because I want to live forever ! I have ulcerative colitis , and I need to keep my intestines as healthy as possible . I eat this stuff every day in rather large quantities . I put it in everything . I cook with it . I dip blueberries into it . I cover a large plate with it and then add steamed greens and eggs and eat it for breakfast . I add it to soups , sprinkle it on salads , add it to meatloaf , cakes and cookies and brownies . I love love love it !
5 #### I 've been using this for years ... every morning . Love it !
5 #### I have added Flaxseed to my smoothie and love the results .
5 #### This is a repeat buy for me . I find this brand by Spectrum essential is a very good one . It is organic which is what I am looking for . I take this mainly for constipation but also for the omega 3 's in plant form . When using this flax seed I find I stay regular . If you are having trouble with constipation this is a very good and natural way to remedy it . I add it to any food I am eating cooked or raw . I add it to salads and into smoothies as well . Two tablespoons a day is the amount that I use . You can also add this to pastry recipes before baking like cakes , cookies , muffins , breads , you name it . It will also replace eggs in a recipe . You can google ' flaxseed , egg replacement ' to find the correct ratio for your recipe or use mine . For each egg , combine 1 tablespoon of ground flax seed ( measure after grinding ) with 3 tablespoons of water . Stir well , and place in the fridge to set for 15 minutes . After 15 minutes , the result should be a sticky egg - like substitute and it 's ready to go ! If you are in the market for a quality flaxseed that is organic you can not beat this one form Spectrum Essentials . I have used to for a long time with great results health wise and in baking recipes .
4 #### Used two tablespoons per 40 oz of veggie / fruit smoothies . Blended great , tasted like flaxseed . Kept in the fridge between uses and all was well . No complaints .
5 #### Mixes well with oatmeal , and also with protein shakes . No aftertaste , and it 's a healthy boost to any food . Would definitely purchase again .
5 #### I use it in smoothies with any flavor , and it does n't clash with whatever ingredients I decide to use in a given day . Other Flaxseed I 've bought in the past have a stronger taste vs this one which is why when I finally tried it , it became my instant favorite brand . Highly recommended .
5 #### arrived on time . Its all as expected and good product .
4 #### Seems more whole ground than some of the others I have purchased . The only negative is it is a smaller quantity than I expected .
5 #### Great for baking or adding to your shake . Tastes great and works great . Spectrum essential makes a great product and I have n't been disappointed by one of their products yet .
5 #### Very easy to use , put in smoothies , oatmeal or baking . I like the flavor also !
5 #### Delicious . I keep mine in the freezer to keep it fresh . Would buy again .
5 #### Tastes great and a great way to get Omega 3s .
5 #### Great quality product ! Use it everyday in my protein shakes . One of the best natural foods for your body !
5 #### Chia seeds are a healthy source of Omega3 and they keep you regular .
4 #### Has a good , nutty flavor . However , I ended up finding the same product for cheaper at a local grocery store .
5 #### I have nothing to compare this too , it 's the only flaxseed I 've used , I think it 's good .
5 #### Organic , healthy . Price on Amazon is slightly better than healthly food market .
5 #### I pour about 4 tablespoons into a small bowl , add nuts and raisins and then pour boiling water over it . I mix it until it 's uniform ( if it gets too thick I add more water ) and eat it as if it were Cream of Wheat ! It has an excellent chewy texture and nutty flavor . I look forward to it every morning .
5 #### Spectrum Essential Flaxseed Organic Grnd , I like this product , highly recommended , I add it to my breakfast every morning .
5 #### I bought this to help with breastmilk supply . It worked well . And keeps you regular . No flavor so I mixed it with coffee , oatmeal and rice .
5 #### This is a product I use daily , added to my homemade granola . It adds substance and a nutty flavor I truly enjoy .
5 #### Short Review Pros -High Quality = Peace of Mind -Tastes very good and adds a little something to my shakes -Good quantity as well should last me through the month - Blends easily into my shake - Gets the job done -The price was competitive with other brands so no gripes there
5 #### Great for adding a little extra nutrient to recipes ! I had no issues with this product and I 've only used it in homemade granola bar recipes and similar foods but I 'm sure it can be used for other ones too .
5 #### taste fresh , no bitter after taste , sweet . I use them on cereal , ( whole as well as ground)ground up in smoothies ( grind first or use this) ... good for you . I 've ordered other nut etc products that were awful so these were a nice CHANGE ! ! ! ! Short and sweet review :)
5 #### Tastes good , I use it on salad , cereal , soups and it blends right in .
5 #### Very thankful to be able to purchase this ground flax seed on Amazon . It is so nicely ground and blends well with so many things !
5 #### This ground flaxseed is great . It is very fresh and has many health benefits . The bag is a great size and last for a while . It has a nice zipper seal which helps keep the flaxseed fresh , and can just be popped right into the fridge . I use it for the great health benefits and increasing my fiber . I add it to my smoothies , breakfast , and sometimes salads . I like how fine the flaxseed is ground , I do n't even notice it added too my food !
5 #### Not too much to say about this product , only use in smoothies , 3 tbsps , no grainy taste , but that could be relative to the other ingredients .
5 #### This ground flax seed is very easy to use , I add it to many foods . There is no taste that I can discern which is fine with me . I will no doubt re - order when the supply gets low .
5 #### Purchased this twice already and probably will continue to buy this from here unless I can find a cheaper price . Very happy with my purchase . I put flaxseed on everything . It 's supposed to have very good health benefits and I suffer from an autoimmune disease .
4 #### great GROUND product . will be using it in all my bread .
2 #### Not only does the product only slightly resemble restaurant flavor ; it just does n't appear to be quality product . And folks , DEFINITELY not worth the price .
2 #### This tea is ok , it 's not bitter but it is so disappointing . I have been searching for a jasmine oolong that I had in a Japanese restaurnat that was so good . This tea is not it . You ca n't even really smell the jasmine in this tea . The tea I had at the restaurant was a golden color with a slightly sweet taste and aroma of Jasmine . I have bought so many teas trying to find it . The saleslady at the fancy tea shop assured me that this was the tea I have been looking for . NOT ! Years ago , I had a manager that came from Japan and she took me to a restaurant which her family and friends frequented and I have not had tea like that since . HELP , I want to enjoy tea like that in my own home .
5 #### I love it and will continue to order and tell others about it .. I use it daily in my nutribullet .
5 #### Great product . Hearty size bag for the money . Well worth it .
4 #### It 's not quite the same as the tea in the Chinese restaurant , but close . Still kinda woody , heavy on the Oolong .
5 #### Makes a big difference in my digestive system . I throw it in my cereal , no big taste difference . Even use in my salads . Very very pleased . Not sure of other benefits , was recommended to me to help stomach and it has worked .
5 #### Wonderful . I add it to smoothies or mix it in with lowfat yogurt . Tastes fine .
5 #### I love this product - use it every day on my cereal , in my smoothies and on salads .
5 #### For good health ; my grandfather on the farm in Canada in 1910 used to put this on his oatmeal everyday for good health .
3 #### Buy this locally if at all possible . Paying $ 8 for a very small box of tea is n't worth it . The flavor is very similar to Trader Joe 's Green Tea with Jasmine . Buy that instead .
5 #### I 've tried many , many different teas and nothing is as good as this ! I will buy this again and again !
1 #### This us no way like Chinese restaurant tea when eating out . I will still look .
4 #### This does actually taste like the tea you get in chinese restaurants . I thought oolong tea was chinese restaurant tea , until I tasted this one .
5 #### The product was fresh and sealed nicely . The product was accurately described in the product description . Overall good product .
5 #### love it thank yoou for the fast serice . also for the high quality product
5 #### tastes just like what I am served in our local Chinese restaurants
5 #### Cheaper to buy local just look in the grocery but the nice resealable package is good so it can go in the fridge .
5 #### I add this to my oatmeal ! I put it in before I cook the oatmeal , and then I do n't even know it is there ! :) I also add it to cereal and yogurt . It 's does n't taste bad , and I love all the health benefits . I recommend this to anyone . Amazon seems to have the best price for this . :)
3 #### Tast o.k but does nt remind me of the tea served at the chinese restaurants --- I think oolong tea is better
1 #### It does not taste like Chinese Restaurant Tea . Much more " earthy "
5 #### JUST LIKE CHINESE RESTAURANT TEA ADD EXTRA BAGS FOR STRONGER FLAVOR OR SUGAR OR AS U LIKE IT
5 #### We use flaxseed in many things , pancakes , cookies , shakes . I would buy this again
5 #### No problem with shipping and use of the product . I will purchase again .
5 #### Good quality product . I use it almost every day .
5 #### As a vegan , love the flax seed as alternative to fish oil for omega 3s .
5 #### I had never used ground flaxseed before but I really like this stuff . It works great in protein shakes . I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a quality ground flaxseed .
5 #### they are great- I put them in my muffin mix and in my smoothies
5 #### Item arrived quickly and I was able to use to make some lactation cookies which so far seem to be working great ! Price was extremely competitive to what I would have paid at sprouts .
5 #### very easy to pass through your system . you will like this product . THANKS .
5 #### Just what I needed . I was making dog cookies and one recipe called for these . I only feed my pups organic , so this was perfect . Just the right size too , enough for 2 recipes . Arrived on time and in good condition .
3 #### I thought this was the seed but it was n't I have no use for this
5 #### Not sure how to review this item . Came in fresh , tastes good . Satisfied .
4 #### I bake with this . I like the packaging , and it is always fresh and stays fresh a long time .
5 #### This really works ! has an appealing nut - like flavor . I am a very picky eater and this may be eaten by the spoonful or sprinkled on food ! BUY THJS
5 #### Always fresh . Good price . Ground fine . This stuff is revolutionary for my intestines ! 1 or 2 tbls on my cereal everyday . TRY IT !
5 #### I 've noticed my concentration improve after a few weeks of taking this . Highly recommend it .
5 #### I had heard about the great health benefits of flax seed and decided to try it out . After reading the descriptions and reviews for several brands , I finally decided on this one . It has a subtle nutty flavor that tastes great on my cereal each morning . I order several bags at a time and am always pleased with the fast shipping .
5 #### Bought this to use in a recipe for no - bake cookies . Perform an internet search on " oatmeal - flax - peanut - butter no - bake cookie " and you 'll find variations of this recipe . Probably be a good power - bar replacement , and possibly more economical . I use almond butter instead of peanut butter , add a little more salt , and if the recipe calls for vanilla , it works without that just fine . I also add either cocoa nibs or just regular old chopped up Toll - House semi - sweet choc chips , but you could use carob chips or leave them out altogether .
5 #### Spectrum makes great products and the ground flaxseeds are no exception . I use this for my smoothies and they blend wonderfully !
5 #### Product is as expected . Tastes great ! I use it every day in either my morning oatmeal and/or a freshly made juice !
5 #### Fantastic product and will keep buying it , especially for the health benefit .
5 #### The product is everything that I thought it would be and it arrived as expected .
5 #### excellent quality i have stage 4 cancer and this flaxseed helps so much i swear by it
5 #### Good value . Flaxseed is ancient and under - rated for maintaining health and prevention . Received product quickly .
5 #### I like the quality and that it is ground , so that I do n't have to grind it .
5 #### Great product , i have been using this product for over 3 weeks and i feel the difference .
5 #### I love it ! I use this in my smoothies , in baking and also as an egg replacement . I would recommend Spectrum brand !
5 #### This is good quality flax seed . Fresh and can be used on good and in shakes , etc .
5 #### FRESH AND PACKED VERY WELL . I SPRINKLE IT ON MY CEREAL ..... VERY NICE TASTING AND I WILL CONTINUE TO REORDER . VERY SATISFIED .
4 #### I have found multiple uses for the ground flax seed . I use on salads of multiple types . I use on a garden salad and I use when I make tuna salad . I use with Agave on my waffles in the morning which is a great way to start the day . I will use in chicken salad the next time I make it . The only draw back is closing the pouch it comes in . Sometimes the two sides do n't line up properly . Otherwise it is a very useful product .
5 #### I started using flaxseed on my oatmeal is I 'm satisfied with the mild nutty taste so slowly been adding to my yogurt & other meals . Very satisfied & definitely recommend .
5 #### Having used this brand of flaxseed several times , it 's become my favorite . Has a nice flavor . It 's best to grind it to the desired texture . Easily done if you have a coffee bean grinder .
5 #### I could n't be more pleased with this ground organic flaxseed . I am a PCOS sufferer and flaxseed has a HUGE place in my everyday maintenance .
5 #### Excellent quality ground flaxseed . Seems to be fresh and has a good taste .
5 #### The best flaxseed I 've tasted . Fresh and nutty tasting , ground smoothly so it goes well on oatmeal , peanut butter sandwiches , etc . I 'm more than satisfied with this product .
5 #### This came very fast , and I love the product !
5 #### It is everything I expected . I purchase this every 2 months .
5 #### Great healthy product at a good price . The fact that it is organic is also a plus .
5 #### Great organic ground flaxseed that goes perfectly in cereal and sauces , too . You can also use it as a substitute for eggs in baking .
5 #### They have been working just great for both my smoothies and my protein shakes . My wife and I just love them
5 #### so good in muffins and mixing with fiber mix
5 #### Really enjoyed this ! Easier than grinding your own . I keep mine in the fridge to retain freshness as long as possible . I add a little in to my oatmeal every morning .
5 #### We have used organic ground flax seed for over a year now and can tell a difference in our overall health . I use it in cakes , cookies , meatloaf , our hot oatmeal and cream of wheat . Anywhere , really , where I can tuck a few tablespoon fulls without affecting the flavor or textures of my dishes . This is an organic way to keep our digestive systems working smoothly without using any harsh stimulants I 've always read that Americans do n't get half enough fiber in their diets and a lot of our ailments could be wiped out if more fiber were added to our to our every day eating . It 's rich in Omega 3 fatty acids and has 3 grams of fiber per serving . If you think that the whole flax seed is better for you then think again . It passes through the human system whole without digesting . That 's why the ground flax seed is the better way to go . And since I 'm eating flax seed , I decided that organic is the only way to go . Spectrum Essential Organic is always fresh and good quality .
4 #### I purchased this products for my husband , he likes to take it with his breakfast in cereal with oatmeal etc . , and he loves it . I started taking it too and I love it also . This is essential flaxseed that we both need and like and the fact that it 's organic makes it even better . Good stuff .
3 #### The product is good but I realize now I prefer regular flax seeds to ground flax seeds . Just a personal preference .
5 #### Excellent product - very fresh ! Put it in yogurt , pancakes even brownies ! Possibilities are endless .
4 #### Like its taste when i put in my milk . Also in yogurt it does taste so good .
5 #### Very good ! I sure do enjoy adding this to my smoothies .
5 #### I use in my Nutribullet with my green smoothies almost daily . Not gritty
5 #### Made this purchase to use when making smoothies . I usually have a nutritious smoothie every morning for breakfast and I use the organic ground Flaxseed as an added boost to make the smoothies even healthier . Great price for the product which I will purchase again .
5 #### Great packaging , Easy to open & reclose . Nice fresh smell !
5 #### 3 tablespoons a day in tea really helps settle my digestive system and reduce flair ups . 75 % cure for my Chrones and a faster recovery when I get food allergy related diarrhea . Plus lowers cholesterol , improves memory ( omega 3 ) and has both types of fiber in one shot . Tastes kind of bad , but tastes much better than the other brands . I cover the taste by drinking cardamon chai tea with it in the morning .
5 #### I put this in my overnight oats and it 's pretty good !
5 #### Fresh and tasty - a great dietary addition to support health . Delivery was very prompt and packaging for shipment was done well . Since I wrote this original review , I have continued to order this product from OxKom and remain highly satisfied .
5 #### I bought this for my brother who had read about the greatness of the product . He received it last week ( he lives in PA ) and was delighted to have received so quickly . He uses it on his cereal and salads and loves the nutty flavor .
5 #### just got it and it 's exactly as ordered , would order again
5 #### Great . Quick shipping . Reasonable price ( especially for an item that will ship to an overseas APO address ) . I am thankful to have it for my baking needs .
5 #### Perfect ! ! Just what I wanted , plus became super fast ! Thank you guys so much
5 #### I really like this product ! I feel better when I use this in my shakes .
5 #### This is a great addition to any smoothie . I would not put too much in as it has a nut taste and if you put more than you should you will have auntie taste and a bad after taste . You should not add more than 1 tablespoon in a smoothy anyway . If you do , you could running to the bathroom or not drinking it becuase they taste is too much .
4 #### Used in Quaker Oats Old Fashioned oatmeal . Mixed well and did not change flavor of oatmeal . I have not tried flaxseed in anything else .
5 #### Great taste and aroma . I use it in smoothies .
5 #### So proud of the Spectrum Ground Flaxseed . Full of good stuff for me ! I 've read that flaxseeds are a " rich source of micronutrients , dietary fiber , manganese , vitamin B1 , and the essential fatty acid alpha - linolenic acid , also known as ALA or omega-3 . " I heard or read that ground flaxseeds are more effective than the whole seed . And I do n't miss an opportunity to add a T. to my oatmeal or fruit with kefir , yoga , nuts , etc . At 66 , I 'm interested in eating healthy . This certainly fits well into that program . Get some !
5 #### Flaxseed is one of the best super - foods that you can eat . But did you know that your body can not digest whole seeds ? ! You either need to grid it yourself ( ai nt ' nobody got time for dat ) or buy ground seed ( which is what I did ) . Spectrum provided me a superb , fresh product that I add to my smoothies in the morning . It give the smoothies a wonderful subtle peanut buttery taste , and I am relieved to know that I am consuming an organic product as well . I will definitely be purchasing again .
5 #### Great product ! This is my second purchase of this product . I would recommend it .
5 #### Great product , everything I expected . Quick delivery . I have no complaints
5 #### Received sooner than expected . Great product , use it every day in blender mix . Will order again . Highly recommend . Will not disappoint .
3 #### Saw a recipe for Parmesan Flaxseed crackers , tried it , it tasted bad . That however does not mean there is anything wrong with the Flaxseed , I just need to find a better way to use it .
5 #### The product is very fresh . I was somewhat worried buying it online but I will purchase again . I have stored the bag in my refrigerator to preserve freshness .
5 #### really good on cereal . I put some on ice cream .
5 #### I love this ground flaxseed- add it easily to any recipe actually to anything- love it ! !
5 #### Very pleased with quality . Spectrum products are grrat
4 #### I add this to smoothies and baked goods . It was recommended by a nurse for my son 's constipation . It works and also adds vitamins , minerals and omega-3s to your diet . Adds a nutty taste and texture to cookies , muffins and even apple crisp . I prefer to use it in smoothies in order to retain all the nutrients . The only con is that I had to transfer the contents to another container as the resealable bag was defective . I just happened to get the one bag that did this , I 'm sure . I will re - order this product as I like it very much and is an easy way to add fiber to the diet ..
5 #### I have never tired dark ( black ) soy sauce before , so I do n't have a real comparison , but I love this flavor . Compared to normal Kikkoman brand fermented soy sauce , the flavor is just as salty , but with a much more intense rich " brown " flavor . I find it much preferable to normal soy sauce in all applications . I am going to toss out the Kikkoman bottle !
5 #### I am so excited ! I have n't been able to find this double black soy sauce since ( I worked in Boston ) I shopped at the markets in Chinatown on the outskirts of downtown Boston . The flavor of this soy sauce really makes my dishes , especially my pork lo mein , taste authentic ( I guess I mean as it tasted in the restaurant ) . Go easy though , the flavor is intense ! Thank you , Amazon , for carrying these wonderful imported treasures .
5 #### Add spoonfuls to yogurt and cereal for a special flavorful , nutritious treat .
5 #### Product has a light nutty flavor ; it 's really yummy . This flaxseed is fresh and high quality . I used it to bake brownies and bread this week and they turned out really well - my family could n't tell there was any flaxseed in them but I noticed the light flavor addition . This is a great way to add omega-3 and fiber to your diet without taking yucky supplements . From what I understand , flaxseed can be used to replace eggs in recipes . This is my first time using , so I only replaced 1 egg in my recipes with 2 tablespoons of flaxseed and it turned out great !
5 #### Fresh tasteful and delicious ! Will buy again both berries and plain ... package easy to work with and store .. Dietician gave me micro muffin recipe so I use this every day !
5 #### I use this flax everyday on my Paleo diet , excellent
5 #### A rich taste with notes of sweetness if your into 50 year ol.d rich aged vinegar as aposed to apple vinegar in a plastic gal jug try this next time you reach for soy sauce .
5 #### Great taste . Enhances food much better than the soy sauce available from the market . Will buy again .
5 #### I have just used this on a stir fry and was pleasantly surprised with the good flavor . The bloody bottle was hard to open because it had a beer type cap which seemed to not want to let go . But what 's inside is what counts and the flavor is excellent . Highly recommended .
5 #### This is the kind of soy to use on chow mein or chop suey . It is not so salty as to make your food over - salted . A little goes a long way . Has a hint of molasses taste but this is not sweet soy . Use as a basic starter for a million different dipping sauces . i do n't cook with this but I guess you could . Cheap and last a long time .
5 #### I love Spectrum Essential Organic Ground Flaxseeds ! They are full of Healthy Omega 3 's and taste really good . I sprinkle them on my sliced fruit for breakfast and enjoy the nutty taste of them . I highly recommend them .
5 #### Excellent product . Mixes beautifully with coconut flour , almond flour for baking
5 #### It arrived on time as promised and as shown .
4 #### Nice clean product with no odd debris or suspect lumps . Color is a nice nut brown , slightly lighter color than the other brand I purchase , but consistent and with gold flecking . Product is dry and well protected in it 's packaging ; no odd or slightly off aroma . I had happened to run out and needed this , so I used it immediately in my gluten free flour blend . It gave a nicer more soft nutty flavor to the flower than my previous brand . We also add it to our breakfast oatmeal and the results were the same . A soft nutty flavor , not overpowering . The grind is fine enough that there were no clumping issues in the oatmeal or flour blend . Some brands I 've tried have almost an oily feel to them , this one did not , a good indication of proper processing . The grind is fine but by no means would it dissolve in water , which is fine for the way I use it . It 's perfect for use in oatmeal , smoothies , gluten free flour blends , added to cookies , bread , pancakes , and muffins to add nutritional value without being obvious . A nice product that will replace my usual brand .
5 #### This product works what else I can say it keeps me regular and unlike psyllium husk does not bloat you . I have been taking it daily . Also once you open it you have to put it in the fridge .
5 #### Love this product , particularly that it 's organic and cold milled . Have it in my " health drink " and organic Oatmeal every morning . My wife also uses it in a number of the recipes she makes including whole wheat bread , meatballs and others I ca n't think of . I know this is picky but I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars because the last " resealable " package I received just wo n't seal , which I 'm sure will affect the life . Packaging sealability improved with my latest orders . Going to 5 stars . Love this stuff .
5 #### great produce and price . fast shipping . highly recommended . 4 Stars
5 #### This flaxseed is fresh and the grind makes it easy to ingest
5 #### I LOVE IT ! I have only ordered twice so far and so far extremely satisfied ! ! There is ONE concern . When it arrives it is so hot from the travel . Us that okay ?
5 #### I use this for too many things to mention here but my main use is for flax eggs ! Nobody should eat real eggs anymore . The convenience of the flax being ground and the quality maintained is terrific . Add to everything ! ! !
5 #### Has a good nutty flavor . I add a tsp to cold cereal , or you can add it to any dish you 're making for some good added fiber .
5 #### Ordered to add to smoothies . this is very well ground and ca n't taste it at all . very happy with it
5 #### This is perfect for smoothies . You do n't taste it . But it 's not bad tasting anyway . Ground is the best way to take Flaxseed .
5 #### I love the sealable packaging , and the flaxseed is just what I wanted . I put it in everything !
5 #### Very satisfied with this project . Especially enjoy adding to green smoothies .
5 #### Great nutty flavor and I like how these are packaged . Very happy with my purchase .
5 #### My daughter has cerebral palsy . Wanted to include omega in her diet but she refuses to eat fish . This is when I tried this product little sprinklers on top of yogurt or rice or pasta sauce :-)
5 #### This flax is wonderful and tasty . I keep it in my fridge once opened and feel so good when eating it , as though I am doing something good for my body . Very easy to digest .
5 #### Great stuff , did find it way cheaper at my local grocery store though . I add this to everything ( oatmeal , smoothies , cereal and others ) . It 's supposed to help increase milk supply , I think it helps
5 #### Taste great and no extra crap ingredients . I 'm happy I bought this .
5 #### Used whenever I make an apple pie smoothie , or to sprinkle on my oatmeal . EXCELLENT PRODUCT !
5 #### I had been taking flax seed whole , then I read that ground flax seed is better absorbed into the body for better results . Only been taking it a few days so far so its too early to tell , but I expect good results . The flax seed arrived on time and was packaged well .
5 #### Great taste and useful version of healthy product . Great value for organic . Getting omega3 as a vegan can otherwise be a huge challenge . I add the ground flaxseed to hot and cold cereal , moreso for the former . It mixes really well with oatbran and oatmeal . Also , adds well to recipes and box mixes for baked goods - like a 1/4 to 1/2 cup depending on the size of the recipe , volume of mixture . I also like to add chia seeds as well to hot cereal , cooked quinoa , and baked goods as well .
5 #### Very healthy , I use these on a daily basis . I mix with yogurt and cut - up fruit ( along with chia seeds ) . But do n't pre - mix ahead of time , because the fiber swells from water a bit . Mix and eat within an hour . The taste is fine , I even put it in my daughter 's oatmeal and she ca n't taste it . My cousin recommended these for me , and she 's a health nut . I got my mom hooked on those as well . Will definitely buy again .
5 #### Easy to use . We spoon this over cereal and yogurt .
5 #### I throw into anything like yogurt , cottage cheese , cereal and even on fruits for my toddler . She is easily constipated so I add it to her foods and she has been a lot more regular now . I also enjoy it in my own foods . I recommend it !
5 #### Good product , pretty tasty . Mixes well into cookies and brownies .
4 #### This is the first time I 've order ground flaxseed . But I 'm finding all kinds of uses . I put it in my oatmeal in the mornings . Plus it 's great in smoothies or in yogurt
5 #### Great organic way to spleen your omega 3 with added benefit
5 #### Product was fresh . Bag easy to open & seals back . I have used this for a long time and never been disappointed .
4 #### I use it to mix in smoothies . It 's a healthy addition to my drinks .
5 #### Ground Flaxseed . It came on time . It did it 's job . No complaints except that its flaxseed and who really " enjoys " flaxseed .
4 #### Great product , I add it to my veggie smoothie and I believe it helps me stay healthy ! !
5 #### Excellent . Love this product . Will buy again . Fast delivery .
5 #### I like to eat it with morning oatmeal , even so , I read doctors recommending eating first thing in the morning couple of spoons , but it are so dry and after drinking water it is sticks to teeth . But for better looking skin , I will keep do it :)
5 #### We love this flaxseed . It gives the food an added nutty flavor , and has a good texture .
3 #### I was expecting this to be a finer ground so it would dissolve in a drink . But it 's more of a course ground , so when I add it to a drink , it just settles at the bottom .
5 #### This stuff is awesome . I use it in my green smoothies for fiber . I was using benefiber before , but I like this better because it is organic .
5 #### Love to eat and bake with and very good quality and taste . Most people will tell you to grind your own as needed for best quality but I love these b / c its easy to use since its in ground form and it tastes and energizes me without any difference from whole seeds .
5 #### This has all the characteristics I want in my ground flaxseed : organic , sealed package , resealable , and processing ( breaking open the seed hulls ) temperature as low as possible . After opening , I keep it in the refrig and use in a smoothie daily . And the price is good when buying 3 at a time too .
5 #### I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR GROUND FLAXSEED TO ADD TO MY MORNING SMOOTHIE ... THIS IS JUST THE TICKET AND I HAVE BEEN USING IT EVERYDAY
5 #### I buy this on a regular basis and add it to a variety of things when cooking . I even toss it on top of a salad , or on vegetables along with a TBS of olive oil and then either roast them or eat them raw . Flaxseed is an excellent source of Omega-3 fatty acids and fiber .
5 #### I was surprised how easy that you can mix this . I put in my salad and smoothies and al foods actually .
4 #### This was a very healthy ingredient to add to my home made energy bar no bakes . Add some good fiber and protein
5 #### I add this ground flaxseed and chia seeds to my daily green juice . Flaxseed has amazing benefits , what 's not to love ? I am very impressed with Spectrum products , very good quality .
5 #### Ground flaxseed is rich in Omega 3 , and I personally like this organic brand . Comes quickly , always fresh , organic , and I have never had a complaint .
5 #### Love this stuff . I put it in my yogurt with fresh or frozen fruit . It gives it a nice nutty taste .
5 #### I use it in my smoothies and sprinkle it on my food . It has great nutritional values to boot . It is definitely something that I will keep as a staple in my cupboard .
5 #### I 'm new to the flaxseed scene and I must say I love it ! I like the ground seeds for convenience and cold - milled is best to preserve nutrients . This is good in everything from protein shakes to pancakes to coffee ! Great product !
5 #### I love this stuff - I ordered it before , and I 'll order it again . It 's fresh and well ground unlike a lot of packaged options I find in the grocers , and it is a great value for the cost . The packaging for this is great , because it keeps it really fresh for a long while , as it takes us a while to go through it for smoothies and other uses . But this is the only flaxseed I use anymore .
5 #### Flaxseed is one of my basic must - haves in the house . Love this one , it 's the only one that I 'll buy .
5 #### I have used this product for some time and continue to use it because it is fresh and healthy . I use it in my shakes or over cereal and salads .
5 #### I use at least 1 - 2 tablespoons per day in smoothies that I make for me and my husband . I highly recommend .
5 #### Very finely ground and easy to mix with cereals , yogurts , smoothies . I do n't really notice any flavor but I have not eaten it by itself .
5 #### So I used to use whole flax seeds in my food until I found out I would n't absorb the nutrients , so this is not as nutty but still has a somewhat nutty taste to it . I 'm not completely sold yet on consistency but I just think I need to adjust to the fact that they 're not whole nuts . I 've been putting them on my oatmeal in morning and protein shakes too . I 'm also going to try them in my baking , like for protean bars and bran muffins . I store them in fridge to extend shelf life .
5 #### excellent brand at a good price . I have been using this brand for sometime and find it to be a added benefit to my new healthy lifestyle .
4 #### I liked this flaxseed and I think I will be ordering more of this brand . I 've ordered a different brand to try but I like this one much more . This flaxseed is much more pleasant in taste and texture and even color .
5 #### I use this almost daily . I love that it is organic and finely ground . I can easily incorporate it into recipes .
5 #### This was a great tasting and very healthy product as well as a good amount for the price I paid .
5 #### I have been using flaxseed meal for my smoothies for several years and I also cook with this . Great health benefits .
5 #### I got this flaxseed because I have been dieting and needed more fibre in my diet . This has helped my problem .
5 #### I tried different brands and this is the best tasting with the freshest date . I love to make meatballs using oats instead of bread they come out absolutely perfect with this stuff . The texture and flavor is spot on . Magnifico !
5 #### I am on my third bag of this ground flaxseed ... this product is the best tasting ! super fresh ! I add 2 TB to my morning bowl of steel cut oats with 1 tsp of cinnamon ... the taste is nutty and yummy ! not to mention the wonderful health benefits !
5 #### I love Spectrum 's Flaxmeal . It 's mild in flavor , finely ground , and fresh . The mildest flavor and highest quality flaxmeal I 've tried . From a great company too !
5 #### Ground flaxseed is recommended by Dr. Oz , WebMD , MayClinic , and other health experts . Flaxseed is packed with Omega-3 essential fatty acids , " good " fats that have been shown to have heart - healthy effects . Each tablespoon of ground flaxseed contains about 1.8 grams of plant omega-3s . It also has Lignans , which have both plant estrogen and antioxidant qualities . Flaxseed contains 75- 800 times more lignans than other plant foods . Also , it is loaded with both soluuble and insoluble fiber . This is the main reason I started using this product . I found that once I started using 1 tbsp . in the morning and 1 tbsp . in the evening , the frequency of eliminations improved by 50 % . I mix a tbsp . in unsweetened cranberry juice , per Anne Louis Gittlemans " long - life - cocktail " recipe . Also , I notice that Jillian Michaels from the Biggest Loser , also recommends flaxseeds in a cranberry drink as well . If you do this , be sure to use unsweetened cranberry juice .
5 #### Good nutty flavor . Great for use in homemade breads or muffins , on salads , cooked cereals , yogurt , etc .
5 #### This is a great product . I am very happy with it . The only problem I have is the delivery . I had to wait 3 or 4 weeks .
5 #### It tastes Good easy to Use . I Use it my Yogurts , on cereal even In My Baking . Its SO easy & It Taste Good . Love the bag too , it stands Up in refrigerator and seals well , with the strip . Good stuff !
4 #### It is always great to receive a tower like this . Good chocolate , beautifully packed . The only complaint was that a corner was sloightly crushed
5 #### Rocky Mountain chocolates are savored in small bits from experience . I ve sent this bundle to several people who , as it turned out , had never heard of Rocky Mountain . I received a thank you call this week from one chocolate connoisseur client on the East Coast that I gifted . The person complemented that this is the best chocolate ever and that was precisely the purpose of sending this package . 5 - star great gift .
5 #### After reading the reviews here I had a few moments of doubt . However , since I had ordered from this company before ; I chose to order this item and sent it to my boyfriend for Easter . He is a very honest person and he would have been gentle about it but would have told me if there was an issue . It actually arrived ahead of schedule so he is already enjoying his . So over all I would say it is a great Easter Gift and would highly recommend this item .
2 #### I ordered a lot of stacking boxes of goodies this year . I have received complaints from every recipient . Never again .
5 #### I bought this as a gift for someone and they said they really liked it . So I never saw it or tasted it . I guess they could have just been being nice but they thought it cost alot so I think they really did like it .
5 #### Good stuff in each box . It was like a new present with every box . The snacks were very yummy ya .
5 #### You really ca n't compare these with twizlers , twizlers are a different candy entirely . You might as well compare these with m&ms or lamb chops . Soft , delicious , perfect .
5 #### There 's something about these that 's just plain addictive . My first bite ( a 4 pound one bought for my wife ) made me think ... meh , it 's alright .. then I took another .. then I ate like 5 in a row , LOL ! ! They really are good , and like I said , you 'll want more . We finished the 4 pound container off a few weeks ago , and then I ran across this CHEAPER at the time 5 pound container ! ! Ordered and enjoying !
5 #### Yum I love red licorice and black licorice I finally figured out red licorice has cinnamon in it that 's why it 's red
5 #### TOTALLY YUMMY . CAME FRESH , AND GOT DEVOURED AT A FAMILY PARTY . EVERYONE LOVED IT . CAN'T GO WRONG WITH RED VINES .
1 #### It unfortunately tastes like medicine with a hint of chemical taste . Totally terrible . .
4 #### Usually when I get these , they 're perfect . The last tub I bought had a bunch of broken fragments , which I 'd guess was caused by it being stored in a variable temperature environment . The flavor was still good , but they 're usually great .
1 #### This does n't even taste like licorice . Twizzlers is the brand I intended to purchase . I would not recommend this product .
5 #### Tasty without too much sugar . I got to get more of this licorice . Already bought 3 tubs . Yummy !
4 #### Smell , and taste , like the plastic tub . Improved by letting them sit , open , overnight to air out .
5 #### My husband loves red licorice and these we just right for him to enjoy as he travels . Will order again if the cost does n't soar .
5 #### Okay .... I ca n't put a real thorough review on a tub of candy but here goes ..... my bride likes the red twist candy stuff . I think she buys a different brand and certainly in smaller amounts . This is a 5.5 pound TUB of twists . That is a bunch of candy and it wo n't fit into her Christmas stocking , but I am calling it good . The tub will sit on the kitchen counter , maybe in a cabinet , for awhile . Some of it will get snacked on but at the end , a good portion will go in the trash . Not because the product is not good , because it is more candy than my bride and I together would eat in a year . Why did I buy such a big amount ? Who the heck knows ? Not me .
5 #### This tube keeps the Red Vines soft and fresh .
2 #### Could have played a drum solo with these sticks .
5 #### My favorite ! Will continue to buy since I ca n't find them in most theaters anymore .
5 #### Taste good and many people at our office like them . The can of red vines we received seemed extra soft and fresh
5 #### I ca n't believe I ate the whole thing :-( LOL
5 #### What do I actually need to write here ? If you are reading this , it is probably because you already love red vines . If you do n't , what the heck is wrong with you ? ! This is the 2nd tub of these I have ordered from Amazon and both of them have been ridiculously fresh . 10 times fresher than any pack I have ever gotten locally . There were quite a few on top that were actually broken into pieces because they were so soft . I kept a stash at home and then brought the tub to work to share the love with my coworkers . Recruited some twizzlers people ( You ca n't even compare Red Vines to twizzlers ) . I might go for the black ones next , although I think those will probably last longer since only a few people like black licorice . I will be buying these again . And again .
2 #### It is average tasting . I thought it would be similar to twizzlers in taste .
5 #### I have to tell you that I have been addicted to Red Vines since I was a preschooler and now I 'm 69 and they still taste and great as they did in the stone age ( LOL ) I have to limit myself to only a few vines a day when I buy a tub , they also make a great gift when you do n't know what to give someone .
3 #### Sort of hard and the flavor can be described as , " eh " . The test was taking the tub to work and the tub still being half full after 3 weeks .
5 #### Sent these to a red twist fanatic and He loved them ! Hooray !
5 #### arrived in 3 days which was a week early & they are so soft and fresh !
1 #### The Red Vines were unsealed , the top opened , and spilled inside the box . They were hard ( stale ) and I , defintely , was not going to eat them .
5 #### sent to Grandkids in England , they went crazy over it .
5 #### The best . Period . If you like eating plastic , go for the other brand .
5 #### There is a constant battle in our house with Red Vines vs the other plastic tasting fake licorice candy on the market ! These tubs are perfect , and a great value for those of us who love our Red Vines !
4 #### I thought this was a good deal . The licorice was very fresh .
5 #### My favorite licorice hands down . No other kind even comes close , and I got this at a good price
5 #### Very Fast Shipping , Great Price and I love Red Vines . Thank You
5 #### great price , fast shipping and I love Red Vines
4 #### Love Red Vines - way better than Twizzlers . Red Vines are not easy to find in the stores . This give me a good supply for my craving .
5 #### Flavorful , soft and delicious . Thought they would be perhaps stake but was truly pleased with these ! Would buy again !
1 #### I had my mouth all set to enjoy these , opened the package and they smelled like red vines , they do not , however , taste like red vines . They are n't fresh and the texture has a strange harshness to it . This is unlike any red licorice I have ever tasted . I bought one for my family and one for my brother 's . Now I do n't want to even give them to him so it 's 2x 's a waste .
1 #### just a horrible taste . Very suspicious of the positive reviews . It comes in a very cheap plastic package . Makes me wonder how fresh it could be . Throwing product out . Not a good taste at all and that 's an understatement . I do not believe any of the reviews that say great taste . Does not taste like licorice at all . Just really horrible . I love all candy too . Ingredients six items corn syrup , Wheat flour , citric acid , Artificial flavor and red 40 ! ! Ingredients do not lie . Amazon should stop selling this item
5 #### Bought for an event at work . Super fresh redvines ! Product was as expected .
5 #### these are delicious . I limit myself to 5 per day ( or seven ) and really struggling whether to re - order these or go for twizzlers
5 #### If you love red vines , very fresh and a good price .
5 #### Make sure you live with 64 other people before buying this , or you will eat waaaaay too much ! !
5 #### always fresh and good to the very last stick
5 #### Gave this as a gift and it went quickly . Big hit !
2 #### We were disappointed in the flavor . If you like strawberry licorice do n't buy these . They are cherry flavored . They are nice and fresh but we were disappointed in the taste .
4 #### Nice soft licorice . One day just had such a taste for it so ordered this 5.5 lb . Tub . I 'll be eating licorice for a year as my husband does n't like it .... good for me ;)
5 #### What is better than having 5 LBS of Red Vines sitting on your office desk to share with others ? ! AMAZING
5 #### I go through a tub of these every few months , they arrive fresh , they are soft they are sealed when they arrive and they taste great . I give them to my friends and there kids and the neighborhood kids , they are great and taste great . I would not buy them this way if they did not taste good . plus in my hometown you can not buy red vines , I love twizzlers also but these taste much better .
5 #### This tub lasts a long time around our house , but they stay fresh . I like to be able to grab and go and this large size tub makes that very handy .
1 #### Decent texture and freshness but there is a noticeably industrial taste and aroma . Will not buy again - bargain or not . Returned them and bought Twizzlers which are reliably the better red licorice .
5 #### IF you like red vines , then this is the way to buy them . If you have never had red vines , only swizzlers , I warn you that they taste very different and have a very different texture . Swizzlers are really fruity to me where red vines have a more " licorice " taste . They are not as soft as swizzlers , more chewy . That being said , I prefer them to swizzlers any day of the year .
5 #### I buy this for my cube in my office and for $ 22 a month I sure hear a lot of gossip and office politics ! It get unlikely people in my cube and these get em talking , people will say the darnest things to please you in return of a few red vines :) Cheap price to pay for the benefits . As for the red vines , they are a red vines , who does n't like them ? ! They come fresh every time and taste great !
5 #### So , here 's a true story for you . One day , I wanted my husband to put my shelves up for me in my craft room ( due to an unfortunate incident that shall remain unnamed , I am no longer allowed to use his drill ) . He did not want to do this , because it involved measuring , finding studs , and was generally boring and tedious . After hemming and hawing over what he would like as his reward for completing the task for me , he finally brightened and said " I want 5 pounds of redvines ! " thinking that I could n't find any on short notice . We agreed , he would not have to do the shelves until said Redvines were in his posession , and we had a movie night scheduled . I snuck onto Amazon , and minutes later , had this tub ordered Prime . Amazingly enough , I got an email half an hour later saying it was shipped ! I had opted for 2 day shipping , but lucked out and it was to me the next day . Imagine the look on his face when I triumphantly presented him with 5.5 lbs of licorice , popcorn , and a chick flick . The vines were not stale as they can be when buying them in the small packages from the video store , and tasted great . Plus , as an added bonus , the container is somehow dog proof . Do n't ask me how , my dogs are destructive chewers , but they ca n't seem to get a hold on this tub !
4 #### This was my first time trying Redvines , and when I first opened it I did not like them . The more I ate , the better they started tasting . I do n't know if they are just something you have to get used to ( try not drinking soda for a few months then drinking coke or pepsi , terrible . ) or if the taste just gets better as they aerate . Either way they are delicious now , and I ca n't stop eating them .
5 #### Now this is the real stuff . As a long time sufferer from cow 's milk allergies , I was very pleased to find a source of sheep 's milk Romano . By the way , using sheep 's milk is precisely the way this stuff should be made . Its flavor is outstanding , and I use it in my Caesar dressing as well as final pizza topping . Thin slices add extra zest to sandwiches . The price for this cheese is excellent , and the shipping is well thought out with cold packs added to prevent any temperature damage during transit . I ca n't say enough good about it , it is simply delicious . A big thumbs up for an excellent product .
5 #### Love the cheese . Great taste . Great value . If you like a real Romano flavor this is your cheese . Packaging for my cheese was not what I expected .
5 #### I ca n't get genuine Romano at my grocery stores , so this is such a blessing . Very much enjoying it .
4 #### made a home pizza;used this product it was very good .
5 #### Well , you have to love this cheese to eat it . It is salty , somewhat crumbly , and has a unique taste . It is very good , in my opinion , while I am sure that some wo n't like the taste . It is hard to find , and here is a good source for it . The sellers have found a good method to ship it to prevent getting too hot in shipping , which is very convenient since they use priority mail . Good for them , and good for my wife and I.
5 #### Tasty and great quality . I like to grind my own cheese to always have on hand for recipes . This is my second order and will order again ! Excellent product . Take the time to watch an on line video on how to store cheese . Well worth effort ... wrap in parchment paper , get it out of the plastic wraper then store in proper cheese containers :) bon appetite
5 #### If you had these as a child at least once , I 'm sure you 'll remember the smell and even the taste after many years . I do n't care about the shipping costs . The product itself was fresh and it 's the original stuff . Now I just need to order my tea lol !
5 #### This is a great product and it literally warms our memories from another place . It arrived in good condition and fresh . However , the shipping charges on my entire order was way out of line and extremely expensive ! ! This company is efficient to do business with , but the shipping charges are a rip - off !
5 #### My husband spent some time in South Africa and he lives these .. remind him of his trip
5 #### We grew up in South Africa and Ouma ( meaning " grandma " ) Rusks were part of our lifestyle . It was so wonderful to see the familiar boxes with rusks in our pantry and we just about inhaled it ! It 's similar to biscotti which is a sweetened bread that 's cut in slices and then dried out in a low temp oven ) . Ouma Rusks are n't as sweet and it 's bigger than biscotti usually are though , but we prefer it like that . We dunk it in hot coffee or tea to soak up and softened the rusk and then ENJOY the great taste of yesteryear ! Wish we had more stores here in the USA that 'll carry more British/ South African foods . Everyone here is loosing out on some great tastes and products . Product took a long time to arrive , but that 's understandable due to where it shipped from . THANK YOU .
2 #### They are too hard and the taste it is o.k . , but not that great .
5 #### This is an update on my previous review . This stuff is amazing . It lends a subtle zest to everything . I am sold on it and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting some pizazz in their cooking , meals , salads , etc .
5 #### We love this stuff ! Everyone of the Borsari seasonings is just fabulous . Do n't hesitate !
5 #### You wo n't find this quality and spectrum of ingredients in any other product and price
1 #### Recipe changed without notice or warning on package ..... changed ... a great reduction in fiber .. Compared old label and this label .
5 #### This product tastes absolutely fantastic BUT of the 50 + ingredients listed on the container the NUMBER TWO ingredient is pure crystalline fructose ( fruit sugar ) , so yes , it tastes fantastic ! ! After years of on and off use of this product I now mostly use it to sweeten my " other " supplements / smoothie ingredients and only ideally if I have an electric blender available . Although the product clearly states " MIXES INSTANTLY . NO BLENDER REQUIRED " , I find that to be a real stretch of ones imagination ! If one were to mix the powder into boiling water it may " mix instantly " , but I tend to add this to cold milk ( or similar ) and , believe me , IT DOES NOT MIX INSTANTLY ! ! Of course , this is not a major issue if you do not mind a lumpy shake , but if you want a smooth drink plan on using an electric blender --or allow extra time for an extended bottle shaking ceremony as part of your workout !
5 #### Gives me super energy with just 2 scoops every day .
3 #### Why has the odor changed , is the product defective ?
5 #### Great TASTE . GMO FREE ! ! ! ! ! I only use water , other use fruit and such but I do n't have that option at work . Water works great . Would recommend and buy again
5 #### A staple of my smoothies for years , and have ordered many time from Amazon , and is actually delivered by The Vitamin Shoppe , who I have ordered many times from also . It 's hard to describe the taste , but people call it a ' nutty - granola ' taste .
4 #### I never purchased this product before , so I am no expert on it . But I have no complaint about it . So I would recommend it to others .
5 #### I just switched over to using this product as it is the only brewer 's yeast that I can find that is organic . Even Whole Foods only has brewer 's yeast marked " natural " which means nothing . This brewer 's yeast also has a mild taste and does n't have to be disguised , though I put it in my whey protein shake with a tablespoon of raw organic cacao and some stevia and it is fabulous . This stuff is loaded with vitamins , minerals and amino acids and is a good source of fiber since I am allergic to chia , flax , and psyllium which do n't have the nutritional value of the brewer 's yeast in any case . Excellent product .
5 #### This is very tasty . Added to ice cream , it was the closest thing to a malted milkshake that I 've tasted since my Celiac diagnosis .
2 #### I have no complaints about quality of this product . The nutritional value of this Brewers Yeast is outstanding but it has an awful aftertaste to me . I had a difficult time getting it down . Masking it with protein and stevia helped a lot . Still the aftertaste was really off putting despite what it says . So in this case , that 's what you get when nothing is added . I still would n't discourage someone from trying it . Maybe you wo n't mind the aftertaste or wo n't mind being a little creative to disguise it . For me though it was too overwhelming . So I would n't buy again .
5 #### Because of the expense , this was requested as a Christmas present . This is something that the recipient swears will ward off physical maladies of various types . I think it tastes pretty awful but he thinks the taste is wonderful , so it is a matter of opinion on that . It is definitely chock - full of healthy ingredients . He has been using this stuff for decades and swears by it . So glad they continue to make it .
1 #### The first sign with all multivitamins , etc . is , if your urine turns bright neon . If it does , you just lost everything you thought will be kept in your body . This one does and in my opinion a big waste of hard earned $ . Kind of heavy on the stomach as well . I 'm taking a different shake , not interested in promoting it , so I wo n't mention it . None the less , it is light years ahead of this one .... let 's just leave it at that . Do some more extensive research on MEAL Replacements , you 'll stumble across the product I 'm currently using with no " neon urine " afterwards :-) P.S : Even tried their pills with the same effect .
5 #### It actually tastes good and it healthy supplement as long as you do not have gout . It sprinkles on food easily .
5 #### For everyone who does not like the taste . Try mixing it in orange and carrot juice . It is wonderful and seemless . It will be a nice treat !
5 #### I 've been using this product for years . I use it in oatmeal , salads , stirfries , smoothies , etc . I 've learned to love the taste and am impressed by the nutition . The selenium content alone is worth the price . I try to never run out .
5 #### Do n't know about the " energy boost " but do know that I love this shake ! Alot of protein shakes leave you with upset tummy feeling , but not this one ! Tastes great even mixed with just water . LOVE it - Thanks !
5 #### I love this shake-- I have used it for years and it always keeps me healthier during very busy times . One note , however , Amazon really should list the ingredients here on the site . I 've never had an adverse reaction , and I love this shake , but it does have bee pollen and PABA , which many people are allergic to . ( I am looking at the back of the container right now ) . The product IS completely gluten - free , which is a nice plus . I used to use Alive ! Soy Shake Mix , which is also fantastic , but I had to stop because that shake has retinol palmitate in high doses and that 's not safe for pregnant women . This shake does not have retinol palmitate . Instead , it has beta carotine , which is safe for use by pregnant women .
5 #### I have been using this 5 times a week for several years . Yes, .. like most of you , I have tried MANY similar products but this has been the best for me . This is USUALLY the best price here at Amazon but check your local Vitamin Shoppe as they have it on sale periodically . This is also the best neutral taste , ... kinda of like creamy oatmeal . IT IS GREEN . I use a simple 16 oz blender bottle with 50 % water , 50 % plain soymilk , 2 scoops . It is naturally sweet so be aware if you mix this with any sweetened products it may be too much . I am a diabetic and this has a very LOW impact on my levels . I am a big boy that enjoys Eating REAL food .but this really tides me over for breakfast every morning . It has become one of my FEW good eating habits . As far as the 1 star review , ..... ALL WHOLE GREEN FOODS should be tried slowly and carefully , ... especially if you have never used anything like this OR have a diet that has been missing all your veggies . If you jump in full blast some of you can expect some tummy rumbling or gassiness , ... but be patient , , , , simple whole foods like this can really have a great positive impact on how you FEEL !
5 #### Not only is this the finest quality . it also tastes really great . If you are looking for Brewers Yeast , look no further .
5 #### I was preparing myself for an awful taste because of some of the other reviews , but they were dead wrong ! I prepared this by heating it up to extract the nutrients and strain the fiber ( can cause gas ) , and drink it like a tea and it reminds me of those packets of chicken noodle soup flavoring . Very good !
5 #### I called Bragg , KAL , Lewis Labs , and LeSaffre ( makers of Red Star)to find out if any of the products were grown on a nutrition base that was GMO free . Bragg said yes , KAL did n't have a phone contact that I could find so I emailed and did not get a response , Lewis Labs said yes , and LeSaffre said no . So I moved to Lewis Labs from Red Star , it is very different , more of a toasted nutty flavor . Very different and I like it there are foods where I think the cheesy flavor of Red Star works better . My body seems to like the Lewis Labs a little better .
5 #### I believe , if you search , you will find other internet retailers offering a better price than VS does . But , that said , this product is excellent . Lewis Labs Brewers Yeast is the most nutritious yeast I 've found . ( One of the more expensive KAL nutritional yeast products is very good too ) . I 've actually come to enjoy the taste , and because it 's grown directly on beets in a basement in formerly communist Eastern Europe ( or some place like that ) you know it 's definitely not radioactive , which is nice to have in a yeast product .
4 #### I 'm enjoying this concentrate and I 'm glad to have found a good tart flavor ( and not a sugar bomb like others ) . I bought this for Jillian 's detox tea , but now I 'm adding it to soda water ( sometimes with vodka ) for a light drink . The only reason this did n't get 5 stars is because it seemed a little expensive to me . However , when I run out , I 'll probably buy again ... so I 'd still recommend it !
5 #### Tree of Life Cranberry Concentrate is the best cranberry concentrate I have found . I have tried others after some of the health food stores I used to buy it from quit carrying it . Decided to hunt it down online and have shipped directly to me . It is the most concentrated with the best flavor and consistency . I use just a little to flavor the water I 'm drinking during the day . I like the tart flavor but if you prefer a sweeter taste try adding a little to orange juice , apricot nectar , grape juice or apple juice in the morning - gives it a whole different flavor , yum !
5 #### This is a great product , and very reasonable for the size !
4 #### I would have given this 5 stars if the price was more affordable . The taste is perfect - clean and tart and does n't seem watered down . This is also not sweetened which is what I was after - only concentrated cranberry juice in a glass bottle . The bottle was well packed and delivered timely . I use it to mix with L - arginine powder to make it palatable , and using 3 tablespoons per serving goes through the bottle quickly .
2 #### The taste of this tea is 5 star however I 'm giving two stars because I did not appreciate breaking out . If it was n't for that I would have continued taking this tea .
4 #### I do not have any knowhow of the effectiveness of the ingredients included in this tea , but the tea is flavorful and high quality . Not the best I have had , but still very good .
5 #### I also love this concentrated cranberry juice . It seemed to work in helping my husband keep bladder infections away . He has an indwelling catheter .
5 #### This is a great way to add real juice flavor to Kombucha tea . Sure beats the cranberry juice in the grocery stores that taste like Kool - Aid .
5 #### Good solid tart stuff . Adding it to my smoothies .
5 #### It 's sooo hard to find cranberry juice that 's unsweetened . Recently , my body developed a bladder infection * on the day we were snowed in ( for 3 weeks , it turned out ) * - would n't you just know it ! I could n't have gotten to the pharmacy even if the doctor HAD prescribed an anti - biotic ( which I do n't like to take unless I absolutely have to ) . So I started drinking cranberry juice sweetened - to - taste with xylitol , and added coloidal silver as an antibiotic .. It seemed to have worked , but just to be sure , I had my doctor give me the " pee in a cup " test when I saw her ( as soon as we could get down the mountain ) . Sure enough , urine is clear - it worked like a charm . I 'll make sure this concentrate is always on my shelf ...
5 #### I use this almost everyday . It is great because it does n't have sugar in it which you need to stay away from when you have tendency to get bladder infections .
5 #### If you have discomfort with UTI 's this is the go to product for keeping it under control
5 #### I have read about the effects of unsweetened cranberry juice and have found this brand to be the best for me . I 've used it for years before I found it on line for a cheaper price . It is rich in flavor , yes it 's bitter but if you add a little stevia it is a wonderfully healthy refreshing exchange for a sugary drink or soda . It helps clean the urinary tract and bladder , has antioxidants and many other benefits ... best benefit no sugar .
3 #### I really ca n't tell if is working as yet
5 #### Great product ! It does the job and cleans you out . I already feel lighter within a week of drinking this .
5 #### Works as described and is way more gentle on my stomach than the pills I ordered . It works faster too . It surprisingly tastes very good ; no bitter aftertaste at all .
5 #### I am an avid tea drinker so I 've tried hundreds of flavors and different brands . As far as detox teas go , this one is my favorite . Many detox teas have a laxative effect which I do n't feel is necessary ( if that 's what you 're aiming for , they have a smooth move tea that works just as well ) . This has a delicious and light fruity flavor and is absolutely delicious whether hot or iced . I drink a cup every other day now simply because I love the flavor . I ca n't say whether or not it " detoxed " my body , because I tend to eat pretty clean , but it definitely had no negative side effects which is always a plus .
5 #### I used this as part of a cleanse with other products . I 'm not entirely sure which product caused what , but I lost 10 lbs in a month and my bloodwork came back with noticeable improvements . I believe this tea is what caused me to lose weight . I drank a big cup made with 2 teabags each morning . Note that I believe this causes a trip to the restroom within 30 minutes of consuming . I do n't think this should be drank indefinitely because of that , but it did what it was supposed to .
1 #### even with 2 tea bags and long steeping just loosened stools , never detoxed
2 #### it do not work very well i thought it would work better .
3 #### Tastes OK but I do n't think it detoxes at all . I notice no difference even when I drink 1 at night & 1 in the morning each day .
5 #### I received the item very fast . It taste very good good with honey . I am drinking it due to pregnancy and helps with labor . Best to drink it couple weeks before labor . I will be drinking 2 cups a day . With my previous pregnancy drank this tea and labor was easier and less painful . I recommend this to all moms .
1 #### I do n't like the quality of the raspberry leaves in this particular product . I recommend to consider a different product . However , if you are going to use it like " just a tea " it is fine . If you are going to use for treatment -- find something else .
5 #### My favorite tea , tastes good and is good for women 's health . A recommended brand from my acupuncturist . Also , their nettle tea is great for allergies .
5 #### Excellent 5 Star product & company . Interested only in spending money on Certified Organic & Verified Non - GMO with companies devoted to healing people , animals & the planet .
5 #### I love this tea . It taste like a very mild black tea but with no caffeine and health benefits to boot !
5 #### This tea is delicious and has a nice subtle flavor
5 #### Box was definitely damaged inside the outside packaging . Luckily , the bags did n't open . Tea is very tasty .
5 #### I like this tea . I ve been drinking it because i hear it helps the womb and could help have easy labor . I will find out in a few weeks . I m due Jan 28th
4 #### Just purchased this product based on the recommendation that it helps women with female challenges ... I enjoy the taste ... not a heavy raspberry flavor .. but wanted to say teas take time and consistency before you really notice changes and these days everyone has a microwave mentality .
5 #### Winter warm up drink , taste good , no caffeine , so you can still go to sleep later
5 #### I purchased this tea , because I desperately needed my raspberry tea and my go to tea was not in stock . This tea helped with all of my usual symptoms during my menstrual time as well as the other brand . I must say though this one does not taste like medicine , although the medicine taste never bothered me . I really like the flavor of this tea and I think this will become my # 1 Raspberry tea . At the least I have another go to Raspberry if 1 of my 2 is out of stock .
2 #### I normally purchase the Yoga Organic Raspberry leaf tea - but could n't find the multi pack so I ordered this in the multi pack . I buy it b / c it tends to help with all sorts of menopausal symptoms , especially hot flashes . I drink about 3 cups a day . However , the Yoga brand tastes very mild while this one is strong . I 've explained to people that it tastes like what I would imagine a tree tastes like . Sounds funny but to me it tastes like wood might taste . Nothing offensive , just not what you would drink for the sheer pleasure of it . This tea however does taste strong , maybe it has a root type of taste to it ? Yuck , not for me . I went back to the yoga tea , much more pleasant .
5 #### Bought on the recommendation of another mom during my third trimester and still drinking it today . Caffeine free and tastes just like regular black tea .
5 #### I am in the third trimester with my 2nd and planning on doing an HBAC delivery this time around , I was recommended by multiple people to try Raspberry leaf tea to help prep my body for labor to allow for an easier delivery . My last birth I was induced and after 13 hours there was no progression therefore I had to get a c - section which I 'm trying to avoid this time around by doing an all natural home birth with my midwife so I 'm willing to try anything that will help prep my body for labor or make any portion of it a bit easier lol . This tea taste like your basic black tea to me so I sweetened it with honey and sometimes add a spoonful of coconut oil just to get some healthy fat and lactic acid which I heard can help aid in the production of breastmilk . Now that I am 35 weeks I drink this tea 2 times a day and will sometimes switch off between this and the TM Pregnancy tea . So far I 'm really enjoying this tea and will update with how my labor went once I deliver in May . Overall satisfied with this purchase and would buy again .
4 #### The taste is n't bad . I ordered 1 box first to try it out . I 'm pregnant and have read that this tea is good to drink for labor . Upon further reading though I found it to be beneficial all the time for female health and decided to buy in bulk .
5 #### Best tea for the woman , helps ease period cramps and it will be lighter . Def recommend .
5 #### Love Raspberry Leaf tea a must for all women :)
5 #### This tea is not as disgusting as everyone says ! I add in a little honey or add another tea I love and it has a great flavor . I think it does help the female system and I have also used it on a stye in my eye . I squeezed the used tea bag into my eye and my stye went down that day ! Its a wonderful healthy tea to have .
5 #### When you have a sore throat this kicks it to the curb , and my kids like it too .
5 #### I love herbal teas , and had a sore throat so I decided to try Throat Coat . It tastes like Licorice , but just faintly . It might just be the warm liquid , but I think that it really did make my throat feel better . Each tea bag is individually wrapped so I can grab just a couple of packets when I travel for the weekend . My only complaint is that the steep time is 10 - 15 minutes , but it 's worth it .
2 #### I bought two kinds of throat tea , this being one of them . I 'm glad I did , because I did not care for this particular one . I 've had other teas by this brand , so no concern about quality . This variety made my throat feel numb though , which was n't a very soothing feeling for a throat soothing tea .
5 #### Very flavorfull and really help with rough throat from cold weather changes will continue to buy .
5 #### Delicious and just a little sweet from the licorice root . I can drink it and enjoy it without any sugar . This is my go - to caffeine free tea so I drink it even when I 'm not sick .
2 #### This tea does n't have a very good flavor and I did n't notice any improvement when I used it for sore throats or hoarseness .
5 #### really does what it says -- helps soothe and coat the throat when it 's irritated , sore , dry , etc . I typically use it when I get colds , but it 's a nice secret weapon for singers ... brew some up and keep it around at room temp for when you perform . It also tastes really good .
3 #### I tend to love Traditional Medicinals teas . They work well and usually taste pretty nice . This one is downright hard to choke down . I ca n't really even tell you whether or not it works ( though it probably does ) because it is just nasty to me . I do n't love the taste of black licorice in the first place , but it 's tolerable . This stuff is just a blast of black licorice taste with a rather icky , cloyingly sweet aftertaste much like diet drinks , even when I add no sweeteners of any kind . I do n't really recommend this .
5 #### Great product for dry throats or for those who live in dry climates . Vocalists . would find this soothing to their throats .
5 #### My coworkers all come to me to get these when they are sick . I 've given them to plant visitors suffering from airline stuffiness / drainage , and they 've called me months later to ask the name of the tea again so they can buy some . Many of them are not tea drinkers , but this is a very soothing beverage that tastes nothing like a classic tea . It is mildly sweet and they are able to drink it comfortably . Some add a bit of honey to sweeten it further and increase the soothing quality . It is usually tolerated by those suffering from drainage tummy upset .
5 #### This has helped me through three weeks of a cold with a sore throat ... Or what ever it was .
5 #### Very soothing and tasty tea ... I use it for LPR / GERD ( or any sore throat ) . Contains regular licorice , so use with caution-- esp . if you have low potassium or heart conditions ( I 'm not a doctor , but this is what I 've read ) . Check it out with your doctor or other health professional . Use in moderation .
5 #### The tea has great flavor and just the right amount of sweetness , so no need to add any sugar or other sweetener . The company was very responsive to a problem with my order and corrected it quickly .
4 #### Good product . Kind of licorice in flavor . Might not be so great for you if you do n't like that taste . Amazon 's description and price were incorrect . Buyer needs to watch the " per teabag " unit cost . Sometimes they 're way off . Take out your calculator and do the math yourself . :-)
5 #### As someone who speaks several times a week , i 've found that Throat Coat tea is absolutely the best throat lubricant before , during , and after a speaking engagement .
5 #### If you have not tried this , you should . It does n't taste good but there is No and I repeat NO other thing that works so great on tummy pain . They have ginger that you eat but its all sugared , I prefer this especially when my tummy hurts . My kids and hubby choke it down and then 10 minutes later thank me . BTW I am not anti OTC or prescription , this is just better than those .
5 #### Really good with digestive tea , very soothing and helps with an upset tummy .
5 #### I love this tea . I drink it when I feel a bit unsettled or just want that gingery zing . It is a bit spicy .
3 #### This product has a wonderful scent and taste , especially sweetened , but it did n't do a thing for me in terms of getting to sleep . I wo n't be reordering .
5 #### I am shocked at how well this works . I take 10 mg of Melatonin that is a mix of fast and slow release nearly every night , and still usually wake up around 3 am . I noticed from the very first night of drinking this that I am much more likely to sleep through the night . It also gives a very nice relaxed and dreamy feeling before I actually go to sleep . I will be buying more of this and I have given some to friends and recommended it .
5 #### Probably fine tea but I did n't like it and it was not relaxing .
5 #### Awesome Product . Came fast and worked just great ! Perfect for my recipe and made the recipe taste good . Great quality .
5 #### I started using this in the 80s , from a health spa in California . It is n't fancy at all , nothing that has curative powers . However , it gives flavor and taste to things so that you curb your use of butter , and regular salt . I dump it on popcorn , baked potatoes . When I need to tighten it up a bit , I stir some of the powder into hot water for a broth throughout the day at work , which seems to keep away that afternoon candy bar craving . Not exotic , but it 's been a staple " condiment " for me for over fifteen years .
5 #### This product is highly nutritional , and tastes strong like fish or sea weed , but a little goes a long way , and I use it in smoothies along with barley grass as well as other nutritional supplements . After it is mixed with fruit and yogurt the taste is not noticeable .
4 #### Good value for dulse powder . Dulse is an acquired taste - I only like small amounts on salad with oil - but this is a great product .
5 #### works , your loved ones will absolutely adore you for using this as your moods will improve because it keeps pm symptoms at bay
5 #### I tried this tea when I had given up on western medicine . I needed help with my pms irregularities . This is a great product to go with DIM and Emerita pro - gest . I had n't had a period in months and I drank this tea and I finally started . It was great . It also helps with mood swings . Traditional Medincials is a company that can be trusted , I have been drinking their tea for years .
2 #### GAVE AS A GIFT AND DID NOT HEAR WHETHER IT WAS GOOD .
4 #### Purchased this for my 15 yr old daughter . She had horrible cramps . She said it worked ! ! thank you ! Will purchase again !
5 #### I 'm not into herbal teas at ALL . But someone recommended this one , and I find it a surprising alternative to coffee , my first love . I drink a cup or two in the evening . Has a nice minty taste . I enjoy it once it 's cooled down a bit .
5 #### Awesome ! I 've been experimenting with allot of relaxation teas . I love this one on par with Republic of Tea 's " Get Relaxed . " Each has their own good points . This one is better for being calm and still feeling like I can focus . RoT 's is better for weekends or after work , I think . Not as strong as a tea I have called , " Lavender Butterfly " from The English Tea Store though . Different strokes for different scenarios though . I 'll keep ordering this for the workday .
5 #### I love this tea . The flavor is great ! Nice and calming too .
5 #### Have bought and used this product for several years now , and not sure if it actually makes any health improvement , tho I certainly like the idea that it might . I tend to take it when I feel " low " or sluggish or tired for no obvious reason . And always about a half teaspoon with water or weak tea . No complains about it and no proof that it helps my health , just like the idea of it . Another use by mixing it with coconut oil in a jar to rub into back of hands that get dry from outdoor gardening .
5 #### My new favorite iced tea ! ! The benefits of green and black tea all wrapped into one yummy bag !
4 #### I use this product in my smoothies and it has an acquired taste but it is actually not that bad
1 #### Bought for menopausal symptoms . This remedy did not work for me . I actually perspire more while using this product .
4 #### I like the product . YS says it is organic yet the USDA Organic Logo you see on so many other Organic Products is not present . To some degree this makes me question the quality of the product . Hopefully YS will have the Organic Logo on the product in the future .
4 #### Just Started Taking , It taste good , I also use there other Bee product . Thank you
5 #### This was my first experience with oolong and am thrilled with the discovery . I will purchase more in the future
5 #### Love this tea and great price too thanks ! I 've shopped around since starting to drink this three years ago and this is by far the best price out there . Thanks you
5 #### EXCELLENT product , the best on the market ! I 'll buy two next time !
5 #### Royal Jelly is really healthy for you and helps to boost your immune system . This stuff has a great taste and spreads easily and is not clumpy or stiff at all . Great with hot tea and toast !
5 #### This tea is very good . But I ca n't drink it before because of the caffeine in it .
5 #### I do n't know if this will have lasting results , but I must say every time I take it , I feel immediately better . More energy and a better hopeful mood . It could just be a sugar high , but it does n't make you crash afterwards . Tastes delicious , I mean come on , it 's pretty much pure honey . Like a thicker pasty - er honey . I love it and will continue to use it .
4 #### Tasty jelly in honey ! I purchased this for recreational snacking , no other purpose . I like trying different super foods , and I really like this particular royal jelly . I often get tired and become useless around 2:00pm , but that has changed . If I take a teaspoon of royal jelly in the late morning , before I normally get tired , then I have more energy and can power through an afternoon without espresso . This may simply be the effect of the sugar content , and I wo n't be surprised if that is the case . The taste took a day or so to get used to . It 's not bad , it just is n't pure honey and my tastebuds were surprised . In general I do like this royal jelly in honey and I am happy to have made this purchase . I might not replace it as soon as it is empty , only because I have neglected honeys in my pantry that would enjoy the attention of a daily spoon .
5 #### excellent value product ! it 's got real and good quantity of ' stuff ' : royal jelly and ginseng in it because the ginseng taste is strong . Not like some products with only trace of ginseng that you ca n't tell at all !
1 #### Awful ! No flavor the tea was SO light compared to other teas . So sorry I purchased this ...
1 #### Was very excited about the weight loss thing , I am on a diet too and do moderate exercise , this tea did n't do anything additional as I tracked , I drank about 2 cups a day ! !
1 #### i have taken a royal jelly softgels before , this product is just a normal crystallized honey , i know its says " royal jelly in honey " but i did n't feel any deference in its effect ! the real royal jelly would give a lot of good energy this one is just honey . i really liked their normal 3 lb raw honey , but this one is not royal jelly .
3 #### somehow the tea in the new package is not so intense as in the old one , which I used for years !
5 #### I just ordered more of this . Great nutrition and a boost of energy . I will keep buying this brand .
5 #### Works GREAT as a face and hair mask , absolutely love it
5 #### I just wanna try it out and compare it with my regular oolong tea that I usually drink .. It 's good , subtle taste but single use bag , unlike my old brand it was stronger like black tea and can make up to 3 mugs of tea .
2 #### I do n't care for the taste . I could drink a gallon of oolong from our local Chinese restaurant , but I ca n't stomach one cup of this stuff .
5 #### Delicious tea ! The packaging is nice and pretty sturdy .
5 #### My very favorite oolong tea brand . I just found out they make this in an organic version , which I will purchase next time .
5 #### This works ... buy this and follow directions ... or use it for your health . Make sure you are not allergic to this ! YummY
5 #### I find it easier to take Royal Jelly as a supplement in this form when it is dissolved in honey than in pill or powdered form simply because it is very palatable . I have been taking it for roughly two months now , what I have noticed is that on days when I have n't slept the night before I feel better if I take it compared when I do n't .
3 #### This makes a weak tea but works fine . Just not very flavorful .
5 #### I love my tea and this product is excellent .
5 #### Amazing for pollen season allergies , among other things . This balances out your blood sugar , thus controlling sugar cravings . Use it as directed for maximum benefits . Directed use : consume 1 teaspoon with water or without in between meals . So I take a teaspoon in the morning and at night or mid - afternoon , when there is nothing in my stomach . This is for maximum potency . In three days my allergies to pollen went away . This is a super food . Royal Jelly is reserved strictly for the queen bee who can 2000 eggs a day . I will not live without this stuff , I use to be miserable and now everyone else with allergies is suffering around me . I have only taken it as directed , so if you get it and do n't take it that way do n't blame anyone but yourself .
5 #### Tastes awesome and fresh ! Using it before my workouts ; very happy :))
5 #### Super item . Had not had Royal Jelly for years . A small amount goes a long way . Tasty .
3 #### Nice package & good tea . Although , Bigelow Oolong tea is more back for the buck .
5 #### Excellent tea . Oolong is high quality and great for the bod . I usually combine it with green tea and yellow label to make a blend . I drink 8 - 12 cups a day and carry my own tea when I go out . Kinda sad to go to Asian place and they do n't have green or oolong tea . Been using this teas for a few years .... like it lot .
5 #### Love this stuff ! I will continue buying this company 's line of products . Lots of good health benefits in royal jelly .
5 #### My first exposure to Oolong tea , and it is now my favorite . And I do n't see how you can beat this brand - lowlow price , mild taste , and the company is named after my Lord and Savior . :)
5 #### The best tea I ever had . I 'm sticking with this . Good price .
2 #### If you are used to choice organic products u will not like .
4 #### I have been using this tea about 2 weeks , I make it into iced tea using It 's soo hard to describe how OooLong taste , I guess I would say it 's a weaker Black Tea ? ? That 's fine with me : ) I 'm writing because I tell ya , It really really really does cut your appetite ! ! I am really plus size , round with belly fat , and fat neck and chin and it 's been impossible for me to lose weight especially after 50 years . Well , this week , I realized " why am I not craving carbs like I usually do " ? Well , I have to attribute it to the Ooo Long . Nothing stops my craving for sweets and this does ! I have gotten on my treadmill after not looking at it for 5 months ! I pulled all the weeds from my garden ( a task I kept avoiding ) , and have energy where many days I do n't want to get out of bed . I suffer from xtreme exhaustion , though I do n't do anything strenuous . Now I 'm not so exhausted anymore . So try this , what have you got to lose ? I see on YouTube many people have drastic results drinking OooLong , and I think it may be true ? ? .... I will update results in 2 months Oct 1 2015 . Watch out for it . Thumbs up if you like my review . I really enjoy giving my honest opinion about things .
5 #### This tea has a great flavor and tastes as expected for a great price . The 100 tea bags for this price were a great buy and the box it comes in is very nice for being able to store them and easily grab a tea bag while keeping my coffee / tea cabinet looking organized . Essentially this was a great buy for a lot of tea that tastes great !
1 #### this stuff is n't worth the plastic jar it came in and it is " non - returnable . " do n't go cheapo on royal jelly
2 #### Not happy with at all . It is kinda my own fault for not paying attention to the tea . I had n't noticed the last box I bought was organic and this one is n't . It made a huge difference in the quality of the tea
5 #### For a bagged Oolong there is n't a better option .
5 #### I have used this product for over 20 years . It is rich nutritionally and has been a staple for me and my family worth the cost .
1 #### Purchased double pack . One container was cracked and some oozed out . The royal jelly was in a solid form , which was good for this shipment because I had other items in the package . It was a mess , but it could have been a lot worse I opened the second container and it was in a solid form . I have purchased this product other times and it has been a thick honey substance . Will not purchase again .
5 #### Tastes yummy and I really think it works in improving my fertility , I think !
5 #### I love this tea ! It 's got a very nice fresh taste , and is n't too strong .
5 #### love this and will continue to take my royal jelly 2x a day ..... natures medicine from the bees .... and an all around favorite brand i use
5 #### Like its sister product , the one with Ginseng , Bee Pollen , and Propolis , this is a wonderful product . Helps me most when I am stressed out . This one tastes more like honey ... honey is added to make it sweet . I highly recommend this product .
5 #### love this tea notice improvement in my aches and pains .
5 #### exactly what I expected ! delicious tea and LOTS of it ! !
5 #### Absolutely love this tea with its subtle jasmine flavor and drank it daily with milk and honey , almost as good as coffee but .... BP has been high and so went off it to see if the caffeine in it was part of the problem . Not sure yet but still love this tea . Wish I had a big cup right now !
4 #### Pretty good . I love the taste and the convenience of tea bags is good for on the go too .
5 #### Second purchase . It 's pretty normal oolong tea but I like it .
5 #### Fresh and fragrant tea , my favorite to use for making tasty kombucha !
5 #### So , for some reason , I bought this by accident ( or due to an Amazon error ) as I 've always purchased the royal jelly / bee pollen combo . Anyways , royal jelly is supposed to be a good source of BH4 which apparently I am lacking in . I like the taste of this better than the royal jelly / bee pollen combo , which I do n't mind . I do feel like this product is a good addition to my nutritional program and I highly recommend it . Oh , and despite what some unintelligent commenters have posted , this SHOULD NOT BE REFRIGERATED . It says so right on the container . Enjoy !
5 #### Love this stuff ! ! ! Great taste and very good for you
5 #### As another reviewer noted , often available at Big Lots at a " giveaway " price . One of the best pre - packaged teas I 've encountered . Excellent quality . I expect only whole leaf tea could surpass .
5 #### This is a great Oolong tea product , one of my two favorites . It is even drinkable without adding anything to it . I mix it with either flavored tea , stevia or flavored stevia .
5 #### Love this stuff . Taste much richer than regular honey . I eat it by the spoonful ! And it 's good for you .
5 #### I started loving Oolong tea after I discovered a bottled product called ' Tejava ' . That product is over a dollar for a 12 ounce bottle . I needed something less expensive so I tried this ' Prince of Peace ' brand Oolong . After a few brewing experiments , I now love this stuff . What I have learned ; If brewing as ' sun tea ' this type of tea seems to come out very weak . If you put this tea in boiling water , it may come out bitter . I now heat up my water in a microwave until it is , very hot to the touch , but no way near boiling . I then put in the tea bags and let it brew for about twenty minutes ( I like strong tea ) . I have , to my taste , duplicated the ' Tejava ' brew at a fraction of the original cost . Enjoy Ken
5 #### I drink three cups of this each day , made with one Oolong tea bag and one green tea bag , in a large mug . I believe this has helped me to lose about 8 lbs . in the last five months . I drink it without sweeteners , and also cold . The price for this is very reasonable , and the taste is mild .
5 #### This was for my daughter who has gastroparesis . She was able to eat a spoonful , and keep it down , which is a really really big deal , and she says it is really really good honey ! She recommends that I get myself some .
5 #### Magically delicious , thick , creamy ... and healthy , too ? I love it !
5 #### Awesome . Tastes great . I have at least 1 teaspoon each day .
5 #### Yummy . So far not being attacked by bees . I feel a bit more energy . I add this to caffeine free Chai with Soymilk in the mornings and its really yummy . I like that it is organic . Not as sweet as regular honey , but the slight tang of the Royal Jelly is n't sour or annoying .
5 #### Simply the best for Qi deficient people . Check with your Acupuncturist . This is not a general tonic for everyone is is very specific to a Chinese Medicine diagnosis . It can create imbalances for those who do not need this specific type of support . Pollen and Royal Jelly are cooling . So if your condition does not require this it can harm you . Also they use multiple types of Ginseng . All Ginseng is not created equal . Contrary to what we read Ginseng is not just for energy boosting . Different types of people need specific types of ginseng for specific purposes according to my Acupuncturist .
5 #### I ordered this product on the 6th and received it this morning ! With regular shipping and handling , WOW ! Super fast delivery . I heard this helps with fertility and energy so that s basically why I purchased it so hopefully it works for those reasons . The taste is why I gave this 5 stars , it melts in your mouth like butter its soooo smooth and has the same amount of sweetness I compare to cotton candy , VERY sweet n tasty !
5 #### This Honey is thick and delicious . It 's great to know that you can put a sweetener on your kids ' oatmeal and feel good about its healthfulness .
5 #### THE ONLY THING IS THAT THE JUNKY PLASTIC JAR CAME CRACKED , BUT THEY SENT ME ANOTHER ONE . JUNK JAR , BUT GREAT HONEY
5 #### I bought this out of curiosity after hearing about it on tv . I wanted to test it to see if it would boost my energy level ; so far it seems to be doing just that . I will purchase more just to be sure since I 'm already almost out of it . I figure if it good for those worker bees and the queen bee it should be okay for me . Seems to be working .
5 #### I am new to Royal Jelly . I purchased based on other positive reviews and benfits of Royal Jelly . I am not disappointed . I tried one other brand that included bee pollen propolis -- but I will purchase this brand again -- soon .
5 #### I love this , I eat a spoonful every morning . I think it helped heal an infection I picked up over the winter .
5 #### Wonderful stuff ; gives you energy :) Buy some of their honey and compare the two ... very distinct difference . Behold Health ! Love it .
5 #### ROYAL JELLY ? ? Trust me - if you have not had the sheer joy of taste with ' royal jelly ' you have cheated yourself from having a true treat ! BUT IT .... AND TRY IT ! ! You will never regret it ! !
5 #### I love this product . I take a spoonful of this every day . I have beehives , but am new to beekeeping so do n't have the experience to collect my own royal jelly , so I purchased this product . Ummm Ummm Good !
5 #### I like the taste of this , was surprised at other comments of it not tasting good . I take a teaspoon each morning . I feel better and believe it really gives me extra energy . I will keep this up as it has a lot of natural vitamins in it .
3 #### I was disappointed in the taste and smell . I bought this without ever trying any sort of Royal Jelly . I was simply trying to better my health but jee wizz , when I opened the jar I seriously asked myself " Why do you do this to yourself ? ! " The smell nearly gave me a headache ... to me there is no comparison to smell ... maybe like hot plastic and witch hazel ? It looks like peanut butter but when online descriptions say astringent , they mean astringent . I do n't consider myself to be too picky . I pretty much like anything but this was disappointing . I thought it would be like honey but no ... I do n't know if this product is good as royal jelly but as a product based on taste alone , not very good ... luckily the taste does not linger ... but the smell is strong ... My audience here is new people . Before buying this , see if you can try it somewhere first ... On the brighter side , very easy to just swallow whole I just tried it today so I ca n't rate it as a dietary supplement ( energizing , etc . )
4 #### I ca n't complain about the quality of the product . It 's well packaged and contains exactly what the product description says it does . It tastes ok ( considering Royal Jelly is not exactly an appealing flavor for my taste buds ) . The product is mixed with honey which helps make it more palatable . I feel great since I have been using this product . I ca n't really be sure if it is due to the royal jelly , but if it 's not then what an awfully strange coincidence .
5 #### I think this is an acquired taste , quite intense and flavorful but fortunately sweet . As for ingredients : Royal jelly , check . Raw honey , check . Bee pollen , check . Propolis , check . Korean ginseng , check . Korean ginseng is on the Warm side of the Chinese qi system and that alone should give you more energy . That 's why I normally consume American ginseng which is on the Cold side . But the former is probably better for winter months .
5 #### Just like it says ... This product is very good yum ! Very creamy and smooth . It 's got that taste I 'm looking for ...
5 #### This is great tea , taste is good without adding anything . It seems to work or at least my pressure seems to be more stable now that I drink a couple of cups per day . Might be the reduced coffee but I 'll give credit to the tea .
5 #### My husband is very happy with this product to help control his high blood pressure . We will continue to re - order . We receive the product on a timely basis and in very good shape ! Thanks again .
5 #### I have used these tea for a while now , not daily but when I feel my blood pressure is up , and every single time it has worked to lower my blood pressure ! It is awesome !
2 #### Within 1 hr of drinking this tea my blood pressure increased . That is my own experience . It may not be that way for someone else .
5 #### Bought this to help manage my BP . I ca n't believe it , but it seems to be working . I went from an average of 136/86 , to 122/76 ! I have one cup in the morning , save the tea bag and use the rest for another cup in the late afternoon . The flavor is mild and very good . I like to add a bit of honey to mine . Update : I have been on this tea for ten days now . One full cup in the morning and one full cup around 4 pm . I have been achieving BP readings of 115/78 , and 108/78 . No side effects thus far . Wonderful tea !
5 #### This tea tastes good , I 'm not sure if it lowers blood pressure , but it does seem to work .
5 #### Love this tea ! I suffer from hypertension my blood pressure is some what high . This tea works wonders I had some last night and I got so relaxed I feel asleep which it does n't usually do . I guess my blood pressure was under control I usually check it before I drink a glass . The tea works wonders ! !
4 #### I am not big on bagged tea but this one is not bad . A bit high priced , but to add a bag to a larger brewing it works very well in both floral and fruity blends . Just depends on what your looking for . I did feel better while drinking it but there were a few factors to consider .
2 #### THIS DID NOTHING TO HELP MY BLOOD PRESSURE AND IT WAS EXTREEMLY WEAK TEA
5 #### great and works very well you will be able to tell the difference
5 #### I 'm always battling my blood pressure and I do n't like taking prescriptions . I 've been drinking this tea , along with taking Mulberry capsules and Hawthorne capsules , and my numbers have went down in a couple weeks .
5 #### It helps me a i use it all the time
5 #### This tea not only tastes good , it feels good . After the very first cup I felt more balanced and had more energy . It came well packed and arrived promptly .
2 #### Even steeping 10 minutes it is almost clear and no tea taste at all -sure do not understand how it can do any good
5 #### After a month does not appear to have had any effect on average blood pressure . No specific ingredient list showing the active ingredients .
5 #### Sometimes its hard to find this in the grocery . I like having this on hand . I drink this to help maintain my hbp ( .along with other supplements . )
5 #### I was surprised to find this to be so tasty . I am brewing 2 cups per day , and alternate with finely grated fresh ginger and lemon in a cup of boiling water . It makes me just feel better .
4 #### Taste great but not sure if it really helps with one 's blood pressure .
4 #### I am not sure if this actually lowers my blood pressure or if it 's just the fact that tea relaxes me . It does work for me though and it might work for you as well ! Unfortunately I am not a huge fan of the flavor , but I do enjoy this tea as it relaxes me !
4 #### I really enjoy this tea and it does seem to help keep my blood pressure down . I am surprised how good it is and I look forward to my afternoon tea whether iced for hot weather of hot for cold weathere , it is great . It is a little pricey but cheaper than high blood pressure problems .
4 #### Very good tea the price keeps me from repurchase it 's too expensive .
4 #### Seems to work ! I got 3 more boxes after the first one .
4 #### Very nice flavor , not sure if it actually does the trick or it 's really does anything more than hibiscus tea which can be bought cheaper in bulk but it 's a nice tea
5 #### I really have n't checked my blood pressure right after drinking . But I drink this at night before going to bed and I have been sleeping much better . I am not sure if it is the tea or a coincidence . The taste is ok , but it is really good with just a drop of honey .
5 #### I use this mixed with regular rooibos tea and make iced tea so he will drink it and it really works to regulate his blood pressure with his meds ... love it
2 #### When I made this order from Amazon , the Label showed and stated 100 % Black Cherry Concentrate , but what I received was Black Cherry Concentrate Blend . This was deceptive . The ingredients show " natural flavoring " which makes the concentrate taste non - real fruit .... kind of like a candy flavor . I have cherry trees and know what a real natural unadulturated cherry tastes like . I will use this up but will NEVER order it again !
5 #### I love this product it really works I feel energized when I wake from a night of great sleep
4 #### The taste is good . I can almost taste them individually ( has other juices in it , also ) . A great anti - oxidant boost . Great mixed with chia ( seeds or chia meal ) .
5 #### One ounce or more , plus a little water n u will be in dreamland in 30 minutes . Sleep from 4 - 6 hours uninterrupted . True .
1 #### May just me but this stuff taste horrid . Bad chemical taste ( i bought 3 bottles ) and it is apple juice / cherry juice blend w / grape , peach , pear , pomegranate and black currant juice .
5 #### By far one of the best we 've tried ! We use this in our water drinks , and diet milk shakes . It tastes like it should ... GREAT ! I already ordered two more ! Would recommend and buy again ! ! !
5 #### This product is delicious . The container lasts through many drinks because it is so concentrated . It is not sour . Sometimes drink it straight At other times it is made with a packet or two of stevia . Might also be tasty as a topping over vanilla ice cream . not easy to find in stores . Thank you to Amazon for making it available . It is a flavorful way to get anti - oxidents for people who can not consume large quantities of green vegetable due to medications .
5 #### I use this juice for miscellaneus aches and pains . I prefer this over having to take over the counter or prescription drugs because it is more natural . It does the job for me and if I take it at bedtime I can count on a good night 's sleep .
4 #### This worked great on my toe gout and was pretty tasty too . I since have gone to microwaving frozen cherries and eating them , but if you like the extra convenience of concentrate this is an effective source . My fingers get warm so it might help BP and circulation too ... not sure .
4 #### This product was bought for the use by someone else who has been suffering from gout recently . This person seemed to like another similar product and I went ahead and bought two bottles . If needed in the future , will order more . Had initially bought another similar product , but much more expensve . When I read a review and the person had the same ailment and praised this product and I said try it . My friend seems to like it and it seems to be working .
5 #### I am an herbalist , and I purchased this for my husband who has issues with gout . This brand is the best tasting black cherry juice concentrate on the market . I have him mix it with a little bit of cold water before bed . This is also great mixed with a little water added to your taste preferences and then frozen into popsicles . Add a daily dose of potassium citrate to your daily regimen , and presto ! No more gout !
5 #### Wanted to thank for such a great product ! It 's absolutely delicious ! Its consistency and taste is superb . It 's the best honey I 've ever tried and I highly recommend it . Thank you !
5 #### Has a good taste and i just love black cherry so i would recommend this to anyone who like black cherry flavor .
5 #### Using this to spark up the flavor of some homemade elderberry wine . I will add this to the fermented wine when it reaches 1.00 specific gravity and adjust the pH with some potassium bicarbonate so it 's not too acidic . YUM !
4 #### Received the product with one of four bottles broken . Their customer support center is really bad . I 'll spare you the details but very frustrating . So I like the concentrate , but not the vendor . Ca n't give the product 5 stars .
5 #### The taste of this concentrate is much better than another brand on Amazon . This one tastes more like fresh cherries and does not have that prune juice taste . It also tastes better than the bottled cherry juice ( not concentrate ) I bought at the health food store . I do wish they would make this bottle so it would pour more easily without dripping down the side . That is the one thing I do not like about it .
5 #### It takes a little over an once to match what 15 frozen / microwaved sherries do , but the effect seems prompt . Easier to take , though , and great for travel . I put it into seltzer water and stir for a fairly tasty drink . It is n't too sour or anything ... it 's just right as is .
5 #### I love this honey for baking my Paleo friendly goods . It has a mild flavor , and sweetens perfectly without giving an obvious honey flavor . It 's my favorite to sweeten my morning warm lemon water too .
5 #### High quality and very sweet ! Worth it ! Thank you .
3 #### This is a convenient size in a hard - to - find product , but I personally think the taste could be better . Seems bland .
5 #### Best Honey i have ever had , i 'm only buying this one , worth spending a little more for real healthy honey ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Love love love this product ! ! ! I am a royal regular customer for this honey .
4 #### They went from about $ 16 to around $ 20 more or less these days ; not sure why but it 's delicious and nutritious !
5 #### This is one of the best honeys I ever ate .
5 #### I always enjoy the product . Unfortunately , sometimes it is not shipped in the proper packaging . This time it was shipped without the caps tightened . That is pretty messy . As I said , I am always pleased with the product despite the other problems . Thanks
5 #### LOVE THIS ! ! I 'm about half way thru the jar n will be ordering some more in a few days .. ill probably do a subscribe
5 #### I 'm using for DIY lotion or face wash or whatever beauty products . It smells so good every time I open the jar . It must taste so good , too . I have n't tried yet . Anyway this is very good honey . I can tell because the way it smells and looks .
5 #### Lots of uses for this product but I only use this brand .....
5 #### This is by far the best honey I ever had , I love it . Thank you for this good product
5 #### I have ordered and used this product many times and am so satisfied I will continue to do so . Wonderful mild honey -- I doubt there is a better honey to be found . Packaged wonderfully , too , in its own special - made bubble casing . I was impressed !
5 #### This is EXCELLENT organic raw honey , and is shipped in a good - quality GLASS container , not cheap plastic like some other brands . This honey is superb !
5 #### I am in love with this honey . Out of regular organic , raw and creamed honey i have tried , this has the perfect taste . It really tastes different from the dark liquid honey and not overly sweet like the creamed raw honey i purchase from store . I can say that no sucrose is added . Will be a repeat buyer .
5 #### I use raw honey in my coffee , and this is easy to spoon in with no dripping and sticky mess . Tastes wonderful .
5 #### Great honey , creamy and delicious . that 's all I have to say .
5 #### Excellent honey . Not all honeys are created equal . This is possibly the best honey I 've ever tasted . It 's not cheap to be sure but it has a far better flavor than other honey I 've tried . Keep in mind too that it is very thick and ' grainy ' ( in a good way ) because you are not buying a jar of water . If you pay this for honey , do n't use it for cooking . Use it where you 'll taste it --- in tea , on bread , etc . I use a more basic and cheaper honey in my breads . Use this honey on food items and it will last a long time . Terrific product .
5 #### We just love this honey ! It 's like a wonderful honey " cream " -- it 's much thicker than typical honey . Tastes delicious and comes in a great glass jar ( which is such a great shape , it gets re - used in a million ways ! ) , plus it 's organic -- what 's not to love ! ?
3 #### Compared to the Italians Honeys I usually but this is nothing special , bur for the American consumers I believe this is a good product
5 #### This is THE best honey ever ! ! ! Delicious ! ! Highly recommend , you wo n't be disappointed , and it 's organic ! !
5 #### Oh man this is GREAT ! ! ! ! I grew up not liking honey . I 'm still not a fan of the " teddy bear " liquid honey , but organic RAW honey is fantastic . I scoop it out with a spoon and lick the spoon clean . Will buy again and again ! ! ! !
5 #### Yum ! Yum ! This is a spreadable consistency and runny like most honey .
5 #### This is tasty stuff . It 's more grainy than the processed honey , so be prepared for that . I love it .
5 #### I love this honey . Better substitute for sugar . I use in my morning coffee
5 #### This brand of honey has to be the best ! It 's so creamy and delicious . But I 'd head on over to Vitacost.com for a much better price !
5 #### Very good ! Use this several times / day , in many recipes .
5 #### This is the most delicious and high quality honey I have ever eaten . Smooth , delicious flavor , literally melts in your mouth . Lasts a long time . I do n't want to ever purchase a different honey again !
5 #### YS Organic Farms Certified Organic Raw honey is super special . It adds a sweet , delicious flavor to all my organic teas ... especially Peach tea .
5 #### I bought this for myself . I am quite a bit more health conscious than hubby but he has already eaten half of the jar . I had a little bit on some toast and hopefully I get a little more before the jar is gone entirely . I will be ordering more for both of us . I am hiding my jar ;)
5 #### Great honey . Raw honey is the best ; healthy for you and taste good .
5 #### This honey is great . I love to put a dollop of it in my tea .
5 #### This is ABSOLUTELY the best organic honey on the market in my book . I use it to sweeten beverages and in cooking ! Best natural sweetener there is in my book ! Awesome stuff Y.S. Organic Bee Farm ! ! Keep them bees healthy and happy so we can be healthy and happy !
5 #### Use it all the time , a must have in the house
3 #### Amazon best Value : Pack of 3 - $ 46.99 ( $ 0.49 / Ounce ) $ 15.66 each Lucky Vitamin best Value : Spend over $ 50 to qualify for free shipping . Pack of 5 - $ 59.60 ( $ 0.37 / Ounce ) $ 11.92 each But whatever you do , do n't be dumb and spend $ 20 for a single jar or spend $ 25 at the Vitamin Shopp . !
2 #### Funny taste . I think they added something unnatural to this honey for mass production . Do n't take my word for it though , try it out , but keep an open mind before deciding .
5 #### Awesome tasting honey . Has a floral tone . Will def buy again
5 #### D. LISH . ISS . Plain & Simple , this honey has a lovely , light , perhaps slightly floral taste . The slight grittiness , almost like a very fine sand , just melts away as you rub your tongue against the roof of your mouth , letting the flavor linger as long as possible . A few months ago , I bought honey from Brazil and the taste was Funky , and Not in a Good way ! This honey comes on gently and stays that way with No weird aftertaste . This is only the second time I 've bought raw , unfiltered honey ... I have n't bought honey at all in the last several years , but I know Now I Will be buying This honey on a regular basis . Here't to hoping that this does n't become my newest addiction !
4 #### I liked this honey and the prices was right .
5 #### Yummy ! and a nice semi solid consistency that makes it very versatile . I use it in coffee , on cornbread and as a face mask mixed with other ingredients .
5 #### I purchased this honey based off of the great reviews it received . I was very curious about what was so great about it . Now I know ! This is the most delicious honey that I have ever tasted . The texture is not sticky like the bear honey , it spreads on toast like butter . I have put it in my tea and coffee and I ca n't say enough about it . It is so worth paying a little extra for this . It also gives me peace of mind to know that it is organic . I will never go back to the bear honey again . I highly recommend this honey .
3 #### It looks like semifrozen white oil quite different from normal honey . I did n't like this feature . I ca n't say anything about the quality of honey as I have yet to use it .
5 #### Purchased as a gift and that person really enjoyed it , they liked that there were 4 different flavors .
5 #### Now this is what a cheese cake should taste like . I was impresses and I have eaten cheese cakes from NY to Fl . Also , a super job on packaging . I know some companies on here that could take a lesson from this company on how to package your product so it 's not melting or in crumps !
5 #### I put this in my green smoothies for a sweeter , yet healthy taste .
5 #### My favorite honey , other than my local raw honey . Love , love , love !
5 #### Can not go wrong with this cheesecake , smooth and creamy , everyone just loved it ! Came in a nice little cooler with dry ice , it was chilled really well !
5 #### I was quite nervous about ordering cheesecake seeing as I had come across some negative reviews on some other options , but WOW ! ! This is amazing . It shipper well , it was tucked into the box super nice and it was kept cold for its whole trip . I had to try some as soon as I opened it and it is wonderful . It 's creamy and sweet , just perfect ! I will definitely be ordering again ! Thank you so much ! :)
5 #### Last winter right after christmas , i sent my sons family cheese cake sampler from Omaha Steaks , I notice Few cheese cakes had nuts in it ( pecan ) i think , my son has diverticitis & ca n't have nuts ... they just moved & i bumped into this site , i heard there Lotts more better Than Omaha Steaks cheese cakes ! ! Hope so .
5 #### I 've ordered this before and it 's great honey . very thick and does not flow very easily , but that 's ok with me
5 #### This is a great product . It 's completely spreadable and maintains its consistency to the bottom of the jar . I 'm almost addicted but manage to limit it to one bagel at breakfast . Small wonders = big rewards .
5 #### So delicious - I use a spoon of this with my probiotics in the morning . Also , I take a spoon before a run or gym session as a natural pre - workout energy boost .
5 #### OMG , this stuff is SOOO good . Spreadable honey , yum .
5 #### I love this honey ! Rarely do I buy any other unless I am in a pinch .
5 #### I love the thick yummy texture of this honey . I have and would buy again

5 #### absolutely fantastic product . at first I thought it was a little pricy , but after using it I can totally justify the cost . it 's the only honey I buy now !
5 #### This is a different look , consistency , color than I 'm used to in honey , but it really tastes good .
5 #### love the taste of this honey ! will order again
5 #### An excellent product . This honey is the real deal . Excellent flavor and consistency . I love the fact that this honey is as untouched as possible ; and that it is organic and raw . Thank you for producing this excellent product . I will definitely continue to purchase this honey for years to come .
5 #### Yum ! Really delicious . You can tell it is organic and more ' pure ' by taste . A+
5 #### I have written a review of YS Organic 's raw honey before on a different size / product , but just to reiterate it here : I love this honey . I seriously doubt I could ever love another honey as much as this raw honey . I have tried several other raw honey brands , even fresh comb from my friend 's family beehives , and its just not as good . This is the sweetest , most delightful honey -- PERIOD . It is solidified unlike traditional honey , so at times it can be harder to work with in cooking and smoothies unless you warm it a bit in the microwave , but I seriously could care less about that . I had to buy two humongous jars to keep up with my cravings for it , one for work and one for home . I drink a lot of tea and do a smoothie most mornings , and I often incorporate this honey into it as a natural sweetener . It sweetens my tea with very little , and it melts into the tea beautifully -- honestly , the effect is hypnotic in my clear glass teacup . Sometimes I 'll eat a small spoonful for a snack and energy pick - me - up midway between meals , and it is so satisfying that I can trade out a processed dessert for it . The nectar of the literal gods , seriously .
5 #### Yummy , Yummy , Yummy ! I love this Honey . It is like heaven in your mouth ! It is thick and creamy in texture and melts like butter once it hits your tongue . It is sweet but not overly so . I love the fact that it is Organic as well . It is one of my favorite honeys out of all the brands that I have tried so far . Worth every penny ! =)
5 #### This honey is very good but I do wish I could find a bee farm closer to my house . Since I have n't found one yet , I will order from Y.S. Organic Bee Farms again .
5 #### This is good quality and is very good in tea .
5 #### Great tasting honey . It 's like candy . I never tasted anything so good in the honey industry . You can not beat this quality of honey for the price . A spoon a day may help your allergies go away .
5 #### Product is as described and tastes great , though I use my honey more for skin care than anything else ! Absolutely love this .
5 #### Does n't taste like the honey I am used to when eating from a spoon but its really great in my tea . I will continue using for the health benefits .
5 #### Excellent ! I buy as many ORGANIC products as possible after watching several TRUE yet terrifying documentaries like GMO OMG , Forks Over Knives , Cowspiracy , The True Cost , Ethos . If you love your family you will find these documentaries and watch them ASAP ! There is a reason almost ALL Americans are diseased , fat , tired , depressed and basically hopeless . Where we put our dollar is the ONLY leverage we have so please give your money to companies that provide clean , nutritious NON GMO foods while actively participating in ways that prolong the one & only planet that supports life - Earth . We must stand together in this or continue to watch each other and our children end up with one illness after another . Peace !
5 #### Absolutely delicious and good amount for the price . My favorite honey , hands down .
4 #### This is really excellent honey . I like to make sure I always have it stocked . It 's a smooth , spreadable honey with a really nice mild flavor . If you like a stronger honey flavor , you may find this too mild ; however , it has a good flavor and goes well with anything you may want to use honey for . We love to spread it on toast ; and I love to use it in my iced tea . The main negative is that they are constantly raising the price of their products , so ... I'm not sure I will be hanging on for much longer as a loyal customer if I can find a replacement at a better price . This comes in a glass jar , which I really appreciate .
5 #### I eat a LOT of raw honey and I drink it in lemonade or tea all day . I try to use local honey but sometimes I ca n't and this is what I get then . I like it . The flavor is wonderful !
1 #### I do n't like saying negative things . It is not Honey . I do n't know what it is . My advise , DO NOT BUY this product .
5 #### My favorite brand of honey , will purchase over and over again .
4 #### Love the buttery flavor . wish it came in a glass jar .
5 #### I have tried so many raw honey that are there on the market and nothing taste like this one . I know the taste of pure wild raw honey and this definitely tastes better than any other honey.tastes so good on home made bread . I also add it in my morning green tea . I definitely recommend this .
5 #### Very hard by the 2nd week but really tastes good .
5 #### Without a doubt , the best honey that has ever passed over my tongue . However , its like wax , so forget about it on your breakfast cereal . It worked great in teas and whatever is hot .
5 #### This honey ( I LOVE honey ) is supercalafragilisticexpialidocious ! My wife ordered this at Christmas ; we mix it with natural , dark , crunchy peanut butter for a snack on crackers . It is absolutely marvelous on leftover toasted biscuit . Very creamy with a subtle sweetness ; great in a cup of coffee . A far cry from the pesticide & herbicide infested commercially - processed honeys one finds on the grocery shelves . Simply delightful !
5 #### My main use for this honey is to use it as an ingredient in my Green Tea Spritizer . I will admit I have licked the spoon and I must say that the taste is amazing . I have tasted other honey brands , but this one stands out for me among the others . This is raw and organic and that clearly comes through in the quality and taste of this honey . I have bought this honey several times over the last four years . People love the taste of my Green Tea Spritizer and it is mainly due to the honey itself .
5 #### Lots of Honey .. Careful you do n't go overboard eating it ;) Thank You
5 #### this is really good quality . I need to order some more ! We use it in everything ... very smooth , and great taste !
2 #### This " honey " was pretty bad .. When I got it , it was solid so I soaked it in hot tap water hoping to soften it up . After multiple attempts at this , it never totally softened . Does n't appear to be crystallized , just has a very waxy texture . My friends raise bees and I 've eaten a lot of honey , seen what it looks like fresh from the hive and this stuff is unlike anything I 've ever experienced . The taste is okay but I 'm not sure what to do with it . . I 'm thinking about just throwing it away . I showed this stuff to my beekeeper friends and they were also very suspicious too . We all agreed this is not pure raw honey . If i knew where to get it analyzed by a lab , I 'd pay to do it .
5 #### This is absolutely the best honey I have ever bought . I have told others about it , and they agree , very good honey .
5 #### I got this primarily for my kids who love to have apples and honey as a snack ( parenting win for me ) . I 'm not a fan of honey , personally - or I should say I was n't until trying this stuff . I love it . Apparently I 've learned that I 'm not a fan of cheap knockoff , runny honey . This stuff is delicious ... creamy , sweet , flavourful ... I guess it 's what real honey is supposed to be . So now I wo n't get anything else because why bother ? I 'll be getting this again when we run low .
5 #### This product arrived yesterday January 23 , 2016 . I was very impressed by the quality of the product and the way it was manufactured . I have purchased from Y.S .. Bee when I lived in another state and was always satisfied with my experience and the way it seemed to help my energy levels .
5 #### This is awesome honey . It is n't too sweet . The consistency is different from your regular , comes - in - a - bear honey but I like it even better .
4 #### Very good and so deliciously sweet . Makes my sugar go up !
5 #### Really good honey , arrived well packaged . Would highly recommend it .
5 #### GREAT PRODUCT , GREAT PRICE , I WILL RETURN I'M A SATISFIED CUSTOMER !
5 #### I have already used my first jar and just purchased two more jars today .
5 #### Best honey ever ! ! ! we use this in place of sugar . We have not bought or used sugar in our household for at least 4 years now .
5 #### This is the best honey that I have ever seen or tasted . You will dig it .
5 #### I trust this brand and the great quality has never let me down . Great price for organic and do n't be afraid of the larger size ... I guarantee you will find so many uses for this honey and use quickly !
4 #### Very expensive . It does taste excellent . I am now buying organic honey from local Traders Joe .
5 #### It 's raw honey that 's never been heat treated or finely filtered , so it is n't fluid . You do n't pour it out , you spoon it out . Because it has n't been heat treated , the natural enzymes have n't been denatured , none of the nutritional value has been lost , and the food is still completely raw . In other words , this is what bees eat . I love it .
5 #### This is the real deal ! None of that liquid bown clear stuff that passes as honey , but is probably HFCS , with this honey . This is raw and organic and so good ! I just wish it was n't so hard to spoon in the winter .
3 #### To each their own but I did n't like the smell / flavor of this one .
5 #### Though very hard to scoop , it is really an authentic organic honey .
5 #### I love this organic raw honey for its taste and health benefits . I put a tablespoon in my hot lemon water every morning and it provides me the nourishment I need to get me through the morning before I have my lunch . Very economical and great tasting !
5 #### Delicious ! I could eat it by the spoonful . Raw honey has many health benefits too !
5 #### This is my very favorite Organic Raw Honey . The flavor is so beautiful and makes me feels so relaxed just smelling it . Makes me feel like a kid again ! LOL Licking it off my finger or a spoon ! YUM !
4 #### The honey was great , kind of hard to get it out of the glass jar
5 #### One of the better honeys on the market . I use it with my herbal teas and really can feel the difference in my energy level and overall health . I I would n't go back to even the top brands sold in grocery stores as there 's no comparison . Buy this , put some on a spoon and taste it . You 'll know right away this is top quality honey . Now give it some time in your body to feel the difference . You 'll be happy with your choice .
5 #### I love this in my oatmeal is so good for you I 'm making cereal out of oatmeal egg whites and 1 teaspoon of the bee pollen with some cinnamon or you can cook some quinoa and use it for cereal also with a tablespoon of milk and makes you so healthy definitely the best before a workout
4 #### Good for the price . It does nt have any added sugars so do n't expect it to crazy sweet like the supermarkets . Its thick which is the natural state of honey , liquid honey is only liquid for a minute , the permanent liquid honey has water & sugar or some use high fructose corn syrup . Not bad , I like it anyway .
5 #### I 've been buying this honey for several years and have to say it 's better than anything local or storebought . Being organic , it 's imported because our farmland is so contaminated that organic honey is nearly impossible to get from American hives . Hopefully this will change if we keep fighting gmos and cafos .
5 #### By far the best honey you will ever taste . Trouble is , once you take a bite or a lick , you ca n't stop . It 's like a spoonful of heaven . Makes all the store brands seem so horribly inferior .
5 #### these fruits are really a great gift for someone .... interesting looking and great tasting ! i love them ! i have sent them to family and friends and they too loved them a lot ! really tart and sweet at the same time ....
5 #### I think this is some of the best tasting honey I have ever eaten . I purchased it in for my Granola recipe .. It is expensive and I am thinking to buy more but using it in my beverages instead .
5 #### It arrived in great condition . The fruits were fresh and ripe and so yummy I finished the whole box in one sitting . No regrets ! ! Trying other fruits from same seller now
5 #### Wow ! I just received this honey , took a taste and was incredibly surprised . This is by far the best honey I 've ever tasted . From here on out , this is the only honey I will ever buy . Extremely satisfied !
5 #### Great , came really quickly and as delicious as I remember them from Malaysia . I will be re - ordering them soon .
4 #### This is my husband 's favorite fruit , and very hard to get outside the Tropics . The Rambutans arrived on time , well - packaged with an ice pack to keep them fresh . A few were over - ripe , but I know how hard it is to source them . These do n't grown anywhere outside the Tropics , so they have to be specially flown in , take about a week to ripen , add to that travel time and delivery time and I have to admit , I 'm very pleased with this product . Rambutans are like lychees , but much more satisfying as they have a lot more flesh than lychees . Having had A LOT of Rambutans in Asia over my childhood , these really take me back . Unfortunately , I ca n't get my Tropical favorite fruit anywhere in the States , Mangosteen are impossible to come by ! This is a close second . As with any groceries , they 're a little smushed , a little ripe , and mostly perfect ! I 'm very glad I was able to get a little bit of our childhood back in the States , it was completely worth $ 35 .
5 #### Excellent ! I like this YS Eco Bee Farms Raw Honey because this is the product what I want . It is so smooth and delicious .
3 #### About half had arrived spoiled , seller made it right , but I was n't impressed with the taste . Rambutan were not as white as on the picture .
3 #### not as fresh as they should have been , very expensive .
5 #### Super delicious and ooh so sweet ! All were fresh and delicious and arrived almost before I was expecting them .
1 #### Rambutans arrived with a black mildew or mold all over them . They were very dry and difficult to peel . We tried to eat a few of them , but they were just too bad to eat . I have eaten fresh rambutans , and these are not fresh rambutans .
5 #### The Rambutans arrived quickly in were in great condition . Absolutely delicious ! Ripe , juicy and a real treat for our grandchildren . We will definitely order them again .
5 #### This is just what I needed . I find it to be superior to the honey sold in the grocery store .
5 #### Fabulous Honey . The best I have ever tasted . It is available at Super Supplements in a glass container which I prefer , and at a slightly better price . Highly Recommended !
4 #### What fun ! Just figure out where the seam is , give a squeeze , and pop out the sweet amazingly tasty pulp . Has a big pit , but I put the whole insides in my mouth , and spit out the pit . Tastes the same as leechee . I just love these . I live too far north to get them in the grocery more than once in a blue moon , so it 's nice to know I can order them when I 'm thinking they 'd be nice to have , not waiting for that future time when a specialty store finally gets some in .
5 #### This is the first time we tried Rambutans and we are HOOKED ! We loved these little fruits and will definately order them again ! ! The only thing we would of liked is how to properly store them and what their life was before going bad . Some people know about exotic fruits , but then some of us do not and want to know how to store them properly . We made the mistake of putting them in the refridgerator and the next day , they seemed to have lost their flavor . Just a thought to include directions in how to keep the fruit from spoiling for those of us who do not know . Thanks !
5 #### My husband is very happy with this organic honey , so glad we found it .
5 #### Awesome ! Best honey you can get , great value , great consistency . We always have some in the house !
1 #### This honey was good but the last two times I have bought it its becoming more and more sugery .. Trust me stay away if you want to get some real raw honey try wee bee honey it taste good and you could tell they do n't feed the bees suger and syrup ... Plain Nasty they got me this time but never again ! ! !
5 #### I love this honey . Quality product and organic too -- perfect .
5 #### Best tasting organic Honey I have ever tasted . I have been buying O. H , for years and from different places , but this is the best ! !
3 #### Has a plasticy after taste , which is weird because it 's in glass . Fine to use in tea , but not to eat by itself .
4 #### I love the taste of this organic honey . It 's also difficult to find organic raw honey in larger containers like this one . However , after a few orders , I found this same honey at my local Sprouts grocery store for about 25 % less . So I 'll keep buying from Sprouts , but I love YS Organic Bee Farms honey !
5 #### I just received my raw , organic honey and washed my hands , opened the jar , and scooped a fingerful out like a greedy little girl . I have never tasted honey this good . I will be both eating and face - masking it , and this wonderful company now has a life - long customer in me . Thank you , Y.S. Organic Bee Farms . I know we 're not supposed to blue - up the air on Amazon , but I ca n't help it ... I 'm so bloody pleased with this honey that ... well ... just thank you , thank you , thank you !
5 #### This has a wonderful taste and creamy texture . It 's great mixed with peanut and other nut butters !
5 #### We 're like bears , we like to go in and eat it straight ! Just make sure you use a clean spoon every time !
5 #### I use this in food recipes and in a recipe for a body wash . It is wonderful !
5 #### great tasting honey ! as well as good for you .
5 #### I love this honey . It has a great taste . I love how natural and rich it is . I bought a large jar because I know honey is great for you . It was a great buy . I try to have a teaspoon everyday . A must have ! ! !
5 #### This honey tastes absolutely divine . I love to bake with it . It adds a subtle sweetness without being overpowering . My sister hates honey and even she loves this stuff . Highly recommended .
4 #### It was delicious ; I ate some of it like pudding or like peanut butter out of the jar ; )
1 #### I use to Love this honey . But the last one I ordered was very different than before . The taste was n't sweet , the texture was waxy instead of creamy . I do n't know if the company removed certain ingredients or I just got an old one . I do n't think it was old cause the date was good and it did n't smell old , just very different .
5 #### Tastes good . It is exactly as described . No complaints .
5 #### I bought this honey because it was from a real bee farm . You ca n't get any better than honey from a real farm . This one is great . The taste is that of a real quality Organic honey . The way it should be . Of all the honeys I 've had , this one is by far the best .
5 #### This is the best honey ever ! Just my favorite , and I can tell it is so pure and beneficial .
5 #### I 'm on an almost all organic diet now . Lost 30 # in a month , and this product is perfect ! ! It 's nothing like the clear honey you see in grocery stores , it 's thick and light colored . Tastes Delish Wish I had gone organic years ago ! !
5 #### It 's a keeper . I love the taste and it 's great for all the things I use it for .
5 #### So good it 's become a staple . Only sweetner I use .
5 #### I absolutely love everything about this honey and ca n't imagine buying refined honey ever again . So delicious !
5 #### This is what honey is suppose to taste like , not like that slop they sell in the stores .
5 #### I use this raw honey to wash my face after makeup removal . It is so good to clean my face . To moisturize the face more , I left it on for 5 minutes then rince with water . It is good for acne skin as well .
5 #### I never tasted anything quite like it . I use it for many things : recipes , on toast , on a sandwich , and as a sweetener .
5 #### This is some of the best raw organic honey i 've purchased ! Has a great taste and texture !
5 #### Nice flavor . Great for spreading on toast with peanut butter . Does n't drip .
5 #### Some of the best - tasting honey ever . Love that it 's certified organic . Love the thick texture ( do n't worry it melts ! ) . Love love love the taste . Seriously great quality , and I could probably sit and happily eat the whole jar with a spoon .
5 #### Awesome honey ! ! ! ! Totally what you are looking for ... non GMO Organic Honey ! ! ! ! And , of course , it does n't taste like that stuff they sell in your grocery store .
5 #### I think I 'm on my 5th jar of this stuff . Ca n't beat the price . We use it for everything . Love it .
5 #### Just got the honey delivered today and could n't wait to try . It is so delicious , light , smooth and sweet ! Solid when you get it and you can eat it w a spoon . Most other honies are thick and heavy with a sickenly sweet taste that would not be as pleasent to eat from a spoon . The white on top is delicious too ! I love it and will buy more .
1 #### HONEY IS BAD FOR YOU ; HONEY IS OVER 50 % FRUCTOSE . GOOGLE HONEY IS BAD FOR YOU ... IT CAN MAKE YOU GAIN WEIGHT
5 #### I know nothing about honey except that this tastes great . It was very well packaged , each jar in its own sturdy cardboard box . The jars are glass and the top is metal . I am not so much one to tout popular remedies for real or imagined ills , I have to say that I have had very little problem with my sinuses since using this honey . Normally I am racked with " nasal " allergies . Since this is not exactly " local " honey I 'm not sure how that works but I am feeling a bit less like an allergy victim now that I am enjoying this honey . Even without this possible benefit , the stuff just tastes wonderful so that is good enough for me . I 'm hooked .
5 #### We love this honey ! While we try to buy local raw honey , this is great during the times when we ca n't find any . The price is fair .
5 #### Delicious . This honey is rich in flaver , and I recommend it to anyone looking for some good honey .
5 #### The honey is very good and I just used it as a spread for my home made dinner rolls . The honey is sweet .
5 #### I 've had this honey before and it is excellent .
1 #### Do n't care for this at all . I bought it to add to a lemonade drink that I make in the morning , however this is in a solid form . I have to melt it in the microwave to use it . Does n't work for what I need it for . Would not buy again .
4 #### This is very sweet , and I bought it twice . But it tastes more like crystalized sugar than honey . This is very thick honey . You ca n't pour it . Sometimes it hardens , and then it is difficult to spread . I bought fresh honey from a beekeeper , and the beekeeper honey tasted so much better than this one . This honey does not have a strong taste at all . It is just sugary . I prefer a rich honey taste , and this honey does not have that . But this is super - sweet honey , so it is sure to please many people .
5 #### Others have said it all already , of course . This honey tastes wonderful , it 's packaged in glass , not plastic , it is raw and therefore more healthful than processed honey . So good on homemade bread and in tea . Did I mention , the flavor ? The best . Try it , you 'll be glad , your mouth will be glad !
5 #### This honey is so thick it does n't really run at room temperature - it almost has the consistency of shortening . Completely opaque . Incredible taste . This compared to regular grocery store transparent amber honey is like comparing a grass - fed ribeye steak to a cruddy fast food burger patty . Or high - quality chocolate to the crap Nestle and Hershey use to coat their candy bars . Sadly , Vitacost no longer has an amazon store , where I bought a 2 lb jar of this for about 40 % less than what it 's going for now .
5 #### We are on our second jar of this delectable treasure ( I keep three extras in the pantry unopened for emergencies ) . This honey has a really nice clean taste . Last a long time , melts wells , is smooth and I 've used it in recipes ( including homemade jam ) that call for sugar and had everything turn out yummy . Very nice honey . Ca n't say enough about it . If I had more money I would have about a dozen extra of this stuff in my pantry , it 's that good . You wo n't be disappointed from the first spoonful to the last . My opened YS Honey jar only has about 2 tsp left . :( On a side note : Archeologists have found honey in various Egyptian tombs and the honey is still edible ( you can be sure it was n't YS Honey ! ) So the shelf life is about 4,000 years .
5 #### This was a repeat gift , the recipient loves it .
4 #### Tastes delicious , however I 've been informed by a friend who produces honey that there is no such thing as ORGANIC HONEY , which makes sense as bees roam all over the place .
5 #### ... when there was more raw honey available , rather than the amber , syrupy stuff . I remember when Billy Bee in Canada had the opaque , raw kind , like YS honey . Yum ! So glad I found this brand . It is delicious ! I just started eating a spoonful before bed .
5 #### LoVE this but it is half the price on vitacost ! GREAT honey-
5 #### This is the best honey I have purchased , love the taste
5 #### This tastes great . My kids eat with a spoon .
5 #### This honey is EXCELLENT ! Great taste . I find myself having a spoonful for a snack .
5 #### I purchased this honey to stir in to my warm lemon water each morning . IT IS DELICIOUS ! I am finding it hard to put in to my lemon water because I want to put the spoonful right in to my mouth ! I am so pleased with the taste of this honey . From my warm April pantry , it is the consistency of butter .... not sure if it will liquefy more this summer or harden up in the winter months . Either way , I LOVE IT !
5 #### This is simply the best . Craving sweets - a tsp right out of the jar is perfect . Has such a deep taste , not at all like store bought Sue Bee Honey . My second purchase . I have also used this when sick , soothes my throat like none other . DELICIOUS !
5 #### I actually started using this product as a deep conditioner ( sometimes using in my tea ) . It is great when melted and added to coconut oil , olive oil and aloe vera gel . I leave it on my very thick and curly hair for 30 minutes , then rinse . It leaves my hair soft and manageable ( with the other products added ) . I love it .
5 #### This honey is the best , pure and simple . The combination of organic and raw ca n't be beat . It is creamy and thick with a light flavor that I use sparingly in tea and coffee , yes , coffee . There are many honey that are either raw or organic . Here you get both from a reputable source . Love it !
5 #### The YS Organic Bee Farms Certified Organic Raw Honey is simply great . I have purchased it locally for years , but decided to get two large jars from Amazon . It came today . I have already used it and it is excellent , as usual !
5 #### This is honestly the best tasting honey I have ever had . The fact that it is unfiltered allows for a more natural and complex taste that you do not get with processed honey .
5 #### Used this product for gelatin gummies - love it and will continue to use it .
5 #### OMG , this is the most wonderful beautiful honey on earth , HANDS DOWN ! ! ! ! ! I am in love !
5 #### Simply the best sweetener . My wife wanted organic honey and we hunted and hunted . I thought it was pricey . We have used it instead of Neosporin . We have used it to replace 90 % of our sugar in beverages . We have used it to sooth our throats during illness . If there were a miracle medicine , this may just be it ! ! !
4 #### I paid more for this and got this great product , I give them 4 * because great product but much higher price , and took longer to receive
3 #### Using a jackhammer to get honey out is n't our idea of the perfect buy , but it is organic and it is raw . We did find organic raw honey downtown recently which is much easier to use , however .
4 #### It 's good but I wish it was easier to pour . The can makes it hrd to add . Otherwise wonderful stuff .
5 #### Love this treacle . Brings back memories from a kid . Good old British treacle .
5 #### great produce , you really get to know what honey should taste , loke
5 #### got here fine .... wouldn't you know I 'm allergic to sugar ... but did not know I could n't take honey ... but all is not lost ... family likes it !
5 #### My can has been sitting unopened with my canned goods since I bought it in January 2012 , four years ago . I finally opened it for an experiment which I do n't know will work , am trying to make cranberry orange steamed bread . It may fail , but I tasted the syrup , and it is delicious ! It 's very thick , was still amber - colored after 4 years , expiry date was Sep 2013 , so about 1/4 can left ( I used 3/4 cup ) may go bad now that it has been opened . There are some recipes I still want to try with it . I wonder how it would work for divinity . The syrup tasted like caramellized sugar I 've been making a lot of lately for flan and desserts , only much better . I will definitely order some more but may get the bottles which may be neater to pour , will price compare . But the carmellized sugar I make gets hard in the bottom of the pan and takes extra time to make for a recipe . I am going to try this , swirl in the bottom of cake pans and bowls , and bet it is going to be a real winner .
5 #### I have never consumed a lot of honey in my lifetime , and I 'm 53 years old . Over the last few years , I m moving away from refined sugars . I 'm using Pure Via at the moment , and while its the closest taste to the real thing , it still has an after taste . I decided to really go natural , and after reading all the positive reviews from hundreds of reviewers , I took a chance and ordered the 2 pound jar ( I 'm an all or nothing kind of man ) I have tasted processed honey , and the taste was good . When I used to think of raw honey , I imagined unfiltered honey with bee parts in it . That s the only thing that kept me from trying it " in the raw " . I put on my big boy britches , and when my honey arrived ( very well packaged ) I tasted only the top layer which was a light white layer of what I assume was separation due to the cooler temperatures . Absolutely delicious . I wanted to eat it straight from the jar . The taste of this honey was robust . It was n't overpowering . It was rich in taste and texture . Raw honey is incredibly satisfying . Processed honey is okay . This raw honey is spectacular . I m using this to sweeten my hot and cold tea . You wo n't have any regrets with this purchase . It 's worth every penny . No more refined sugars for me .
5 #### I 'm on my 4th bottle . I 've essentially replaced sugar with this .
5 #### I put it on my oatmeal like I used to when I was little I eat it every day .
5 #### It tastes good , I think I will buy it again .
5 #### Superb taste . If this stuff really is as healthy as people say , it should be a marvelous product . The bee farms are located in Brazil and Canada far from any commercial crops ( I wrote to the company ) .
5 #### Got this to have in the cupboard for when I come across recipes calling for it . I am too lazy to make a homemade version , so I ordered this to have on hand . Great idea !
5 #### Just the same as the bottles just in a can it is easier to store in a pantry but for ease of use I 'll go with the plastic bottles ..
5 #### I have friends in Australia and New Zealand and this is in many of their desserts , in fact they swear by it . The tin is pretty and the syrup is yummy . It almost has a burnt caramel flavor to it . We made ANZAC biscuits and they were very good ! I 've also heard it 's good drizzled over vanilla ice cream , but have n't tried that yet .
4 #### I have purchased this Raw honey from local merchants and on Amazon . It seems to be one of the better RAW HONEY varieties on the market today . Have been using this product for several months and it seems to be a very good product . Have tried other brands but this brand seems to be better than most I have tried , will continue to use it .
5 #### Many uses . Whenever I see a recipe for corn syrup I substitute for this and it works . It has more flavor than corn syrup - better .
5 #### I bought this to make Anzac biscuits . I was born in New Zealand , where the men are strong , beautiful , and fabulous at everything . But their best feature is their modesty . If you have n't ever had Anzac biscuits , then you are missing the Herculean ingredient that makes New Zealanders ' this way .
5 #### My mother was born and raised in England where this is a staple in every household . I was raised with it in our home . Tate and Lyles has not changed from the original recipe and it is as good as ever . Wonderful to add to baking and as a spread on toast . Not like honey , not like syrup , not like corn syrup , Golden Syrup is its own special thing and this is the best and original one .
5 #### can not find anything that tastes like this anywhere - has a unique taste better than honey - way better than corn syrup - can do many things with this - in oatmeal - spread on puff pastry and bake
5 #### Love it and good price , use it all the time .
5 #### Very thick and tasty . So takes a while to dissolve in anything - even hot tea . Can warm in warm water to make a bit less thick but takes a while . Have not cooked with but have used in Vitamix when making protein drinks so thickness not an issue . Little pricey but a little goes a long way !
5 #### I use this daily in my oatmeal wo n't start my day without it ! ! ! ! Very Healthy ! ! !
4 #### Five stars + for taste ! Three stars for packaging . Maybe across the pond the decorative tin is preferred , but it seems to become a little " dicey " during shipping . Small " leaks " from the tin make for a " slightly " messy delivery . I 'll buy MORE of this quality item ( try it on scones or toast ! ) , nicely sweet combo of Maple Syrup & Honey ( to me , anyway ) ... BUT ... like Maple Syrup / Honey , * NOT * something you want dripping all over you ! Squeeze bottle please !
5 #### Again , this is a favorite food stemming back to my husband 's childhood in England . I have used it in an old World War I recipe for an eggless fruit cake , and to top very small portions of Spotted Dick , as the dessert with syrup is very rich , though delicious .
4 #### This has the consistency of honey and tastes like a toffee . It 's surprisingly quite strong . It 's good on baked goods , but not good for everything ( like drinks , I suppose ) . You would like this , if you 're looking for something new and sweet to put on your pancakes .
4 #### This is good honey . I bought this cheaper at my health grocery . You can buy this honey at many health food stores , too . I 've tried 11 raw , most of which were unfiltered , honeys , and I do n't have any real complaints about this one . It is waxy , which is common , but it is very hard , making it fairly hard to dig it out with a spoon , even though it melts easily and completely in your mouth . I suppose this is a fairly minor problem , but I would n't buy it again . It is a very mild / bland honey , which some people may prefer . That said , I only found one raw , unfiltered honey on Amazon that I liked a little better . The Amish Mountain honey is a little more expensive , but it has a little more flavor and a nice honey like consistency . I also found a local honey at my health food store that is a dark desert mesquite honey with a normal honey like consistency and lots of flavor for a honey . It is also cheap , but Happy Bear honey is probably only available in Arizona . That 's the only reason I did n't give this YS organic honey five stars .
5 #### Nothing better than scones . The are delicious and Lyle 's Golden Syrup whips up the best tasting scones . Try 'em sometime .
5 #### LOVE this , it 's excellent and not as sickening sweet as other Syrups I have tried . I use it in recipes & by itself on foods . It 's GREAT ! !
5 #### i needed this for a honey comb recipe i made and it was amazing . the taste is way different from honey so i m so glad i did not substitute .
1 #### Received can with large dent . The box was in good shape , so can was damaged before shipment . The main reason I ordered this product was for the decorative can . The same was true of a can of Black Treacle ordered from the same supplier at the same time and delivered in the same box .
5 #### I 've seen this product for decades but did n't feel like finding out it had an aftertaste like so many syrups on the market including Monins . I do n't like molasses and I do n't like maple . I finally took the leap and MAN IS IT GOOD . There is really no sweetener I stand in coffee except pure sugar until now . This is even good there . Did n't alter the coffee the way honey would . Pancakes Waffles on your Tongue on Ice Cream on Sausage , in baking , its like adding almost - caramel to anything . Butter just brings it forward . Alaga no longer is like it was decades ago so this is the syrup I 'm switching to . Looking to try their other goodies .
5 #### Wonderful memories of my childhood . My mom and grandmother used this in baking & cooking the traditional Scottish & British foods . Many things change but this item has not changed . It still has that golden syrup taste . Heaven !
5 #### Second order from them this seller . This is quite possibly the best honey ever .
4 #### Like this and it is work it for the $ . I use it in tea and is perfect . Will buy again .
5 #### Great flavor and really thick consistency . It does not pour ; it has to be scooped with a strong spoon . I use it for toast , tea , baking , smoothies , and sometimes just by itself . Yum !
5 #### Excellent Taste ! Wonderful product- I will buy it again . Best tasting Honey my husband and I ever had .
5 #### Amazing taste and all organic . Plus you absolutely ca n't beat this price . I did the math on even bigger amounts of honey from all over amazon and no other all organic company has this price and quality .
5 #### I was tempted to give this fewer stars , but it would n't be fair to blame the product for Amazon 's poor packaging . Lyle 's Golden Syrup is an outstanding and delicious syrup . If you make any kind of traditional English desserts , there is no substitute . If you simply use it in place of corn syrup , you 'll never be satisfied with anything else again . I can only say : taste it . It speaks for itself , and it 's immediately obvious that this is n't just something you use to add sweetness . It has a distinctive and delicious flavor all its own and will enhance any recipe where it can be used . Or , just dribble it with butter on muffins or toast . Divine ! Now , as for Amazon 's packaging : terrible ! This product comes in a sturdy tin that could probably be stepped on by an elephant without being harmed , and yet Amazon packed it so poorly that it arrived half caved in and pretty useless . Because it 's a small and not expensive item , I wo n't go to the trouble of returning it - but I 'll find another source to buy it rather than Amazon . This is carried by many specialty stores and health food stores .
5 #### This product is delicious . It has a very unique taste and is great by itself or in other things like baked goods . It has a beautiful orange - gold color . I also use it in some beer recipes that I brew . The can is also lovely , but once I open it , I store the syrup in a glass jar .
1 #### Product was advertised as coming in a decorative tin . I received a cheap squeeze bottle . Not worth $ 12.00 . Amazon issued me a credit .
5 #### I 'm a big fan of natural , raw honey , so when I saw this product I did n't think too much of it , but bought it because I like trying new things . I do n't care for maple syrup much , too sweet for my taste , so I was hoping this would be a substitute for that on pancakes / waffles . The texture / thickness is exactly like honey , so it pours slowly and thickly , making it a lot like honey in this way as well . It does n't seem to granulate like honey , though , which I 'm glad for . Then I tasted it ..... OMG it 's sooo good ! ! ! Very light and sweet , not ' sugary ' at all , but buttery goodness ! ! ! This has become my favorite liquid type sweetener , even over honey , although I do n't think I 'd use this in tea , only on foods that call for syrup , since I would think the buttery flavor might get lost in a hot liquid . I purchased mine at Sendik 's in Milwaukee . So glad they carry it ! Worth every penny !
4 #### Good stuff . Not sure which is better , Freshpak or 11 - o'clock brand . Freshpak is easier to get though , at least for me .
5 #### Excellent Rooibos straight from the source . Delicious with a splash of milk . Great value and quick shipping
5 #### The best ICE TEA in summer with sweet leaf stevia ( I buy 4 oz size on amazon . ) I do n't use sugar ! Now I can have my caffeine free ice tea I love and like more than lipton tea we drank in summer . People I have try it , love it more than black tea ! I boil a medium pan of water , turn off , and put in about 6 - 8 bags , steep a while , stir and cool , put in container in fridge . I add some to large glass with stevia and ice and make it as weak or as strong as I want . Soooooo GOOD !
5 #### the best original from south africa , fresh and fast !
4 #### I 'd give it 3.5 stars if I could . My first try at Rooibos so I do n't have anything to directly compare it to . Generally speaking , for an herbal tea , the color was a nice dark red , the flavor was mild and on the weak side . Based on what I have read about Rooibos I expected more flavor . I 'll try making it stronger next time or letting it steep or brew longer . Seems like a good value and at this price you could double up the strength .
5 #### Best organic raw honey I have ever tasted . Smooth , silky in bottle . Love that it is packaged in glass . Packed well , delivered as promised . Will buy again and again .
5 #### I love this honey , it is very creamy . A lot easier to spread and does n't drip like regular honey . I use both kinds and this is my " go to " honey . It has a very good taste too .
5 #### very satisfying flavor best value . goes great with reading the woman 's no 1 detective agency series
5 #### I buy this over and over . Roobois is a great tea , and this brand is very good .
3 #### This tea has a unique robust flavor . It 's difficult to describe : very herbal and strong , plant - like and not quite medicinal , but something akin . It 's supposed to be healthier than other teas , but due to the taste , I find I opt for the other teas .
5 #### After a few cups , this is now my favorite tea .
5 #### Not to be confused with the other honey they sell ... This is the organic version . I , like others was confused when I ordered the other version of the honey they have due to the name of the company and the description ( talked about how they are able to harvest honey organically ) . This is still good quality but comes in a glass jar instead of the plastic one of the non - organic honey . It is thick but I do like it that way . You wo n't have to worry about it getting everywhere and it still has a great flavor . This is by far , way better than any store bought honey . I was never a huge fan until now . It is a little pricey but so is everything else organic . Sad to say that you have to pay more to get what we should already be getting in the first place .
5 #### This honey is very good and taste great in tea . I will definitely reorder .
5 #### This is my 2nd order , Iove the taste and my husband uses too much for his hibiscus tea !
5 #### Rooibos is my favorite beverage , hot or cold . The local stores have it but it 's a lot more expensive per tea bag . This is much more economical and I do n't notice any difference in flavor . I love the fact that it comes in a large amount so I do n't have to be ordering it every week . Lastly it comes as unwrapped tea bags in a box that 's sealed wrapped . So once I opened a box , I just put a handful of tea bags in a Ziploc sandwich bag that I have out near my tea kettle . The rest of the tea bags in the open box I put in a large freezer size Ziploc bag ( entire box fit ) and store in a cupboard .
5 #### Raw , sweet , pure -just a great honey . Very pleased with the taste , color and texture !
5 #### A multi - purpose product . Every home should have this on the shelf . This is a great immune system booster , great sugar replacement , n good for any wound on humans or animals .
5 #### Very delicious honey . I love to have a spoon full with my tea .
5 #### One of the best honey I ever got . Because its raw , its super good . Tastes delicious , and Raw honey is the best you can get .
5 #### It is amazing the difference in the taste of this honey versus the supposedly " organic " honey I purchased in the grocery . It is not bitter and in fact tastes creamy . Awesome product in my opinion and I will purchase again .
5 #### This Rooibos tea is the real authentic stuff straight from the slopes of the Cederberg Mountains in the Western Cape of South Africa . I researched and found out that if you want true genuine Rooibos tea , then make sure that it comes from that geographic region as it has the best climate to grow optimally . The taste is strong and flavorful although I would expect that not everyone would like this tea . However the benefits derived from drinking genuine Rooibos tea is amazing and that is exactly why I love this tea and continue to drink on a daily basis . The price is great too for being an authentic product imported from South Africa ! I highly recommend this product and its hands down the best brand that I 've found compared to other Rooibos tea brands . Here 's to your long health ! !
5 #### Love Rooibos tea . Great health benefits and this brand is less expensive than the last one I was using . Now if I could just keep my husband out of my tea ....
5 #### Came quickly ordered twice . This is the best honey we have ever eaten , I also gave some to friends and family so I will be ordering again .
5 #### Great raw honey . Although solid , it is easily spread .
5 #### I had rooibos red bush tea when I was in Tanzania . I love it . This is the same brand I bought in africa and a good price for so many tea bags .
5 #### This honey tastes really good , better than the liquid . At first I thought people were exaggerating , but it is better than the dark liquid honey . It 's nice and sweet . Honey is great for natural skin care . I use it sparingly in my face masks since I have oily skin . It is amazing and leaves skin nice and soft afterwards . Good for eating and skin care which is awesome ! And it 's certified organic , for the health conscious folks out there ...
5 #### I love this tea . Better price than Rooibos Rocks and I find it a little less astringent and very mellow . It is great hot or iced . I prefer to use 2 bags per 12 ounce cup , steep 10 - 15min or until cool . I love this tea and will definitely reorder . From what the other reviewers say , this is the genuine tea they drink in South Africa , no wonder it 's so good , glad Amazon carries it at a great price and with free prime shipping .
5 #### This is the best ORGANIC Raw honey ever ! It is nothing like " regular " honey . Once you try this you 'll never want the runny stuff ever again . The texture is smooth and " buttery " . The price is great too ! The first time I tried this was when we were in Las Vegas at Whole Foods and I thought hmmmm , I 've never even seen this kind of honey , so I bought it . After I got home from vacation I was bummed that I did n't buy more . I honestly ca n't believe I found it on Amazon ! I will definitely buy this again . Try it you 'll love it . I was able to find this at a local health foods store 1 1/2 hours away , but Amazon is closer and the same cost .
5 #### This is our favorite tea . It 's fantastic . We drink this daily . Either by itself or as a base with other teas . Great hot or cold . One bag makes a whole pot of tea .
5 #### More of a sugar taste than the syrup honey you get in stores .
5 #### I have been buying this brand of honey for months . I love the flavor and use it in my coffee along with coconut oil believe it or not . It is a good value and I researched a number of brands to see which natural one people preferred , and this one came out close to # 1 . I am quite happy with it .
3 #### Seller was fine and on time but I would never order it in a large jar again . Too solid and difficult to get out of jar after 1/3 down . Heating a jar that large is time consuming when you use it every day .
5 #### Was n't sure about this going in , but I was very pleasantly surprised . The first several cups brewed well , and my iced blend is perfect . It tastes fresh , good color , aroma , and flavor . No complaints .
5 #### Love this stuff . I had to give up coffee , so I tried lots of different herbal teas , and this is the closest thing as far as a satisfying taste . Hits the spot , and according to webmd , it 's even good for you !
5 #### We have now purchased four jars of this amazing honey ! ! Great taste , and better for you than what you can buy at the grocery store . We 'll buy more as needed in the future .
5 #### great deal- good quality product at a good price
5 #### Excellent product , have been using this honey for years . Very high quality , unheated and clean .
5 #### Great rooibos . Great price . I drink it every single night and will continue to purchase . Arrived Fresh and fast . Thanks !
5 #### Very , very good and this honey will be on my re- order list ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Excellent . It replaces the sugar in my coffee . So good .
5 #### One of the best tasting honey 's you can buy and its all organic . It ca n't get any better then this . Good for the cold season and it has lot of vitamins and nutrients .
5 #### Wife loves this and leaves the bag in ( she never leaves the black tea bags in because they get very bitter , she says ) . I think it tastes too much like earth or bark but it is her favorite tea ( after a few fancy Parisian Marriage Frere ones ) .
5 #### This was the first time I tried this tea . I like it a lot . Its really good with a little milk and honey . I even tried it with Coffee mate liquid creamer and that was yummy . i make this tea both hot and iced . Both ways its a nice tasty treat . The only down side is the bags do n't have a string attached , so you have to use a fork or spoon to get the bag out of your tea cup . Not a big deal , but wanted you to know .
4 #### Rooibos Tea is part of a collection of teas I keep around the house . This was my second or third box .
5 #### I love this tea . Healthy , and tasty . No caffeine .
5 #### Love this honey ! First bought it from Whole Foods and was happy that Amazon sold it at a little better price for a larger container . It is a very thick honey - almost solid ; but I love the creamy mild flavor in my coffee and tea .
5 #### Love eating ORGANIC raw honey and it makes me feel great throughout the day . It is thick but if you set it room temperature it pours out nicely and has a great taste !
5 #### Product as described will buy from again . Thank you
5 #### There are a lot of claims floating about on how this tea can help you lose weight . Well I can not say it has that impact but I began adding it to my morning tea in the morning and I have been able to stay active and go for long periods without getting hungry . I also take another herb that is supposed to do the same type of thing and so I can not say which one has the most impact or any impact at all . I always have been able to skip eating if I was busy and I have been busy so I can not say that buy this and you will experience magical things happen to you . But this brand costs very little and actually tastes very good . So I think if you are curious about this type of tea for the price it is not a great risk to try it . Plus it does have a pleasant taste so even if it does nothing for you , you get a nice drink . It does not come with a string so you end up fishing it out of your cup which is a minor annoyance but at this price well so be it .
5 #### I was pleasantly surprised to find that Freshpak Rooibos Tea could be bought in the USA as this is the exact package that I brought back with me when I visited friends in South Africa . I consider it as healthful as green tea . I do wish that it had tags , such as come with the Choice brand of Rooibos tea , but it is a small inconvenience .
5 #### If you like rooibos and hate tagged teas bags , this is the one for you , Good value and great - tasting herbal tea .
5 #### I have searched far and wide , did all the leg work for everyone . I can now tell all of you who are looking for the best closest 100 % certified organic non GMO honey this is the closest I have found . I will update if I find a better product . For now this is it . Sending all greenies a long , healthy , meaningful TRUE life .
5 #### This is the best flavored Rooibos tea . I love it !
5 #### The best Honey in the world was my second time I ordered this ! ! ! Good product
4 #### Very Good Tea , it has a good aroma and color to it . The taste is somewhat similar to sassafras tea , which is very good also .
5 #### I read something about red tea and the health benefits . So I decided to try this one . Excellent . The bags make a very strong cup of tea . For me I need no sugar with this one and sometimes just a squeeze of lemon . I drink at lest one cup a day
5 #### One thing I have missed moving to the states from South Africa was Freshpak tea . So happy to have found it on Amazon , only wish they sold more flavors . Recommend .
5 #### I hate herbal tea , not a single flavor appeals to me . So I 've been drinking green and black tea for years . I recently tried Tetley Red Bush tea in England and fell in love with the flavor . It does n't taste bland or sour . Upon reading reviews here I found FreshPak . So many positive feedbacks ! So I gave it a try . I have to say I am not disappointed . It tastes just as good as Red Bush . If you are not a fan of herbal tea and want to have an alt to your afternoon cream tea , give this a try . It 's supposed to be good for high blood pressure and some other health benefits .
5 #### I LOVE THIS HONEY AS A SPREAD ON BREAD , IN SMOOTHIES IN DESERTS AND IN DRINKS . MY GRANDDAUGHTER WANTS ME TO PURCHASE A JAR JUST FOR HER .
5 #### Bought this at our local organic food store and then found it on Amazon for about half the price ! This is the best raw honey we 've ever had ! Truly raw -- unlike so many that claim to be but it still looks just like ordinary translucent honey . This has that opaque , yellowish - golden color and tastes rich and so full of flavor ! Not to mention the health benefits of raw honey ! Highly recommend this -- the price is a steal !
5 #### This honey is so good , I would order it again .
3 #### I thought I could get more band for the buck with this product , but it turned out not to be so . This product is much weaker in taste and flavor than Davidson 's brand I have purchased before . I will not buy this product again . However if you do like a milder tea , you might not mind this .
5 #### The South African original . Naturally without caffeine , rich in anti - oxidants , and great taste . Do n't spoil it with vanilla and herb or fruit tea blends . Make it strong , and add a little milk , if you like .
5 #### My first time using red tea , came from a recommendation of a friend who likes different teas without the caffeine . After my first cup I 'm hooked and this will now be my standard .
5 #### Love this product . I am going to order a couple more . It does n't drip unless you heat it or keep it in a hot place . You can measure it out by the spoon and no drips . It is not messy , I love it . It is the only honey that tastes good in coffee ! I have it every morning with mine . Only one teaspoon does it . Less calories than sugar .
4 #### This honey is mild tasting and has a creamy texture . I use this honey everyday mixed with water and Braggs organic apple cider vinegar to help with joint pains . This drink seems to work for my joint pains and tastes good . The honey is top quality .
3 #### The product was delivered as described and in a timely manner . My rating is based on the product itself . I 've never had this type of tea before ; however , I am a huge tea fan . I do not care for the flavor or aroma of this tea .
5 #### I love this tea . It has a nice robust flavor that others seem to lack . I have tried other Rooibos teas and this is hands down my favorite .
5 #### Very good honey ! I 'm new at the raw honey thing ( used to buy in syrup form from grocery ) . This is so much better and better for you and i like that it is solid as i can easily use on pretzels and only get a small amount . Very sweet !
5 #### I am about to make my third order of this product . It is reasonably priced and I feel fortunate to have access to such a good product .
5 #### This is one of the smoothest tasting teas I 've tried . We first had it in South Africa , and I was worried I would n't be able to find it here in the U.S.
4 #### I enjoy this tea . Good value and was satisfied with the quick delivery . I have enjoyed at least one cup every day since receiving . I really enjoy the flavor .
5 #### I 'm so impressed with the claims that are made for Rooibos Tea . If one is drinking green or black tea ( which is actual tea , not to be confused with an infusion such as Rooibos ) , then this product should be considered to be plugged into your daily routine . Does it work ? Are the alleged health benefits true ? Check back with me in 30 years . Meanwhile , enjoy a unique flavor and take care of yourselves .
5 #### I have been sampling different Raw Organic Honeys but found this one to be the best all around , though spendy ( I buy the 2 - pak ) . I prefer that there is no plastic and the whole container can be reused or recycled .
5 #### thank You , for the fast delivery , see You soon again .
1 #### bogus claim - thought this was pure & have been paying a small fortune for it . I 've learned there 's no such thing as organic honey . it 's convoluted as w / everything . total ripoff . they must be laughing all th way to th bank . here 's a link 2 great details...http://livingmaxwell.com/organic-honey-certified
5 #### The only complaint I have about this is that it is n't more " liquidy " and when used in something cold , like iced tea , it does n't stir in well .... but , it is good ...
4 #### Distinctive flavor and holds up well when cut with a little more plain water . Figure on two cups of water per one bag of tea . I use a twelve cup coffee maker and put six bags in the grounds holder . Terrific ! ! !
5 #### I love this non - caffeinated tea . We drink it with sweetener and cream . Especially over the flavored versions that others provide ( e.g. mixed with vanilla , chai ) .
5 #### The iced tea maker runs all summer long and this is the tea of choice for the family : ten bags make a solid , tasty brew . I wish it came in the larger box -- the ones friends bring from South Africa !
5 #### I drink rooibos tea when I want the flavor of tea without the caffeine of regular tea . A cup while watching nighttime TV wo n't keep me awake for hours like regular tea does . I like it in the single - serving packs so I do n't get the flotsam from making it with a strainer . Although , really , I do n't object to tea flotsam if it does n't get between my teeth , since rooibos can have sharp little splinter - like bits , the bag is a real convenience .
5 #### This stuff is FANTASTIC ! Delicious with soy milk . Had this while I was visiting Johannesburg in October 2011 , and was hooked ever since .
3 #### Very expensive product and I do n't really see the purpose . Tastes fine , but I will stick to butter .
1 #### My star rating is not a reflection on the seller . They were fantastic and quick in processing my order . I am quite fond of rooibos tea from South Africa , which is the only location where GENUINE rooibos tea should come from , FYI . The brand , however , tastes crap . I 've gone through about 10 or 12 bags , hoping that it was a fluke . Sadly , it 's not . It does n't taste anything like any rooibos tea I 've ever had in my lifetime . In fact , I know this is marketed as the # 1 tea company in South Africa . Honestly , though , I had never heard of this brand . Twig and Ouhuis seemed to be pretty popular brands . Of course , most people in SA buy this tea loose . In terms of mass marketing , this would probably be on par with Red Rose brand tea here in the States in terms of quality . I hope this helps !
5 #### Best tasting honey I 've ever had . Plus it 's organic . Straight from the bees , into your mouth . Yum ! ! !
5 #### Yummy good ... so sweet .. It came in fast .. will never use sugar again
5 #### In the ' 70s there was an herbal tea that I really loved from South Africa , but then came the boycott of South African goods and I could never again find it . Recently I did some research and found that the tea was once again available ( though not by the brand name I knew ) by the actual name of the tea " Rooibos " . So I made an order through Amazon ... and although the shipping price is a bit high for something so light in weight , I ca n't complain because the tea is even better than I remember it . For those who are n't familiar with Rooibos Tea , it is very similar to good Black tea in flavor , minus the bitter after taste and minus the caffeine and tannic acid , but with the anti - oxidants and other GOOD stuff . Refreshing and delicious stuff !
5 #### This honey is absolutely amazing . I bought it based on the reviews , and I did not regret it . I will buy again once I run out .
4 #### Taste great . It 's really interesting to use this instead of sugar for the daily coffee .
4 #### I never seen honey come this hard , I put it on my coffee cup warmer for a couple of hours to thin it up and it 's fine now to squeeze into tea and stuff
5 #### I first started drinking Rooibois Tea in Zimbabwe in the 1980 's and amazing enough , it was Freshpak there also . This tea is even better for you then Green Tea and it is caffiene free . It taste very much like the regular orange and black pekoe tea . I love it and recommend it to any one . It was shipped immediately and that made me happy .
5 #### delicious , did not know what true honey tasted like until i bought this one.will never buy honey from a store again after tasting this one , from here on in its always going to be ys organic bee farm certified organic raw honey.yes there is a difference , a big difference so buy the best and go raw
5 #### These are great . Honest to God . GREAT Value for the money . Thanks Amazon .
5 #### What an awesome treat ! My first taste - I 'm in heaven ! Enjoying a small amount of this takes away my craving for other bad choices like , chips , chocolate and cookies - you know the three C 's . I love real maple sugar candy and this is as close to that consistency as I could find . Thank you clever bees for making the world 's perfect food ! I 'll be back again and again for more !
5 #### I eat a tablespoon of this on toast every morning of my life and since I 've been doing it I have not been sick with a cold ... six years now . I take a Kyolic a GNC garlic pill everyday too . Two great natural germ and virus killers .
5 #### Awesome ! It 's the word I can find most appropriate for this stuff .
5 #### After tasting this honey , my husband asked me to never again buy " that other stuff posing as honey " at our grocery store ! I was worried this would be too thick or crystalized for baking , but it 's soft enough to scoop out and measure . Tastes fabulous in tea . The only kind of honey we 'll use from now on .
5 #### My grandchildren and I love the taste of this honey . I always order the biggest jar . You ca n't beat it on good bread with peanut or almond butter . I also put it on cuts and insect bites where is can help to soothe the sting and heal the sore . I also appreciate that comes in a glass jar rather than plastic . A great product .
5 #### I will never purchase that cheap watered down clear " honey " from the grocery store again . This stuff is THE BEST , it tastes so much different in a much better way and has a different consistency than that other stuff they claim to be honey . I will be stocking up on this stuff for sure .
5 #### I 've ordered this honey prior great thick organic honey
4 #### Was very raw and thick and did n't easily dissolve in hot water took a lot of turns in the cup and sticky when measuring , but a very good taste .
5 #### I love the taste of this honey . It reminds me of when my father would bring home local honeycombs and we 'd have just a little bit ! Be advised that it 's thick and does not mix well with other things other than hot foods / beverages . I love it on toasted Ezekiel sprouted breads with a little almond butter or peanut butter , or melted in my Teecino beverages . It is very sweet , so you only need a little .
5 #### I have an APO address because I live in Korea and the product got to me in a very reasonable time . I am very pleased .
5 #### I have never had honey that tastes this good . I temporarily held off on a reorder because it gets used fairly quick . I am the only user & its hard to resist . If you like or use any honey your consumption will increase ! I think the odds it does not are not in your favor . LOL
5 #### This is without a doubt the most amazing honey available . It is ultrasweet , smooth and glides on toast or anything else . I LOVE this stuff and be forewarned it can be addicting ! It 's that good ! I sometimes just take a small knife and dip it right out of the jar so I can savor it 's flavor . It 's definitely a winner !
5 #### Best tasting and sweetest honey . Much better than wildflower honey . It 's quite thick but I do n't see that as a drawback . It 's delicious in recipes and you do n't need a lot to sweeten .
5 #### There is n't too much more I can say besides the fact that I love this honey ! It is organic and raw , two of the most important aspects for me ! Give it a try ! It is worth the price !
5 #### Love this honey , it is really yummy and one of the best I 've every tried . i will keep on purchasing it and would definitely recommend !
5 #### I really liked the taste and texture of this stuff . I 'll order more soon . It 's much better tasting than regular old store bought honey .
5 #### I have tried a lot of different honeys . I guess I would say I am a honey connoisseur . This honey is smooth and almost creamy . It is a bit pricey so I only use it for gourmet recipes and health care products but it works well . Good sturdy jar and it tastes pure and unprocessed .
5 #### This is an excellent product . The honey is smooth and tasty and if there is a drawback it is that the honey is solid - not crystallized but more like smooth butter . I really did n't mind so for me it was everything I was looking for . The price was reasonable the packaging adequate and delivered on time .
5 #### Love this honey . Will only buy raw honey now . Has a distinct flavor and use it for tea and coffee mostly . But tastes good on just about anything .
5 #### This honey is certified organic and raw ( important if you want the health benefits ) . The taste is lovely - so good I ate it directly out of the jar .
4 #### we are big honey lovers and was on the lookout for a good raw / organic honey and found this on amazon . It is a good product and the honey tastes good as well . Have been using it for over a year now .
5 #### Excellent quality honey ca n't beat the flavor . I am going to purchase at least 3 jars xtime I will recommend this to all of my friends
5 #### I love it and use it to sweeten my ACV mixture and use it in coffee sometimes and other things to help me to get away from sugar and definitely high fructose corn syrup !
3 #### Good product , good price , grandkids like it and I always have it on hand ! nice on waffles and toast and pancakes ,
5 #### I love this honey . I use it with everything . It 's flavor in very nice and is mild . some so called honey I have bought has a nasty bite . This does not . I liked it so much that I recently bought 2 jars !
5 #### The only honey that I consume now that I have had a taste of it . Good in tea or coffee also . Would recommend this product to all those who love honey .
5 #### Use in my baking , and frosting for my cinnamon rolls , my lactation cookies , my hair for deep conditioning , and my face to treat acne . ( day 4 and irritation is calming down and pores are getting smaller ) Its all around good uses , My son got a nasty big bite that looked like it was getting infected and IK put some honey on it with put a bandage and its starting to heal . LOVE THIS STUFF . I 'm not even half way done and I use ALLOT of it in almost EVERYTHING .
5 #### To try and stop eating artificial sweeteners I thought I would try adding honey to a lot of things . It 's great on toast , pancakes . An equal part of organic honey and organic coconut oil makes a great lip scrub . I am experimenting putting in lots of things . I would recommend this product .
5 #### How can one argue with raw honey versus heated and treated and who knows what is done to it honey ? Besides , it tastes great and I do n't have that sugar like feeling after eating it versus the non - raw honey .
5 #### I love this honey . I like the glass jar it comes in . and the flavor is so good , not your honey you get in supermarkets . This honey has all the nutrients and vitamins in it .
5 #### It 's addictive ! ! ! One little bit on anything will get you hooked ! This bears no relationship to processed honey at all and is actually solid at room temperature . Not to worry , though . If you want it in liquid form , just heat it slightly in the nuke oven . It is absolutely the best tasting honey I have ever had .
5 #### Wonderful ! Just what I needed . Even better than the last brand . The large jar will last a long time . Thank you , YS Organic Bee Farms !
5 #### It is very sweet . I usually use one teaspoon for my large 3 cups coffee and it is still very sweet . Regarding to the health benefits , yet to be seen .
5 #### Best raw honey I 've ever had and has a great flavor . Will definitely buy this product again . Will put it with my other subscription and save items .
5 #### I use for over two years - consistently good . Mostly used in breakfast organic oat meals , and in pancakes . Highly recommended
5 #### This is the best honey I have ever tasted . I do n't like the jars of honey that are runny that you buy in the grocery store . They have an unwanted taste to them . But this organic honey is solid and boy does it taste good ! So sweet . I put a spoonful in my coffee and it melts right in . Nice product !
3 #### Great honey but it 's not local to my area so it does n't provide the health / anti - allergy benefits that I need . Tasty though .
5 #### I purchased this honey when I could n't get any local raw honey . It has an amazing taste and mixes so well in my tea and yogurt . I have even eaten it by the spoonful when I had a sugar craving ( not the best or healthiest choices but far better than eating a candy bar IMO ) . It is thick and creamy and can be somewhat difficult to get out of the jar on cooler days . I have found letting it sit in warm water is the key to softening it .
4 #### My favorite raw honey . Glass jars are always a preference for food items . Not as costly as some other brands of raw honey .
5 #### You do n't pour or squeeze this honey out , you have to get it out with a spoon . Tastes great but has caused me no weight gain whatsoever , and usually I have had up to 4 tbsp . a day of it . ( The rest of my diet is very healthy , do n't know what the result would be with junky things . ) Keeps my blood sugar steady without adding pounds .
5 #### Being on the Paleo now , I needed a guilt - free outlet to get my sweet tooth on ! This is great tasting honey ! Will be ordering more very soon ! I 've cooked with it , and eaten it raw .... both great options !
4 #### Arrived in very good condition . Well packed and beautiful consistency . Ca n't wait to try it out but have other honey to use be for I open this one .
5 #### Taste and texture are super ... I ca n't help myself , I keep reordering ! I am on a paleo diet and this Honey is a welcome sweetner . ... Dave Update been Vegan for over a year , and still the best honey I have ever had ... Dave
5 #### Wow , well do I start . I guess all I can really say is that I 'm in love this honey . Also , I was actually surprised by the size when I got it . I did n't exepct to get so much due to the reasonable price . I will be reordering again so that I have jars in my cabinet LOL . I do n't want to run out . By the way , it makes even the most bitter of coffees taste amazingly sweet and delicious .
5 #### I have used this brand of Organic , Raw Honey for years and love it . You can not go wrong with ..... beware of brands that misrepresent their ingredients . This is the real thing . :)
5 #### Ca n't buy enough of this . The family eats it up too fast . It 's the best Honey I 've had in years . We can only get Honey of this quality around here in season , but in off - season , this is equal . I wanna just snuggle some of those hard working Bees . Ouch .
5 #### I love the organic part , the raw part , the size , the fact that it helps with intestinal flora , it sweetens well and tastes great .
5 #### What can I say except " Great ! " ? Organic , tastes great , helps with my food digestion and restoring flora . I love it .
5 #### This is my honey ! And , I am not always a honey kind of gal . It is organic , raw , delicious and has made a lot of people happy when given as a gift .
5 #### This is my favorite honey in the world ! I use it for everything and love to eat it off the spoon too . It is delicious and full of goodness .
4 #### I used to buy " Really Raw " honey , but this brand is cheaper and tastes pretty much the same . I do n't use processed sugars anymore .
5 #### I used this to rid my family of flu symptoms . I mixed it with Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea , Black Cherry Berrry and 1 tablespoon cocoa . Besides being delicious , it stopped the fever and the illness immediately ..
5 #### It comes in GLASS --- a plus for me . It is also in a solid form , excellent flavor . This is the one to buy !
5 #### Excellent product . This is true honey a must buy for anyone seeking true honey . I will purchase once I 'm finished with my jars .
5 #### Best Raw Honey Ever- I always buy this brand . I will never go back to " just honey " again . It is hard getting out the jar , but it is worth the trouble ! I got 3 of the 2 lb for $ 40 - you ca n't beat the price $ 14 each It is more cost effective to buy the 32 oz rather than the 2 for $ 36 . The price stays @ $ 4.95 no matter how many you buy from Vitacost ( 32 oz ) as opposed to American Nutrition Store ( 2 for $ 36 free shipping ) Both brands are NOT Amazon Prime eligible , thus it take time to deliver- my VitaCost too 3 - 4 days to ship . Prices can always vary in the Amazon Market Place
5 #### this is as good as raw honey gets . I do n't know how anyone could eat non - raw honey after this tasty stuff .
5 #### This Honey is awesome . I have been using it for about 2 years as of this post . It is sweet and satisfying . You do n't need to use very much and then your craving is filled . I am not a doctor but I have heard from reliable sources that unfiltered raw Honey helps reduce seasonal allergies due to yourbody getting some of the pollen that the bees have on them and then they put it in the honey . That pollen in the honey is like a healthy way to train your body how to fight the pollen . I have been doing many things to be more healthy in in the last 8 years but I can confidently say that I have not had any allery responses in more that 2 years . Even the year before I used this honey I had almost no allergies due to being more healthy , Now I have not had ANY allergy response for 2 or mroe years .
5 #### I love this product . It is rich tasting , and full of healthy goodness . It is USDA Certified Organic so you do n't have to worry about pesticide contamination or any of the nasty HFC ( High Fructose Corn Syrup } that most other ' honey ' is polluted with . This is pure raw honey with all the goodness you would expect from a great natural product . I use it to sweeten my coffee / tea , put on toast or bagels , sweeten oat meal ... etc . etc . It might just be the worlds most perfect food .
3 #### Love the all natural organic source . Product was totally congealed though which makes it hard to work with . Have to spoon out what I want to use and microwave to get it liquid . Not the healthiest thing to do but soaking jar in warm water takes to long . Otherwise great .
5 #### The YS Organic Honey is simply delicious . I 've tried a handful of other organic honeys & this one is by far my favorite . The flavor is rich & creamy with a smooth , balanced & lingering aftertaste . Great for cooking because it does n't have the strong floral or citrus characteristics . that many honeys contain . I use it often & whenever possible !
5 #### Honey is expensive . This is a good buy . You must understand that it 's content is very hard and must be melted in tea , etc . Very good tasting .
5 #### This is very good honey , best I ever tasted ! the honey is soft and even texture and easy to scoop out with wide knife or sharp spoon .
5 #### OMG , I can not say enough about this honey ! it is Sooo Goood ! I will never go back to buying from supermarket .
5 #### The Best honey yet for the price . I was using the store brand liquid honey . My daughter said " since it 's only you , why not buy Organic Honey " I said why not for this price . I have purchased this honey for about two years . The taste is great in my coffee !
5 #### I COULD NOT BELIEVE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE TASTE OF THIS HONEY AND OTHERS I HAVE PURCHASED LOCALLY . IT IS TERRIFIC IN TEA AND EVEN MELTED INTO HOT CEREAL . YOU ONLY NEED A SMALL AMOUNT . THEY HAVE A RETURN CUSTOMER IN ME
5 #### We adore this product . It is smooth , it is comforting to the throat ( in tea ) , and it is easy to use , since it is spooned right out of the jar . Tastes great , too .
5 #### Raw honey is the only honey I buy . You just ca n't say enoug good things about it . Besides being used as a sweetner , raw honey has lot of other health benegits too . You can use raw honey for first aid to treat cuts and burns and raw honey is a staple in any panty especially if you are preparing for challenging times . I just ca n't seem to keep senoug on hand .
5 #### This is the second batch and the outside had just begun to crystallize , but except for the outer most layer , it was milk and creamy , the best brand so far ( besides our local honey ) I ordered the 1 lb before and there were NO signs of crystallizing . never had any ferment by this brand so far ..
5 #### This is the best tasting honey I 've had since I was a kid . Raw honey has anti - viral , anti - bacterial , and anti - fungal properties . It promotes body and digestive health , is a powerful antioxidant , strengthens the immune system , eliminates allergies , and is an excellent remedy for skin wounds and all types of infections . Raw honey 's benefits do n't stop there . Raw honey can also stabilize blood pressure , balance sugar levels , relieve pain , calm nerves , and it has been used to treat ulcers . Raw honey is also an expectorant and anti - inflammatory and has been known to effectively treat respiratory conditions such as bronchitis and asthma . GO ORGANIC !
3 #### Very expensive honey that is truly the best tasting honey we have tried . Unfortunately , it constantly crystallizes even after a warm water soak . We have gone back to other brands of wild , raw honey that pour easily without the effort of soaking in warm water bath to , pour .
5 #### i enjoy honey drinks over winter . this is by far the best i ever tasted . i will be a repeat customer
5 #### I love the way the honey improves the taste of my tea . I also find that it helps me feel better .
2 #### I was disappointed with the honey . It is nowhere near raw honey as the seller depicts . I could n't figure out what it was . All I can say is it has additives .
5 #### Super good honey ... tastes fantastic ... I like to purchase honey from different areas ... Texas , Arkansas , Idaho , Canada , etc ... this particular honey is very delicious ... would buy again !
5 #### This stuff is to die for . It 's a very different consistency , color , and flavor from the honeys I 've grown up with . Some might find that a little off - putting at first , but trust me : It 's delicious .
5 #### I LOVE THIS STUFF ! It seemed costly , but , I am so glad I tried it . It is a firm form of the tastiest honey I have ever had . I spoon it right out of the jar and into my mouth . If you need it to be softer you just warm it up . It 's not crystalized like when honey sits for too long . This is smooth and has a creamy feel in the mouth . It melts quickly in my tea and the smell is divine . Highly recommended !
5 #### This is great honey - very nice flavor , very mild , great to use in baking , on rice cakes , in coffee or tea ... all around great organic honey ... I put the jar in the microwave to make it more runny , because it does n't come that way . If you are going to put in tea or coffee , or spread on rice cakes , its fine as it is - but need to make it runny if you are going to bake with it , so you can pour into a measuring cup ...
5 #### We really like this product . We 've reordered for ourselves and given this honey as a gifts and it is ALWAYS well received .
5 #### I came back to order this a second time . This honey is thick , unlike the syrup honey in the store . I add this to oatmeal , with organic coconut and cinnamon . I have no problems with energy . I am 54 and have healed acne , infected eye and an infected toe . Honey is antimicrobial and that is wonderful . Put it on sores , scrapes , whatever and it will begin healing over night , seriously . It seems to be a natural band aid . I am waiting on cholesterol numbers and I really am curious about this . IMO you ca n't go wrong .
5 #### I like it . The price is good and the quality of the honey seems to be good for a raw organic honey .
5 #### Have rated this before and will continue to say that i love this product ; texture and taste . i buy the large size . Take a spoon full every night . Have very few colds and even my lousy stomach seems better !
5 #### Great product especially for vegans , great foe healing cuts and burns?easy to store . Just keep out of heat and light no refrigeration requmired
5 #### Great , on my third jar . Great taste . Have nt had such good tasting honey in a long time . It always comes before they say
5 #### Very delicious and different from the store bought honey I 've been used to my whole life . It is solid but not crystalized in the way that store bought honey gets after awhile , more like a type of butter . It spreads easy and this is better I think because there is less of a mess than dealing with a liquid . They wrapped it 3x thick in bubble wrap , I guess from after all the responses of broken bottles lol .
5 #### very easy to get out of jar , delicious in taste and priced right ! I like it thicker like this for easy spreading !
5 #### This honey is the best thing I 've ever tasted in my entire life , I am actually addicted to it , and ca n't stop my self from getting a spoon fool of it . I think my body is craving it because I have crohns disease and my body needs all the good stuff it has in it , and or I have anemia . I try to stop my self from eating more because i want to save money but I ca n't this honey is like heaven . So go ahead and buy it , but if you want to avoid the addiction , I suggest not . God bless this honey .
5 #### I love this honey ... perfect consistency to pair with butter , peanut butter , sunbutter . keep it in the frig if your house gets at all hot .
5 #### This honey is the best . You do n't use as much because its so concentrated . I originally bought one of these by mistake . Now its the only kind of honey I use . I would recommend this to anyone who loves raw honey .
3 #### There 's nothing terribly special about this honey . By the description on the side of the jar you 'd think this was manna from heaven . You can tell it 's honey and not sugar , but it has none of the lovely subtle flavours I was expecting from a a jar that says ' We have searched the world and traveled thousands of miles to find the perfect isolated , untouched areas where nature is abundant with wildflowers that flourish in the undisturbed frontier wilderness . ' etc ect . I used to get big 5 kg tubs of raw honey from a local beekeeper , it was oh so much more flavorful than this stuff , their clover honey was like nibbling on clover blossoms and their wildflower was as unpredictable as wildflowers are , but always something fresh and fruity and floral and wonderful , but I 've since moved away ... I thought this would be a good replacement , but alas , I will have to go searching and see if I can find a farmer 's market nearby . If you 're coming from the perspective of using the honey flavoured corn syrup often sold as honey in supermarkets , you 'll find this delightful . Just know that there is much , much better out there .
5 #### It was ... different . I am sp used to processed foods it actually tasted quite odd . I like it though , I used it for my homemade cinnamon - rolls yesterday and they came out so mouth - watering delicious . I also Used it in my hair this morning along with hot oil to condition my hair & my hair is sooooooo soft . I have very dry curly hair and it brought the bounce and shine back into my curls ! ! :) NO COMPLAINTS ! !
5 #### I call this happiness in a jar . Okay it 's not 100 % raw like from a honeycomb , but its not bad either . Also , raw honey is a much better alternative than ' healthier processed ' sweeteners like xylitol and stevia .
5 #### I can not believe how good this honey is , the taste is addicting . I bought it because it is unprocessed and it 's real hard to find honey here in Florida . I really do n't eat much honey normally , but I have already ordered another one .
5 #### For the past 4 months I have been eating healthy . Everything from having no artificial sweeteners to recording every calorie and nutrient I eat . After doing hours of research I came to the conclusion all natural honey needed to be introduced to my diet . I was very impressed ! ! ! I typically make a fresh ground almond butter sandwich add bananas , and this honey and it tastes great ! Taste : AMAZING Price : Not bad , because it lasts a LONG LONG time . You wo n't use much at a time . Health : VERY GOOD FOR YOU Overall , I would but it again !
5 #### It look high quality product . The consistency and taste are perfect , and the glass container add better conservation . Thanks a lot .
5 #### Thank God the honey bees are still around . The chemical companies want them all dead . This bee product is very , very good , I have been buying their product for many years . If they could only talk !
5 #### Tasty and healthy ! I am glad I chose this brand . You ca n't go wrong with this great bargain and excellent taste .
4 #### I tried both ys organic bee farms raw honey . The certified organic and the other non certified version . This honey has good flavor but i find the texture is a bit too hard . This version comes in a glass jar . The other version comes in a plastic jar . The other version is a better texture and flavor in my opinion . The other version has a slightly more intense honey flavor at least over the processed kind . The 22 oz version is my pick between the two
1 #### First let me just say .. I thought about this before I wrote this review , after taking things into consideration I decided since my satisfaction was a total disregard in the first place I think I should warn people prior to their purchase . when I received my package EVERYTHING in the box was dripping in honey & might I add ( ( NOT CHEAP ) ) honey at that ! ! I bought 2 jars of this honey & they were both destroyed when they came . The boxes of Tea I purchased were also in the box with the jars & were sloshing in the broken glass jars of honey as well .. Why buy glass jars of anything if it comes busted ? ? ? I have purchased many items on Amazon that were glass & always they were wrapped specially for protection against the rough treatments in transit . This time however ? it was rolling around loose DUH ! ! ! ! you do NOT insert 2 glass jars together in a big box & expect them to arrive in tact I mean how dumb ! ! ! it was so gross I could n't salvage anything but the honey soaked tea boxes . Needless to say I wo n't be buying from this company again , I know who I can safely buy from .. those sellers that take extra care in the shipping process . OUT $ 45.57 & one BIG FAT STICKY MESS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
1 #### Honey is a good wholesome food , problem is if its shipped in glass , its bound to get broke , which it was , so naturally i hate to waste any thing , i heated it up filtered the glass out of it , but i know it now was just like store bought , had to heat it , , , ,
4 #### I really like this honey and the flavor it adds to my teas . I will definitely purchase this product again .
5 #### I have been reading about the health benefits of raw honey . My father has cancer , so I ordered this mostly for him . He likes the taste of it very much - he mixes it in his coffee ! This honey tastes great , and I am very pleased with it .
5 #### This has a taste so much better than the syrup in stores ... with the crisis in Momsanto killing the bee population , I Am rationing this .. so much healthier than ant sweeteners and artificial sweeteners are just plain dangerous . Packing is fantastic and shipping very fast . Love it !
5 #### This is exactly .... the stuff I 'd make .... beelicious . Sorry , I could n't resist .... This stuff is thick , spreadable , and does n't drip like ordinary honey most everyone is used to . The taste is that of the best honey you ever ate . I use it most frequently in tea and my morning coffee ... wonderful .
5 #### I 'm trying this because I heard many good things about organic raw honey . I try to have a spoonful each day , though I 'm bad about keeping to that . It does smell kind of weird , but it tastes great .
5 #### The best ! ! One tablespoon of Organic Bee Honey and one tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter starts my day with sufficient protein and nutrients to tide me over for breakfast . Soooo good ! .
5 #### I will buy nothing but raw honey . This brand is very good ! ! It is very difficult not to eat spoonful 's ! * I take a spoonful before bed and it actually helps me to sleep better . * Put honey on a cut and it WILL heal faster ! * GREAT for skin . Either water it down to be thinner to wash your face with or put honey on your face as a facial . Once the honey has set on your skin for about 10 minutes , press your fingers ( flattened hand ) against the honey and pull . Yes , sticky . Do this for several minutes all over your face . It helps to pull toxins out of your skin and stimulates blood flow . Your skin is left sparkling clean . * Raw honey has antibiotic properties which is why they say to put honey in warm water and sip . It helps coat the throat and reduce irritation . * For blocked sinuses , mix a teaspoon or so in a pot of hot water and then put the towel over your head and inhale the steam . Again , the antibiotic properties help with a sinus infection . * To treat allergies the honey should be local so the bees have made the honey from the local pollen . * A spoonful ( ok , a heaping spoonful ) in my coffee or tea gets a burst of energy . I love the texture , I love the taste . Absolutely night and day from processed honey .
5 #### I had not recently tried organic raw honey so I was not sure what to expect , regardless , I did not expect this . The taste is unbelievable , sweet yet not cloying- nothing else tastes quite like it . The texture is also a nice surprise in that it 's slightly creamy but with more body and texture than a typical processed spread like Nutella . Take a piece of high quality dense bread like Ezekiel bread , lightly toast it to bring out the nuttiness , then liberally apply a swab of raw honey to make a little piece of heaven on earth- delicious !
5 #### This product is far better than any other store bought product I ever bought or seen . It being organic and raw means it is better fot you .
5 #### I 've always had that liquid , gooey golden brown honey , even fresh off the combs from a friend whose relatives did beekeeping . This however , is by far the best I 've had . It 's slightly floral and to me a tiny bit of spice . It 's great in sweetening desserts too .
5 #### I think we will be buying this again . There is a local man who made as good if not better honey but he has passed on as far as we know . We taste test honey often . I like it in my tea and my husband likes his on bread .
5 #### It has a very light , delicate taste and goes wonderfully in most drinks . It does not go with everything , of course , but as far as honeys go this is a very solid all - around performer , right up there with fireweed , orange blossom , acacia , and southwest desert wildflower .
5 #### Great value for the quality and price ! I 've had a lot of raw honey and this one is fabulous ! ! Well worth the purchase .
5 #### I have never been a fan of brown honey , but this honey is awesome . The taste and texture is worlds apart from regular brown honey . It 's also very nutritious . Who knew honey is also a prebiotic ! This is the only honey I will buy now . Highly recommend !
5 #### Warnings should come with this . sooooo good . If you like spun honey , you"ll love this . I use a bit in my tea and on a biscuit or fresh baked bread is the best .
5 #### Great stuff ! I love the taste and the health benefits of raw honey . A side advantage is less sticky mess . Very easy to spoon into your tea with no sticky drips ! Rather expensive , but a large container that should go a long way .
5 #### Excellent quality . it 's nice for baking to have it in a solid form ! did not last long in our house . We were finding any excuse to use it .
5 #### As the honey goes this is great stuff , started eating this stuff a while back and it 's a great way to sweeten tea and avoid table sugar and fructose .
5 #### This is an excellent product , and value . The quality is superb , and I think it is a honey lovers delight . Great in coffee with KAL stevia as well . I just finished my morning cup . M - m - m - m - m , good !
5 #### Product is excellent and worth the purchase . My wife and I enjoy its delicious taste and healthful benefit . We will continue to use it in the future .
5 #### I never knew how good this organic honey would be ..... it is so much better than the store bought stuff . And just imagine the good stuff it dies for your body !
5 #### This has to be the best tasting honey on the market in my humble opinion . Use it in my coffee and it melts right away . Gives the coffee a taste like none other . It comes in the hardened state but like I said with the coffee I use it in it melts easily . Or either put the jar in warm water to melt it .
5 #### The packaging is exactly as it appears in the photo . It 's delicious and smooth . I add it to spaghetti sauce instead of sugar to cut the acidity and it add a level of complexity I 've never experienced . Definitely ordering this again .
5 #### I have tried many organic raw honeys that are much more expensive , but this one a the winner . Tastes great with cream like texture and health benefits .
5 #### I take a spoonful in the am and pm . I 'm a hot sleeper and this regulates my metabolism wonderfully . Highly recommend this .
5 #### I love honey , and this is no exception . The flavor is good , with a mellowness that highlights the organic nature of the product . The honey is thick and fairly hard in the jar , but melts rapidly in tea or on toast .
5 #### This stuff is the sweetest honey I 've ever tasted . Rich and delicious - I highly recommend this to honey lovers .
5 #### I had to find a sweetener replacement because agave syrup gave me carb - reactive hypoglycemia and blood sugar issues . This honey is - delectable . I use it : - for raw chocolate syrup - 1 part raw dark cocoa powder , 1 part raw coconut oil or cocoa butter , 1/2 part honey ( or to taste ) - for healing honey - warm water , a bit of lemon and 1/2 tsp of this honey a day for body - healing properties - for cinnamon toast - spread this plus sprinkled cinnamon over gluten - free bread All in all , I will for SURE be a regular and buy this again when I run out . NOTE : the top of my honey looked white , maybe from oxidation on the top layer or moisture in the honey top layer . But it tasted Fine ! Yum yum !
5 #### Not just good but great ! ! Taste is superb ! It seems to go a lot further than store brands , but the TASTE far outweighs that of the little bear ! ! ! !
5 #### Very good taste and healthy unprocessed raw honey from YS Organic Bee Farms . There are maybe better honey like Manuka honey , but the are super expensive , like $ 40 for 8 ounce ? Crazy . This YS honey is almost as good as Manuka honey but at a very reasonable price , the best quality and value I can find nowadays , thanks to Amazon and YS bee farms .
5 #### A tasty , healthy spread : Combine 1/2 cup of YS Organic Honey with 1/3 cup extra virgin coconut oil * ( add a teaspoon of organic lemon oil or orange oil for fruit flavoring if desired ) . Both honey and coconut oil should be cool but not cold for easiest mixing . * Try Garden of Life Extra Virgin Coconut Oil ( sold in glass jars ) .
5 #### I 'm usually very wary of products that get really good reviews from people I do n't know . Well , I bought this anyway . And the reviews were spot dead - on ! This is a very delicious product , as sweet as I wanted it to be , no more . I understood that it was fresh from a beehive , so I did n't expect it to be anything but that . And that 's exactly that is what it is . Very , very , very good . I 'm usually stingy with superlatives , but this time , I 'll give it a 5 star and three verys . It 's that good . When I 'm done ( it will be a while ) I 'll order it again . And then again . And husband loves it too , and wants biscuits NOW .
5 #### This is the best honey we have ever had . It has the bees wax on top to seal the honey and to eat a scoop of the wax with the honey is so good . Love this stuff ! ! !
5 #### I have always enjoyed this product and Amazon has the best price ! I recommend this product to anyone who uses honey . I use it in my tea several times a day . It 's delicious !
1 #### i always buy my raw honey at whole foods . but i decided to try something different and get more for my money . i have to say this is the worst tasting honey that i have ever had . it is sweet but it just tastes bad . even the color is off . when you buy high quality honey , it should be alive in a golden colour and this honey is very ull looking . do not buy it . stick to whole foods !
5 #### This is definitely different ( even though the packaging looks similar ) to the other honey I have bought&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Y - S - Eco - Bee - Farms - Raw - Honey-22 - oz / dp / B000Z93FQC / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Y.S. Eco Bee Farms Raw Honey - 22 oz</a > . This honey is a whole food and avoids all of the processes that are involved with making that other honey that is available on the grocers shelves . I love the raw ( spun ) kind of honey . The thickness and the taste of flowers ( you can get an idea of what types of flowers the bees visited ) give this particular brand a light , floral taste . My bottle had a crystallized layer at the top that was almost waxy . This added to the flavor and texture and was not a problem . As others have mentioned , this can be softened by placing the bottle in hot water . I find that this honey is great on my Udi 's GF bread as toast&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Udi - s - Gluten - Free - Whole - Grain - Bread-1 - Case / dp / B0049OPXP0 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Udi 's Gluten Free Whole Grain Bread ( 1 Case)</a > . A spoonful of the honey is great for the throat and just feels good . Love it .
5 #### love this product . great texture and taste . organic is always the way to go . will continue to reorder as needed
4 #### Its a good honey . I personally like manuka . The taste or smell is a little funky . Overall it does the job . ( I love it in coffee in the morning )
5 #### A little bit of this honey goes a long way for me . It 's very sweet therefore very economical for me :) It tastes so pure !
5 #### This honey is great , I mean really really great . Initially I was liking more the Hawaiian white honey , another great honey but now my taste is leaning towards this one ... My kids love it too . If you can get the jars unbroken because of very poor packaging , it 's very very worthy
5 #### Truly wonderful product ! The best honey I 've ever eaten ! ! ! Can tell its pure n natural . Not burning sweet as other brands are . Does not cause a toothache , neither leaves residual after - taste , as many honeys that I 've tried did ... Highly recommend to everyone ! Arrived in 2 days ( regular shipping ! ) , well packed / undamaged .
5 #### What can I say bad about this honey ? Nothing ! ! ! I even wonder if it 's just raw honey at all ! It is very thick , sweet , and creamy ! I only use it for tea but when I did my YouTube review I tasted it and boy why did I do that ? ? ? ? ? It is YUMMY ! ! Check out my YouTube review to get my full opinion and reaction ! [ ... ]
5 #### There is double the taste when you get the organic honey . I ate one pound in a month just in my coffees . Very cheap if you look around .
5 #### I still have n't figured out what makes this honey the color and consistency that it is .. I buy local honey but wanted to try this .. I love the flavor and fact that it 's not filtered in any way .. Do n't think it has quite the taste as my local raw honey though .. May purchase again ..
5 #### This honey has an excellent flavor , especially after i set it in warm tap water ( 100 - 110 degrees F ) for about an hour to get it real creamy . The sweetness is perfect , the creamy body is just right and it just has a downright nice " honey taste " . The creamy honey is far better than the raw , organic honey that can crystalize after sitting for a long while , which has a grainy texture I do n't care for .
5 #### I use this product daily in my smoothie and have ordered in three times . Fresh made almond milk , cacao powder , honey , banana and amazing grass .... love it . I will always look to order this honey !
5 #### So smooth and creamy and sweet ! Fast shipping too . I use it for everything such as tea and oatmeal and tastes great in greek yogurt too !
4 #### This is a nice product that tastes as expected . I am glad to find organic honey in a GLASS container so I can avoid anything that might leach out of plastics . Thanks for offering this product . * * * UPDATE * * * 2/18/13 Now that I 've used this up , I do n't think I 'll repurchase . The quality is great , but raw honey is so difficult to use in the Pac . NW ( especially in winter ) as it hardens . This jar is so huge it 's difficult to get the last few ounces out of the bottom of the jar . I have to melt it in a dish to be able to use it for anything anyway . I 'll continue to purchase raw honey , I 'll just be finding a smaller container so it is easier to access the product .
5 #### This is so much easier to spread on toast etc . and it does n't seem as sweet as regular honey . I do have a problem with the price as it is much more expensive than the more liquid honey . I bought 2 jars which will last a long time and probably wo n't buy more due to the cost . It really is good though .
5 #### this stuff is the best honey ever . Unprocessed honey is the only way to go , buy this stuff its great !
4 #### I was honestly disappointed when I first tasted this honey . From reading the other reviews , I ordered it in anticipation of tasting something that I 've never tasted before , something unlike the flavor of any honey I grew up with . I wanted to finally understand why Winnie the Pooh goes bonkers for honey ... Unfortunately , while this is a good honey , it is basically a crystallized unprocessed honey with nice smoother creamed texture than typical aged granular honey . While it is marginally better than store - bought processed honey with flatter flavor and caramelized stronger aftertaste , it ultimately left me wondering " What 's the big deal ? " The Y.S. Organic raw honey is a product of Brazil & Canada , and it 's worth a try if you 've never tasted raw unfiltered honey before . However , I recommend that you lookout for fresh unprocessed honey from your local bee farmers instead , which may also help you ward off allergy symptoms to your local allergens . Those will taste more like the popular Honey Spoons candy ( sold at Cracker Barrel ) without the distinct complex flavor of aged crystallized honey which is what this honey ultimately tastes like . Many may prefer creamed aged honey , but I personally prefer the taste of fresh liquid raw honey .
5 #### I have MS and have done research on different foods . One food was raw honey . This is GOOD honey . It tastes good and I got it for a good price from Amazon.com . It was packed well in a box and in bubble wrap . I think personally it tastes better than honey you might find in regular stores and its better for you . I appearantly helps boost your immune system . It goes very well with Red Rose Tea and other teas as well . I recommend it for anyone , especially for health conscience consumers .
5 #### I 've had a lot of different kinds of honey , and this is one of the best . The quality of taste is amazing . I use it in my teas all the time and take a teaspoonful for sore throat . My daughter has asthma and takes this with her breathe easy teas . Love it .
5 #### I must say that I am delighted with this honey . I just opened my first jar this evening . As I have read in some of the other reviews , yes , I enjoyed eating it out of the jar with a spoon . What a lovely , delicate sweetness . So good to know that it is healthful for me too . I may heat some in a dish in some warm water tomorrow , but I already know that I am very happy to have found this lovely honey . I also tried some in a teaspoon with my new Bragg Raw Apple Cider Vinegar , and found it to be extremely flavorful ! I am sure I will be using that combination in many ways .
5 #### This stuff is GOOD , and as another reviewer said you have to be careful because it is that tasty you can overdo ! It is REAL . ( Sadly these days counterfeit honey is a rampant problem - the raw stuff is hard to counterfeit , but rest assured this is an ethical supplier . The health benefits of raw honey are many as it 's a live food , full of enzymes , and acts as prebiotic ( containing substances that contribute to a healthier gut and flora in the entire body ) . It is hard to avoid completely all the processed , ' dead ' foods in the modern world , that do little more than add calories and contribute to disease , so adding things like this to our diet , can help a lot . I like it in tea , I put it in the cup first and then pour in the hot water and stir it . I especially love it in a broccoli salad I make - using chopped / grated broccoli stalks & carrots , organic raisins or dried cherries , and Vegenaise with a tablespoon of this honey -- it is DELICIOUS and a sweet tooth satisfier !
5 #### this is a fine - tasting , long - lasting non - drippy food . there is a variety of sizes available . and it 's organic . what more could we want ?
5 #### I never knew honey could taste this good . I have never been a big fan of honey because of the weird aftertaste I always experienced . After trying this on the advice of a relative I ca n't believe what I have been missing . I bought a 8 oz . jar in a discount drug store on her advice and have since ordered the 32 oz . jar from Amazon . I use this instead of sugar for almost everything . Great product and highly recommended .
5 #### This is almost addicting . REAL HONEY is nothing like the grocery store kind . Amazing taste and of course , organic . I will be buying this again !
4 #### Had discovered this gem about 6 months back and on to my third jar now . Excellent product and quality , no issues here . Only reason I have deducted a star is because there is neither any subscribe and save option here nor its eligible for amazon prime .

We get our orders early and the packing is superb . The product is exactly as described on Amazon 's web site , and it is totally delicious . After reading the detailed description , we knew this was for us .
5 #### Great product from Vitacost . Loved it . Never had such incredible tasting honey in my life . Would recomend this product to all . The cost is low too . One could never get this volume for the cost at a store . Deb
5 #### My dad picked some of this up from a produce stand while he was out of state . I was at his house visiting , and he had me try a bit on a Ritz cracker . I was n't so sure I wanted to try it due to the thick waxy looking appearance . It just was n't what I knew as honey . Once I had one , I had another , and another . This stuff is amazing . I have found myself craving it , but unable to find it any local markets or stores . The waxy appearance is actually a hint at the super creamy texture , and the flavor is so yummy . I am excited to have finally found it , same brand and everything . There are so many ways I want to try this beyond smearing it on a cracker .
5 #### Love this product . I used it during a upper respiratory infection ( URI ) and tea with this honey really helped me to kick it . Obviously , I did have antibiotics to assist but the fact is the normal time for URI to clear is about 2 weeks even with antibiotics . I kicked in one and did n't even have to worry about the chest sputum it cleared . I do believe that the combination of meds with the natural organic raw honey helped me to recuperate much quicker than normal . All this aside , it is great for teas and to take alone especially if sore throat or cough . I tastes great . Definitely recommend .
5 #### What a treat to get this in the mail this afternoon ! I had to hold back from having more than a heaping tablespoon . This is some yummy honey , oh wow ! Thick , velvety consistancy with a smooth , not overly sweet taste . Can not wait to add to tea and spoon over warm bread . Very pleased- much better than the other brand I tried .
5 #### I was a little surprised that it is so thick , almost solid , but the taste is great and at room temp it is easy to spread . I like it in oatmeal , and am trying to cut out refined sugar so this makes it easy . It is super sweet , so I use less than I expected each time . Seemed expensive , but really a bargain now that I know how good it is . I will make sure I keep it on ehand from now on .
5 #### LOVE this honey and it 's amazing with tea . I heard it loses it 's benefits when heated but it 's so damn good in tea I just ca n't help myself . Besides in tea it 's a great tasting honey . Texture is firm and not runny like the processed ones in stores . Surprisingly it tastes way better than the runny crap in stores too !
5 #### Buy this honey ! You wo n't be disappointed . I like the fact that it is 100 % certified organic true raw state unpasteurized and unfiltered , has a great company write - up on the label , comes in a glass jar and not a plastic jar , and it really has a wonderful smooth texture and mellow full distinct flavor , unlike other creamed honeys I have purchased in the past . My cappuccino tastes so much better with this particular honey . The price is so affordable and much much cheaper than if I had to purchase this in a health food store . Amazon 's free super saver shipping speed is excellent . How can you go wrong .
5 #### I love this organic raw honey . Have it everyday with my oatmeal and it makes a difference . It has a solid smooth taste that processed honey does not possess . I do wish this was on subscription because I would sign up for it , for sure ... Highly recommend .
1 #### This is one really bad pu - erh tea . It literally tastes like dirt . Not anywhere near what I am used to in an aged tea . I 'm not an expert , but I 've drank at least a dozen different types . This one was the worst . Many are not much better than ordinary black tea . The only exception , I 've found so far , is Numi Organic Tea Emperor 's Puerh , Full Leaf Black Tea . It has a deep , rich , earthy , malt flavor that I find really appealing . It may be too strong for some , but at least you know you 're imbibing the genuine article . I would have been better off drinking Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea which has a similar earthy malt flavor and it would have cost me less as well .
5 #### This is by far the best honey I have ever had ! I have many kinds , as I drink tea throughout the day . Not only does it taste good , but I do n't need as much of this as the soft honey . I am hoping that I ingest just a few less carbs this way as I have to have my white and green teas every day . I just ordered 2 more . It will not disappoint .
5 #### I really ca n't get enough of this stuff . It 's not golden and runny like most honeys are . It 's more solid , though still spreadable , and no where near as sweet as honey . Most honey has high fructose corn syrup in it which makes it too sweet . This is perfect ... still sweet but does n't over power the " honey taste " I put a tablespoon in a couple of hot green tea every morning ... NOM NOM NOM ! Try it ... you'll tank me later !
5 #### Helps to lose weight , but only if you take 1 hr . after your meal . If Dr. OZ recommended it , it must work , right ?
4 #### I like this tea . This tea was first mentioned to me and others in a weight loss class we have been taking and a group of us decided to try it . It is not a miracle drug , but it helps in the great weight loss battle .
5 #### I love this honey , especially that it is raw , organic , unpasteurized and unprocessed . The taste is very nice and not strong . It is solid and easy to manage . I would recommend it .
5 #### Amazon , put this on subscribe and save please ! Great Taste , thick honey , but easy to get out of the jar ! Good for making a honey spicy brown mustard dressing !
5 #### I know I probably should have used it for internal purposes but , hey I 'm not the biggest fan of honey on / in my food . However , I mixed it with some shea butter and a few other hair healthy ingredients and whaalaaa ! The Best Deep Conditioner Ever ! My hair loved it !
5 #### I just wanted to let everyone know that this honey is amazing ! It is so delicious you can eat it by the spoonful . However , I just wanted to say that it is cheaper at Jewel - Osco and my local health food store . Especially when you consider shipping charges .
5 #### This is the best tasting honey I 've ever had . After checking prices at several local and not so local stores I also consider it a great value . I will say though that we 've started buying 2 of the smaller 22 oz . jars each order instead of 1 larger 32 oz . jar . Including the 99 cents each jar shipping , it comes out a little cheaper per oz . Not sure why the 22 oz . jar description calls it " gel " . It 's the same solid honey as you get in the 32 oz solid . If you 're looking for really good organic natural raw honey this is the best deal around .
5 #### My honey arrived as shown in the photo , opaque . But it 's delicious , and really helped my stomach . I take it twice a day , and even with cinnamon . You might want to research how the combination of honey & cinnamon is good for you .
5 #### Read some reviews that said this tea could taste strong and earthy , but Generation Pu - erh tea was surprisingly nice , much nicer than green tea . I 'm very happy with this product . And the service was exceptional , shipping incredibly FAST ! Thanks !
1 #### This product has a lot of caffiene and caused a migraine headache and I only have had 1 other in my lifetime . The shipping is as much as the product . if you do n't drink coffee and are sensitive to caffiene , you may want to stay away from this tea .
5 #### Is this cheap , " Heck , no . " Is this good , " Yes ! " Pu - erhs ( ooo - air)are made into little ( or big ) cakes of tea , and then allowed to ferment ( rot ) . Bad Pu - erh tastes like tea left to rot . This definitely does not . It has a warm oak flavor . Pu - erhs are " double - fermented " . Tea makers let the tea oxidize like black tea , and then form the leaves into cakes . Pu - erhs take awhile to ferment ; they actually have vintages like wine and can be as old as 40 or 50 years . Because of the longer processing time , pu - erhs are generally more expensive , so this is n't a bad price for pu - erh , although it is a little pricey for tea . This is good pu - erh for other reasons : unless you have a tea diffuser , you ca n't make pu - erh teas -- they're not generally sold in bags . If you 're not really into buying a lot of tea accoutrement , e.g. , an American , these bags are a real find . Each one will more than handily make 3 or 4 cups of tea when steeped in a several cup teapot -- or you can steep repeatedly for a different taste with each cup .
5 #### This product was shipped quickly . This 1 lb of Wheat Germ is in RAW form and needs to be refrigerated once open or can be frozen to extend shelf life . It is a great way to add nutrition to your diet at a great price . I highly recommend this product .
5 #### Good product at a great price . So many uses for product .
5 #### This wheat germ is sweet and fresh . I have been happy with Barry Farm products thus far .
5 #### Very nice and fresh product that I 've found easy to add to numerous recipes .
4 #### I use this to ' kick - up ' my morning oatmeal and I like the product very much ! I 'll be reordering when this order runs low . Thanks !
5 #### The gardeners put on earth by God do their work by buzzing around . Flitting here and there and everywhere . What they give to us is a valuable source of rich nutrients and health giving benefits . Honey for sweetness . Bee Pollen for nutrient rich supplement and multifaceted benefits for us humans , so dependent upon the Bee . A wonderfully concept and produced quality nutritional supplement for those who care about their health and future .
4 #### Great for smoothies or just a quick teaspoon to eat on the go . Highly recommend ! and it taste great too !
5 #### Love this product . I think bee pollen has everything for good health .
5 #### The Taste is Strong but very Palatable . I 've used a couple other Products from YS and both were of the Highest quality . So I 'm hoping that this Product can also help my Overall Health .
5 #### Thank you for selling this product in a smaller size to allow customers to try it for the first time at a reasonable price . The Clear Jel came quickly in the mail and the quality fresh . It makes perfect homemade cashew mayonnaise - just the right consistency . Exactly what I was looking for .
5 #### I 've bought a couple packages of Clear Jel over the past two years . I bought it originally for use in pie making , but now I use it in everything that calls for standard corn starch . I love the fact that it 's clear and dissolves well .
5 #### I love this product ! Add a flavor stick for bottled water to make low calorie jelly instantly !
5 #### I 'm glad I found the secret to great fruit pies after make a lot of pies .
2 #### The judges at the state fair were not impressed . No ribbon for my pie , though I took ribbons in other categories . I'l probably go back to using flour or cornstarch .
5 #### I started using 2 TBSP of this instead of corn startch in pie recipes . Really nice consistency .
5 #### I have been looking for a substitute for King Arthur 's Instant Clear Jel and I 'm so glad I found this version by Barry Farms . There 's a very decent amount here ( much more than KA 's ) and I like that the sugar and citric acid have been left out , this is just plain ol' clear jel . This product is fantastic for making pies , works so much better than ordinary cornstarch or flour . Simply mix - I like to toss with your fresh fruit and other ingredients and add to your pie crust . This gives a lovely " jam - like " consistency to pie fillings and will firm up the juice if you 're using berries or wet fruit so you avoid a soggy crust . There are no instructions but you can find recipes on KA 's website for a general idea of how much it takes when you bake a pie . For example , I used 1/4 cup in the last 10 inch apple pie I made , 2 - 3 TBSP would be appropriate for smaller ( or flatter ) pies . You may need to experiment a bit with your baking , I like that this Clear Jel does n't clump or harden like regular cornstarch if you use a bit too much , it mixes very well . It also works very well with low pectin fruit . The price is very reasonable too ! Highly recommended !
4 #### I have used it once , to thicken homemade soy yogurt , and it seems to be working well . It did not add any grit or distort the flavor . Good product .
4 #### I got this because I was hoping to get away from all the boiling needed to get rid of the starchy taste when I added it to yogurt to thicken it up . I tried this insead with some banana powder , and it thinkened up , but several days later my yogurt went from thick to drinkable . I 'm not sure if this product will work well with yogurt if it does not hold viscosity .
4 #### this is my second order , great for canning pie filling , awesome peach and apricot filling , not so great in jam tastes like baby food then
5 #### This is a good product to have one hand . I add a small amount of the clear gel in my corn . It becomes so creamy and delicious !
5 #### Works as advertised ! Soooo handy . Love that I can thicken without the floury , cornstarch taste . On a side note , I also use this to make my own hair gel as I have allergies to most products . Works better than name brands !
5 #### The sauce used to hold the uncooked strawberries ( blueberries , etc . ) together is cooked , but not the fruits , so it makes great tartlets , etc .
5 #### I have only used for sauces so far but gives a nice consistency . There is no noticeable taste and I have n't noticed any weeping of water that happens with regular corn starch .
5 #### This date sugar is very tasty . I have used it before in making date nut bars , date filled oat meal cookies , bread , and many other recipes as well . It makes a good tasting alternative to regular or brown sugar in recipes that call for dates , or are date flavored . Just remember that date sugar is a little sweeter than regular or brown sugar and should be used more sparingly . Also , date sugar does not melt down and liquify like other sugar either . When used in recipes it may appear as small brown flakes that give a more concentrated sweetness to cookies , bread , etc . Date sugar is not cheap , but worth it for the few times you will use it for the special sweetness and flavor it adds . Also , it is near impossible to find in anything but gourmet shops so Amazon is a good bet if you are feeling favorable to it . The only thing I would suggest is that you either order two or more pouches of this or something else that qualifies you for the free shipping . ( If it 's still be offered , it was at the time of this writing . ) Then it becomes a solid deal and well worth the money . Recommended ...
5 #### Date sugar is great for baking , hot cereal and smoothies . I love getting my sweet with ntrients .
5 #### I use this in many baked goods instead of brown sugar . It has a wonderful caramel flavor . It 's powdery texture is not good for brown sugar toppings though . For that I use it mixed into Splenda with some barley malt syrup .
5 #### Make your own Ovaltine ! We did - use this , organic cocoa and powdered milk - BEST EVER !
5 #### Very malty & dissolves well in hot water , so probably OK in cold as well . I sub it for the sugar in my cocoa mix - nice !
4 #### We love this stuff . Keep buying more for vegan milkshakes . It 's so great . The only problem is , I think it 's not healthy to eat this much :)
5 #### Good stuff ! I like the flavor of malt and generally add about a Tbsp or two when I 'm baking bread . This is pure malt powder and does n't have any fillers or sugars added .
4 #### This is OK - I use it when making bread . Since buying it I have switch to using barley malt syrup which I happen to like even better . The syrup is harder to find so this makes a great alternative .
5 #### Love it . Used it to make homemade HORLICKs . This is my office night time beverage
5 #### Healthy & delucious . Clumps so I put warm milk & the malt in a jar & shake to mix .
5 #### I love malt flavor with ice cream . I sprinkle this on vanilla ice cream . Sometimes I add peanut butter or chocolate . It always tastes great .
5 #### Delicious with yogurt . Used to buy this at the grocery but ca nt find it now .
5 #### Barley malt powder goes great in our homemade " Ovaltine " powder . Its a pricey ingredient compared to the others , but if you like an old fashioned malt , this is what you want . This is a smooth and very fine powder . One pound is equal to about a quart . After I opened the bag , I poured the rest into a quart jar for storage . This bag does n't re seal , so you will need to store it elsewhere .
5 #### This is great . I use it to make Ovaltine . It is naturally sweet , so it needs no addition of sugar . It is simply 2 cups dried milk , 1/3 cup malt , and 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa . Hot .. just add water . Mixed in cold milk .. Needs stick blender .
5 #### Great nutty , caramel malt flavor in Shakes/ Popsicles etc . Sweet taste , though will need additional ingredients for dessert recipes . Fine powdered texture . Was glad to find this even at twice the former price ( used to buy Now brand ' Barley sweetener ' before it was discontinued ) . Yumm
5 #### This brought back childhood memories when I mixed it in a glass of milk ! ! I have also added a little into my cookie batter and it was great . I know it would be fantastic added to a batch of chocolate chip cookies ! ! I think I will try it in some homemade ice cream next !
5 #### dissolves in my tea to make a great taste
5 #### I love this product and it 's a must when making bagels . It also helps in giving a good strong rise to your yeast dough recipes . Love this stuff ! This was a great price , good product and really fast delivery .
5 #### Used this for homemade malted milk powder . Worked perfectly
5 #### Exactly what I needed for making bagles with that authentic flavor ! :)
3 #### Its a good product . Just make sure you do n't confuse this with " milk malted powder " , an entirely different product made with dried malt extract ( DME ) , powdered milk , and sugar . This is ground up malted - ized barley , that should more accurately be called " malt flour " . This is no fault of the company , it is accurately labled . Though I use malt for candy , this is more suited for brewing , and baking .
5 #### This is pure barley malt . You are not paying for a lot of sugar . If you want to make a great chocolate malt mix , just combine this with your favorite hot chocolate product . Please avoid buying any Nestle products . They are bottling water in California and selling it all over the world in the midst of the worst drought on record there . They are a corporation out to make a fast buck even if it harms our fellow citizens . Thanks !
5 #### I use it in my baked breads , sourdough starter , in my coffee , and anything with cacao . Happy with the product .
5 #### I only eat plant based foods so I was searching for a way to make chocolate malted protein shakes . This works perfectly . It tastes like malted milk but without the milk part ! Kinda pricey for a pound but you do n't need much to get the flavor in a shake . I will buy it again .
5 #### Used this powder to make a traditional Korean dessert , a sweet rice drink . It was exactly what I needed and the drink cam e out as i remembered it as a child .
5 #### Great malt powder , not malted milk . Straight up maly , so slightly sweet by nature bit no added sugars . Love it for baking .
5 #### I have been reading thru the post and it appears there is lots of confusion between the difference between Diastatic and Non Diastatic . Diastatic barley malt contains an enzyme that convert starch in flour to sugar , to feed the yeast during fermentation of the dough . It is added to promote the catalytic action . Nondiastatic barley flour does not contain this enzyme , so it can be added in large quantities as a flavor enhancer . My favorite past time is baking bread and a little of the diastatic goes a long ways ( .5 - 1 % flour weight ) and is used during long & slow ( overnight ) fermentation . Non diastatic is normally used in bagels and scones for flavor . Its sole purpose is for its flavor . That is why I am looking for it . My sons really love the Stickyfingers Scones but they are way expensive and I think it 's the malted barley flour ( non diastatic ) is what makes them so delicious and gives them the chewy texture .
5 #### Love this in shakes and in vanilla ice cream . Going to use it in some home mAde ice cream .
5 #### I prefer this to malt syrup for baking . It is non - diastatic , and convenient to use as well as store .
1 #### I was looking for an alternative to malted milk powder and the reviews state that this was even more malty than that . And its not . Its gross and mild .
5 #### This malt powder is one of my ' go to ' ingredients for making high quality breads . A little goes a long way and you can often use malt powder in place of sugar if you are trying to lower your sugar intake ( the yeast loves this stuff ) . I get some gorgeous , shiny - crusted breads with this and it 's absolutely essential for a good sourdough .
5 #### I bought this ti make Icecream with . So far it has done the trick and everybody loves the icecream we make .
5 #### Bought this to be able to add a little to my Alba shakes for a malted flavor - very niiice ! Wonderful to add a wee bit to baked goods .
2 #### Was hoping for malty flavor but not so sweet as malted milk powder . Does n't taste like much of anything . Better than Horlik 's though . Been using it in smoothies and shakes .
5 #### Since I have always loved the taste of malt , I grew up drinking malteds , made from real malt powder . My faves were chocolate and banana . When I became an adult , it occurred to me that you could hardly find a real malted any longer -- only " shakes " . Also , as an adult , I begin to bake my own bread and discovered , through reading a lot of information about bread - baking , that " barley malt " was an ingredient that artisan bakers used in their loaves . At first I purchased the liquid form of barley malt and did n't even connect the fact that this was real " malt " , only in liquid form . I added it to some of my bread recipes and the result was a positive one , in yielding richer tasting breads . But the problem with the liquid is that you refrigerate it , and subsequently , it is a sticky , syrupy substance -- difficult to measure out . Hence , my interest in the powder form of malt . This product is the real thing . It has NO ADDED SUGAR , like most other products do . Other recognizable - named products work well , if you just want a " drink powder " , but if you want the most nutritious substance , able to enhance your yeast baking , AND to make divine malteds and ice cream sundaes , GET THIS PRODUCT . I will continue to buy this pure Barley Malt Powder . Love it !
3 #### I get this for about half the price ( about $ 5 per pound)at my local home brewing supply store . Maybe shop around a little to save some dough ( pun intended ) .
5 #### Barley Malt powder is super healthy , since the sugars are largely Maltose , which do not produce a sharp sugar spike for diabetics . I have tried just about every one available , and Barry Farms makes the best one of all . The Barry Farms barley malt powder is sweeter tasting than most others and quick dissolving in milk . I use it with straight cocoa powder and milk in a blender to make a tasty chocolate malted breakfast drink . Two tablespoons of this only has 3 grams of sugar . This is one great tasting health food .
5 #### I only use Arrowroot now for thickening sauces and gravies . It works much better than other gluten free flours and you use less so there is less chance of adding an unwanted flour taste to the end result . And of course I LOVE Barry Farms ; their delivery has always been trouble free and the communication is excellent . The product is always exactly as described and I 'm fully confident in all their gluten free products ! Love you guys .
5 #### I LOVE this stuff ! It does not leave a after taste like flour does in my apple pies or gravy . I mix berries together and add a table spoon of arrowroot to it and heat in micro wave to thicken and YUMMY over ice cream
5 #### Love this stuff . Works very well in all my cooking .
5 #### I use this Arrowroot Power for all my sauces , gravies , etc ! ! ! It is perfect and I always use this product ! ! !
4 #### This is a great product for water - based thickening ; however , it does not work as well with milk .
5 #### This arrowroot powder was perfect for today 's sugar - free vegetarian , high - protein snack baking experiment , and the price is very good too . This product was great to make my gluten - free paleo thin mint brownie bars fluffier . I uses raw cacao powder from Amazon ( I used this&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Healthworks - Cacao - Powder - Raw - Organic-1lb / dp / B00EKLPLU4 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Healthworks Cacao Powder Raw Organic , 1lb</a > ) , and also super fine ground blanched almond meal ( < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/5LB - Almond - Flour - Blanched - Extra - Fine - Ground - Almond - Meal - Oh - Nuts-5 - LB - Bag - Blanched - Almond - Flour / dp / B01E5ZJV9Q / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">5LB Almond Flour Blanched , Extra Fine Ground Almond Meal - Oh !

Next time will add more stevia , and maybe make a sugar - free choccie frosting , yet otherwise these high protein , gluten - free thin mint brownies came out great . Happy gluten - free baking~ *
5 #### I used this product to make home made deodorant and it worked great . Highly recommend .
5 #### I bought this to make homemade , non - toxic health and beauty products . It seems to do the job just fine .
4 #### It 's arrowroot starch ! What can I say ! Love it ?
5 #### Great ! This was my first time ordering and using arrowroot powder as I wanted to add a natural deodorant to the products I sell . This worked perfectly so far ! My pits have been dry and odorless all day so far . My only wish is that this came in a re - sealable package as once it 's open there is no way of closing it . Can end up losing product .
5 #### Works great for all my thickening recipes . Great for making my own confection sugar due to my grand - daughter not being able to have any corn products .
5 #### Loved the bulk purchase of this instead of the smaller amount I purchase at a time from the grocery store . Only difference is that the store bought arrowroot is that it is in a more convienent container . It 's a sealable plastic bottle with an open top , similar to a parmesaun cheese bottle . No worries though as I just save the bottle and refil it from there . Works well in a lot of my homemade DIY organic recipes . Will purchase again .
5 #### Works great for making homemade deodorant . Should last around a year !
5 #### Arrived on time and is fresh and well packed
3 #### Found a place to buy near by that ended up less expensive and a much bigger quantity !
5 #### My husband really believes this is cornstarch and that I am just lying to him ! ! In my book its perfect ! !
5 #### Great stuff . Little on the expensive side but makes gluten free or paleo baking possible and quite tasty .
4 #### Bag leaked some in transit , but most of it remained .
5 #### this cuts down on the greasiness of home made lotion bars , works great
5 #### Product received was the same as product shown when ordering . Shipped quickly and with other items in appropriate size box . Very happy with purchase and will order again .
5 #### Great product ! Use it for making DIY things ..... deodorant , etc . as well as cooking with it .
5 #### Wonderful quality , have used it in gluten free cooking . Have used it in D.I.Y. body powder . It makes powder so silky . recommend !
5 #### I use this as an ingredient in homemade deodorant and it seems to work great . I have no prior experience with arrowroot powder so I ca n't compare but I like the price this one is at and will continue to purchase it .
5 #### I use this in making my gluten free bread . Great product .
5 #### Much better choice that using the old standard cornstarch which is GMO'd , for those corn sensitive can cause you to bloat . This is organic , is a root that thickens , can be used to dust chicken or fish to seal in the juices and is just healthier .
5 #### Used this in my deodorant which I 've worn for 2 days so far and I love it ! I highly recommend !
5 #### I 'm digging this . add to sauces to thicken . I 've been adding to eggs and milk to make super fluffy scrambles .
5 #### Great thickening agent ! I was following the Whole30 and paleo diet last year and stumbled across this . It 's virtually flavorless and does n't really add a thick coating . I dust chicken with it when making Asian dishes , and it helps the sauce thicken and stick to the chicken . I 've added to my morning shakes ... Love this stuff !
5 #### Arrowroot is such a wonderful alternative for those with corn allergies or looking for corn starch alternatives for any reason . I 've used this product for everything from deodorant making to baking and cooking . It does beautifully . I m very happy with the results and price on this item . thanks !
5 #### Got these for some of my homemade products and it works just as expected ! Will certainly order again when I need it !
5 #### If you have a corn allergy , then this product can be used as a thickener without using a corn based product . This product works well in my homemade teriyaki sauce . If you use too much it can get rubbery but that is under the user 's control . The powder seems to thicken more than corn starch . I will update this review if I encounter anything notable to share .
5 #### love this stuff ! it 's a perfect thickener without using cornstarch . Does n't leave an after taste at all , in fact , it has no taste .
5 #### I love using this product to thicken my sauces , from gravy to syrup . It does a great job without jellying the next day like corn starch does .
5 #### Economical way of buying Arrowroot rather then buying the small bottles in the grocery store . I just refill my little bottle labeled arrowroot and keep with other spices . Empty large bag into a plastic container . Arrowroot is a great thickener as it does not cloud sauces which is great when fruit sauces are made .
4 #### I ordered this to use in a bread recipe . I did not know what the product does . Now I know it is used as a thickener .
1 #### I saw this listed as purchased items to review . We never got this item though ! Not sure why it 's listed here and if we did indeed buy it , where it is !
5 #### Works great as a substitute for traditional thickeners , flour , cornstarch and is a great kitchen staple for those following the Paleo diet . I use it to make bread as well using almond flour .
5 #### Previously I had only been able to find this is 1 or 2 oz . packages & had little packets taking up space until they were used . This has been great & I use it all the time instead of flour for gravy or Sauces & I do n't have to wait to cook out the Flour taste . It 's a staple in my pantry .
5 #### Arrowroot is a good , old fashioned thickener for clear sauces and gravies . I 'm allergic to corn and wheat , so this is a godsend , especially when making giblet gravy for the holidays .
5 #### This Arrowroot powder is excellent for thickening in all recipes . Does not add any flavor and it is a healthy choice .
5 #### Product was securely and well packed . It arrived as was advertised . Quality product for the price which was equitable . Would recommend this item .
5 #### Great product ; it makes fruit fillings the perfect texture .
5 #### Worked as expected and made a great finished canning product
5 #### Exactly as promised great service , fast shipping . Will certainly buy again
5 #### Made peach pie filling .. Bagged it and froze for later .... Filling came out " clear " with NO added taste or texture ... The peach filling was awesome ... I had to taste it before it hit the freezer .... I used distilled water because our HARD water can add tastes that are noticeable .... I added the liquid from the Fruit Fresh dip also ... It had so much flavor I could n't dump it .. What 's a little extra vitamin C ... I normally use corn starch and tapioca pudding ... Never again ....
5 #### I made several batches of fruit jellies and jams for Christmas and holiday fundraisers , and this is exactly what I needed . It worked perfectly for my recipes and I received several compliments on the jellies and jams - you could say it was the recipe , but more technically it was all of the ingredients that made them turn our perfectly .
2 #### I used this to can some fruit - gave a not - so - great taste to the cobbler I made with the fruit .
5 #### I 've been using this for the past few years to make apple pie filling . It works great ! It adds no additional flavor and stays clear . It 's really easy to work with dad just mix it in with your sugar before adding to the fluid so it does n't clump up . Heat until thickened and you 're done ! I always get compliments on anything I make with this .
5 #### I was glad to find this product . Thank you .
5 #### Making vegan cheese is a breeze with this ingredient .
5 #### Clear gel is most excellent for making fruit pies , thickening jams , and thickening gravies and soups . Clear gel stays fairly soft when it cools . Far superior to cornstarch .
5 #### I have been using Clear Jel for canning for the last 3 yrs ! Love this stuff ! ! Makes all my canning fruit , jams , pie fillings so creamy & smooth ! Very easy to use . I ca n't be with out it !
3 #### have some see weed smell but used few drops of almond extract to make cold desert . Easier and faster to use agar in stead of gelatine
4 #### Great place to purchase Agar powder . I use this to make my ' cheese ' substitute and it turns out great !
5 #### Use this to make clarified orange juice and pho broth . Worked very well with the freeze / thaw cycle and cheaper than local stores . Use a mg scale if you need a really small amount .
5 #### All these products are good and healthy . I can in bulk order as I want and not by items I do not want . The nice thing is the free shipping .
5 #### Does exactly what I want it to do . I use this to make vegan artisan cheeses .
5 #### If you want to thicken something like a donut icing , you must have this stuff . A very tiny bit , maybe 1/4 teaspoon , dissolved in boiling water and added to your recipe does the job . Experiment with this stuff , a little more and a little less .
5 #### I use this for jams and it has proven to be very successful . The product works exactly the way it 's supposed to and is more cost effective . It was delivered promptly and packed with care .
5 #### perfection for the person looking to go " vegan " while making gelatin products such as jellies
4 #### I got what I was expecting and the right quantity too . I was a bit concerned because someone else indicate they had received less product than expected . But I did not . And it works as I was hoping it would as a substitute for gelatin . It was good to see that it had a best by date out for a year , which means to me that the product is relatively fresh .
5 #### Great product ca nt wait to use it this product this summer .
5 #### First time using Barry Farm products and this Clear Jel was a great product . Clear Jel is almost impossible to find in your local stores . I do a lot of canning to enter in State Fairs etc ... and I want my entries to be - look and taste outstanding ! I used this Clear Jel to make a beautiful Apple - Cherry Pie filling , since Clear Jel does not begin thickening until the liquid / filling starts to cool . Clear Gel is clear in color when cooked , it has excellent stability and remains smooth . I also use to thicken stews and gravies if needed . So many uses for Clear Jel ! !
5 #### Great stuff . Works well in jelling jams and jellies .
5 #### I use it to make a special Russian cake with merengue - like creme layer and it turns out perfect each time !
4 #### Ok it came pacaged fine . Did feel it needed to be re - packaged to keep better and easier to use . Otherwise it 's agar .
4 #### This was a good item . Great to use in more recipes I make . Cheese being one of them . Will be enjoying this item .
5 #### I had a recipe for a dessert topping using agar agar . This worked well and the topping was yummy . So I am very pleased with this , and have lots more for future recipes .
5 #### First of all , let me say I have no complaints about this product whatsoever . I bought it to use in a pecan pie recipe . My mistake ( and I 'm only mentioning this , because this was my first time using agar , and I learned a lot ) was in assuming that agar powder and agar flakes could be used interchangeably in the recipe ( which called for flakes ) . My pecan pie slices came out like bricks - haha ! So , I plan to make the recipe again , but probably with only half the amount in powder , in the hopes that my second attempt will be much more successful than the first ! The seller and product were both great ! Thank you .
5 #### this product is wonderful canning peach pie filling . makes the pie filling taste like you opened a can from the store . Apple pie filling is wonderful also .
5 #### have ordered several times now for when I am canning pie filling when my apricot tree is loaded.time for some more soon
5 #### If you like to save mooney , this is what you need to make your own " Jello " style instant puddings . Just google homemade instant pudding and you will find oodles of recipes .
2 #### The apple pie recipe using this Clear Jel was NOT EVEN CLOSE to being as good as my usual recipe . Next time I will just make my regular pie recipe , layer wax paper in the pie pan , freeze , pop out apples , and store in a gallon ziploc . No need to can . No need for Clear Jel . Skip it , you can make better recipes without it .
5 #### Clearjel works well , but you have to keep in mind that it expands . I checked several sites online after I had a near disaster canning apple pie filling . Either use less , or be prepared to leave 2 inches of headspace . And , be careful , Clearjel increases the burn from sugar , watch out for splatters , they will sear your skin off .
4 #### this worked great for making apple pie filling for canning . It actually got a bit too thick , I used a little less clear jel on the 2nd batch and cooked it less . It never came to a boil as the instructions state , it thickened up nicely when it got hot . I poured in the apple chunks and mixed it all around then canned the filling . The apple filling came out great , apples are not too soft , since I did n't boil the filling . After canning , I did have to leave the jars in the water bath for a longer time . The first jars boiled over a bit when i removed them at the recommended time . The clear jel filling keeps the pie filling very hot for a long time and there was some leakage if the jars are removed too soon .
5 #### This was a very good year for every apple tree in my area . Instead of the usual apple butter and apple sauce , I wanted to can apple pie filling . Most recipes warn that regular cornstarch can break down as a jar sits . The Ball Canning site suggested this product , and it worked beautifully . The recipe is on their website , if anyone wants to try it .
4 #### everything i have made with this product so far has turned out great . i did have to kind of guess on the amount , there was only one recipe with this bag , and it was covered by a big shipping sticker , which when i tried to carefully remove , ripped off with the sticker . the product itself is wonderful though .
5 #### Used this to do peaches .... works like a charm and I like it much better than sure jel . Clear Jel works great for those fruits that you can to do pies .... holds up much better in the double cooking / baking .
5 #### With clear gel you can make your own instant puddings . You can also use this product to add to a cake or cake mix that does n't contain pudding , it 's " pudding " without the flavor . Works great to make your cakes moist and tender . Instructions on the site and recipes .
5 #### A good product at a very good price . This is not easy to find at grocery stores and was exactly what we wanted to make pie fillings .
5 #### This is better than using cornstarch or flour . Even my husband is amazed how my pie look and taste . A must when you make pies . Go try it for yourself . I 'm sure you will be happy with the result .
5 #### I have only used for sauces so far but gives a nice consistency . There is no noticeable taste and I have n't noticed any weeping of water that happens with regular corn starch .
5 #### I purchased this in hopes it would save my jelly I worked so hard on . This is the best you can get .
5 #### I tried this for the first time after hearing recommendations from other folks who like to can . This really made my canned apple pie fillings look wonderful . I got complements from everyone ! I went back to Amazon.com and ordered more for 2011 . My apple pies looked as good as they tasted .
5 #### I have only used this to thicken gravy but it worked so well with no starcy flourey taste . I will order more when I need it . Thanks for haveing such a great product .
5 #### It is the quality that you would expect and a price that is reasonable . I recommend this product to others .
3 #### I was thinking 1 lb would be a lot more than what it actually came out to be . Especially since starch is somewhat light , and since it was $ 8 . I wish they sold this in larger quantities .
5 #### What can I say about potato starch . It 's just potato starch , so this review will be on Barry Farm instead of potato starch . From Barry Farm you 're going to get things cheaper , much cheaper . I 've been buying products from Barry Farm for several years and they have been great to deal with . Their shipping is fair , but unfortunately , flours and starches weigh a lot and shipping is n't cheap . I purchase items from them that are too expensive to buy locally , things I ca n't find locally ( finely ground white corn flour , sweet rice flour and Ivory Teff ) and items that are better quality than what I can buy locally ( the best sorghum flour anywhere ) . I usually order 25 or 30 pounds of product at a time and that reduces the overall price per pound to a reasonable cost .
5 #### Learning to cook Gluten Free is difficult . I especially like bread and have been experimenting with this product to mix a flour that is like my mother 's . So far it is an experiment , but I could n't do without it .
5 #### A recipe in Cooking Light recommended that Potato Starch be added to cupcakes , cakes , etc . when you reduce the amount of butter . It worked well and I would recommend this company . They had a fast ship and well packaged .
5 #### I love the taste of Amaranth made into a hot cereal . It 's smooth and filling . Will order this again . Glad to find in on Amazon .
5 #### I cook this grain as a cereal . I find the taste to be very pleasant . I sometimes add it to soups to enhance the protein content . This is definitely super and tasty health food ! I have bought other organic grains from Barry Farm and I am very satisfied with the quality of their products .
5 #### Tastes just like regular black tea only a little weaker . Do n't get it if you expect it to actually taste like raspberries . I bought 6 boxes to use in the first half of my menstrual cycle for building a good uterine lining . It 's organic , good tasting , and has health benefits without the caffeine . Ca n't go wrong !
5 #### This tea is great tasting , and very helpful to prepare the body for labor .
5 #### This the best tea for the woman . I bought it to help strengthen my uterus for when I 'm ready to conceive . I use around my period too . So If you have heavy periods this will help . I love this tea and I would def recommend to a friend .
5 #### I drank these while pregnant and really feel like they helped my last labor go by faster . It tastes great and I replaced my cup of coffee every day with these while pregnant . I would definitely recommend .
5 #### Did research on how to relieve pain from menstrual discomfort in a natural manner . Kept getting raspberry leaf tea as a result and decided to try it . It helps alot . I highly recommend it .
5 #### I buy this pretty regularly . we r trying to get pregnant and they say this tea is a must . well I do n't cramp anymore and my periods r regular and relatively light now . so I think its working .
4 #### The name says everthing about this lovely tea . Sweet chamomile apple is like drinking a golden delicious apple . The scent is strongly fruity and chamomile . The flavor is apple , chamomile and honey -- a wonderful golden flavor that is soothing and while sweet , not cloying . Chamomile tea is known for being a nerve tonic , settling upset stomachs , and soothing menstrual cramps and headaches . Having a cup before bedtime is a nice way to relax . Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging : they utilize 100 % natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they do n't package each tea bag individually . Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it . It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag . The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface .
5 #### This is Celestial Seasonings at their best - a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf , which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea ! Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet , clean taste . Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine . It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea . Peppermint combats flatulence , promotes bile flow and digestive juices , and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion . It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension , soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle . Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging : they utilize 100 % natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they do n't package each tea bag individually . Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it . It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag . The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface .
4 #### Did not help with nausea as hoped but still like it .
3 #### not bad .... but not my favorite either ..... think i am basically a black tea lover ..... but this can use w/o sugar as i do as it has a sweet natural taste
5 #### My favorite flavor of tea ! ! Add a little milk and honey
5 #### Everything that I would expect out of these teas .
5 #### I love the cinnamon apple spice tea . It 's naturally sweet without fake sweeteners and has helped me get off of soda . I make a gallon pitcher every couple days and refrigerate it for iced tea .
5 #### My teenaged son and our housemate both love this assortment .
5 #### Nice selection of sampler package . I like them all , so none of them have to get tossed or passed on to someone else . I 'm glad I tried them ... I never would have thought of trying peach , but it is really nice .
5 #### reminds me of when I was little and the spice tea my Mother use to mix together for me .
4 #### The grape flavor was n't as strong as I would have liked , but the tea was still good . I do n't prefer tea , but felt I was drinking too much coffee . This was a nice alternative . I would n't buy it again , having moved on . but I would recommend it if anyone wants to experiment with herbal teas .
5 #### One black tea bag and one of these bengal spice ! Add cream if wanted and steep 5 - 8 min wow easy at home masala chai ! ! I simmmered this in on the stove with evaporated carnation milk for 10 min with a touch of sugar Be careful milk boils over right when you turn away ! Add a drop of cream if desired
5 #### What a treat ! Sweet and spicy and sugar free . Total winner ! Have put this on auto - ship .
5 #### Love these flavorful teas . They are all delicious . A good way to try different fruit flavors .
5 #### My favorite herbal tea . So tasty ! I order 6 boxes at a time and drink a cup every night . Arrived intact and in excellent condition as promised by the seller .
5 #### Yummy ! This tea has a wonderful flavor . When I want something warm and sweet , I make a cup of this tea , add a sweetener and sit back to enjoy .
5 #### This is one of my favorite teas and I got a price worth setting a subscription .
5 #### Love it , great tea , it is spicy and bold , I drink it cold and you do n't even need to use sugar , I also love it hot with a touch of cream , perfect for anyone that likes spice tea flavors .
5 #### One of my favorite teas ! Love the 6 pack .
5 #### This was a good flavor , enjoyed it very much . Will buy again .
5 #### I LOOOOOOOOOVE this tea ! Wonderful flavor , really strong , perfect with a tiny bit of sweetener . Caffeine - free so I can drink it all day !
5 #### This tea not only tastes amazing , but the main ingredient is Milk Thistle , which has so many health benefits . The taste is not strong , though , so I double the tea bags for this one ( then add a little cream and its incredibly delish ! )
5 #### I love this tea . wonderful taste and good for my digestion .
5 #### OOOH I LOVE this tea and flavour I am a coffee man - BUT when I am looking for something else to drink - WoW this is very satisfying Maked a wonderful cup - hor or cold
5 #### Great spicy tea ! More flavorful than your typical cinnamon blend
5 #### Rich and soothing . I sometimes use two teabags for extra strength and sometimes add it to a chai tea for the same reason .
5 #### best tea when having colds or flu and then grat any time
5 #### Love this stuff . The perfect kick :) great for a nice hot drink , soothing the belly , or even nausea .
5 #### Love it and I really do feel it has helped with digestion & heartburn issues ! It 's does have a bit of a kick !
5 #### I buy so much of this . This is one of the rare teas in which the flavor of it is very good . Not too strong , and not too weak . I personally love it for iced tea as well .
5 #### I bought this tea from a store - so I am only reviewing the product / taste . It 's incredible and amazing . Absolutely incredible . It is very " sweet " . The spices make this actually taste very sweet ( but not overly sweet ) . It truly tastes like chai ( sweetened chai ) . I Love a really creamy chai tea so I use either half and half or whipping cream ( 1 - 2 tbsp ) with a 8 oz of this tea ( 1 bag , 8 oz hot water , 5 - 7 min seep ) . I love how I do n't need to add sweetener / sugar . It 's great by itself as well . I 'm doing this intermittent fasting and I crave food and sweet food at night . I just bought a box of this yesterday and between my mother and I , we 've already finished half the box . I can drink this and sleep with no issue because it 's caffeine free . I 'm so incredibly happy with this tea , I can not even describe . The store I got it from was a bit cheaper than here - I will probably be buying 2 boxes of this tea a week . It 's literally my favorite tea right now .
5 #### Yummy ! ! ! So lemony , yet balanced with other herbs . My go to lemon tea !
4 #### I enjoy this tea . I love all types of herbal flavors .
5 #### This is our favorite herbal tea . Its like chai tea : spicy and delicious . If you like chai , but do n't like the caffeine , check out this wonderful tea .
5 #### I do n't think they make any flavor that 's not good , but blueberry is my favorite of the bunch . The other reviews are misleading about one thing , however : not all of them are naturally sweet . You might want to make sure you have your sweetener of choice on hand . I use sucralose .
5 #### A soothing , zero - calorie tea with the gentle mellowness of buttery vanilla that only makes its appearance on grocery - store shelves around Christmastime , so I was glad to learn I could order multiple boxes of it . Add a dash of your favorite type of creamer and you 've got the makings of a beverage that 's pure comfort in a cup .
3 #### They changed this from the original recipe that my gal pal introduced me to and that I really liked . Now I have one mostly unused box and five sealed boxes of this stuff .
4 #### It works for me . Helps me sleep every night .
5 #### If you 're looking for a very delicious chamomile tea , this is it . An extraordinary and interesting flavor . It makes it more than plain old chamomile . So delicious , hot or cold .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R17BESJVNIQMIR " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / F1kr4p8OWwS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/11htNCs0Z0S.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;i love this tea . it brings back special memories from when i first came to America . That is when i first drank it almost 40 years ago . i made a video so you can see how much i like it . i hope it helps . Sabiene :) Update : i forgot to mention that i often wonder about the cinnamon as an ingredient in there . i have recently learned that if a product contains cinnamon that it does n't always mean that it will be the true cinnamon from Sri Lanka . Honestly i would drink it way more often than i do now if it would contain the true cinnamon . Cassia cinnamon from Vietnam and/or Indonesia is cheaper , but contains more coumarin and too much is not healthy for you .....
5 #### The variety pack is great . No issues at all and will continue to re order
5 #### This is the best tasting tea we 've ever had , but now it 's so hard to find in the grocery stores - even though they have a ton of other flavors . Thank goodness for Amazon ! We are all tea drinkers in the family , but this is the only flavor we can all agree on . Our tea shelves are filled with many different types of tea , but we buy so many boxes of this at a time half of one shelf is just all this type - that 's how much we love it !
3 #### taste is strong . hard to get use to it . I wish that you can make apple , fennel , carrots in one bag . stomach cancer , blood pressure will help 3 kinds of ingredients .
5 #### I purchased Mahamosa Ginger Cinnamon Spice loose tea . Frankly Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice is far better in depth of flavor . Love this on those cold winter evening .
4 #### This is a style of coconut I ca n't find in stores . I love this for home - made granola or mixing in trail mixes . I appreciate that it is free of sulphites ( which I am allergic to ) , unlike most coconut preparations .
5 #### I love adding these fruit flavored bags to my green tea . I love iced tea , and these taste really good , very flavorful .
5 #### I like the taste very much and it 's caffeine - free . Has beautiful aroma
5 #### One of my favorite teas ... love finding it at a reduced price ! A bit of sweetener enhances the blueberry fruity taste ( I would not like it without sweetener ) . Iced version when warm ; hot when chilly outside .
5 #### Excellent tea and best price I have found anywhere . We have gone through 2 boxes this winter . My husband loves it and he is not usually a fan of herbal teas . The ginger and lemon taste really fresh , also so good for you if you have upset tummy or a cold . Good just plain or sweetened with honey etc .
5 #### This is my absolute favorite tea ! ! Cinnamon is definitely the predominant flavor , which I adore ! It reminds me of chai only better .
5 #### I bought Tension Tamer , just because I was curious , because I ve heard so many great things . The flavor is actually nice , its mostly minty and there s a subtle citrusy flavor .
5 #### these are good for you .. i like adding them to coconut milk .....

5 #### This is my second bag that I have purchased from this company . I love to munch on these chips while watching t.v . They are yummy and fresh tasting . Shipment was prompt . I will continue to buy from this company and item .
4 #### Tension Tamer is one of the teas I have purchased regularly for years . I do not drink it everyday , just when under stress . I like how it tastes and it helps to feel calm and relaxed . It is good for drinking at work since it does not cause drowsiness . I try to avoid products with unspecified " natural flavors " , which this product does list as an ingredient ; however , I purchase this anyway because I like it . Rating of 4.5 stars rounded down to 4 .
5 #### This tea was such an excellent price . Its one of my favorites . Very happy
5 #### This is a very delicious Camomile tea at a great price . It is heavily wrapped to keep the product fresh . I 'd buy it in even larger quantities if they made larger boxes , but it works with this size as I just buy more of the small boxes . The price is one of the best for this type of tea .
5 #### I have had a cough for months now , some days good and some days bad . This ginger lemon tea helps to soothe my throat and ease my cough . It taste great with some honey which is how I drink it . You could taste both the lemon and ginger in this tea .
5 #### great size bag . also appreciate that they are no added sugar
5 #### I use this in my trail mix I make instead of buying it mixed already . It makes a lot of mix and to keep the rest flavorful I put it in the freezer . Great taste of coconut and not a sweetened product for us diabetics !
2 #### this is a bag of coconut chips . Seems obvious . But unless you toast coocnut , its really just for a topping . This is a 1 lb . bag of coconut topping . That being said , the quality of the chips were ok .
2 #### I thought they would be thicker , very thinly sliced , would be better if twice as thick . Sweet to the taste , I used them anyway .
5 #### I ordered this product and got 1 # of coconut chips from SincerelyNuts.com --- I'm guessing either Barry Farm works with this company , or it was a substitution . Anyway , I LOVE this product ! Unlike others reviewing this , I do n't use these for myself . I give them to my dogs as treats . And they ADORE these coconut chips ! I used to get coconut chips from another supplier , but the chips were small while these are BIG and terrific ! I am very satisfied with this product and will certainly get more .
5 #### I needed to make granola for gifts , and needed a big bag . A good price and it arrived the next day !
5 #### I bought these because I did not want the regular shavings in my granola . These are perfect . The would be good in any baking project or decorating ( cakes , cupcakes , puddings , etc etc ) . They toast up in the granola very nicely . Not that great for eating straight out of the bag though .
4 #### Bengal Spice used to be my all time favorite , but the new white box changed the recipe and it 's not as good . It used to be 5 stars , now it 's about 3.5
4 #### These are tasty but a bit on the crumbly side , turn powdery in yr hand . Useful in cooking , esp . Cakes & frosting .
5 #### This is perfect for making coconut almond brittle . Thing is , I found the same coconut at Kroger for $ 2.99 . I have never seen it until I ordered it online ! It is just so easy to order on Amazon Prime :) .
5 #### This was a terrific buy and very fresh as well . Intended to use it exclusively for baking , but we couldn ' t resist digging in and topping our ice cream with it as well . Yummy
5 #### So great to be able to shop for product on line . Unable to purchase product in my area because it is so small . Coconut chip were fresh and tasted great .
3 #### too dry and could be tastier . I ve used other ones and these chips were either old and not fresh or just not the best sorry .
5 #### Nothing you do n't want , just pure , great tasting coconut . Very clean , good taste & quality . I recommend removing the coconut from the plastic bag & storing in a glass or BPA free plastic container .
4 #### Thought these were going to be more like the large chunks of coconut that are slightly sweetened that I love . These are plain coconut chips . I 'm using them in my morning smoothies for extra fiber .....
5 #### these lasted me FOREVER ! such a huge bag ! i stored in my freezer and used when I needed it . recommend .
5 #### Ten bucks a pound is a lot for cocoanut , and this is not an everyday purchase , but the quality is premium . Unsweetened chips of exactly the right thickness and dimensions . It makes a good snack straight out of the package , toasts beautifully and works well in trail mixes raw .
5 #### Like the tea , I always drink tea before bed so this is perfect
5 #### I like this tea . Very tasty hot drink for when you do n't want caffeine .
5 #### This is my favorite tea . AMAZING taste at a great price for a case box . Even got my parents hooked on this when I gave them a sample .
5 #### We love this sampler pack of fruit teas . The variety is a nice mix and each flavor is tasty . Price is below local market and delivery is fast and convenient .
5 #### GOT THIS FOR THE HOLIDAYS & WINTER SEASON - WE ARE ENJOYING
5 #### My daughter - in - law got some in NYcity , and when I searched online , I got them cheaper and package was delivered to the door . This is an awesome product .
5 #### This product was delivered promptly without problems . I found the coconut to be exactly what I needed . It is not actually chips , but rather thick and wide strips of delicious , moist coconut . Yum !
5 #### I was so happy to find sugar free unsweetened coconut chips . They are really filling and the bag seems to go on forever . I have ordered this 2 times now and will make it a part of my pantry as long as they sell it !
3 #### The flavor of the tea is lemon and ginger , just enough of both to satisfy your craving . Also , a good tea to help with digestive issues and a sore throat . I drink it as a pick me up because ginger is also a natural energizer .
5 #### I got the Jammin Lemon Ginger tea and it 's really nice . It 's a great balance of just enough lemon with ginger . You can smell the ginger in the background , but it 's not over powering . The lemon adds a nice tartness but not too sour . I drink it all day during that time of the month and I swear , it 's really helped with the pain .
5 #### this tea is a hit - flavorful too . am ordering more
5 #### great tea great price but why does the peach teach have ( & lists on individual package ) 3 tew bags and not 4 ? i use this for iced tea and i use 2 teabags per 20 oz container of hot water so it is a bit of a pain but still the tea is great so i can deal with it
5 #### Absolutely delicious tea . A family favorite . Highly recommend . Does not even need a sweetener it is so good .
5 #### Just trying the Roastaroma flavor for the first time and I LOVE IT . Nice for these arctic winter nights when I want a subtle coffee taste and warmness but no caffeine . Seriously this tea is great , my new fave .
5 #### My every night bedtime libation . Love the value ! Many tea bags at a fair price . Will re - order
3 #### I PURCHASED FOR A FRIEND . SHE ONLY LIKED THE PEACH . FAIR PRICE . FAST SHIPPING .
4 #### I do n't care for the taste , but I like how it makes me feel . It 's not sweet , ( I love sweet teas ! ) but if you add a dash of honey , it 's a lovely taste . It 's very soothing .
5 #### Loooove this tea . Flavor is delicious and so relaxing for a bed time drink .
2 #### While the tea is n't bad , the issue with Celestial Seasonings now is the tea bag itself . I have noted for a good while how poorly their tea bags have been constructed . Cheaper ... Cheaper ... Cheaper for years now . Out of the sampler pack , I have had several bags that ca n't hold up to steeping and the bag breaks and spills the leaves all over the cup . I 'm done with Celestial Seasonings because of their bags . Also , I do like tea bags that have a string attached so you are able to pull out the bag without a spoon . That 's the one thing I never really cared for with Celestial Seasongings
5 #### I 'm not supposed to have caffeine so finding something I like is hard . I 've never liked chamomile before not really exciting . But with vanilla and honey flavor it
5 #### Damn , this is great tea . Sweetened and hot , it soothes the soul and warms the body . I 've been buying this a while and wo n't stop .
1 #### Not as expected . I thought they were k.cups this is powered tea , not even real tea I have just given it all away . was a tea drinker I wo n't drink this rubbish
5 #### I 've always liked Celestial Seasonings fruit teas . Really nice for a break mid - day , when I really do n't need more caffeine .
5 #### I needed this ( along with other ingredients ) for making home made gripe water . Worked like a charm for a fraction of the store cost and no artificial stuff added . I also use just this alone for my kids when their stomachs are upset . Nice alternative to store meds with artificial ingredients and dyes . I drink it myself because it tastes amazing . I add local honey and it 's perfect .
5 #### I use Celestial Seasoning Sampler teas when I 'm detoxing . I like the variety and it taste great with a natural sweetener .
5 #### Because this is the only place I can find black walnut pieces that I need to make a family favorite cookie called " Chess Pies . " I scoured Manhattan to no avail .
2 #### I have craved the flavor of eating black walnuts for years , so I placed an order here when I saw them available . I was disappointed at the stale flavor and lack of the slight , sweet cherry taste at the back of my palate that I remember when eating these as a child . The price was not inexpensive for this experiment either !
4 #### Reach for these ! Nice chunky bag of black walnuts . They are versatile and have been used in oatmeal and muffins in our house . The price seemed reasonable .
4 #### I like all the flavors , but not sure what " natural " flavoring really is .
4 #### The cherry / berry flavor is delicious , especially iced . I keep a pitcher in my frig and sip some all day . It 's refreshing even iced in cold weather .
5 #### yes it is a full 6 boxes of teas ... was a bit worried but yep and I just love these .. thanks tons
5 #### GREAT PRODUCT , FAST DELIVERY , THANK YOU WILL ORDER AGAIN SOON .
5 #### Love this tea with honey and milk , but good by itself as well .
5 #### This is my favorite tea ! Perfect mellow tea to drink hot or cold .
5 #### My kids love this tea and so do I ! It smells like fall and fall is my favorite . Love it ! !
5 #### If you have n't tried this one , you must . Just opening the box you smells cookie ! It 's not a sweet tea ( to me ) but the flavor is awesome
5 #### Best tea ever if you like flavor ! You do n't even need sweetener becaus the flavor is so robust . Try it with a splash of cream . If you like your tea weak , this probably is n't for up unless you just dunk it a few times .
5 #### I love this stuff ! I make a big batch of it and put it in the fridge to drink on ice later . It 's delicious ! Perfect summer drink .
5 #### my favorite herbal tea . I have a cup most nights .
5 #### This was a fantastic value , but if it creeps up in price I wo n't buy it again .
5 #### Celestial knocked it out the park with this tea blend . I like to drink it iced , slightly sweetened . But the flavor is inviting and calming . Really good tea !
4 #### Wife started drinking tea instead of soda and enjoys the variety .
5 #### Glad I found this . I looked all over for this chili base and could not find . I add this to my chili , nacho meat , taco meat and it adds awesome flavor . Get alot of compliments when I use this .
5 #### This is a great addition to your chili ! Adds good flavor , not to spicy , just perfect . I love all of the " Better Than Boullion products " this one is perfect .. enjoy !
5 #### Love this brand ! Have been drinking this cham . tea for years on and off . Great for upset tummy , anxiety , and insomnia . Flavor is great .
5 #### I love the flavor of the true blueberry tea .
5 #### Love this stuff . I add a bit of stevia .
3 #### Tasty but if you leave it sitting for a day or three it 's likely to start growing mold . Ok , that 's not the way one is supposed to ' eat ' tea but I do . I guess I 'm spoiled by the natural [ ? ] antibioticity of Bigelow orange flavored herbal tea which will sit for a day or three and never mold .
5 #### I use my usual tea bags and then add a couple of these to the jar when making sun tea and it comes out delicious ! My favorites for iced tea are the peach and mixed berry , but they are all very good . Of course these are also very good hot , but much better iced , in my opinion .
5 #### I like being able to try several teas without having to commit to a full box of each . I am enjoying most of the teas in this sampler .
5 #### This is my husbands favorite tea and he 's been drinking it for years . It has a sweet but robust taste - we will continue to order this product .
5 #### I love this stuff ! It 's been my favorite for nearly a decade . I start every morning with a cup of Tazo Chai tea . Stir in some milk and a bit of sugar and it 's perfect . It 's spicy and bold . Perfect to wake up with .
5 #### It 's a feel good tea . When you need a little something different this light cinnamon taste and smell is so comfortable and enjoyable . Sometimes adding a little milk and sugar is good and sometimes just plain is good . Have n't tried it iced yet but I 'm thinking in summer I will . We recently switched to tea after noon ... replacing the afternoon pot of coffee . Sometimes I like it so much I think I may give up coffee . Will have to try the other varieties made by Tazo Chai ... there is a wake up one that might completely replace my coffee .
5 #### Tazo Chai tea in the filter bag has an aroma and taste I love . I also drink Stash Chai , but I prefer Tazo Chai because it adds a small and pleasant bite . That may be because its spices include pepper and anise . I fix it every morning , 14 oz . at a time , using one or two tea bags ( depending on how sparky I feel at the time ) . I add two bags of Splenda and two ounces of skim milk . The result is 16 oz . of pure , low - calorie pleasure .
5 #### FAAVORITE TEA OF ALL TIME . I have a massive stock pile of this though because they only sale it at christmas time . Its great to add to a different tea as well to give it a little bit sweeter taste
5 #### I do n't drink coffee , so this is my preferred morning boost
5 #### Love this tea . I was introduced to it from my Aunt . It 's spicy and sweet . I enjoy it before bed or when having sweet cravings .
5 #### keeping my son healthy at college , plus he plays sports n do n't want him eatin to much junk buy em
5 #### Good pumpkin seeds , tasty and fresh , not to mention healthy . Reasonable price , too , so I was happy with my purchase .
5 #### The bag was much larger than I anticipated , still going through it . According to DR . OZ , pepitos or pumpkin seeds are a great source of fiber and a good way to loose weight . I mix these into salads , into trail mix , or as just a quick snack at my desk . The seeds are NOT salted , which is great because I like to monitor salt on my food anyway - this way you are not left with overly salty ( and unhealthy ) snacks . Great Value and Great Taste !
3 #### These are good quality pumpkin seeds . Virtually all of the seeds are whole seeds ( vs. some companies where the seeds are broken and cracked ) . I have no complaint about the seed quality , but the shipping costs from this seller are high even if you order a number of items together . Ordering just one or two items is out of the question because shipping costs are so high . On the plus side , the costs for many of their items are very low , so it can cancel out the high shipping . Be aware that if you order more than one item at a time in the same order , shipping is reduced on a per item basis , so take that into consideration when you see over $ 10 shipping for a couple tiny items !
1 #### This product is loaded with salt ! Why do they need to add so much salt ? It was disgusting I threw it out , waste of money !
4 #### Very satisfied with this product , I would definetely recommend it . But it does have a lot of salt in it , but it also has a lot of flavor .
5 #### I have had good experience with other Better Than Bouillon products , so was drawn to try the Chili Base . I used two ( 2 ) tablespoons as the exclusive seasonings in two quarts of ingredients that included home - canned plain tomato sauce , 1.3 pounds of ground round , a can of thoroughly rinsed mild chili beans , and 1/2 cup each of chopped onion , green pepper , and celery . The addition of the Chili Base took the pot from bland ground beef soup to bright - colored tasty chili that I will be proud to serve to anyone . This is well worth the investment . Please note that the suggestions on the jar said use 4 ( four ) tablespoons of Chili Base in about that amount of chili -- half that amount is plenty for my taste , besides making it more cost effective .
5 #### The only thing that surprised me was the size . Bought the chicken Bouillon and the jar is much larger . Does have a great chili taste . Without having to make a big chili bowl , I can add a teaspoon of this to pork or beef in a sandwich and have the chili taste . Works nice on eggs too . Adds variety .
4 #### There is nothing quite like this for improving your chili . I make chili with a recipe from America 's Test Kitchen , which is good , but then add a tablespoonful or 2 of this product . It moves the chili right up into excellent .
5 #### This tea is awesome at soothing a sore or gassy stomach . Great mix of lemon and ginger ; I prefer to others I 've tried .
5 #### I love this tea , which is rarely available in grocery stores . I add almond milk and honey for my own version of chai , with no caffeine .
5 #### This tea is so amazing ! It truly tastes like sugar cookies . I hope they NEVER get rid of this flavor . With a little stevia ? Heaven ! Not just for the holidays .
5 #### This is a great , flavorful tea . I love it after meals to aid digestion . It is also very helpful to have around if you are getting a cold . I add some honey to it and it soothes the throat and helps clear sinuses . I like the " bite " at the end of a cup from the ginger .
5 #### Love the Herbal Tea Sampler . It discovered that the peach herbal tea was one of my favorite teas . Highly recommend .
5 #### I love the product and the timely manner in which it arrived . Thank you
5 #### I really like this tea . It has all the spiciness one would expect from a chai tea , but it 's not so much that it just tastes like spices ( like some other teas out there such as yogi ) . I always add almond or soy milk and a little bit of sugar , because otherwise it is too bitter .
5 #### The flavor is just what I was looking for . I brew the tea 5 minutes in one cup of boiling water and heat a cup of whole milk inthe microwave and pour together -- NO sugar . It is a great pick me up .
5 #### this and a jug of honey soothes sore throats . the ginger is pronounced but it 's very good . it 's not candy - sweet ginger , decent amount of spice .
5 #### great for when you feel sick or need to brighten your mood , always keep handy
1 #### I love Celestial Sleepy Time Peach tea so I had a high hope for this tea . But what a disappointment ! No peach and just grassy bland flavor . I do n't know if Amazon had a stale batch but this was the worst teach I 've had from Celestial .
5 #### The fruit sampler I got is delicious and such a good deal too . However make sure not to leave a tea bag for too long , best to remove it after 3 - 5 minutes depending on how strong you like your tea . Otherwise a tea will become really bitter ..
5 #### I love this ! I have tried other brands . But Celestial has really honed their craft on this flavor . The candy disc of peppermint that you see on the box is the flavor they seemed to have achieved . I like to use their tea for making ICED peppermint tea . I use 3 bags , in a cup of water from the tea kettle . Then I pour it over ice in a stainless steal cup and it comes out to be 19 oz of tea ! It is so cooling and refreshing to drink here in the SOUTH on hot days ! And the 40 bag box helps it last longer before getting a new one opened . Plus I am ordering this on Subscribe and Save which gets me 6 boxes and t great price ! i wish they could make a little stronger tea , or bigger box .. ha !
5 #### I LOVE ICED PEACH GREEN TEA from the " Star Mermaid Place " I 've found the perfect way to make my own using this . a. Put 4 peach tea bags and boiling water in a 1 CANNING JAR , b. 1/2 full strainer bucket of GREEN TEA and boiling water in 2nd CANNING JAR . Leave the peach tea bags in the jar even after it 's in the fridge . c. Steep GREEN TEA all day making sure water saturated the strainer . ( You can get another strong jar of GREEN TEA that evening by spooning out a bit of the tea , mixing the leaves up and steeping the strainer again until desired strength . ) Refrigerate 3 jars . ( I use press & seal instead of the lids . ) Morning : 1/3 Green Tea , ( more if you like + + caffeine ) 1/3 Peach Tea , 1/3 cold water over ice in cup . I add 2 pks of Stevia and stir and enjoy !
5 #### I do turn to Amazon for some of these specialty products as it can be easier than finding a store that carries them and then travelling there and then poking around to find what I need ... even tho I am a hobby shopper ! I wanted this tea to see whether it could help clear my vocal cords which seem to think they still have a rotten cold that left the rest of me weeks ago . I do n't know whether that will work - hate singing in choir with a raspy voice - but can report that this box of tea is delightfully fresh with a code date somewhere in 2018 and it makes a cup of tea that has no caffeine but great zing hot or cold . Most pleased .
5 #### I love the smell of cinnamon and apple and when i brew this it feels like holiday anytime of the year .
5 #### Delicious . Love the smooth black cherry flavor . This flavor is my normal morning tea . No lemon or honey needed . The multi - pak boxes are convenient , though not cheaper than I could get at a local store .
5 #### Delicious . I loved it . I will definitely purchase this again .
4 #### Four star as I do n't think they are as strong as they used to be . Enjoy them , but the zing in the zinger is not quite the same .
5 #### Love this tea , especially in the evening with milk . Naturally sweet and reduces any urge to snack . Good price and delivery .
4 #### I really enjoy this tea . It actually makes a nice iced herbal tea and it 's fantastic for a cold or upset tummy . Its is not overly tart but stull has a nice rich lemon flavor coming from several sources , lemongrass gives it an umusualfullness of flavor , a spectrum of lemonyness . The ginger is zippy and prominent but not overwhelming . Other herbs round out the taste making a complex but pleasant flavor . I 've sweetened it with everything from honey to sugar to agave to Stevia , it 's tastes great with them all . I wish celestial seasoning sold small travel tins or pouches as I often carry tea with me , and I also wish they had a string and tag on their teas , makes it easier to remove after brewing . .
5 #### love the product , use it everyday for extra flavor in soup , stews , to spice up vegetables
5 #### I 've tried a lot of herbal teas , and in my opinion , this is your best bet if you ca n't drink real tea for some reason . No caffeine , wo n't stain your teeth . Tastes a little like the Constant Comment I used to enjoy .
5 #### Love the variety and the convenience of delivery right to my door
5 #### Good as iced tea also . I use three bags to 5 cups of water . It makes a slightly sweet drink with no sugar .
5 #### This tea is better than most chais and it has no calories , sugar or caffeine in it .
5 #### This stuff is guilt free Kool - aid if you cold brew it , I 'm sure even kids would love it . Perfect for spring and summer , super refreshing , not too sweet but does n't need sweetener .
5 #### best tea , , no cafine but taste is out of this world ... and healthy for you .... https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000E63LDS/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0?th=1
5 #### I just love it and ordered since I was geting the pomegranate Pizazz .
5 #### Very good blueberry herbal tea at a great price .
1 #### Do not confuse this " Blueberry Tea " with the previous formulation ! There is no similarity . Up to quite recently , this brand had a box with blueberries portrayed on the right side : This tea was easily worth 5 stars , and it was a staple of mine for several years . Last month , I ordered five boxes of this tea [ from a different site which portrayed the original box ] , but only one of the boxes had this design . The other four had a river - running bear with a Disneylike background . The tea " blend " was appalling ! Although there was scant uniformity between the colour / flavour of the various packets , not one of the 6 packets so far used has even remotely approached the previous formulation in taste . Two of the six were poured down the sink after the first sip . The rest were rather reluctantly drunk , but none warranted a second steeping , unlike their predecessor .
5 #### Chamomile helps my digestion . I like these tea bags after a meal , especially a heavy meal . These are caffeine free . I found Celestial to be among the bet tea brands in the market today , if not the best . Price is great on Amazon , and I save money by subscribing to it every other month . Thanks !
5 #### Love this tea and the price was good too .
5 #### My favorite tea in the whole wide world ! This flavor is hard to find locally so I order a large quantity . Flavors are very hearty and comforting
2 #### Not as good a flavor as I thought ... But good company to buy from .
1 #### It is a big bag for teapot not for a cup of tea . Not easy to store either
5 #### I love Celestial Seasonings peach tea , and buying it by the case on Amazon is just so convenient .
5 #### great tea with wonderful , fruity tastes ! loved it ! need to get more !
5 #### I had this tea while visiting my sister . We had dined out and although I had a wonderful meal , it left my stomach feeling bloated and painful . Had a cup of this tea and felt good as new in 10 - 15 minutes . One teabag brews a strong cup of tea .
5 #### I am planning on doing sweet pickles next year and wanted to have whatever amount of alum I needed on hand
4 #### I like this combination of caffeine free sampler however many of the different tea 's in this Tea Sampler contain Hibiscus so if you do not like Hibiscus you may wish to stay away from this box of samplers . The label is a bit misleading . They taste great though .
5 #### Bought it for my sister - in - law who has had a serious sore throat and cough for months . This was the only thing that brought her any relief and she had been to the dr and had lots of tests .
5 #### Excellent anti - deer spray . I mix two table spoons with water in a windex size sprayer and spray once a week . Deer have not bothered the plants since the first taste .
5 #### I 've been getting this tea for years , and we just love it . Great , robust flavor and it 's nice to have a decaf chai option .
4 #### I wish it was more lemon and less ginger but it smells great and tastes fine
5 #### Love this Tension Tamer Tea ! Makes me relaxed but not sleepy . Have used it for years and it is better than any prescribed meds for Stress . Lowers my BP too . Bought 6 boxes at a great price on Amazon as it 's hit or miss to find in a store .
5 #### Looking forward to trying my hand at tanning this fall with cooler weather .
4 #### It is what it is . McCormicks is a lot better ! ! !
4 #### My brother loves this stuff -- no longer carried by local grocery stores !
5 #### LOVE this flavor with honey . Have to be careful not to overdo it , if you 're drinking a single cup , cut it in half . Ginger flavor may be a bit strong , otherwise .
5 #### Good stuff , it dissolved in water pretty fast and completely .
5 #### The best lemon ginger tea from a bag that I 've ever had . It helps that lemon verbena is my favorite herb , hands down . No weird chemical flavors , and no overpowering THIS IS LEMON GUYS . Good to soothe a troubled stomach , or to soothe an active mind as you head to sleep .
5 #### Got it in the mail real fast . Nice fine crystals better than the photo shows
5 #### Has a really strong ginger flavor and that ginger bite . If you 're a fan of ginger , you 'll like this tea . The lemon is a nice subtle underlying flavor and supplements the ginger without overpowering it . I drink this after every meal instead of having dessert , and the flavor is really good and strong enough that I really do n't crave anything sweet afterwards , which helps with the waistline .
5 #### Absolutely love this tea . It 's very tasteful and flavorful , and has palatable aroma . I seep 1 - 2 teabags in hot water , ( depending on the level of potency I desire ) , cover and allow to brew for 5 - 10 mins . I then add less than a teaspoon of honey , stir and enjoy . Sometimes I combine with Peppermint teabag ; Depending on how much stronger I want it , I do n't hesitate to place a pinch of powdered ginger in it -- Love it !
5 #### Nice assortment of herb teas all in one package .
5 #### I was about to give up on ever finding an herbal tea , or ANY hot tea , I liked . I bought this one when I was looking at some of the other Yogi teas . I like licorice ( REAL licorice , not that Twizzlers junk ) , so I had high hopes . Hopes were n't dashed ! This is a really good tea ! If you do n't like licorice , then there 's probably something wrong with you ... sorry . I like licorice and do n't really understand why it gets a bad rep . This is also one of the few herbal teas that I did n't immediately pour down the drain . Most herbal teas taste awful to me . I was raised in the South ( US ) on Sweet Iced Tea , so I never developed that mysterious " hot tea " palate . Growing up , if someone was drinking hot tea , they were probably sick and nursing a cold or something . This tea also has a slightly sweet flavor and aftertaste , so I did n't need to add my usual 3 - 4 teaspoons of sugar to make it drinkable . I 'm able to drink it sans sugar . Another plus !
5 #### My son needed a pound of alum for a project and I thought I was going to have to spend a fortune on dozens of the spice - aisle - size bottles . So glad I found this package .
5 #### I absolutely love this tea . It is bursting with blueberry flavor and has a nice tartness , too . I like my tea strong and use 2 tea bags . If you love blueberries , you must try this tea .
5 #### Really good tea . More like a treat than a tea , tons of flavor
5 #### If you want a tea with a smooth flavor , no caffeine , try this ! It does not taste like coffee , however , it is a really close substitute . If you 're trying to cut down on coffee or avoid it , try this ! !
5 #### use for making pickles great price . , in stores 1.9 oz is over 3.00 . great saving .
4 #### I tried using this Alum to recharge an old battery . Got the process from YouTube but it just did not work for me .
5 #### It has a unique taste to it and odd but i feel in love with it after a few cups . Great tea
5 #### Amazing flavors ! I have these when I want a dessert but do n't want to eat sugar , and I sometimes add some drops of stevia to sweeten them to a perfect fruity flavor . Every flavor of these is great . At first I did n't like the cherry and peach as much as the others but now I like them all .
5 #### YUM ! Add a bit of sweetener and some milk for a lovely tasting chai tea . I will definitely keep ordering this .
4 #### love this tea , but do n't like the fact that it was n't cello - wrapped . anytime i ve ever bought teas they have always been wrapped in plastic - so i threw it out . there is no safety seal on it either , so i wo n't drink it . do n't know if someone opened it & returned it .... better safe than sorry - wont take the chance
5 #### I love this stuff . It requires more water ( IMHO ) than my usual tea , but that 's because of the robust cinnamon flavor .
5 #### Love this tea ! Very strong and sweet and fruity , as you 'd expect
5 #### I bought this for my mom . But only because she drank all of mine . This is a favorite for both of us . Has a wonderful spice mixture that is wonderfully warming on a winter night . Caffeine free . Try it , you will like it .
4 #### In my quest for celestial 's k - cups for the Keurig brewer I happened to see this box of fruit tea bags on Amazon and thought I 'd write a review . I bought a box of these in a local store and the flavors are very good . I like my tea on the strong side so I do let the bag steep for about 5 minutes in very hot water that I heat in the microwave first . It 's too bad that none of these flavors are available in k - cups or that they do n't have the string attached to the bag or I would order them on a regular basis - for this reason only I took one star away ! The string that I mention makes it less messy to remove the tea bag from the cup .
3 #### Okay , I am a fairly new recruit to the " bases " for cooking . They have some MSG , but no added / additional MSG , so the amounts have been low enough to not cause problems . ( My husband gets migraines from MSG . ) We love most of the flavors , and I was anxious to try this one as well . They do n't carry anything but beef and chicken in our local stores , so all the other flavors have to be purchased online . That makes them very expensive to use , since the shipping is never cheap for these heavy little glass jars . I made a batch of New England style clam chowder last week and used the clam base . I was looking forward to a real clam - intense flavor from the base that would be more than the milk / cream combo . It was VERy disappointing . I used enough of the product , but I would have had to double it to get any taste , in my opinion . I did n't want to do that , since I do n't know what other flavor tweak it might have caused to have double the recommended amount . Over all , I love all the bases ( the chili is amazing ! ) , but the clam leaves a lot to be desired . I also have a lobster , so the next time I make the chowder , I 'll try it with lobster base instead . This one is just too " blah " to be useful for very much . I do n't think I 'll buy it again .
4 #### This Clam Base , besides being expensive , is not the best but it does the job intended , which is add clam flavor to culinary creations . Bought it because of the price but when I discovered it was only 8 oz I realized why the low price tag . Worked fine on several dishes , a little intense in the sodium content but overall it delivered more quality of flavor . I normally buy Minor 's Clam Base because it helps me to prepare a really fine seafood chowder . As of late I use the very same ingredients that go on a Boston Clam Chowder but I add lots of fresh seafood . It comes out creamy white , with diced potatoes , celery , onions , peas , carrots , corn and it taste very nice . I used the Better than Boullion Clam Base for pasta dishes , soups and more , and it delivered to a certain point that special flavor that clam juice or base can only deliver . More like a 3.8 I settled on 4 Stars .
5 #### This is my favorite holiday tea . I have been drinking it for three years . Excellent choice for those who want the taste of sugar cookies without the calories of them . Tastes just like them ! It 's my go - to when I feel I want something sweet . Hard to find in my local stores and am very glad that Amazon carries it . Delish !
5 #### My husband and I got hooked on this tea during our recent long lasting cold . The tea is very refreshing even if we are n't ill . I find I am able to drink more fluids since I enjoy this tea so much . I used to have difficulty getting hydrated because I typically do n't like liquids unless I 'm thirsty which is n't often . But I will drink this tea ! So I how have it on my subscribe and save to get even better pricing .
5 #### I used this product for my elderly aunt 's pickle recipe . It made the pickles very crisp . Much better price than in the grocery store .
5 #### The absolute BEST relaxation tea anyone could ever hope for . Pure magic in a cup . Every sip you can taste a different herb coming through to the surface . I * really * hope they never stop making this ! ! ! ! My grocery store ran out of tension tamer , so I ordered from this seller and got a free collectible tin in the box . Nice !
5 #### So convenient . I suffer from IBS and I experience a little discomfort on an empty stomach , but not this seller or item 's fault . An aftermeal delight .
4 #### Great product . I use this in white clam sauce made from scratch . Great in New England clam chowder too . Even a ramen soup . This puts the finishing touch on many seafood recipes .
4 #### Add to water before tossing in asian noodles and fresh veggies . Nice .
5 #### This is better than using clam juice for making linguine with clams . A real flavor booster . True to it 's name .
4 #### Amazing in rice , but a little saltier than expected .
5 #### I use this to make awesome seafood sauce . Salty , so no added salt when cooking . Salt to taste at the table .
5 #### This is to die for ! ! ! ! ! Really adds to any seafood dish you are making ! Highly recommend this product ! Yummy !
4 #### Wife has made Lobster Bisque three times since our trip to Maine . This is helpful for getting a flavorful base . She gets the lobster meat out of the shell and then boils the shells in this lobster base in water . This will last a while . Storing in refrigerator after opening .
5 #### I have no had an opportunity to use the Clam Base yet , but anticipate it will be as good as the rest of the Better Than products ! I was very tired of spending $ 3 for an 8 - oz bottle of clam nectar , and saw this product , and Wow !
5 #### I 'd been using Kosher salt for my pretzels and the flavor was ok , but they just did n't seem right . Picked up this salt and it 's really completed the recipe . The salt sticks well has the right " salitness " and looks great . I know looks do n't matter so much , but the kosher salt would kind of blend in and you could n't even see it . Kind of sad when the pretzel does n't look salty . This stuff is great !
5 #### Excellent flavor and less salt , it is all good .
4 #### Flavor profile is good but the color is far too dark , your NE chowder will have an tan color . Hope they can reduce the dark color .
5 #### here is an item that is impossible to find in stores . if you make homemade pretzels at home , this salt is the way to go , it is the salt that is found on commercially made pretzels , they grains are large but give a nice crunch without being hard on your teeth .
5 #### This is very good salt for pretzels just the right size and taste for all you pretzels lovers , enjoy this
5 #### This salt is not limited to just pretzels . The texture is good - not to course , but definetly better than table salt . I was looking for a courser salt for use in baking and cooking and this salt was excellent for use on bread items .
5 #### Nice alternative for black tea when you are pregnant and ca n't have as much caffeine as you are used to .
3 #### This salt has the right size and shape for Lye Pretzels . I bought it together with the Lye . The reason I gave it only THREE stars is that the shipping charge was several times the cost of the product and THAT was not made clear . GOOD Product , Lousy price .
5 #### This is a great tea for damp and chilly days . The orange spice blend it tasty and soothing . I am a big fan of Celestial Seasonings teas . It would also be lovely as an iced tea in summer .
3 #### Definitely tastes like clams , albeit a bit light on the flavor .
5 #### Have used these bases for years . Restaurant quality at home quickly .
5 #### This is the secret ingredient that most restaurants use , i think .. Great flavor addition
5 #### This is the best for gumbo and most seafood dishes requiring bouillon .
5 #### This stuff is great for flavoring soups . I use it to flavor my seafood chowder . Everyone loves it !
2 #### Just go to Red Lobster . This would please lower income families , if they could afford it .
3 #### This really did n't work for me . Very salty and the lobster flavor was not to my liking
5 #### Looks and tastes more like bouillon versus the salty dehydrated stuff .
5 #### This is the best alternative to clam juice I have found . My store wo n't carry the brand I prefer , instead carrying one that is very watered down , so this is now my new go - to .
3 #### I tried it - and it was ok , I was n't bowled over - the other Better than products ( chicken & beef ) are great
5 #### If you are making a clam chowder or seafood chowder this is the cherry on top of the ice cream . Using clam broth and cream as well as the seafood and other ingredients makes a nice chowder ....... but add a bit of this and you have an exceptional flavor enhancer .
5 #### This was a tea I found several years ago in a local store and then never found again . Well now I have some . I ordered in a supply . I love this tea . Thanks
1 #### The Jammin ' Lemon Ginger tea tastes like some kind of housecleaning product . Kind of a lemony pinesol if you will . Adding sugar or honey does not improve the flavor . If I want lemon ginger tea in the future , I 'm going back to the Yogi lemon ginger tea which I find has a much better flavor without reminding me in the slightest of floor cleaners .
5 #### I love this brand and all the flavors available . Makes great Clam Chowder soup . For me it it not just " Better " but perfect bouillon . I never waste a can of broth anymore-- make exactly what I need . For me , it tastes much better , and depending upon what I am making , I can make it as strong or as weak as I want . I introduced my adult children to BTB -- they love it too .
5 #### This is the best stuff for chowders , but it 's hard to find around grocery stores , even in New England . Glad to find it here , even if it is priced too high .
5 #### Great stuff ! Makes fantastic gravy , broth , soups etc . You can adjust the strength to your taste . I highly recommend trying this brand for different flavors too ... I 'm very satisfied with the quality and receive many compliments on my gravy , broth , soups etc .
5 #### It was nice to get this while deployed to a FOB in Afghanistan .
4 #### product is great . tastes great . packaging great . But for the quantity the price is too high .
5 #### Delicious and soothing . I will surely order this again .
4 #### This tea is so sweet and spicy , yum ! It is already loosing its flavor after just about 6 months though , I even have been keeping it in a glass jar .
5 #### My favorite herb tea , great anytime . Guests love it and always want the name . Hard to find in my grocery stores now for some reason . Happy I can get it from Amazon .
5 #### This is so great . I do n't cook enough fresh lobster or shrimp so this is wonderful stock .
4 #### Not as " clammy " as I expected , but much easier to use than clam juice and more versatile , since it can be made as intense as you want . Quite expensive , but will keep .
5 #### Just what I wanted , the quality I expected , shipped fast !
3 #### Their cashews are some of the best , but these fall short for me . Not as purely buttery as i ve found before . These have like a tree bark ( maybe shell dust ? ) Flavor to them . Maybe this is what stale is ? I do n't know , but wish I did
5 #### This flavor is outstanding and will enrich the dishes you make . We love homemade clam chowder , and this makes it divine ! Great in clam dip also and fish stew .
4 #### Pricey but No one sells this locally . Good stuff , all the flavors of this brand .
5 #### Perfect blend ! I love the warm taste of this tea . It also tastes great with honey and a little splash of milk .
5 #### I have a cup or two of this every evening after dinner . I absolutely love it !
5 #### Taste strong smells good with ginger and lemon flavor , natural and yummy . Good product .
5 #### Absolutely indispensible for your lobster stock for your bisque or risotto . Delicate lobster flavor that tastes 100 % authentic . Just lobster and herbs . Fantastic .
5 #### Do n't know that it tastes like lobster , but tastes good .
5 #### I used to enjoy chai tea late in the evening , but ever since I discovered this Bengal Spice tea , I enjoy a much more robust cup of tea , enjoyed with milk and a touch of honey ! Satisfying flavor and aroma ! Celestial Seasonings is a company I 've visited multiple times , and one whose quality and reliability I trust absolutely .
5 #### I love Mint Magic ; it 's mellowed by the chicory . I 'm back for another six boxes . Try this : brew it doubly strong , add sweetener , heavy cream , a tiny bit of vanilla , and a splash of dark rum . Yes , it 's decadent but it 's less decadent than dessert . Alternately , you can stir a touch of cocoa powder into sugar or sweetener and add that .
5 #### Hubby loves this tea ! Love all the flavors , hubby likes 2 tea bags in his cup to really great a strong flavor . I like it too , it 's great tea , specifically the blueberry !
5 #### I love these , very fresh and taste delicious . Expensive , but I would purchase again .
5 #### I have purchased this 2 lb bag of macadamia nuts 3 times in the last 3 months , they are absolutely amazing . I have to say though , my husband and I have agreed , this last bag we received are without question the BEST macadamia nuts we have both ever had . I used to purchase a lot from nuts.com and became increasingly disappointed with the quality of the nuts I received . Some were rancid , some were just off and others just lacking in flavor . I started buying here on Amazon since I shop here so frequently and man am I glad I tried these food to live nuts . I 've also purchased the pistachios & brazil nuts , they 're amazing as well .
2 #### I expect raw macadamia to be much more flavorful and aromatic than this ! $ 28.99 for 1 lb of non - organic macadamia with zero taste is way too expensive . I 'm not buying this again . Local store have much better deal .
5 #### I have not had an opportunity to use this yet , but if it is as good as the set of the Better Than products , I will be a happy camper . My lobster chowder will be better than ever !
5 #### I love this in my Lobster bisque ... or crab bisque ... or shrimp bisque ... yes we love bisques ! This bouillon adds that little extra flavor to make these dishes taste great ;)
5 #### Excellent as is everyone of their products I have used , several .
5 #### I could not find the Mandarin Orange Spice Celestial Seasonings in any of my local groceries or health food stores . Glad I could find it here on Amazon . It has a wonderful orange spice taste , great for chilly evenings by the fire .
5 #### best tea ever no need to add sweetner . just great by self .
5 #### During the day my wife and I like to drink a cup of hot tea , especially in the winter and late fall . We like this country peach passion tea because it tastes good and it is caffeine free . It also contains no additives or preservative or artificial coloring . Since we are trying to void caffeine this is an ideal replacement for our afternoon coffee . It is great just to drink by itself or with a couple of cookies for an afternoon snack . We either use a touch of honey in the tea or Splenda when we are watching our calories . This is a great tasting tea and we enjoy it often . I recommend it .
5 #### Throw a bag or two of this in when you are making ice tea to add some great subtle flavors . Gives my ice tea a hint of sweetness and flavor depth without adding sugar . Makes great hot tea by itself , too .
5 #### Makes a decent quick - and - easy lobster bisque . Not as good as from scratch ( of course ) but still tasty . I 'll definitely buy again when it 's gone .
5 #### I use these when making a Paleo granola recipe . They have a nice buttery texture and very mild flavor . They are very satisfying .
5 #### These are fresh and delicious . I just wish there were more in the bag . I can eat all these in about a week !
5 #### Delicious , large , whole macadamia kernels with good texture and flavor .
3 #### I do n't like this flavor , and I 'm not sure exactly why . It 's got a fruity flavor to it , with spicy ( but not biting ) flavors too , just like title says . I think I 'm realizing that I just do n't like spices in my tea . If you like apple cider , this is sort of a cousin to that . Ingredients : Hibiscus , Roasted Chicory , Chamomile , Rosehips , Roasted Carob , Natural Plum and Cinnamon Flavors with other natural foavrs , Ginger and Cardamom .
5 #### This is great stuff ! I love all the " Better Than Bouillon " flavors and am happy to recommend them .
3 #### purchased these macadamia 's because my usual brand of raw Hawaiian macadamias were sold out . These are not from Hawaii ( they are from South Africa ) and they are not tasty and buttery and fresh like my regular brand . They were smaller , harder to chew and did not have that fresh macadamia nut taste . For what they charge per pound , I am very disappointed in quality , country of origin and taste and will not purchase again . I may have gotten a poor batch but when you 're paying over 25.00 a lb . you expect better .
5 #### Love the nuts ... so fresh as if they were just picked ! Package arrived much sooner than I expected and this made me very happy . My package was also packed very well that the nuts were nut damaged . I would definitely keep ordering from this vendor in the future .
4 #### The smell of this is delightful right out of the box . Taking a whiff of it is just as satisfying as drinking it once brewed .
1 #### The tea is great but when you pay for a package of six and they deliver 1/6 of the order your a little disappointed .
5 #### Great Hot or cold . Good for tummy aches , too .
5 #### this is great- I have a recipe for seafood chowder that uses " dry packets of Newberg sauce mix " with no longer are being made . a tablespoon of this , with 2 tablespoons of flour , and voila ! Newberg sauce ! easy peasy :)
5 #### This is my favorite tea of all time now . I first tried it in the sample pack , and loved it so I ended up ordering 6 boxes ! Highly recommend .
5 #### Tasty both hot & cold w / a bit of honey as sweetner !
5 #### I originally found this stuff at the Christmas Tree Shops , which New Englanders will be familiar with . I bought it out of curiosity . Since then , I 've found myself using it for all sorts of things , particularly whisking just a dab of it together with whatever liquid I plan to use for a stuffing or dip . It adds a LOT of flavor , just remember to omit other salt from the recipe until you have a chance to taste it . My fave Lobster Boullion Paste hack is a warm seafood dip . Make it in a mini crockpot . Use 1 bar Neufchatel cheese , 1 can crabmeat with juice , 1 shallot minced fine , and a combination of 1 tbsp each lemon juice and white vermouth plus 1 teaspoon lobster paste whisked together . I also like to add Korean red pepper flakes . If you do n't want that kind of spicy , use black pepper to taste instead . Heat , stir , and enjoy . I 've also used it instead of bonito stock to make miso soup . Pretty awesome sub . Back to buy another jar ! I think this is the 4th one I 've gone through ? I keep finding the jar almost empty ! I wonder why that keeps happening ? ;D
5 #### I got this on a dare and just a small portion in 8 oz 's of Hot Water really is a change from Beef and Chicken Bouillon . Not that Fishy which was a concern but with a very nice warm taste of Paprika . Very nice .
1 #### I was so excited to get this tea because of how people rave about it and because when I 'm dieting I like to have a variety of teas to drink to keep me on track . This tea smells absolutely delicious , very much like a sugary cookie dough . Unfortunately it tastes like absolutely NOTHING , literally no flavor except that of hot water . It 's quite unbelievable . How does something taste like nothing , just no flavor at all ?
5 #### Finally figured out how to make the type of clam chowder and lobster bisque you come to expect in a good restaurant ..
5 #### I am familiar with cooking with bases . Now I can have newburg sauce again .
5 #### Great brand and great flavor . I buy them in the store regularly with other flavor . Moving to a small town , I could n't find any lobster base . I use them regularly to add a little to other base to give it a sweeter taste . Great lobster flavor .
5 #### Such a rich , warm flavor . I use this as dessert ! It 's that good ! ! ! !
5 #### Part of my taste test of Lemon Ginger teas -- this was a good one !
1 #### I had an allergic reaction to this tea - not sure what the ingredient causing this was , but be aware .
5 #### My daughter adores this , it 's one of her favorite teas now
5 #### Very nice product . Easy to make macadamia butter at with these .
5 #### Good flavor , not overpowering , add honey and more lemon if you like strong flavor ! Also steeping longer makes the tea stronger too . Nice and relaxing in the cooler weather .
4 #### I prefer lightly roasted macadamias but if you prefer raw , these are very good .
4 #### Really hard to chew , almost got ta give it some extra oomph . They are also dry , no salt , no roast / smoke / bake - it 's in the title , RAW . Just be aware . Pretty good price if done through subscribe and save .
5 #### Love it in Sipper Drinks for Trim Healthy Mama
5 #### This is a perk you up type tea . Can drink it anytime .
5 #### this is a wonderful chef 's helper for good cooking .
5 #### I just love this tea . I buy it by the case and have it on Subscribe & Save . I brew it with a bag of black tea and 1 t sugar and steep for 9 minutes . I use a cup of boiling water to steep it and then add an additional 3 cups of water when it 's done .
5 #### I love the tea and it comes nicely packed .
4 #### Lovely flavor . Very gingery . The only thing I do n't like about CS is their bags do not come with a string to remove the spent teabag .
5 #### This product is terrific but has a salt basis and ca n't use it at present . It really makes a fish dish 100 % better .
1 #### These nuts are very expensive but they were nut fresh I ate some but I did n't like them and threw away the rest !
5 #### REALLY GOOD TASTE FOR RAW MACAS ! WILL CONTINUE ORDERING DUE TO ITS GOOD TASTE AND PRICE !
5 #### Macadamia nuts are so expensive , that one wants to be certain of making a good purchase choice when buying them . These nuts , by Food To Live , as with other nuts of this brand , are superb . The nuts are in halves and pieces , but we use them in Smoothies and that is not of importance .. These raw and unsalted nuts were an entirely new taste experience for me . The taste without the additives is so much fresher , and when used in cooking , or in a Smoothie , adds a rich , smooth , and delicate flavor that serves to enhance every food to which it is added . The nuts themselves were of a very pure taste , with absolutely no hint of rancidity , or any " off " flavors . These are lovely just to eat as is , but we particularly enjoyed this entirely new experience of such sweet and fresh - tasting nuts when used in our health Smoothies , and other foods . Food To Live performs well in ithe packaging of its nut varieties . These arrived in a very thick bag , with a convenient zip - lock open feature . These nuts are the best Macadamia Nuts that I have tasted , and they are excellent value for money . I highly recommend these as a superb source of an extremely high and healthful fiber content , and Vitamins A and E. the taste is delightful , and you will.not be disappointed with your purchase .
4 #### I love Macadamia Nuts , and have for a very long time . They are quite expensive , and the quality can vary in the extreme . However , I have had very good experiences with this brand " Food to Live " , and decided to order the 2 # size of Nuts . These are not organic , and are not non - GMO , which is a disappointment . However , the taste is superb - rich , creamy , and full of that particular luscious flavor that only a Macadamia nut can provide . I used thes , along with a Macadamia Nut drink , Pistachios , Gala Apples . Coconut , and vanilla and real coconut extract to produce a very superior Smoothie . I also ground one third of a vanilla bean into the mixture , which served to accentuate the already fine Macadamia nut flavor . Aside from the lack of these Nuts being Organice , and non - GMO , I would highly recommend the use of these Macadamia Nut . As it stands now , I will finish these , and continue my search for organic , and a non - GMO version . Unfortunately , I can not wholeheartedly recommend these non - organice Nuts . But I will keep my eye upon this brand , in the hopes that they will produce an organice , and non - GMO version
4 #### not all herbal teas are fall and winter pleasers , flannel shirts and camo , this tea is a nice change .Warm and spicy but not overpowering .
4 #### The salt favor is quite strong . This can not be used as a base alone . It works if added to a stew with no additional salt
2 #### Really did n't like this flavor at all . To me it tasted like a combination of coffee & tea . Could n't doctor it up . Gave it away .
5 #### love this tea . it is delicious and I 'm a black tea drinker so I 've switched to this with just a little black tea each day
1 #### This tea used to taste lovely . It was a favorite of mine for many , many years . No longer . This tastes like cinnamon gum , which is not a good flavor for tea .
5 #### I have been drinking Tension Tamer for years . Ever since I developed an anxiety disorder in High School , I have been able to count on Tension Tamer to help me relax . I have recommended it to many people , and so far everybody that I have recommended it to has loved it ! I personally microwave a mug of water for two minutes , let this steep for about 5 , and drink it when I can tolerate it . The tea itself is so flavorful that I never need to use sugar or sweetener . It has a very calming and spicy taste to it . If you 're looking for a tea that will really help you relax , this is it !
5 #### This is a great tea if you want something to give you that aroma and taste of coffee . It was suggested by a nutritionist as a caffeine free substitute for your morning coffee . I was not hopeful at first because i am not a tea drinker to begin with , but this really helped . I am now a 100 % herbal tea drinker and this tea is one of many that i enjoy .
5 #### Love this tea ! Natural sweetness so no additional sugar is needed .
5 #### Great stuff . I am very satisfied and happy with this product as it has brought relief to my problem with acid indigestion and throat irritation . Look forward to order my next batch very soon .
5 #### This is so delicious . I ca n't hardly stop myself from drinking 2 big mugs full . I like it because it does n't taste artificially flavored . I am going to try every flavor . I have the Country Peach , ca n't wait to taste it .
5 #### It was nice to get this while deployed to a FOB in Afghanistan .
5 #### Comes in handy wherever a " fish stock " taste works better than the ubiquitous chicken stock . Not really very lobster - y tasting to me , more generic shellfish - fish , but just what I needed . Quite pricy , but there 's nothing else out there quite like it .
5 #### I love Lobster Bisque . No - I REALLY LOVE Lobster Bisque ! ! I go visit my sister in Provincetown , Mass. and there used to be a restaurant there that made the BEST Bisque EVER < they have closed in the last year > SO I did a lot of searching and found a recipe that called for Lobster Base < of course I could have used Bouillon > and no stores in my area had it . So I came to Amazon and knew I 'd find it . This base is PERFECT for Lobster Bisque ! It came a week earlier then expected so that made his purchase even better ! My parents came for a visit and my father and I love Lobster Bisque so I was able to make it the morning they got here . He LOVED it ! ! That alone made this purchase so worthwhile ! ! I will definitely purchase this again when I run out of the jar I got . 8 ounces will go a long way !
5 #### Great macadamia nuts . I have tried the rest and have found the best , not cheap but the best never is . Have and will order again thanks ! !
5 #### These macadamia nuts are wonderful . The are raw and crunchy . We are trying to live healthier , and this reasonably priced bag of nuts are easily roasted with coconut oil and sea salt for a wonderful snack . It 's a great bargain for the price and the nuts always taste fresh ; unlike some vendors , they are never rancid or stale .
5 #### Very fresh , yummy . I keep them in freezer , and they are one of my favorite nuts . Highest levels of " healthy fats " of any nut , Pecans are my second choice .
5 #### Awesome ! These macadamias are delicious ! Chew them slowly and savor them ! One reviewer claimed that these were the BEST nuts he had ever tasted . I was skeptical . But now I think these are the BEST nuts that I have ever tasted ! Food to Live is a very good company . I also highly recommend their organic cashews . Good tip : Store nuts in the fridge and make sure to properly seal the bag to keep them fresh longer .
5 #### So happy I was able to get my favorite tea year round . Just wonderful .
5 #### This has become my new favorite tea ! Very spicy with a sweet taste without the sugar .
5 #### This tea smells and tastes great ! I drink it hot , unsweetened , and I 've been very happy with it . The price is GREAT for a tea this tasty . I ca n't wait to try it iced !
5 #### Great lemon ginger tea , even if a little light on the ginger , but that 's the way I like it . I 'm not usually a fan of herbal teas that have no tea , but I really like this one , particularly with some orange blossom honey . Yum ! It 's also great for helping to settle an upset stomach . And its definitely a bargain ! I will certainly buy more .
5 #### This is my favorite tea ! Refreshing taste and smells great ! Hard to find in the grocery store . The only thing that could make it better is if it was USDA organic , but that could be coming in the near future .
1 #### Vanilla Honey - yuck ! Probably the worst version of this tea I have tasted ! Do yourself a favor and pick up the Bigelow version if you like vanilla honey chamomile !
4 #### Good tea , it 's cheaper in bulk . Drank it years ago .
5 #### I get my teas locally but I just have to review this here ... the cinnamon apple flavor is my all time favorite tea , and I 'm really not a huge hot tea drinker . But when I was younger , my mom would make this cinnamon apple tea if I was sick or had an asthma attack , and it was so comforting to breathe in the yummy apple cinnamon aroma , almost like apple cider . Now , I make it for myself or my kids if we are sick and add extra cinnamon and some honey , and it tastes almost like a mild hot cider drink . Absolutely delicious . None of my kids like hot tea , but they 'll drink this flavor . I just recently bought the Tension Tamer tea , and it also has a VERY nice flavor . I 'm kind of picky about tea and like I said , not a huge tea drinker , but this tea has a beautiful mild flavor that is very soothing . It 's herbal with a hint of fruit and a slightly mint aftertaste . It 's probably awesome iced , will be trying that next , as well as hopefully buying the sleepy time to see how that is ! This is IMO the best tea brand with the best flavors . I have purchased fancy tea at Teavana , and Celestial Seasonings tastes just as good and better , and is more convenient ... and more affordable !
3 #### We ordered several coffee substitutes from Amazon so we could perform side by side taste comparisons . This one was just ok , it was n't bad , but neither did it smell or taste like coffee . Maybe an odd version of Mexican hot cocoa ?
5 #### I the small town I live in , it is often very hard to find uncommon items for cooking ..... I found it on Amazon and I must say , I made some of the BEST lobster bisque EVER ! ! ! I am going to keep ordering from superior foods for all my odd cooking spices etc . It was fast and reasonably priced and it made me happy !
2 #### This tastes more like vegetable base than lobster base . It will work in a pinch and it does n't taste bad , but even fish sauce tastes better than this , if you were looking for something closer to a lobster flavor , plus it is far less expensive if you went to an Asian store . It is way too pricey than it should be and is why 2 stars . With its shell , I think the crustacean escaped the bouillon pot .
5 #### Like millions of others around the world I follow a modified Paleo lifestyle . As part of that regimen I include nuts in my daily food intake . A variety of nuts help your Omega-6 / Omega-3 balance , if you stay away from the choices on offer from " Big Nuts " . Their nuts are roasted using seed - oil and crappy salt . I roast mine using coconut oil and Himalayan pink salt giving them extra goodness . I have tried nuts from many vendors but have settled on Food To Live nuts . They are always fresh , high quality and just plain yummy . I buy lots of nuts and give them to my friends and co - workers and they all tell me I have the best nuts and that the only problem they have with them is they ca n't stop eating them . Yay for my nuts . Yay for Food To Live .
3 #### I have enjoyed Food to Live macadamias on numerous occasions , but I did n't even bother opening this bag . Nuts were small , uneven colored pieces and nowhere near the quality of previous macadamias I 've ordered from them in the past . Food to Live 's return policy is flawless and I will order again from them in the future . Just going to wait a bit and hope their product source returns to the previous quality .
5 #### this reviewers for the pine nuts I bought from this co. not mac nuts ! these are wonderful pine nuts ! very fresh ! this is my 2 or 3 time ordering from this company ; all consistent ; best I have found !
5 #### This was my first time purchasing the macadamia nuts . We have purchased many of their other nuts . They are so good dry roasted ! ! My husband is a truck driver and loves them for a snack on the road . Food To Live 's quality never disappoints !
5 #### Great , natural - tasting tea , one of the few flavored teas I can drink every day .
5 #### I absolutely love this tea and I have a hard time finding it in the grocery stores . It 's very flavorful and has a great aroma .
5 #### Our favorite flavor , we mix it with spicy teas and lemons for a great Arnold Palmer
5 #### My husband , daughter , and I all love lobster bisque . I tried making it once using other ingredients and it just was n't the same . This lobster base really helps give it the right flavor . Now , if only I could get the thickness to the right stage ...
4 #### They stopped selling this in my local grocery stores . This is such a fantastic tea for children . No caffeine , and it 's lightly sweetened so you do not have to add anything to it - although we do add a drop of honey to ours . It is a part of our daily bedtime ritual , warm tea with our medicine and for my extremely picky eater / drinker this tea is not put down before it 's all gone ! Give the added bonus that it does induce a gentle calm that allows for a smoother bedtime and you ca n't lose ! The price was decent , considering I can not get it locally anymore .
5 #### This is my husband 's favorite tea to drink . He bought it one time at the health food store ( for more money ) and loved it so we went to our favorite place to shop , Amazon , and looked it up and there it was and such a good deal ! So we made the purchase and he is enjoying every last drop of it . He tells me there is a hint of apple flavor , but mostly cinnamon and to him , it 's like drinking apple pie ! You maybe should know , he likes his apple pie heavily spiced with cinnamon ! For the most part , it has good ingredients although neither of us like using anything soy , this states to have soy lecithin in it as a flavoring . I wish the company would either leave that part out or switch to sunflower lecithin which would be healthier . Nonetheless , it probably does n't have much of that soy lecithin in it and my husband really enjoys this tea . I 'm sure we will continue buying it as the need arises . There are 20 tea bags in a box and we got six boxes in this purchase at a very good price . We would recommend this product .
1 #### The only brand worse than these is We Got Nuts . More pieces than whole nuts and so many were chewy ( aka NOT fresh ) that I sent them back . Food to Live ? Yeah , if you 're starving and it 's either eat these or die . That 's the only way I 'd have eaten any more of these . Huge disappointment ! !
5 #### It tastes so good . Very fresh . Top Quality ! Definitely I will buy again .
5 #### These are by far the best nuts I have ever tasted . I could n't find any high quality nut in the local grocery stores that did n't cost an arm and a leg . After some searching I found Food To Live nuts . They taste fresh , crunchy , and awesome . I almost think they freeze dry the nuts because they end up so crunchy . Either way that would be a great preservation method and keep the nuts just like they were cracked . Their walnuts , brazil nuts , and pumpkins are also super delicious . Enjoy !
5 #### Appeared to be stale , but Food to Live was kind enough to refund . I will try this again when they change suppliers . UPDATE 2/26/16 - The macadamia nuts were very fresh and tasty this time . I keep the bag in the refrigerator to continue to keep it fresh . Thanks for the great product and customer service ! ! UPDATE 4/24/17 - The macadamia nuts continue to be high quality !
4 #### Lovely teas with great flavor . Wish they were organic .
5 #### This is delish . Very flavorful . I like to add powdered ginger to mine for an extra kick . I also put in a few cloves sometimes , but it 's got some in it
5 #### This tea tastes good ... is relaxing ... helps calm me after a long day . It 's my favourite flavour and I rarely use honey or milk ... but those can be added as a treat . Definitely my go - to tea in the evenings .
5 #### Just love seafood , this is the best base . Loaded with lots of flavor , great for boils , stews , soups . My favorite .
5 #### These teas are so good- I love them all so much I have a hard time deciding which one to make ! I use for iced tea- 4 bags per quart- so refreshing and thirst quenching on a hot summer day- and the amazon subscribe and save is the best way to buy these ! I like how each flavor comes sealed in their own pouch so the flavors do not mix in the box . No caffeine so no jitters or up all night .
5 #### This tastes great ! I normally only drink black tea , but this is the one caffeine free tea I can drink . I do n't add sugar and find it very flavorful without it . I only wish my local stores would carry it all year instead of just at Christmas time .
5 #### Perfect for making Lobster Bisque ! So very handy and easy to use . It 's priced right and came packed securely , so there was no breakage to worry about .
3 #### I have tried the beef and chicken flavors . Both were very good . This one tastes more like a tinny fish stock . Not bad , mind you , but does n't taste much like lobster - and if eaten as a plain broth - not good at all . Highly recommend the Chicken and Beef but I doubt I 'll buy the Lobster again .
5 #### Whatever it does or does not do , it has a really wonderful flavor ! Not your usual herbal tea and that 's why I buy it .
5 #### My favorite tea of all time and I drink allot of tea .
5 #### I buy this tea in quantity now . It is the only non - caffeinated tea I drink . In the summer it is great with ice and lemon slices . In the winter it is absolutely great with honey , if one feels under the weather . The taste is really pleasant and is not too fruity . Just right for me .
3 #### It is a good mix but flavor is mediocre .
4 #### Well , I have to admit that I love the Bases for cooking . They do have forms of MSG in them , so those who are allergic need to be aware . They can say no ADDED MSG , because they add it in a different form than pure MSG ( which you can actually buy - it is a salty powder ) . If a product has " hydrolyzed _ _ protein " , then it has a form of MSG , which is created in the hydrolyzing process . Anyway - There is a recipe on the label that I look forward to trying , and plan on making seafood enchiladas with this as well . Since Amazon sellers almost never list ingredients for their food products , here is what the jar says on the lobster base : INGREDIENTS : Cooked Lobster , Salt , Maltodextrin ( a sugar ) , Hydrolyzed Soy Protein ( form of MSG ) , dried onion & garlic , potato flour , corn oil , natural flavors ( ? ) , xanthan gum , disodium inosinate and guanylate , soy lecithin , oleoresin of paprika . ( As they 'd say on HeeHaw , Yum Yum ! ) NUTRITION : serving size 1 teaspoon . Calories - 10 Sodium - 680 mg Total fat - 0 Carbs - 2 g Protein - 1 g If you eat out much , you probably are already eating these bases . They are highly concentrated , so you do n't need to use much . You " reconstitute " the base in boiling or very hot liquid and add it to your recipe . Very easy to use . The product should be refrigerated after opening . I 'll update my review once I 've made something with it .
5 #### I make a seafood bisque with this , and it takes less than 10 minutes . It tastes as good as anything I ever had in a restaurant and is elegant and impressive but inexpensive ! Great as an appetizer but filling enough for an entree . I am waiting for the cool weather so I can make it again .
5 #### I have purchased all of the different bases and they are great . I must eat non gluten products and this works fine in preparing my meals . Flavor is great !
5 #### The fruit tea sampler is fantastic since it is easy to get bored just drinking one flavor . You can choose any one of five to match the meal you are eating that day . I like to brew it in boiling water and then add ice to cool it down . It is extremely refreshing and has the perfect hint of tartness in it . Many of these teas also contain hibiscus which has been shown to have even higher antioxidant levels than green tea so it is very good for your health . Also , not all the flavors are completely natural . They do say ' natural flavors ' on the list but the term is way too broad and probably contain artificial flavors . However , the addition of the flavor allows this tea to taste in a way that teas without flavoring just can not accomplish . There is just no way to get the flavor of black cherry or blueberry without some artificial flavors . I only wish Celestial would make an organic line .
5 #### I have ordered this many times . Mixed with organic green and white tea , it 's the best cold summer drink . In the winter I use it hot . Deep cinnamon flavor and much better price than the grocery store .
5 #### Like the subtle and gentle taste of this peach tea .
5 #### A favorite tea . Nearly impossible to find just this tea without others . Was very pleased to find it on Amazon . Ordered several . :)
4 #### if it 's primarily made from lobster , what else is in there ? I wonder . Primarily ... Who uses a word like that on a food label ? It 's primarily delicious among other things , things we usually have no energy to talk about after eating a fine meal . I 'm so full of primarily lobster bisque that I 've been making and have come to be addicted to . NO ! I will not share the recipe , because I am too full and do n't feel like it . Primarily .
5 #### My favorite tea right now ... & no caffeine or sugar . It tastes a little sweet , though , which I like ( maybe the roasted carob or cinnamon or vanilla flavor or .... ) . I do n't add black tea or milk to make a chai tea . I noticed Celestial Seasonings ' website had a recipe for cooking a shallot , mushroom recipe ... have never use teas in recipes but sounds interesting .
5 #### Its the product that is advertised . Might be me but it seems they ve changed the blend some but I still enjoy this one . Combine it with the yogi Egyptian Licorice you do not even need any sweetener .
2 #### Should rename this product to salt with flavoring . Pour in 90 % kosher salt and add 10 % flavor and that 's what this is .
5 #### real chicken , not chicken " flavor " . Need I say more ?
5 #### Excellent for making broth for soups and in use with pressure cooking . I use everything in this line of product .
5 #### I use this to make awesome cream of mushroom soup ! It 's salty , so I do n't salt while cooking . Salt to taste at the table .
4 #### Good , but not a real strong mushroom taste as I had hoped to augment my gravies . Not bad ... just not GREAT .
5 #### I like to lightly salt my popcorn with this popcorn salt which because it is so finely ground compared to ordinary salt it spreads out across the popcorn with a hint of salt . Everyone raves about my popcorn .
5 #### Delicious tea , very refreshing and flavorful . Highly recommended . Love the ginger !
1 #### HUGE RIPOFF ! ! ! From all of the advertising hoopla and the ridiculous high price , I figured this stuff must be absolute food magic ! WRONG ! I bought 4 different flavors and none of them are worth the bottle they come in ! Could not even taste it in the food ! Save your $ $ $ !
3 #### Great for vegan soups , but it tasted more like Vegemite than mushrooms to me . Very salty , but kind of beef - like .
5 #### Better than Bouillon beats regular bouillon any time . Essence of mushroom is a handy additional cooking tool .
5 #### This product is the best bouillon yet ! It is more expensive than the other products but the seasoning is perfect for soups and stews . Gave up using all other bouillons .
5 #### Just perfect . Arrived on time and in good shape . Just as described . I 'm happy .
5 #### Better than bouillon is the only bouillon that I use ! You can add it in a pinch too wet or dry foods . If you were throwing it in the sauce you do n't need to worry about it cooking down long enough for the dry cube to disintegrate . A few swirls with your spoon and it is integrated into the sauce . I even have added a little bit of this to grits , mashed potatoes , and mac & cheese . It integrates so easily and you can put as little or as much as you want instead of having to make a cup of bouillon . So versatile !
5 #### Love Better than Bouillon . Did n't know there was other flavors . Now I have many opitions .
4 #### I love mushrooms & I love broth so I had elevated expectations here . I actually prefer vegan not chicken broth or herbal boullion cubes . I actually slightly prefer this brand 's fake beef broth over the mushroom - this has less flavor .
5 #### this is so easy and much more cost effective than the ready made mushroom broth - we use this as a seasoning for soups and sauces , not as an actual broth - keeps well if refrigerated
5 #### Very fine , powdery salt , great for popcorn or anything .
5 #### Yummy ! Natural tasting , just like expensive organic chicken . There are many flavors in this brand that I did n't see until I shopped on Amazon , love this brand !
5 #### The product is great - very natural taste , but the price is ridiculous ! In Target you can get it for 3.76 . Absolutely the same product !
5 #### I love this and use it when I make homemade soup !
5 #### I love better than bouillon . The flavor is great , and I know that it is good for my family . This is a healthy size and lasts for quite a bit in our house .
5 #### My husband luvs this tea . It smells sooooo good . Ca n't seem to find it in the stores around us .
5 #### I 've recently gone off caffeine , and this tea is dark and just bitter enough to psychologically compensate for that 3:00 cup of tea I used to need to get me through the rest of my day at work . It 's a nice chai - esque flavor for when I want that sort of thing but do n't want the caffeine . I 'll buy it again .
5 #### Delicious ! I do not like to drink it hot , though . I like to brew it and then blend it with regular , unsweetened iced tea . It even seems to curb any cravings for sweets - bonus !
5 #### Add a little Honey and it 's great for treating a cough . I love Chai tea and lattes but do n't want the caffeine , so this is a great substitute ! The flavor is strong , so if you are not making a latte you might want to use more water and a larger cup so it does not get too strong .
5 #### Very nice blueberry / blackberry taste . Healthy ingredients . Great heart healthy drink !
5 #### 1 C ( 2 bags long steep ) 5 cubes sugar , 4 T Coffeemate , 1 shot brandy , 1/2 oz Cointreau , then nuke it 30 secs to bring temp back up and try to drink the whole thing before falling into sweetly spiced Dream City sleep . Suggested pairing : a minty , piney kush pin roll and anisette toast or Finnish licorice .
5 #### Deliciously strong ginger flavor that I got hooked on not just as a hot drink but iced as well . Will keep this in my monthly subscription orders for as long as its available .
5 #### Yep , sorry , I did n't purchase this salt for popcorn . I needed a fine grain salt that would evenly distribute throughout my icing . Since I 'm only making small batches , this 1 # package will last a long time . I 'm certain it would perfectly penetrate your popcorn kernels too though .
4 #### Super fine grind , just as a few others have mentioned . I doubt I will every use another for my popcorn .. very nice
5 #### Very happy , I use it for my chicken soup stock .
1 #### THIS IS PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE ! It is cheaper to buy it a the local upscale store , right off the shelf , at about 1/2 price . Are you kidding me ?
3 #### Roasted premium beef is delicious and so useful . This one is good , but is n't good like the beef -- salty , but with less savory flavor . Honestly , I 'll not be buying the chicken anymore , in favor of putting the beef one in all my chicken dishes too .
5 #### I love this natural No MSG or any dangerous additive . I works very well , I would be cautious of the sodium content , but is very flavorful and last a long time . I have been using it for a while .
5 #### This product adds great flavor to gravies and soups ... but wait to add salt until after you 've added the bouillon . The bouillon adds a salty flavor ( not overwhelming ) , but taste whatever you are making to be sure that you want to add salt . Having said that , I usually add salt after the bouillon ;)
5 #### Excellent for soups and stews , seasoning and marinades . Tastes fabulous !
3 #### For this reason , I quite drinking Celestial Seasonings [ ... ]
1 #### Once you open the box , the tea smells absolutely amazing . Unfortunately , the flavor is n't as dramatic and loses the little flavor it has only after a short period of time .
5 #### This is my all time favorite tea . It tastes like a very strong chai with cinnamon aftertaste . In fact , this tea is so good that when I would visit my chai - loving friend from another country he preferred it to what he had .
5 #### I 've been drinking this tea for years . I love trying different teas , but this one is the one that I always have on hand . It 's just a great - tasting , nice , relaxing cup of tea .
3 #### I like the taste , my soup came out fine , but the bottle was only 2/3rds full . I see my grocery store sells it . I will try one more time to see if it was a fluke before regularly ordering . Take note this is a sticky condensed paste or gel , not a powder , for those that care about that . Recommendation is to spray a tsp or tbsp with olive oil spray first so it slides off more easily . 3 stars because it should have been full .
4 #### My . brother - in - law told me about this product so I bought it when I saw it on Amazon . He was right ... this stuff is fantastic for adding to soups , collard greens , casseroles or making broth to drink . The four stars instead of 5 is because Amazon is much more pricey than I have seen elsewhere . I will buy again but probably not from Amazon given the price differential .
2 #### This is a VERY small jar , not the giant one you can get at Smart & Final for less money . I wish I had noticed that the size was so small for this price .
5 #### My boyfriend took care of me while I was sick and this stuff came in handy when he made me chicken soup !
5 #### SOOOOO much better than powedered bouillon or the delightful little bouillon cubes . Can be a bit pricey depending on the vendor , but really worth it if you do n't mind the extra $ $ $ .
3 #### I love mushrooms and cream of mushroom soup . I generally love Better than Bouillon , but I am not that crazy about the mushroom flavor of this . It is very salty and that is pretty much all I can taste with this bouillon . I am disappointed .
5 #### Fabulous ! Great taste and strong concentration so you use just a little . Have purchased also their beef and chicken bouillon . All very good .
5 #### This is great stuff ! I love all the " Better Than Bouillon " flavors and am happy to recommend them .
2 #### I love this base for every kind of soup I make , besides adding to pasta water , vegetables ( if I boil them ) , and any kind of slow cooker dish . That said , the jar I received was almost dried out , although still useable . Considering it 's half the price at the local organic food store ( the whole paycheck one ) , I 'll make the trip to the store instead of risking another expensive , mediocre jar .
5 #### I buy this by the case constantly . I can sort of recreate the canceled Celestial Seasonings Almond Sunset with this tea by added almond extract which I buy in bulk size at a restaurant supply store .
5 #### - I just really REALLY like this Bengal Spice tea , and have liked it for many years ; the quality of ingredients has remained very good . It 's not " regular " ( Camellia sinensis ) tea " , it 's herbal - a * lot * of flavor , no caffeine . - It simply does n't seem to be reliably - available in grocery stores - it * is * spicy , with cinnamon , ginger , and even some black pepper ( ( just a hint ) ) , but I also like it mixed into other things , like " regular " Iced Tea and even coffee , so I like to make a small batch and keep it in the fridge ( ( not for too long of course ! ) ) for convenience . It is also good on its own of course ! , hot or cold . I like it sweetened ( stevia or other no - calorie sweetener ) and it helps me to get past both my " urge to graze " and my " urge for sweets " , because the spiciness gratifies my taste buds , LOL ! - I really like being able to order these cartons via Amazon = :)
5 #### Very nice lemon tea , the spot of ginger mellows out the excessive tartness and makes for a comforting , bright cupa .
5 #### Lemon Ginger has a excellent taste . You can really taste the lemon in this tea .
5 #### Salt is great on the hot air popped popcorn we make at home
5 #### I bought a large bag of chips cause it was suppose to be low fat ( less oil ) and salted ... WRONG ! It was flavorless ! I had this bag of salt used for popcorn which works great on popcorn by the way , and decided to try it out on the chips . Because it is so fine and unlike table salt I sprinkled some in the bag and shook up the bag and wow did that make a difference on the chips ! Table salt does not stick but this is great stuff ! You just need to be careful with that much salt in your diet .
5 #### We have been looking for a healthy popcorn salt that tastes like the theaters for a long time . I came across this powdered sea salt and it was exactly what I was looking for . Sea salt is good for the body with trace mineral content , but in it 's regular form would not stick to the popcorn . This sticks to the popcorn and tastes makes it taste just like the theater popcorn . I love this and will use it on other foods as well .
5 #### Much less expensive than the first brand I bought !
4 #### This product has earned a permanent place in my pantry . Rich flavor and no more chasing a stupid cube around in a pot trying to get it to dissolve . Makes a wonderful glaze . I toss the nasty salty flavor packs in ramen and instead throw in a dollop of this with some dehydrated veggies , green onions and an egg to make wonderful filling ramen and udon with a lot less salt and my vegetarian friends like it .
5 #### Have the mushroom , chicken , beef and lobster as well . Awesome in shrimp touffe , white clam sauce , chicken soup and more . Love these products .
5 #### Bought this because the Better than Bouillon Chicken Base was delicious . This is even better .
1 #### Very good product . Ridiculous price . You can by this at Walmart for $ 3.72 . Product is excellent price is ridiculous
3 #### wish that i could find a product that is derived from just chicken . too much salt and sugar ! i simply do n't know what the alternative is . sometimes , a food prep just needs a boost .
2 #### Not my cup of tea . Way too much ginger for my taste
5 #### This is so hard to find and so wonderful . I make lots of soups and sauces and use this instead of beef or chicken flavor bouillon . It tastes very good . Just wish it were not so expensive .
5 #### My husband is a vegetarian and I love Better Than Bouillon 's No Chicken Chicken base . I grabbed one of these to mix it up . Found a recipe for the best cream of mushroom soup that you can make vegetarian or vegan . Start off with olive oil , scallions and chopped baby Bella mushrooms . I add no chicken chicken stock and use almond milk and corn starch -- if heading the vegan way , or use light cream with corn starch to thicken up . I add the mushroom bouillon to kick up the taste and the richness it gives to the soup is devine . I make mushroom gravy or sauce and add a bit in . A little bit goes a long way and refrain from using too much salt before you add the stock . It lasts in the fridge and , believe it or not , the kids are digging the soup . They would not eat a mushroom if i put a sauted one right in front of them on a plate .
3 #### a bit disappointed ... you can taste an almost fake flavor in the food .. perhaps i used too much ... i added it to some cream to intensify the mushroom flavor .... will not buy again !
5 #### This also is an excellent purchase . It is easy to use , great taste amd I am never without it .
5 #### I love the Better than Bouillon Mushroom Base ! It works great in any recipe and have a beautiful flavor !
4 #### Tastes great , however the ingredients are n't that good for you .
5 #### Our stores stopped carrying finely ground plain popcorn salt . This is perfect !
5 #### For years , I 've been dissolving kosher salt in hot water and then waiting for it to cool down when making frosting or cookie dough but now I do n't have to . This dissolves much more easily and distributes better than what I was doing before . It 's also the best option to season food that was under - salted during cooking .
3 #### Good mild flavor but it takes a couple bags to brew a cup . This is an herbal tea with mild ginger flavor , a little weaker than I 'd like and it needs to steep a while before drinking .
5 #### GOOD STUFF guys ... every night , a cup of this delicious tea mixed with magnesium supplement ( CALM plus calcium ) and I sleep like a baby . WAHOO
5 #### I was at the store trying to figure out which to get , and remember seeing this one reviewed highly . Double checked my info online and took the plunge . I 'm a picky stock maker myself and have n't liked ANY boullion 's I 've ever tried . This is the BOMB ! I love it . It 's so easy to use . It 's so tasty . I 've used it to make homemade seasons ramen soups ( like Maruchen but WAY better ) . I 've now used it to add chicken flavor to my pozole , I only had homemade veg stock , and really needed a meaty flavor , so tried this . It was perfect ! I 'm a huge fan now . I will use this for a long time . It 's perfect for when I 'm out of my own homemade , or for small dishes like my ramen .
5 #### I 'm not even sure where I originally purchased this , maybe Costco . I love making soup and chili especially now that it 's fall . I use this ( chicken ) in both soups and chilis regardless of the meat that I 'm using . I also use it to cook rice and quinoa as well as other various dishes . It 's probably past expiration but does n't seem affected . I 'm at the bottom of the jar and since I could not find this in my regular grocery store of course I looked to Amazon to save the day . Literally . I ca n't live without this stuff . This time though , I actually ordered the Organic Reduced Sodium Roasted Chicken in the larger size . Do n't misunderstand - this one is absolutely delicious , but I wanted to opt for a reduced sodium variety since I use it so often . Before this , I was using the box broths ( usually some reduced sodium organic chicken variety when I could find it ) . It became inconvenient , wasteful , and expensive . It was more difficult to keep the boxes on hand and use the remainder of broth after opening before it went bad . This base is far more convenient and also way more delicious ! I 'll be coming back to try out some of the other flavors by BtB !
5 #### I use this in everything . Way better than the other products I have used for years
5 #### Great price for a great product . I 'm very glad I can get this on Amazon . Will purchase again when I run out !
5 #### Excellent to enhance mushroom dishes , especially Polish Christmas Eve mushroom soup which is traditionally vegetarian . Also spruces up dried mushroom broth , pierogi and piroshky . Next on my list to try will be mushroom strudel ... Great kitchen staple .
5 #### I have used every single flavor of this product and I keep it on hand . Not only is it good in a cup of warm water , but , each flavor paired correctly enhance the flavor of the dish you are preparing .
5 #### Love this tea . Better than any Chi tea I 've ever had .
5 #### I love , love , love this stuff , hot or cold ! That 's why I debated on submitting a review , because I do n't want everyone else to buy it , I want it all for myself ! I 've gone through several 6 packs and another reorder is coming up .
5 #### Purchased with stainless steel shaker , very fine crystles , lightly covers the popped corn evenly . Good product , quanity , quality & price .
5 #### Finely ground , so sticks to the kernels just right :) much better than regular salt , and the homemade stuff is better for you anyways !
5 #### This stuff is great for not only popcorn , but fries and everything else that you put salt on . Sticks to food much better than regular table salt .
5 #### This is a great soup base ! I like it better than the canned stock I had been buying .
5 #### LOVE this product ! What a great find ! Soups , vegetables , stews - all more tasty with this , and ORGANIC ! NO MSG or nasty ingredients !
3 #### I can not recommend this product . but when I explain why , my review is deleted .
4 #### All of these are very good not cheap though
4 #### I 'm a big fan of tea and tisanes ( herbal teas ) . I really like fruit teas because they taste like juice but have none of the calories and are natural - unlike water additives . Celestial Seasonings has some great ones - my favorite being Tangerine Orange Zinger . I needed a $ 3 item to get free shipping , so I figured I 'd try Jammin ' Lemon Ginger . It 's a pretty potent and i like my tea strong . I make about 4 cups at a time but only need to use 3 tea bags . Honey is the best sweetener - it mellows out the ginger a bit . It 's great for nausea , especially when iced . It 's excellent later in the day if you want a stimulating drink without any caffeine that may keep you up at night .
5 #### Looks and tastes more like bouillon versus the salty dehydrated stuff .
5 #### i had a friend who find finding it tough going . Does n't drive , has difficulty walking and no money for food . I 'm 4 hrs away so i could n't drop something off . i ordered a box of staples like bean , rice , herbs , spices and jars off this bouillon . She called raving about this product . She had never used a soup base before . She said she even enjoyed a cup of hot bouillon by itself when she was n't up to cooking so I 'd say you have a happy customer . when she had her health she was a gourmet cook so I 'll take her word for it . The product was delivered on a timely basis as expected . i think she received her box of food and bouillon in two days . Note : I sent both the chicken and beef . She was very pleased with both .
5 #### doing beef stroganoff with this base has my husbands family recipe ( mother - in - law ) really kick ass ............ also does help is the brandy , better quality choice beef , Portobello mushrooms , black truffle oil as well ........... he ca n't help himself and even when I make a big pot of this he will still try to freeze extra and eat leftover the next day ..... its THAT GOOD ! !
4 #### I love Better than Bouillon , and use the chicken and been versions most often . This mushroom version is delicious but be warned : THIS IS VERY SALTY ! You have to be very careful when putting this in your food , or you will ruin your culinary masterpiece . I put this in some pasta sauce and I had to throw in cubed potatoes to absorb the excessive salt . Add this little by little , and do n't bother adding any more salt .
4 #### I agree with the name , " Better than Bouillon ! " . It is !
5 #### This is THE BEST flavoring tool in my kitchen arsenal ! BAR NONE !
3 #### I seasoned green beans family members did n't care for if . I normally do n't use organically favor chicken base !
4 #### Not quite as good as the non - Organic chicken Better than Bouillon , which beats it out . Excellent match with the Frontier Soups Potato and Leek soup kit .
5 #### This is the best bouillon I have tasted , much better than other products . Taste pretty much as if you 'd boiled the chicken yourself . Making soup is such an easy pleasure . I love all their soup bases .
5 #### This organic chicken flavoring is great for making chicken noodle soup . I add a teaspoon of sugar in the pot and it is just right . I like the organic better than the regular .
5 #### I love this brand and all the flavors available . For me it is not just " Better " but perfect . I never waste a can of broth anymore-- make exactly what I need . For me , it tastes much better , and depending upon what I am making , I can make it as strong or as weak as I want . I introduced my adult children to it -- they love it too . Mushroom gravy on that steak anyone ? Yum Yum .
5 #### Best Bouillon I 've Tried Yet ! A Must Have If You Do The Cooking Or Want To Impress The Cook In Your Home ! I 've Tried Several Flavors Now , All Are Competition Crushers !
3 #### I adore it , its great , but you can buy it in any store for 4.00 . and get it right away . No shipping !
5 #### My kids love this tea . They like having lots of options . I like not having a cabinet full of tea options for them . The honey chamomile is a definite favorite .
3 #### This is incredibly salty , I would n't buy it again .
5 #### A good quality bouillon versus those other salty dehydrated bouillon . Stuff looks like chicken !
5 #### i had a friend who find finding it tough going . Does n't drive , has difficulty walking and no money for food . I 'm 4 hrs away so i could n't drop something off . i ordered a box of staples like bean , rice , herbs , spices and jars off this bouillon . She called raving about this product .

The product was delivered on a timely basis as expected . i think she received her box of food and bouillon in two days .
5 #### Have used this for gravies , sauces , roasts . Imparts a very deep delicious earthy flavor . On my re - order list . Better than boullion has always made a consistantly good product .
5 #### a little bid goes a long way ( big on flavor ) . I have purchased this before .
4 #### This is an excellent base for sauce and soups for added depth . Like it so well I have purchased over flavors .
4 #### Good combination of ginger and lemon . Tastes as expected . Good tea for helping digesting and fighting nausea .
5 #### It was nice to get this while deployed to a FOB in Afghanistan .
5 #### This is the best soup base . Mixed with the chicken or beef base it is very good with just a few veggies and some sausage or chicken tossed in . I live off this stuff now .
5 #### This tastes excellent . I would n't use this as a soup base by itself , it 's very salty . Mixed into other things it adds a lot of umami flavor . My favorite is stirring it into a batch of green beans and into vegetable soups . I imagine it would be great with meats too although I have n't tried it yet .
5 #### This tea is perfect and I love the ZING and slight bite .
5 #### difficult to find in stores so I ordered it for my daughter here . tasty herbal treat on cold winter days .
5 #### Excellent flavor and very relaxing . This tea helps you fall asleep .
5 #### My husbands favorite tea . I am a black tea only kind of gal but I can verify that it smells incredible . After buying box after box of this Celestial Celestial Seasonings Cinnamon Apple Spice tea I finally checked it out on Amazon and found that it 's a much better deal . Better price and comes to my right to my house . Good deal .
5 #### I can not cook without this or the beef base . There are so many uses for it and it 's the best of the best for sure ! !
5 #### This Bouillon is better than any of the powdered type , without exception . It makes the best chicken noodles soup ever ( well , I do but I could n't make it as good as it is without this Bouillon ) . Delicious .
5 #### This is absolutely the best chicken bouillon base that I have found ! It is rich , thick and full of flavor ! It has more REAL CHICKEN FLAVOR than any other base . I get wonderful compliments when I use this in the holiday turkeys to baste them , as well as to flavor the stuffing and vegetables ! Adding a tablespoon of " Better Than Bouillon " chicken even adds a delicious layer of flavor to a big pot of chili . In fact , I would simply bore you with all of the recipes that have been improved with the addition of my " secret ingredient " ! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it !
4 #### Great alternative to bullion cubes or granules in recipes . Like the flavor and the texture .
5 #### Wow this is wonderful stuff . This is my first better than bouillon product but it wo n't be my last . If you love mushrooms this is definitely for you !
5 #### I 've been using the Better Than Bullion vegetable soup base for a long time and this was the first I saw of the mushroom soup base . It was fantastic in mushroom soup . I 'd even add it to vegetable soup for flavor . By far the best bases out there and worth the money since you get so many servings out of it .
5 #### I have used Chicken and Beef broth from this company . I like Mushroom broth the best of all broths I use and trust this brand . This met all my expectations . Only issue was the jar had leaked a bit even though it was sealed well , not sure what that issue was .
5 #### I rely on " Better Than Bouillon " bases . I can use the exact amount I need without cutting up hard cubes . The flavor is consistent throughout the base and does not settle out -- it will never separate the flavor from the salt from the liquid and fat ; not even when left on the refrigerator shelf for months and months . That is important to me . The base is very easy to spoon out ; it does n't harden in the cold of the frig . The bases are rich in flavor , have a slightly sweet taste , and contain less salt than most bouillon cubes . This mushroom base is no exception : It has a deep , complex and authentic mushroom flavor . I keep several of the flavors in my frig at one time : The jars are short and compact and I can stack them if I keep them out of high traffic areas . It would be nice if they were designed to be truly " stack - able " , with a depression in the lid or bottom , then I could keep them closer to the front of the frig .
5 #### Just a bit spicy , very tasty with honey and a splash of milk . I have bought this before , but is seasonal .
5 #### I 've been on a low - carb , high - protein Thing for over a year now . I 've gone from a size 22 to a 16 , and I 'm still at it , but I must say , there are things one misses . Soup is on the list . Most canned soups involve some kind of sneaky or even obvious carbs . I 'm no chef . The weather is cold . What to do ? I heard this product praised in an online discussion , and decided to risk living on the wild side . I 'm SO glad I did ! This makes a great soup , and the addition of some fresh mushrooms and whole cream really livens it up . Adding whole cream , butter , and cheeses works well ... if you are on a diet that allows those things . It really satisfies the desire for something rich and hot .... one can only drink so many protein drinks and eat so many bars , etc . If you are considering Atkins or a modified version thereof , invest in some of these products . the ingredients are quality , and they last pretty much forever . No complex " instructions" .... add a spoonful to hot water and stir . It 's possible that I might not like it so very much if I had found it right away . But if one has been in a kind of self - imposed food desert for 6 months or so , the introduction of a new thing is kind of fun .
3 #### This stock arrived quickly and in good condition . The vendor managed the transaction well . I am sorry to say that this mushroom stock did n't taste like anything , I can not discern any taste . Other flavors of this brand that I have gotten had some taste as well as a lot of salt . Their low sodium versions were also salty to my taste . Well , I will continue to buy and use this brand because despite my criticism , it is indeed better than bouillon !
5 #### I use many different bases and this brand is new to me . I was pleasantly surprised at how easily this base dissolves in hot water . It makes a nice rich broth to use as a gravy foundation . Add some sauteed mushrooms and you have the makings of a great mushroom gravy . Thumbs up for this product .
5 #### loved this- used for soup and it 's organic ! will order again .
5 #### We really like all Celestial Seasonings teas . I mix it with regular tea for a little extra flavor . Great price and all of the flavors taste wonderful .
5 #### I love this tea and this box did n't disappoint from Amazon . I usually purchase this in a local store but seem it is a christmas item . So happy Amazon has this tea it is a little frothy smells great and wonderful for my head cold .
5 #### This is really tasty stuff . While it 's an especially good - morning hot drink at breakfast , we 've taken to brewing up a jug to pour over ice , now that we 're getting into summertime temperatures . It 's a " light , " not " dark " flavor , so we never seem to tire of it . Recommended .
5 #### I usually drink this tea in the afternoon during work . The whole office loves the aroma . It is a mixture of oranges , cloves & cinnamon , very soothing for the afternoon or any time . I have bought this tea several times & even people at work have done the same . This is the best of the best in the Celestial tea family .
1 #### I like a lot of the Celestial Seasonings teas , but the True Blueberry is AWFUL ! Tastes exactly like artificially flavored grape hard candy . I 'll stick to my STASH blueberry tea , which is good . Or the London Fruit and Herb tea in blueberry , which is n't as good as STASH , but beats the pants off this one . So if you like grape hard candy , you 'll like this . If not , avoid the blueberry .
5 #### This is a very pleasant peach flavored black tea , decaf type and the price was right
1 #### Not the original blend . Heavy chamomile flavor . Returned it .
4 #### The reason I am giving this four stars is that I was expecting more roasted chicory and not five spice powder which most people like but I do not care for but tolerate . I like that I can drink it anytime without caffeine jitters and I am experimenting with different additions for my taste . I found that flavored creamers improve the taste which makes me happy and I can hardly taste the five spice . I have been a fan of Celestial Seasonings for forty years and decided to try their version of coffee substitute . I usually purchase Postum but it got real expensive ; $ 12.00 for eight ounces . I like Roastaroma hot but not cold but tastes differ . Buy this to get off caffeine but do n't expect a true coffee flavor . Do some experimenting yourself maybe add some roasted chicory ?
5 #### Very convenient to use w/ very good taste , not salty once mixed w water .
4 #### i always buy this , and i use on many meals . good and quality stuff
5 #### Tidbit . i did n't know : when you buy broth or stock in a carton or can , the manufacturer buys bouillon and adds water . I 've been paying extra for water all these years . Maybe there 's a vendor that makes stock from scratch , but I do n't know of any . Of all the Better Then Bouillon products I 've tried , mChicken Base is clearly the best . It is miles better than any bouillon or stock or broth . This little jar is amazing . Salt : yup . MSG : nope . I sometimes sneak a taste right out of the jar . ( hiding face in shame )
5 #### this is bar far the most intense fruity flavor " infusion " ( herbal tea ) I ever flavored . we use it also for making " soda " , cold , sweetened or not and sparkled in a handheld carbonated soda maker ( which supports sparkling other then water ) , like SodaSparkle Home Soda Maker Kit Easy - to - Use Sparkling Carbonated Seltzer Beverage Maker . YUM ! !
3 #### The flavor is very cinnamon heavy so be warned .
5 #### Mostly I bought this online because it was cheaper than in the store . Love this tea ! Whenever I have some , people say , " What smells so good and cinnamon - y ? "
2 #### Did n't like it , a little too sweet for my tastes . Lots of cinnamon . I 'll dilute it by blending it with other teas .
4 #### good flavor tea would like to see it in bulk packaging .
5 #### BETTER THAN BOUILLON CHICKEN BASE IS ORGANIC AND A GREAT PRODUCT . I USE IT TO COOK CHICKEN , MAKE CHICKEN SOUP , OR JUST A CUP OF BROTH . I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR ALL FOLKS THAT USE BOUILLON . HOWEVER , TRY YOU GROCERY STORE FIRST BECAUSE IT IS A LITTLE EXPENSIVE ON AMAZON .
5 #### I will buy more of this and also the beef flavor . It has a stronger chicken taste than bouillon . I use it in soup , gravy , and casseroles for that extra punch . I 've gotten compliments on the rich flavor of my broth when I make chicken soup .
5 #### The best bouillon ever ! ! ! Tastes just like homemade broth . A little too salty if use too much , go light . You do n't need a lot because its so flavorful . I buy the organic version . Love love love it ! ! !
4 #### the best chicken base / bouillions available , still very salty but the flavor means you do n't need to use a much as cubes
2 #### It is quite salty & I think the ingredients should be more clearly listed for people who may have food sensitivities.yeast extract is often just a fancy name for MSG .
1 #### The picture is of the USDA Organic Chicken Base , this is not what I was sent . I 'm very upset about the bait and switch and am returning the product .
5 #### Yummy , relaxing tea . Drink slowly . Arrived on time , in good condition , & fresh . FYI : DOES NOT CONTAIN GINSENG which can increase pulse rate in some people , this is a soothing tea )
5 #### Really great peppermint tea in case you have stomach problems . Taste really good on its own .
1 #### It 's my own fault for not reading the ingredients . This product contains sugar ( cane juice solids . ) Why anyone would put sugar in a savory chicken bouillon is beyond me . For me at least , the sweet taste completely spoils it .
4 #### I love this but I found the same kind and size in the local store at half the price . It 's great stuff !
5 #### This is the best base for soup and gravy . I just love it I use it to make spit pea , chicken soup , stews .. very flavorful , not chalky .
5 #### I adore this brand of soup bases ! I even use it in a cup of hot water for a warming drink in the evenings !
5 #### We regularly use chicken stock in recipes , and usually buy an organic version from the grocery store . It 's a bit pricey , but we like to reduce our exposure to non - organic chicken as much as possible . However , we got tired of the high price of such stock , and went looking for alternatives . We found this base , gave it a try , and LOVED it . It 's a concentrate , so it takes up much less cabinet and refrigerator storage , and it dissolves quickly and easily in hot water . Also , this is one of the few products that we do n't buy via Amazon Prime even though it 's available , but it 's currently available for half the Prime price from other vendors , and you can get multiple jars for one flat shipping fee , which makes is significantly cheaper than both the Prime version and also cheaper than the stuff we get at the grocery store . Put it all together , and this has now become one of the staples in our kitchen - love it .
5 #### Very aromatic and deep flavor ! ! It is naturally sweet , too ! When I pour hot water onto this tea the aroma spreads to my entire office room . My co - workers know when I am drinking tea because they are lured to the staff room trying to find out what the great smell was all about . I offered them to join me and they never said no . I got this many tea bags for great low price with coupon and subscription combined , so I do n't have to be stingy to keep them all to myself !
5 #### Buy these locally if you can . The local store was reorganizing and the place was such a mess that I could n't locate the product when I needed to , so I tossed several into an Prime order that i was placing . I ended up paying twice the price . :-( Pretty bad deal really except the the actual product is excellent and much better than the MSG laced garbage from other bullion manufacturers that comes mostly in dry cubes .
5 #### This is the best tasting product of it 's kind anywhere ... and I 've tried them all due to a severe allergy to MSG . HOWEVER ........ the Amazon price is just about double what I pay for it in the grocery store . And .... yes .... you can find it at almost any larger grocery store . I usually get it on sale for 3.49 .
5 #### I have used this product for years and would be lost without it . It not only works for any and all recipes that call for chicken stock , but it is also great for adding chicken flavor to things like mashed potatoes , rice , etc . It is very handy for the " flu " season when you just want to hunker down with a cup of chicken soup . For those times , I make a cup of chicken broth using this product . Sometimes , I add leftovers from the fridge ... rice , vegies , chicken . The other flavors are also very handy ... adding distinct flavors to your cooking repertoire .
5 #### LOVE this tea ! You get a variety of tea flavors in one box . The tea tastes good and smells amazing . My husband loves very strong / concentrated tea , so I usually put in a bag of black tea and a bag of Celestial flavored tea and it comes out perfect . Buy this tea and you will not be disappointed ;)
5 #### This is my son 's favorite tea . Never had an issue with this product , always taste good and easy to make .
4 #### This is my husband and I 's favorite tea flavor all year round .
5 #### I bought this tea at our local grocery store , after not having had it in a long time . I really like it . My teenagers like it too . So I ordered this from Amazon . The tea is spicy without too much cinnamon flavor , as in many spicy teas . You can really taste the other spices . It 's really good if you steep the tea in a mug of hot apple cider . Tastes good plain , or with a little honey and milk / creamer .
5 #### One of my top 3 flavors . Herbal , caffeine free , tastes sensational : what more could you want ?
5 #### It 's a nice mild chai - like tea without the caffeine . It tastes almost sweet ( although there 's no sweeteners in it ) so I like it as a treat at night with some coconut cream in it - hot or cold - like a decadent dessert without the calories .
5 #### Just love this tea . Had it in out local Walmart but they discontinued it . It has a great spicy flavor and wonderful with something sweet .
5 #### I have purchased this product before and liked the flavor , as it does remind me of a black tea with a hint of black cherry berry , but I like the fact that it is a herbal tea .
5 #### This is my favorite flavor of tea . I steep it in a large glass container and drink it all day long . I 'm already set up to have it delivered in BULK every other month . So satisfying ..........
5 #### I love this peach - flavored tea . It 's delicious plus it kinda helps with my bowel movement .
5 #### Love the herbal tea that reminds me of coffee .
4 #### Loaded with antioxidants . A bit pricey . Not bad with a little Splenda .
5 #### This herbal tea is the absolute BEST ! I drink it everyday instead of plain water .
5 #### This tea is awesome ! Relaxing and great for promoting a good night 's sleep ! Tastes great also . Bought some extra for gifts !
1 #### I love the tea from this box and order it by the case but the new Celestial Seasonings Lemon Zinger is not in this box and does not taste anything like what they used to sell as Lemon Zinger . And sadly that is not what I received or ordered .
5 #### Works very well and has a very nice flavor !
5 #### This is some of the best tasting herbal teas I have ever tasted . It is like drinking iced juice . Love , love , love !
5 #### Love the flavor of this herbal tea . It is a good buy .
5 #### Fluffy soft pillow that provides support by being malleable . I 'm a side sleeper using cpap and it 's perfect for me . I do n't toss and turn much so once I 'm comfortable I stay put most of the night . I scrunch the pillow up under my head and neck - it 's not interfering with the cpap mask while giving me perfect comfort . With cpap or without this will be a comfy pillow for you .
5 #### Love the Sugar Cookie tea ! It literally tastes like a liquid sugar cookie . Perfect with 3 tablespoons of sugar ( I use xylitol , better for teeth ) . Best tea ever !
5 #### taste delicious love to add a little coconut sugar too it with a splash of soymilk
5 #### I love this tea . I can make at least 6 cups out of 2 teabags and it definitely does what it says it will do . It lowered my anxiety and stress levels .
5 #### I found this tea at Walmart & they do n't carry it anymore so was glad Amazon did . I initially purchased because it was caffeine free & calorie free . I continue to buy because this has replaced coffee for me , tastes great & makes my whole office smell good .
5 #### This tea is amazing ! ! I love the taste of real ginger , and it 's the main ingredient here ! This is a regular part of my monthly " Subscribe & Save " order . Much better price here than at the local stores . I make two cups most days , and drink it either warm or cold . It 's very refreshing . I 'm so glad I found this , and I hope it remains available ! ! ! Thank you !
5 #### As usual Celestial Seasonings never disappoints . Distinct flavors with a very pleasing scent .
5 #### Next to Candy Cane Lane , which is very hard to find , this is one of my favorite holiday teas .
3 #### Good flavor . delivered ahead of time , I would buy again
5 #### Amazon has made me a chai junkie . I 've tried several different mixes and concentrates and because of a different black tea I thought this would make an interesting alternative . I was right . Because water hot enough to make tea is also great at dissolving various chai latte mixes . Big Train Vanilla and Chamba Spiced and David Rio 's Elephant have all done well using this tea instead of plain water . I 'm very happy .
5 #### Deliciously holiday - ish , comforting taste . Just the thing for a winter pick - me - up .
5 #### I really like the taste of this tea ! Celestial Jammin Lemon Ginger Tea is great to have after a meal or before bedtime . I have it to sooth my tummy . The Lemon and Ginger with a little stevia is so good . I love it .
5 #### This tea is great . Each flavor is in a closed pouch inside the box . So far , the only flavor I 've tried is peppermint and it is so good ! I 'm having a cup as I write this review . One tea bag works wonderfully for a cup of tea , where some other brands need 2 tea bags in order to be flavorful . The peppermint flavor is minty , but not too minty . With a pinch of sugar , its like drinking a candy cane . I 'll try the other flavors at a later date , but if they are anywhere as flavorful or delicious as the peppermint , I know I 'll love them . It came so fast . I 've never seen these sampler boxes in my grocery stores , but regular boxes are more expensive than this box was . Plus I did n't even have to leave my home to get it . Really great product , I definitely will be buying this again .
5 #### My local stores quit carrying the Celestial Seasonings True Blueberry tea . I tried the other brands they had , none were as good and blueberry - y as Celestial Seasonings . I was so glad to find this on amazon . I drink a cup almost very night before bed .
5 #### Love my Celestial Seasonings natural teas and Amazon has a great price when purchased in six - packs with my prime membership ( free shipping , yea . ) Bengal Spice variety has rich , woodsy flavor with the perfect blend of spices . This is my all - time favorite flavored tea . A bit like Chai but with it 's own unique blend of spices that I prefer . I mix my teas with Triple Leaf Blood Pressure tea because it has no flavor of it 's own . My blood pressure stays where it should and I enjoy the accompanying flavor of the teas I brew together .
5 #### Love my Celestial Seasonings natural teas and Amazon has a great price when purchased in six - packs with my prime membership ( free shipping , yea . ) The Apple Spice variety has a lovely light flavor in a perfect blend of natural apple flavor and spices . I mix my teas with Triple Leaf Blood Pressure tea because it has no flavor of it 's own . My blood pressure stays where it should and I enjoy the accompanying flavor of the teas I brew together .
5 #### Love my Celestial Seasonings natural teas and Amazon has a great price when purchased in six - packs with my prime membership ( free shipping , yea . ) The orange spice variety has a lovely light flavor with the perfect blend of orange flavor and holiday spices . I mix my teas with Triple Leaf Blood Pressure tea because it has no flavor of it 's own . My blood pressure stays where it should and I enjoy the accompanying flavor of the teas I brew together .
5 #### I 've been drinking a ton of tea lately , both hot and iced . The problem is that I 'm really sensitive to caffeine so I have to limit my tea with caffeine to only a cup or two and only early in the day . I was so excited to see this black cherry berry tea is caffeine free ! The box was pretty and the name sounded tasty so I had high hopes for it . Well , I just brewed my first cup and I 'm in love ! I 've had problems in the past with berry flavored teas . They 're usually too bitter or I need a zillion tea bags to taste anything . This one is perfect though ! It 's incredibly light and refreshing . I decided to try it iced first . It 's full of flavor and does n't need much sugar ( or Truvia in my case ) to enjoy it . I think the sweet smell of it helps a lot in tricking my brain into thinking it 's sweeter then it actually is . It smells exactly like jello to me . Yum ! I put one bag in a quart size canning jar and added enough ice and water to fill it up . I was afraid it would be weak , but it still has a ton of flavor . I drink tea because I get bored of drinking straight up water . I think I 've found my new favorite tea to help up my water intake . Love , love , love it !
5 #### This tea reminds me of the holidays . It 's bold - very heavy on the cinnamon and very fruity - and tastes best when it 's brewed a little weak ( I 'm someone who normally likes very strong tea and this is too strong even for me ) . But wow does it smell good ! I like to put several tea bags in a coffee machine and brew a big pot and then leave the top part containing the wet filter sitting out on the counter for a few hours like potpourri , and the house smells wonderful . If you 're trying to sell a house and staging it for guests , brew this tea and fill the house up with this smell ! People will never want to leave !
3 #### I have been looking for my old , beloved " almond sunset " from Celestial Seasonings and when I did a search for it , Roastaroma came up . this is a very " robust " tea , almost a coffee . It in no way replaces my almond sunset , but if you want a decaf coffee or a " drink " to go with dessert , this is probably a good choice .
5 #### Amazing tea . Love it on winter days , and I am sure will love it as ice tea in the summer .
5 #### Love this decaffeinated tea as it tastes very good but also does the job as a good digestive aid and stomach discomfort soother . The lemon aroma helps mask the ginger taste , creating a very smooth and easy - to - drink ginger tea .
5 #### Love this stuff . I 'm not much of a tea drinker and this is the only tea I like . I 've been rationing it throughout the year until Christmas rolled around again and it was back on the shelves . However , I wised up and looked on Amazon . Doh . I bought this 6 - pack at a bargain price , and now I can have it whenever I want .
5 #### This is my favorite tea . Spicy and tastes a little sweet so no need for sugar . The best ! !
5 #### My favorite tea ! It tastes wonderfully close to coffee , but with a unique spice blend . Delicious ! This bundle of 6 boxes is a great price too !
5 #### So good ! Reminds me of traditional masala CHAI of India . Great hot or cold . Yummy!0
5 #### great price and really yummy . i love it to drink all day and night .
5 #### Fantastic flavor . When I serve this to guests , they do n't even realize that it is n't regular , caffeinated , black tea . Excellent alternative to chemically treated , decaffeinated tea .
4 #### Since my nearest supermarket stopped carrying , I 've looked in others , hard to find . Tension Tamer is kind of earthy , love it . So now I have to buy it in multiples . Great to have it on hand . For years I had a whole potful every single night . Still enjoy it often .
3 #### Not a very good hot tea but delicious chilled on a hot summer day .
3 #### Cinnamon is way too overpowering for me . I did n't feel that it was like chai at all . I wish they would bring back their India Spice Chai . This would be good used in Russian Tea ,
5 #### Good stuff ... I brew a cup for my ride home from work ... Works well ..
5 #### A wonderful full flavored blueberry hibiscus tea . Caffeine and I do n't mix well in the afternoon and this tea hits the spot perfectly for a hot soothing late evening beverage . I really love the steamy blueberry vapor rolling of my mug when I drink it . I admit I 'm hooked !
5 #### My favorite flavor of herbal tea ever ! In the summer , I put six bags in a half - gallon jug of filtered water , let sit in the sun for six hours , and have an awesome ice tea that requires no sugar , it 's so flavorful . In the winter , nothing quite like the spicy flavor after a walk on a cold , brink morning !
1 #### This is the worst tea from Celestial . It tastes straight up like cinnamon and vanilla . If there are any other flavors , they are hidden behind the cinnamon flavor . If you like Big Red Gum or Red Hots in a tea , you may dig it . I honestly think that they were aiming for chai and flopped and renamed it something vague enough to save face .
5 #### The first cup tasted intensely good , but ' perfumed ' of sorts . Since the second cup this is one of my favorite teas , and I am sharing samples with others who love tea . There is no need to keep a rea this good a secret ! By the way , in my opinion the stringest flavor is cinnamon , and oh is it good ! Dbeing decaf you can have it anytime .
5 #### We buy it by the case . Good hot or cold . Nice price
5 #### This is fabulous tea . I drink it both hot and iced . I prefer it iced . It literally smells and tastes like peach . There is another peach tea I bought once when I could n't find this one ; it was not near the same tasted more like a peach pie then peach I found and bought this before I had even finished the other box . It has a smooth taste both hot and iced . As always Celestial Seasonings uses just a bag no string and tag . My only complaint is that they are in stay fresh pouches and not in individual bags preventing me from storing them in my beautiful bamboo tea box .
5 #### Perfect bland of sweetness and tea . Will order again . I have a box at job at all times . Drink it everyday .
5 #### If you are trying to cut back on coffee and caffeine , this is a great substitute . Love the taste and the cost is better than I have found anywhere .
5 #### Loved this ! Each bag is quite generous , not like those little package teabags on strings . Will definitely reorder .
4 #### great tasting tea . packaging is kind of annoying - each flavor comes in its own packet . need to open these up , but then they are n't resealable . there are only a few in each so they are n't likely to go stale or lose much flavor , but you need to keep all the pouches because the pillow tea bags inside are not labeled .
5 #### I have never tried fruit herbal tea before and I am glad I chose this fruit tea sampler pack . These tea bags have no strings which is nice . The tea tastes fresh and I really like the variety of flavors in the box .
5 #### All natural and delicious . Drinking a cup right now !
3 #### I mix this with straight green tea and it 's a perfect match .
5 #### This is a delicious tea ! It 's caffeine free but I guess it would n't be much of a " Tension Tamer " if it doped you up on caffeine . The mix of herbs is excellent and it really does calm you down . I love tea in general and this brand / type will definitely be in my rotation .
4 #### Very spicy tea . Unfortunately I did n't notice any plum flavor . I will gladly consume the two boxes I have but will not be buying more . It 's not terrible but not really good either . Average . But for just a few dollars a box ( in stores ) it 's worth a try anyways . * * * Looks like I have to update my 3 star review to 4 stars . My husband had a cup of this tea and fell in love with it . So he rates it as one of the best teas he 's ever had and I rate it as average :-)
5 #### Delicious mild peach flavor . Good cold or hot without worrying about caffeine or additives . Best price that I can find , especially using Amazon Prime !
5 #### This is the best tea . It 's fresh , spicy , delicious . I drink this tea with a little organic creamer when I want a treat for my sweet tooth . It does n't have any sugar but it 's very satisfying for my afternoon sweet craving . Also very nice after dinner treat .
5 #### I am one who has a natural strong desire for sweets but who dislikes the side effects of so many of the things that satisfy . Loading up on sugar is never a good idea and I do n't use any artificial sweeteners so am I ever happy with this tea . One glass of iced tea = zero calories , zero carbs , no negative effects and a hushed craving . My local stores quit carrying this - and I live in a not - at - all remote area - so based on supply / demand I can only surmise that maybe I do have a more vicious sweet tooth than most but this tea makes it as tame as the tiger on the box .
5 #### I love this hot with a little creamer . As Ice tea it has a bite but some creamer helps take the bite but leaves the great taste .
5 #### helps me to sleep , altho is not a sleep aid , per se .
5 #### I love the true blueberry taste this has . Celestial teas have a stronger taste of blueberries than other teas I have tried .
4 #### When I ordered this , I was n't reading it properly , I thought it said Jasmine Lemon Ginger tea , which I liked the idea of . I 've tried them and they are nice , but nothing to go crazy about . I like to try different flavors , maybe I 'll get some Jasmine tea bags and mix them with these !
4 #### Not what I thought I ordered but good tea .
5 #### Excellent for my personal use and for gifts , as well .
4 #### This is my favorite tea , ever . It really does seem to help with anxiety and stress , and I always feel quite a bit calmer after having a cup . My only real concern about , is the Soy Lecithin in the ingredients listed on the package . Those with an intolerance to soy , should be aware of this ingredient in this product ..
5 #### Highest quality tea that actually tastes incredible ! good one ! !
5 #### This is delicious on its own as an iced tea , which is how I use it . It also blends well with other Celestial Seasonings fruit teas , such as Black Cherry Berry and True Blueberry . And it 's cheaper on Amazon , per pack when you buy six , than it is at my neighborhood grocery store .
5 #### I love the taste of this tea . It is smooth and rich . It has loads of flavor . I am not fond of fruit teas and this is so nice for a different flavor . It does n't have that unpleasant bite some teas have when you brew them too long . I do n't drink coffee in the summer because it raises my body temperature and I just feel too hot , but i crave it . This is a great taste to take its place . I am pleased that it does n't give me any indigestion or reflux . I can drink it in the evening . It brews a satisfying dark brown color . I love it with a little brown sugar .
5 #### This is my favorite tea , especially in the fall . I use homemade cashew milk and it 's like a dessert , so creamy and rich . I have tried many chai style teas and this is by far my favorite . I do n't know how they do it , but whatever they do - I hope they never change a thing !
5 #### One of my favorite teas of all time . It 's perfect at night to calm me into falling asleep . The taste is amazing , too . Recommended !
5 #### This is my favorite everyday ice tea . Quinshes thurst and settle the stomach .
5 #### Great for Ice tea . I like the ginger twist .
5 #### Great item at a great price . I would recommend .
5 #### Celestial Seasonings Herbal Tea Sampler ( 18 count ) has some delectable and soothing flavors for enjoying tea ( this edition has chamomile , lemon zinger , peppermint , honey vanilla chamomile , and sleepytime flavors ) , One of the reasons why I purchased this tea from my job was a way to help get a nourishing liquid in my system that would help reduce my appetite .
5 #### Cinnamon tea is a favorite at my house . This tea is the only one we have found that has that Cinnamon Candy Apple taste . So yummy !
4 #### Nice cup of tea . Nice , rich blueberry flavor . A good change of pace from regular tea . Caffeine free so it 's nice in the evening .
5 #### since blueberries have so many healing properties , I figured I would just tear open each package and mix it with my fiber and my unfiltered apple cider vinegar and truth be told , I felt better and my memory improved a bit
4 #### I have mixed feelings about this tea . I want to like it since I love all things with apple and cinnamon . But it falls a bit short . I do n't know , it 's not a terrible flavor , it 's just that it 's hard to drink down more than half a cup . So to sum it up , I feel the same way about this tea as I do my mother ... nice in small doses , but overwhelms me easily .
5 #### My favorite tea , mixed with some honey . Yummy . I store in individual glass bottles so I can drink it cold or heat it up ( in the bottle ) . Very calming .
5 #### Make that feeling of deprivation . This tea is wonderful . It has no calories and not only leaves me , someone who loves sweets , with no desire to add sugar but additionally satisfies my cravings for sweets to the point I can use this to minimize the deviations from a pretty healthy diet . A cup of tea vs a cookie works for me .
5 #### Wow ! A very peachy tea ! I love white iced tea , and was looking for a peach flavored tea to add in to my favorite white peony tea and this is just perfect ! I add 3 - 4 tea bags per 8 cups of water , along with 1/4 cup of white peony tea , let it steep for 5 minutes , and strain . It makes a perfect peach flavored iced tea !
5 #### This is the tea I used to help me kick the morning coffee habit . It 's rich cinnamon and clove flavors made for a bold hot drink that worked as a pick me up with out the caffeine . I 'm a regular drinking of it now , with a little honey or sugar and almond milk .. Yummy ! A very satisfying tea , and perhaps it 's just me being a little wacky , but it seems to help my appetite . It works well as a between meal snack .
5 #### The ginger is really strong the only by if you like ginger . Ginger is very good for the digestive system .
5 #### I enjoy these tea immensely . I am a little troubled that the teas are so heavily dyed and also sweetened . My favorites of the flavors are the raspberry and cherry and course those are the first to go and my least favorite is the blueberry . The blueberry flavor in my opinion is reminiscent of berry flavored cough syrup . I enjoy drinking these because Celestial uses rose hips as one of the herbal ingredients .And I read and believe that rose hips can help alleviate some pre - menstrual symptoms but dubious pseudo- science aside these are just really juicy and flavorful teas .
5 #### My favorite Celestial Seasonings tea of all time . I even use it as a base for making fake coffee ( Pero ) .
1 #### I did not like the taste of this tea . It had a strong artificial peach taste and I could n't get past it .
5 #### This is really great . I am not a tea or coffee drinker so I do n't drink tea often but when I do it is this one .
5 #### This is one of my favorite teas of all time and in recent years I could not find it on store shelves . I am very happy to find a 6 - pack on Amazon . This is a very spicy and flavorful tea . I was surprised to find that it did not contain caffeine as it is similar in strength to chai tea . I love it with a bit of cream / milk . It has enough sweetness where you do not need to add sugar or honey . I ca n't recommend this tea enough .
5 #### Delicious tea . I recently was out of town and bought some peach tea from a Walmart , and it was not nearly as good as this tea is . This tea just tastes like quality .
5 #### This is really yummy tea that I love to make iced tea out of . Hard for me to remember it does n't have caffeine tho .
5 #### I 'm hooked on this tea . It 's not available in stores , but is the only herbal tea that tastes like regular Lipton tea . I needed to avoid the side effects of black tea . I can use one tea bag twice by taking it out of my mug full of hot water after a minute the first time , then longer the second time . It does n't get bitter .
5 #### This is the best tea ever ! ! If you want an alternative to a dessert , this is it ! To be clear this is an herbal tea , and has no caffeine . That 's why I was initially turned off of this product . But I wanted dessert taste so I went ahead and got it . It has now turned into my favorite tea , and all of my coworkers favorite tea(as far as dessert tea ) ! Just add a little cream and sugar and the sugar cookie will pop out of the cup ! You will not be disappointed ! ! You can find this item at Krogers or at Whole Foods , but only in the winter time . So stock up now !
5 #### very tasty and I love to have it when my stomach is a little rumbly
5 #### I love lemon ginger tea , this brand was really yummy .
2 #### This is a very pleasant tea mix but , every single one of Celestial 's tea flavors that include cinnamon , there is always way to much and it ruins what would be an excellent drink . If i wanted a cinnamon only flavored drink I 'd make one myself . They seem to get turned on by adding too much cinnamon and this flavor is no different . The cinnamon washes out every other flavor .
5 #### I really like this as iced tea ..... doesn't need any sugar .
5 #### This is a favorite variety pack by Celestial Seasonings that I buy all of the time . Stash this tea in your cupboard ! Herbal means these teas are perfect anytime .
5 #### Great selection of teas ! One for every mood , and in this package you get tons ! Wish winter would come back so I could drink it every day .
5 #### THE BEST lemon ginger tea I have ever tried . Full flavored .
5 #### Terrific tea- is stronger than most mint teas without being ' biting ' . I use this in combination with Celestial Seasonings Mint Decaf Green Tea to make my go - to tea : 2 bags of Mint Decaf Green Tea + 1 bag Peppermint . This combo also works well for sun tea ( ramp up number of bags used for the increased volumes brewed ) . Have had complements on the blend , and this tea is the secret ingredient ! :))
2 #### Very weak . I have to use 4 tea bags just to be able to taste it . And without strings you have to use a spoon to get the bags out . Using 4 bags per cup ? Expensive ! K - cups would have been cheaper . I 'll never buy these again and I ordered 6 boxes
5 #### We are addicted to this tea . If you like a chai like tea with no caffeine and lots of taste , this is the tea for you . We like it so much we buy six boxes at a time .
5 #### Gave up coffee and this is the best ever substitute .... no caffeine but delicious flavor ... sometimes I add a slice of ginger .
5 #### This tea is strong with a strong ginger undertone that is lifted by the light , fresh lemon taste ( and scent ) . It is a comforting taste and the smoothness makes it a great after meal or dessert tea .
5 #### This is great any time you feel tense . I especially like it before bed , better than Sleepytime in my opinion . I usually use two bags .
5 #### I buy this all the time . It is truly one of my daily staples . I could not find it in the stores next to where I live so I bought enough to last me a year !
5 #### I love the flavor of this tea . A great buy .
5 #### My favorite ! I mix it with white tea add nonfat milk and it tastes like chai with no added sweetener and it is heart healthy and diet friendly too !
5 #### Love these . We mix them , 4 cups to a gallon of decaf tea , and use it as flavored tea at lunch and dinner . Everyone seems to like it .
5 #### Delightful iced or hot tea without the caffeine buzz .
5 #### My favorite tea . Try it and you 'll be hooked .
5 #### I order this over and over it again its wonderful
5 #### This is my favorite tea that I make almost every day . Unsweetened , it has a nice astringent , hibiscus bite to it , and if you add some honey it mellows into a delicious berry drink . Very cooling and refreshing .
5 #### I love to drink peppermint tea hot or cold when I am nauseated . I find that it can also help with indigestion ( gas ) . I like the Celestial Seasonings tea flavor the best out of all peppermint teas that I have tried . I would highly recommend this product to others . { Tip : mice dislike peppermint so expired tea bags can be packed away where mice are a issue change periodically . }
5 #### I am not a tea drinker at all .. I was getting tired of coffee and was ready to change it up some . This reminds me of hot cinnamon . I really like this and can drink it instead of coffee . Teavana has a tea that has a similar taste to this but this is half the cost of teavana products and worth it .
5 #### This tea has a much better flavor than just plain chamomile and still relaxes me into sleepy mode .
5 #### One of my favorite teas . Great price for six packs .
4 #### Smells more cherry than it tastes ! Enjoying the tea ! Just wish it packed more cherry taste ! Very aromatic !
5 #### Lemon Ginger Tea , this brand is excellent , calms the tummy and the spirit , a healthy thing .
5 #### Love , love , love this stuff . Great for an afternoon break . The lemon smells like heaven . Leave the bag in your cup a long time , and the heat of the ginger comes through . So glad I tried this .
5 #### Gingerbread Spice tea is the only tea I buy , especially during the holidays . Because it is a multi - pack , it lasts me through the holidays and into the new year . I 'm all out now because it is almost Summer , but I will be re - ordering again this fall .
5 #### I do n't normally like yea but this is mild snd flavorfull
5 #### I love this flavor ! It 's weird , but it really does mellow you out a tiny bit . Something about the smell and the taste is very relaxing . One of my favorites .
5 #### My wife loves this stuff and drinks 3 - 4 cups a night . It actually relaxes her leg muscle spasms and helps her get to sleep .
5 #### My favorite lemon ginger tea ! Price is good and subscribe and save makes it convenient to get monthly . I love adding this to regular tea or add to the chai or bengal tiger celestial seasonings for a great flavor and boost of lemon .
5 #### Always The Best . My favorite brand of Herbal Teas . Peppermint Tea is my secret stomach fixer upper when I 've had too much of the wrong ( But Very Tasty ) foods .
5 #### I love this tea , more like a wonderfull chai , I drink it all the time
5 #### This is my favorite flavored tea , I mix it with green and drink it all morning .
5 #### I was really impressed with the taste of this after I made a cup of broth just to try it . I do n't actively look for vegan products , but was wonderfully surprised at how this tasted like bouillon that is non - vegan , perhaps better than some I 've tried ! I know I 'll find more uses for it and it will be very handy when a person is ill and needs to make sure they get enough liquids in their system since this is so easy to use and so tasty as well !
4 #### This blends very easily in cold water , making it ideal for use in gravy to add a little " oomph " to stretch those pan drippings ! I like that I can keep it in the cupboard , and it 's not full of fat like so many other bouillon products . I do n't give this a 5 , though , because the title is misleading . There is no beef at all in this broth powder . It is a vegan product ( per label ) , and contains no MSG .
5 #### This is excellent bullion at a bargain price . Since its a powder you can much more easily make an accurate measurement of how much you want to add to your stock . And as a powder , it contains slightly less sodium than the familiar cubed bullion . A little of this powder goes a long ways for it is so rich . So this 8 oz . package ends up being a bargain for it will last most of us through several winters . I highly recommend it . It has helped me make the best vegetable beef soup in the United States .
5 #### Nice sweet flavor , plus its herbal so no real need to worry about drinking too much ( like with green tea or coffee because of the caffeine in those drinks ) . I just wish it was offered all year instead of just at Christmas time . But that 's why I come here .
4 #### Very nice pack . Different tastes for every ocasion . I like them all .
5 #### We loves peppermint herbal tea and we have tried several brand and this one who has the better taste , not too strong , not to watery , perfect for our taste .
3 #### got what i paid for , but it works better than i though it would , good job guys ill buy again
5 #### This is by far the best ( most beefy ) tasting beef broth I have ever used . Its not at all salty tasting , but then I 'm adding to soup . Do n't try to drink it straight , there is not a commercial beef broth on the market that could stand up to that test ! The point is how does it compare to other cubes and powders of broth , and its the BEST ! ! Barry Farms Beef Broth Powder has rescued many a pot of rather weak tasting soup and elevated its apparent quality to the point of rave reviews from my family ! !
1 #### To get any flavor at all , this product is as salty as brine . So was the chicken broth . I 'll probably throw both bags out .
5 #### I was surprised to find out this was vegan . But it make for a great addition to any meat sauce or gravy . I have even added a bit to rubs for things like brisket or anything that I want to taste meaty .
5 #### It arrived earlier than estimated time of arrival . It looks exactly as what 's in the picture and qualiy is great !
5 #### We love Jammin ' Lemon Ginger Tea . It has just the right blend of lemon and ginger kick . My daughter and I often make a pot in the afternoon as homework and housework wind down .
5 #### Have not seen this flavor in the store . Delicious .
5 #### This tea works the best I have found for a good nights sleep when I 'm all tense . Tastes good too .
5 #### I love this tea . I will buy again and again !
5 #### I buy this tea on a regular basis . It 's even better through Amazon !
5 #### I am no longer able to find it on my grocery shelves , and love this flavor / brand so much that I 'm willing to order it
5 #### Great tea I used the mock Kool Aid recipe online and it really does taste like Kool Aid . Without all the sugar .
5 #### I like this for just having a hot drink available at work or camping .
5 #### Product arrived on the 29th day of 9th month in the year of 2016 . Not sure of exact time because I was out from 13:00 until around 17:30 and when I got home package was in my mail box . Now I have to charge my electric cigarette and fill with flavored fluid . I am sure it will work as advertised so thanks again .
5 #### Amazing flavor or use it for my Vape great I ordered 10 more than I did so good recommend it to everyone it 's amazing The price is great amazing
3 #### My wife really likes this tea . I think it is ok . The smell is really nice and it is pretty potent . You can fill it up a couple times and it still retains some flavor . I do n't particularly care for the fact that it does n't have any ingredients that carry a powerful therapeutic punch .
5 #### Love my Arnold Palmers : Brew half gallon of tea ( 4 double bags of Green tea and 5 double bags of herbal peach ) Add bottle of Minute Maid 15 calorie lemonade and stir . Add lots of ice to each cup , pour , and sweeten a bit more to taste . I drink it all day and add a little more water and sweet and low or Truvia for each glass .
5 #### Before I even lowered the tea bag into the hot water , the smell of the tea was delicious ! After steeping the bag and removing it , WOW , it tasted delicious ! It was such a relaxing , calming afternoon I had while sipping that tea . My 25 - year old son walked in the room and even asked me what smelled so good . He normally notices NOTHING ! I am a huge tea - drinker when I am either sick or upset , and I can vouch for Celestial Seasonsings Mandarin Orange just melting away the tensionI highly recommend it .

5 #### This is one of my favorite teas that come in tea bags . Celestial seasonings is really good . I like that the tea bags do n't have strings and paper . I always have to tear those things off anyways . The bit of honey and vanilla flavoring make this tea really tasty without adding a bunch of sugar . I will not buy another type of chamomile again ( after learning the hard way ) .
5 #### i work overnights , one cup when I get home in the morning and I sleep like a toddler
4 #### Excellent tea , that is reminiscent of coffee . The only thing I do n't like about it , is that it is a bit " too " clove - y for my taste . I cut it with Dandy Blend , and it is fine .
5 #### Such a delicious brew to drink right before bed . Not too sweet , just the perfect amount of flavor .
5 #### Exactly what I expected and hoped for . Very rich flavor .
5 #### My husband and I are normally Earl Grey tea or coffee drinkers , but on chilly winter nights , whenever either of us has a cold , or on any other occasion calling for something hot and non - caffeinated , this is our beverage of choice . Unlike most herb teas , it has a complex , interesting flavor which we normally enhance with a little honey . We did n't realize how much we depended on it until we discovered our grocery store was no longer stocking it and had to try weak " tangerine orange " stuff instead . By halfway through our first cup I was on Amazon searching for a supply of mandarin orange spice . It has a very pleasant orange - cinnamon - clove taste that is more robust that the average herbal tea , and it 's a taste we never tire of . We both have colds right now and will probably go through the first box by mid - week . Good to know we have replacements waiting on the shelf in the pantry .
5 #### If you use hoisin sauce in your cooking , this is the stuff to get . I have to get it through Amazon because the local place can not maintain it in stock -- it sells out too fast , which , of course , means they have no idea how to run their business , but I digress . This sauce is neither too sweet or too salty so it blends well with the other stuff you are using to make a sauce .
4 #### I used to get this at a large Asian grocery out of state but I do not go there any longer . My wife and think this is brand is one of the best on the market .
5 #### We stumbled upon this in an Asian grocery and enjoyed it for years before they went out of business . What followed was trying other brands of Hoisin Sauce which were too sweet and lacking a distinctive flavor . We were also less happy with the liquid form many other brands would take . This is more thick and like a paste than other brands ( in a good way ) . We 're happy to find this on Amazon so we can enjoy our dumpling and eggrolls again .
5 #### Love this stuff . On eggrolls or anything asian and suddenly your in you favorite chinese restaurant - or better yet , traveling somewhere near The Great Wall ! I 'm so addicted to this stuff . It 's delicious and goes great with Moo - Shoo anything ! If you 're a chinese food lover , you know this sauce is a MUST . Settle for nothing less . Love this stuff . Sweet , salty and tangy . Just how it should be ! ~ Yum ! ~ Oh by the way ... a little goes a long long way !
5 #### I use this to make my vape juice , and it awesome . Really good flavor .
5 #### Wish they had the tea bags individually wrapped for easier display for guests . Bigelow has them wrapped as singles but not the variety of herbal tea flavors .
5 #### Try this on chicken , to bake or fry .. awesome flavor ..
5 #### My husband cooks Chinese food . We have used many brands of Hoisin Sauce . This is the best . Thick and complex .
5 #### I'v been using this brand of Hoisin for years . It 's balance of ingredients and flavors are definitely superior . Ken Bass , Author " Bistro Style at Home "
5 #### I always describe this as " Christmas in a cup " because if you have been into a grocery store with a florist area or craft / hobby store ( e.g. Michael 's ) around Christmas time , the first thing I smell is cinnamon from the cinnamon pine cones . This tastes just like that and I love it . Though my favorite is to combine it with Celestial Seasoning India Spice Chai Tea . It cuts the strong cinnamon flavor and works great with the chai tea .
4 #### very tasty and canbrew it in tap water withice as well as hot , .
5 #### Oh my god ! How can I explain the best tea I have ever tasted . Prepare it using scalding hot water . let sit for 5 minutes and add the creamer of your choice . This tea is spicy , sweet and touch the flavor buds providing satisfaction .
5 #### If you love peppermint and you love tea this is for YOU !
5 #### Sweet scent of sugar cookie , does need to steep for full flavor . Honey bring out the best of this , and if you chill it makes great sleigh ride light iced tea through summertime ! !
5 #### My wife loves this stuff so it must be good . LOL
5 #### This is a great product ! ! I drink a lot of tea , and love flavored ones . This peppermint flavor is smooth , and it is very inviting when you are sick .
5 #### This one is a keeper ! Little fruity , little spice . With it still being pretty cold , a perfect tea to snuggle in with and watch a movie .
5 #### Delicious peach flavored herbal tea . I am very sensitive to caffeine ... it gives me insomnia if I have a cup of regular non - herbal tea after 1 pm so even though I love black tea , I have to stick with herbal teas . I had a box of a wonderful mango and peach herbal tea from a UK company which I finished off and found that the company no longer makes that flavor . This one of peach only from CS is a good substitute . I let mine steep a longer time than recommended .
5 #### Really works when I am stressed and starting to feel anxious and irritable ! !
3 #### I love the ingredients , but this tea was just not for me ... there 's something in here that I 'm not a fan of . Maybe it 's the cloves ? I gave it to my Indian boss who loved it .
5 #### Had great watermelon flavor ! A little bit goes a long way .
5 #### Peach flavor is my favorite of this brand 's selection of fruit teas .
5 #### Tastes like tea ! What more could you ask ( well ... maybe a string on the tea bag so you do n't scald / burn your fingers ) .
5 #### Great price & convenience . Adds nice rich , Chai like flavor to my tea blends - mix with Morning Thunder for added caffeine .
5 #### Great price & convenience . Adds nice rich , almost coffee like flavor to my tea blends - mix with Bengal Spice ( Chai like ) for more flavor , or Morning Thunder for added caffeine .
5 #### Love this tea for iced tea in the summer . Great value and I will buy again . You ca n't buy this cheap at the grocery store !
5 #### This is my favorite tea . The flavors are delicious and I brew several cups from one tea bag . They are fresh and well sealed . I even like the colorful box they come in . I find it hard to decide which one to brew because I like them all !
5 #### I first discovered Celestial Seasoning teas in college -- Red Zinger was my go - to cup back then -- but I was never a huge fan of most " herbal " teas . This warm spice mixture has made me a believer again . For one thing , the sweetness of it ( that cinnamon / clove combo ) makes it a great way to stave off sugar cravings if you 're dieting . ( Cinnamon is known to regulate blood sugar , which is a good thing . ) I love it in the morning and when I drink a little orange juice along with it , the combination just makes my palate want to sing . The clove accent is there but the cinnamon and ginger and other spices keep it in check . ( A little clove goes a LONG way with me . ) . The fragrance alone is yummy .
1 #### I did not like it . I gave it to my daughter who likes ginger
4 #### Easy to use . Very strong flavor . Flavor seems to be very close to watermelon , but do not use too much . Price was good . Shipping a bit slower than other items I have gotten . I use this in frosting , and water for ice cubes . I add cucumber ice cubes and these to punch . Nice combo .
5 #### Could n't find this flavor anywhere but Amazon . Happy to have this flavor .
5 #### Really like this new tea . Just the right amount of lemon and ginger combo . Enjoy !
5 #### For drinking , it is good hot or cold , and I even add a bag to my water before cooking oatmeal ( throw bag away after it steeps a few min , or make up a batch and keep it in a jar in the refrigerator , then use it for half of your liquid , and water for the rest . ) . It gives the oatmeal a sweet , cinnamon - y taste that is just too yummy ! It only needs a little bit of raw honey and a banana added , for just the right amount of sweetness for me , plus I add some ground flax seed and top it off with almond milk or coconut milk . Makes a hearty , healthy and delicious breakfast .
4 #### My daughter loves this in her water . She does not drink enough water , but this really helps ! Only ONE single drop in a 16 oz . bottle is enough to taste like those expensive flavored waters . Saves us lots of $ $ $ ! The price on this tiny bottle could be a little less expensive , though . I saw it at a craft & hobby shop cheaper after I bought this .
4 #### The tea is good . I took off a star for packaging . There are 4 bags to a pack and they look mauled after you remove one bag . Once a pack is opened it does not make a nice presentation for guests .
5 #### I love this tea , especially in the winter , it 's soothing and good tasting . I 'm going to try making ice tea too . As soon as winter leaves our state ...
5 #### Fragrant and smooth tasting . I have served it to my family and friends and everyone loves it and asks what it is .
5 #### Love this tea . Bought some a few years back and had nt been able to find since . I bought multiples this year so we would have stock .
5 #### Delicious ! Like others , I gave up coffee / caffeine for health reasons . Found out even decaf coffee has a little bit of caffeine , and so I got into tea . But I still missed the heartiness of coffee . This tea is delicious ! Unlike other teas , it stands up really well to creamer . I like to use just a tiny bit of almond milk or soy milk creamer . I have it every day now , sometimes twice a day . I 'm only worried I 'll get sick of it , and I really hope not .
5 #### One of my favorite Celestial Seasonings teas . Flavorful and tangy , quite delicious .
5 #### Honestly , the best tasting tea ever ! My coworker brought in a box and after one cup , I came home and ordered this six pack . The blend of ingredients is unique and extremely flavorful . I was so excited when it arrived . My teenage son warned me to hide them - it really is that good . I ca n't truly say I feel less tension when I drink it , but it is a pleasure nonetheless .
5 #### This is one of my favorite teas ( add a little sweetener and some cremeYUM ! )
5 #### This tea is awesome ! I mainly bought it to brew it and then ice it but I also drink it hot with a french vanilla creamer in it and it 's divine ! ! I 'm a huge cinnamon fan so this is a Godsend ! Do n't be like the ignorant that do n't realize that EVERYWHERE you look , the first ingredient is cinnamon ! That 's the idea . PS : I use less bags to get solid flavor than any other tea ( 6 instead of 8 in a pitcher ) so it 's well worth the price , just ordered 6 more boxes !
5 #### " Fruitiest " tasting tea ever ! Love this tea - not weak or watery like some brands . Very flavorful .
5 #### i love these teas ! The Honey Vanilla Chamomile is my favorite and i ordered another 6 pack of that one because i liked it so much . I usually drink the Sleepytime tea at night but wanted to try some other flavors . The regular Chamomile and Peppermint are pretty " normal " tasting and was very much like other brands i 've tried . The Lemon Zinger is great for iced tea or day time since it gives a nice tangy kick . The Honey Vanilla Chamomile has a " warm " feeling and makes my nighttime tea a little more enjoyable and i believe it helps me fall asleep , as does the Chamomile and Sleepytime teas .
5 #### This is my favorite fruit tea . Others often contain strong amounts of cinnamon or licorice or ..... These are fresh and fruity tasting .
4 #### This is good herbal tea with chicory . It 's only good though for one cup at a time , because the flavor is stronger than what I 'd prefer .
5 #### This is my favorite - best tasting green tea I have ever had
5 #### Yummy ! This tea is so good . Great to have in the evening .
5 #### This is my Hubby'sfavorite tea . Ca n't find it anywhere in our area and then lo and behold there it is , in bulk , on amazon . Yay ! I won the best wife award :)
5 #### Love this tea and so calming , relaxing and the flavor is wonderful . I enjoy it anytime of the day or evening and a great treat for me . Coming from Colorado and a rare native of Denver I love " buying local " from a company that knows their herbal teas .
5 #### I like this tea . It 's a lot different from chai teas , it 's a lot spicier . I can definitely taste the cinnamon . I do n't need sugar for the tea because it 's sweet on its own which is purfect for me because I 'm trying to consume less sugar in my diet . It 's a great tea to add milk or cream to because it 's so strong . My brother tried the tea and he compared it to Big Red chewing gum and he likes it . My mother on the other hand , compared it to Father John cough syrup and was not so crazy about it but we all agreed it was definitely sweet .
3 #### Good , but the ginger is strong and pretty overpowering .
2 #### Too much of something . I was looking for an alternate to my fave Stash Licorice Spice tea , but Bengal spice is not the answer by any means ! Plus what is the deal with no strings or separate packaging ? ? Three words , cheap ... cheap ... cheap . Sorry , but I tossing the rest of this stuff . Glad I only bought one box on sale at Peapod . IMHO
5 #### What a way to treat yourself and relax . Hot or chilled , it 's delicious !
5 #### great addition to my summer caffeine free iced tea
5 #### Proper steeping time is required to get the right taste , otherwise the taste of vanilla will overwhelm the tea . I suggest 10 minutes . I know it 's a long wait , but it 's worth it . I get great pleasure out of making a cup of this tea for anyone that has not tried it and waiting to see the look on their face . I wait as it steeps with a secret grin and then let it cool a little until it is the perfect temperature . My friends do n't come back asking for more , because they are immediately to the store to buy their own . It is simply the best tea I have ever had anywhere . It is wonderful hot on a snowy evening and steeped and cooled and poured over ice in the summer . IT is wonderful to combine with another fruit like tea to give it a kick . It is wonderful in every way .
5 #### One of the cleanest tasting peppermint teas I 've found . Relatively strong peppermint flavor ( less than Pompadour , more than any other widely distributed peppermint tea I 've found ) .
5 #### I love almost all the Celestial Seasonings Teas . This is one of my favorites . The flavor is mild and not too fruity . It smells wonderful . I love it with cream . Yumminess heavenly peaches and cream in a cup .
5 #### A favorite tea in our household for times when we feel stressed or before bed instead of Sleepytime . This tea is hard to find locally , so I 'm so glad Amazon stocks it .
4 #### Way , way too much vanilla ... I used two bags in a 40 oz glass kettle , and still had to add a 1:3 ratio of water to tea in order to dilute the taste . Real Indian chai is also sweet , but in a different way ... you can still taste the cinnamon , cloves and other spices . With this tea , the sweetness overpowers the other flavors . I 'm guessing this is Celestial 's way of pandering to the bland American palate ... guess I need to be less lazy and just go buy the raw ingredients and make my own ! = = = UPDATE : Well , I figured out how to make this drinkable : add about an inch of whole milk to each mug of it . The milk dilutes the sweetness and subtly brings out more of the other flavors .
5 #### Good flavor and caffeine free . The ginger is fairly strong and it pairs well with the lemon . Perfect tea when you are n't feeling well .
3 #### I was a little disappointed with this product . I 'm a big fan of Celestial Seasonings teas , but they 've changed the recipe for this particular tea and you ca n't taste any apple in it . Cinnamon is the almost overbearing flavor . So if you want to taste apple in your tea , you may not want this one .
5 #### just an awesome product .. I have enjoyed this for many years . I now have this on subscribe and save
5 #### This stuff tastes like fall / winter . The cloves and cinnamon pack a great punch that warms you up from the inside out . Think of drinking the spice from a pumpkin pie ( without the pumpkin ) , and you are thinking about this tea . Even my wife , who had never found a tea she liked , has consumed a number of cups of this wonderful beverage .
5 #### Five TASTY Stars ! This Celestial Seasonings caffein - free Country Peach Passion flavor herbal tea comes in a one sealed package of 20 unique pillow style bags without the traditional strings , paper tags , staples , or individual wrappers ( which Celestial Seasonings claims saves 3.5 million pounds of waste from entering landfills annually ) . After steeping the pillow bag in hot water for 4 minutes , the resultant tea is very flavorful and can be served by the cup , tea pot , or as a cold drink , following their directions . Each bag contains orange peel , rose hips , hawthorn , chamomile and natural peach flavor and makes 8 ounces of tea : all naturally caffein - free . Highly Recommended ! Five DELICIOUS Stars ! ( Celestial Seasonings Country Peach Passion Caffein - free Herbal Tea , 20 tea bags , No artificial flavors , colors , or preservatives . Net wt 1.4 oz-41 grams . )
4 #### I was expecting more flavor with less product based on other reviews . The flavor is good , though , and ultimately I am pleased with the product- I just had to use a significant amount to get a good flavor .
5 #### Love the zesty taste with a noticeable twist of lemon . Looks rather pale when steeped 2 - 4 min , but flavorful nevertheless . Stronger with longer steeping . Have tried several brands , this is my personal favorite .
3 #### I 'm not a tea drinker , but many of my friends are , and they like this one .
5 #### I became addicted to this brew spending weeks on end in Rocky Mountain winters - it is delicious and warming beyond the physical temperature of the tea . Even down here in Tejas we get cold winter weeks - and sipping on this all day long and not worrying about getting a caffeine related stroke or about going into a sugar coma is delightful . It is getting really hard to find in the local stores - REALLY hard - so I was glad to find it by the case here at Amazon .
5 #### I have get this tea on subscribe and save . As well as other flavors . I drink herbal tea nearly every day , and this is one of my favorites . This tea is a very spicy orange tea that is great hot or cold . It reminds me of a spice tea my mom used to make us when we were little . I do n't know all the ingredients , but it had tang in it , and I loved it . This tea smells wonderful ! I love the fact that there are no tags or metal staples . Less for the landfill , and who knows what those little metal staples are made of . There is an inner wax lined pouch that is easy to fold back over to reseal the tea bags to keep them fresh .
3 #### Does not taste like gingerbread but it does have a pleasant taste .
5 #### Good product , buy in larger quantities at Amazon to avoid much higher prices in grocery store
4 #### This is great tasting tea with a hint of spice .
5 #### Loved this tea , If you liked timothy 's lemon blueberry(no longer available ) this is pretty close .
5 #### If you like the taste of peppermint this is the Tea for you . Personally this if my favorite tea so far . Boosts my energy level with the yummy taste .
5 #### Bengal Spice is one of my favorite Celestial Seasonings teas . If you like Chai without caffeine , this is it ! It is very strong if steeped for very long , so , the flavor goes a long ways . I like to mix and match , and this adds a lovely " spicy " flavor to otherwise mild teas .
5 #### not a tea but is herbs and,,,,,spices , and flowers very tasty
5 #### All right , this tea tastes so good it ought to be illegal . If you like cherries , you will love this ! I drink it as is , or mix it with pomegranate tea , which can be a bit strong on its own . This compliments and mellows the pomegranate out . Add stevia , and you have a drink that will make you forget those calorific sodas . And its good for you too ! It is packed with antioxidants , is anti - inflammatory , and has a calming effect which can help irritability , headaches , and even help insomnia sufferers .
5 #### My new favorite tea , I brew for 10 to 30 minutes , gets stronger , I use 2 tea bags , does nt get bitter like black tea brewed long . Use with soy milk usually . it is naturally sweet and spicy no need for any sweeterner ! Like it better than Chai now , which i use to add honey to .
5 #### My favorite tea ! No caffeine and helps me curb sugar cravings at night . My entire office loves when I brew this tea because it smells so nice . I do wonder what " natural flavors " means in the ingredients ....
5 #### Nice flavor and good for tummy troubles ! I will order again and again ! Mrs Hambone
5 #### This is my favorite peppermint tea ... wo n't take your head off but strong and not sweet . Leaves you with nice clean breath and works well as an appetite suppressant and after - meal digestif . Much better than Tazo which tastes more like spearmint to me .
5 #### I love chamomile tea and getting it delivered to my door for less with a subscription .
5 #### Deliciously BlueBerry : : : Have just discovered this tea about a month ago . If you like blueberries , this tea is absolutely the best blueberry flavored herbal tea on the market . I have tried bigelow which I thought would be exceptional but to my dismal no intense blueberry flavor , had more citrus ( lemongrass or lemon ) flavor . However Celestrial Seasonings brand is so TRUE blueberry as if you are sipping on fresh blueberries . I add a bit of maple syrup to it and it 's sheer heaven . Sad part is that True Blueberry is not available locally however all the other flavors are . What I have been doing is buying the sampler box which has only has 4 bags of blueberry and throwing the rest of the assorted tea away . I know a waste of $ $ $ but I love the True Blueberry . So glad Amazon sells True Blueberry~ ! ! THANKS ! :o)
5 #### yummmmm/ mix it with a decaf chai and you have India yummmmmm . add stevia and soy milk for super yummmmmmmmmmm
5 #### Love this tea , and buying in bulk on amazon comes out cheaper than my supermarket
5 #### My new favorite night time tea ! It tastes great and works as well for me as Sleeptime Tea does . I will definitely order it again !
5 #### I like peppermint tea in the evenings , or anytime I want a little pick - me - up without caffeine . Celestial Seasonings has long had good peppermint tea !
5 #### I thought this tea tasted very good . It is a nice way to fill up an empty tummy and keep me warm . I love the spice and plum flavor .
5 #### Strong & effective ! ! ! ! This tea should be sold as medicine - wonderful for sore throat 's & that " I feel like I am getting sick " feeling . My mom loves this tea as well . My husband prefers Stash 's Lemon Ginger , but he tends to disagree with me about everything & anything . :)
5 #### THIS TEA IS DELICIOUS AND RELAXING . I HAVE GIVEN SO MUCH OF THIS TO OTHER PEOPLE TO TRY AND USUALLY GET GOOD FEEDBACK FROM THEM TOO .
5 #### I 'm hooked on this tea . Cold , warm , with cream or plain . It 's a cozy comfort beverage .
5 #### I 've been drinking madarin orange spice for a few weeks now and find I 'm making that instead of coffee in the afternoon and evening . I make it strong and really enjoy the flavor . Needs no sweetening .
5 #### Tonight is the first I 've tried the black cherry berry flavor . A touch of Stevia was all it needed to be perfect . I like tea strong so I use two bags per cup . Very satisfying .
5 #### This is good tasting tea . I never liked the herbal teas till I tried this at a garden shop . Now I love it as much as my Constant Comment , maybe more . I even stock up on the Keurig cups of this tea .
5 #### very nice flavour . i enjoy with a bit of honey . very nice for relaxing and meditation .
1 #### At first we got a sampler box of the celestial tea the peach was extravagant ! So I went online and got the 6 boxes pack , when it arrived I was excited but upon tasting it it was completely different .... first it tastes like orange peels and not peach , second it is very light your tea will be watery ... finally I think these tea bags are used before ! ! ! Because the sample was good but the actual thing is so bad and now I 'm stuck with 6 boxes of it .
1 #### Do n't ask me how I know this , but for a brief time in the 90 's , Play - doh made a scented Play - doh that smelled like Christmas cookies . It tasted just like this tea . BLECH ! Just the thought of drinking this stuff again makes me feel ill . It is truly awful and does not taste like a cookie- at all . It tastes very fake , and cloying , if that makes any sense . I was very disappointed because I love Celestial Seasonings Cinnamon Apple Spice .
5 #### I love this tea . I drink it every night -- straight , no milk or sweetener -- within an hour of bedtime ; the chamomile helps me sleep ( along with the magnesium tablet I wash down with the tea ) . I buy the 6 - pack online because it 's not always available locally in stores . The teabags smell like pot pourri , but I store them in an airtight container on the counter rather than stash all the boxes in the cupboard . After use , the bags go in the compost and there are no staples to remove .
5 #### I brew this tea in a coffee maker daily -- put 2 or 3 bags in the carafe ( not the filter ) . I do n't drink coffee or pop and had tried to learn to like other herbal or green teas , but this is the only one I enjoyed , and it has a pleasant aroma . I take a thermos of it with me to school or work . I do n't add milk or sugar , but occasionally mix a cup 50/50 with apple juice . Rather than store the 6 - pack of boxes in the cupboard , I put the teabags in an airtight canister and keep it on the counter . Since there are no tags or staples on the bags , it 's convenient to throw the bags in the compost after use . P.S. The only other tea I drink is CS Cinnamon Apple Spice , but only at bedtime because it has chamomile .
5 #### Best tea out there ! It takes like Chi , but is not caffinated !
5 #### I love coffee , even decaf - but like many , need to cut WAY back for health reasons ( reflux , gastritis ) . Years ago , I drank and enjoyed Postum , a powdered grain - based product that you stir into hot water like instant coffee . It was very good , as long as you do n't try to think of it as " almost coffee . " Instead , it is a hot brown liquid with a pleasant taste that gives you much of the satisfaction of coffee , without all the acid or caffeine . Postum was discontinued a few years ago , and instead I have use " Kaffree Roma " toasted grain instant beverage and " Cafix " - each containing roasted barley and chicory , and both available on Amazon . Both are very good - better than Postum - but clearly not coffee . I stumbled on Roastaroma in a grocery store and decided to give it a try . Drinking my very first cup now - I made a big 10 oz mug with one bag . I like strong coffee , and this is pretty robust . And more coffee - like than any of the powdered beverages I mentioned . You do get the nice overtones of the carob , cinnamon , allspice , and star anise , but they stay in the background . Really delicious stuff . I drink my coffee black and this " tea " needs no sugar or creamer for my taste . Quite remarkable , I am certainly going to buy more . I paid $ 2.99 for a box of 20 bags .
5 #### I take the sleepy time tea also with this and put them together at around 6 pm or later and helps me to sleep . Also helps with L - Theanine .
5 #### Ordered to drink only herbal tea , this is a great bang for your buck . Great taste choices and there are about 4 bags in each packet and about 20 packets in each box . Good sipping to you !
5 #### One of my favorite herbal teas that stores just do n't carry anymore . So when I found a multi - pack at a reasonable price , I was very pleased !
5 #### Shipped fast and in good condition when received ( no dents or damage ) The tea smells great ( like apples and blossoms ) is flavorful and relaxing , I like to drink a cup just before bed or when I 'm feeling stressed in the afternoon . Will buy again .
5 #### Love these teas . Caffeine free and wonderful fruit taste . The blueberry is the best .
5 #### i love this tea everyone always asks , what are you drinking ? smells like christmas ! ! =) ) )
5 #### I love this tea . When I make it at work everyone ask what is that wonderful smell . It is so good . I have it every evening after dinner .
5 #### This is a staple in our house . I love that we can get it at a discount through the automatic shipments .
4 #### Did not buy it from Amazon , but this tea smells delicious & tastes great ! I 'd recommend it . The lemon flavor does n't taste fake as a lot of lemon - flavored beverages do . I 'd buy again .
5 #### I love Roastaroma ! It tastes very similar to coffee , a little chocolatey as well . With sugar and cream .... yummmmm .
5 #### Love this tea so much ! Add a little vanilla extract for a more " cookie like " taste .
5 #### This tea is delicious ! ! ! ! ! ! I have at least two cups at night .
5 #### I have tried probably 20 different Celestial Teas but this one is my go - to . It 's sweet but sugar free , energizing but caffeine free , delicious hot or cold and brings smiles all around . You can definitely taste the cinnamon ( which I love ) and the apple flavoring is reminescent of gramma 's apple pie . During winter I tend to prefer it hot , but it 's the perfect ' dessert tea ' or porch swing tea in the summer as well . OVERALL : If you prefer sweet tea but feel guilty about all the caffeine and sugar , this is the answer to your problems . Cinnamon is the perfect sugar alternative because it 's so much healthier and actually curbs sugar cravings . STOCK UP NOW ! I could go through a box a week .
4 #### A nice peach flavor in a tea bag and produced by a company I know and trust .
4 #### The only legitimately good White People tea in existence .
5 #### This is a great warming blend to get you through the cold winters . I plan to buy at extra box next time I 'm at the store so I 'm fully stocked up !
5 #### Delicious , fast delivery , expiration date in 2016 . Enjoying a cup right now !
5 #### This tea is delicious ! Lots of Cinnamon ! I am actually drinking a cup as I write this . A great value and a delicious tea that you will probably love . The tea has a natural sweetness as well , pretty much eliminating the need for any added sweetness . This tea makes a pretty good Chai latte approximation if you steam some milk .
5 #### What a great value and an excellent variety of some wonderful herbal teas ! Tea was nice and fresh , no expiration date issues , and in fact I am drinking a cup of it as I write this review !
5 #### I 'm not a"weed tea " drinker . I only drink a decent English breakfast / black , Darjeeling , ginger tea , Gen Mai , or some of the teas my friend brings me from Asia . One of the ladies brought this to our Bible study and it is amazing . I can not drink caffeine later in the day and love drinking tea before bed . I have it with this . As other readers suggest , let it step for 5 min . I do love my black tea with cream . But not this . I also tried adding cocoa to my husbands ... yech . that was n't remotely flavorful and went down the drain . He 'll generally eat or drink anything , not that . It looked like a mug after drinking real cocoa that had water placed in it to be washed ... watered down nothing . Note to seller . Since most of us are buying this by the case , insert a sample or two of another tea . I wo n't buy teas to try anymore , but would love to sample others and would buy them if I like them .
5 #### Best chai non loose - leaf tea I 've ever had . I 've tried a lot of chai teas and this is easily the most flavorful and the best .
5 #### DEE - LICIOUS ! Sweet and invigorating flavor . No need to add sugar .
5 #### HAving been without coffee for over two years I ordered this with much trepidation --- but I LOVE IT -- my substitute for coffee and it is FANTASTIC FANTASTIC -- did I say FANTASTIC ? ? ? ? It is great Thank you
3 #### This is okay but not my favorite in the line of cinnamon / spicy herbal teas .
5 #### More ginger than lemon , I wish I had this when I was sick !
5 #### If orange and spice flavors are your thing , then this is the herbal tea for you . The plus for me is that there is no star anise in it , which I 'm not fond of but is in a lot of spice teas . The flavors in this are well balanced ( e.g. , the hibiscus does n't overwhelm the other ingredients ) , and the aroma of the tea delightful -- a happy , cheerful cuppa . In addition , I emailed the company to find out if the soy lecithin they use is from GMO soy ( which is pretty much in everything these days ) and they said they use NO GMO soy or other GMO products in their teas -- something I value highly !
5 #### Best cinnamon - based herbal tea ever . Great with coconut sugar or honey .
3 #### I had great hopes for this tea . Yes , it is spicy . But like most herbal teas it is kinda ... boring . I usually add a ginger tea bag for some umph and a little almond milk for a smooth flavor . Nope . It is not the chai tea that I can no longer have becasuse caffeine makes me ill but it will do .
4 #### search farther in Amazon till you find the 6 pack of 40 count boxes ; it 's more economical .
5 #### I 'm trying to give up diet colas , so I 've started using this to make ice tea . I absolutely love it . There is a naturally sweet cinnamon aftertaste that is slightly addicting . And a hot cup at night with the colder weather coming is perfect . It 's been my favorite tea for many years .
5 #### Great product . Has a lot of flavor . It is a fabulous price and I really like the convince of having the product ship to me on a regulat schedule .
5 #### I LOVE THIS TEA ! ! ! ! ! I have enjoyed this tea for 25 + years . It is strong , robust & perfect on a cold day or when I am feeling under the weather . Bummer is I ca n't find it in stores , so I buy several at a time here . My adult kids even enjoy it on chilly days .
3 #### This tea is too weak in cherry flavor . I soooo wanted it to taste like Twinings Moment of Calm Cherry & Cinnamon tea but it falls way short . It is so weak in flavor I have to use two teabags . Disappointing . The supplier gave good fast service though .
5 #### This is my daily tea . Great blueberry flavor and not too tart .
5 #### I absolutely LOVE this tea ! It is so good , I really can not describe the taste . Twinnings had a tea similar to this one and I loved it too , but they discontinued it . This comes so close , I think it is the same tea !
1 #### Absolutely horrible ! The second Celestial Seasonings tea I bought and tried today based on positve reviews -both were enough to make me never buy this brand again . Completely agree with negative reviews . Tastes like red hots melted in water or Big Red gum .. overwhelming cinnamon - water taste . Have to say , I was really excited to try this one , based on reviews , but was a little worried when I opened the box and it did NOT smell good . Tried it anyway and it is just terrible . Throwing the whole box away . Getting a fresh cup of different tea now and putting that cup in the dishwasher . Not gon na risk rinsing it out only and possibly tasting that again in my next cup !
3 #### Just tried my first hot cup after reading all the great reviews . Should have listened to the last reviewer that called it gentle and light . It is VERY weak . It has a nice flavor , but too light for my tastes . Will try two tea bags next time , but not loving that I need to for full flavor .
5 #### I 'm glad I found this tea because I love to drink it every Christmas and serve it to guests as well .
5 #### Have been using Stevia as a sweetener for many years and even though I tried many different brands , I always come back to this ( SweetLeaf ) brand , to me it 's just the best , both powder and liquid . Although I can see how the strong taste of this Whole Leaf flavor can be off - putting to some , I find it very delectable , especially when I mix it with clear liquid SweetLeaf Stevia . You can use half and half ratio , or one third of Whole Leaf with two thirds of clear liquid and the end result will be lot more palatable . You can use either plain unflavored , or any flavored clear Stevia ( valencia orange and chocolate are my favorite ) . It does add strong hint of licorice to anything you use it with , so naturally if you 're not fond of licorice , do n't get this , you wo n't like it . I use it for occasional sweetening of my Earl Grey tea , coffee , Dandy Blend or making my own homemade chocolate truffles , always with great results . Highly recommended . As long as you ' dilute ' this somewhat , and you like licorice taste , I am pretty sure both your taste buds and your body will like it ! !
5 #### Love Celestial Seasons herb teas and peppermint is a long time favorite .
5 #### Good assortment & we like Celestial Seasons herb tea hot .
5 #### Best peppermint tea for the price that I have found .
5 #### This is such a nice flavored tea . I 've been needing to cut out caffeine , and this is the perfect way to do it . This is such a good tea , I plan to stock up on it because this is just a seasonal tea . Please do n't get thrown off by the " spice " in the same . I 'm not a fan of spicy teas , and the spicy aspect is very mild . It 's such a good flavored tea . Get it now , and thank me later . :O )
5 #### This is such a good tea . To be honest , I did n't like I 'd like it as much as I do . I 'm not a fan of " spicy " teas , but I 'm glad I took the chance on it . The spice flavor is n't over the top , but just right . I plan to stock up on this because this is just a seasonal tea . Try it , you wo n't be sorry , I know I was n't .
5 #### I 've been needing to cut out diet soda , so I started drinking tea . I took a chance on the Sugar cookie Sleigh Ride , and I 'm so glad I did . This is a fantastic tea ! It tastes just like a sugar cookie . If you have a sweet tooth , then this is a perfect tea for you . I plan to stock up on this so I can enjoy it all year long . Take the chance , you wo n't be sorry , I know I was n't .
5 #### Best flavored tea ever ! This tea is more like a dessert . I add a little almond or coconut milk for a creamy alternative . Who needs refined sugar products when you can sip your dessert ? !
5 #### This fruit sampler has become my favorite way of buying herbal tea . I have choices between the bold taste of the blueberry and wild cherry or the milder taste of the peach then the true berry flavor of wild berry and raspberry .
5 #### This tea works really well and tastes great . It is sweet and very stress relieving . It does help me unwind but I have noticed that if I drink it at night , then I ca n't sleep . So , I make sure to drink it in the AM . I would definitely repurchase this item !
1 #### This should 've been called Cinnamon Spice . I barely could taste ginger .
5 #### I bought multi packs of this tea . Yum ! Makes great iced tea too .
4 #### The first time I drank it , I did n't think much of it . I think the first time I thought it was too bitter . I ended up keeping it around but not drinking it . Fast forward six months , I drank it again , and now I really like it . It has a sweet and spicy flavor that is really enjoyable . The aroma is very warming too .. smells like the holidays :) I think once this comes back in stock locally , I will buy another box .
5 #### i wanted a whole - leaf stevia supplement and this was perfect . this is healthier than an extract , i recommend
5 #### This stuff is so hard to find in the stores . I end up buying the fruit tea sampler just so I can have the Blueberry ... It is THAT GOOD . Tastes like real blueberries and needs no extra sweetener . It 's great hot or iced , and I love drinking it with any meal . It accompanies everything perfect .
5 #### My favorite flavor . I will definitely get this one again . The price was a little high . You might want to consider making lower . Thanks for the fast delivery .
2 #### Has a bitter taste . This is less processed but ca n't get used to the taste . I have to do 50 % of the clear with it to tolerate it .
5 #### Awesome to sweeten herbal tea and does n't give me a headache like so many other sweeteners
5 #### I love this product because it allows me to control the sweetness of my drinks and it lasts a long time . I only use about 6 - 8 drops in tea and have used it in cereal , oatmeal , cold drinks , and peanut butter . It is the healthiest of all the sweeteners as it has 0 calories , it is natural - derived from the stevia plant - and recommended by most healthy eating enthusiasts . This was my second order of Sweet Leaf Stevia and I will continue to use it .
5 #### This is so much like liquid peppermint candy ! I wonder if it would make a good mint Julep ? I would think you should use fresh mint for that but this would be great too !
4 #### very nice tea and I like the quantity I can get
5 #### Very fragrant and tasty . Not for everyday , but I do like it a lot .
1 #### Very big disappointment because there is so LITTLE cherry taste . will not be buying again .
1 #### This used to be an amazing tea with a tremendous ginger kick at the end that I * loved * , and I used to buy it box - to - box as needed , until about a month ago when I decided to buy in bulk ... only to find that they completely changed the recipe . Now I have seven boxes of utterly lame tea . No kick , no strong ginger taste . It 's generic . Bleh . If anyone knows where I can buy the original ginger tea with kick , let me know .
5 #### I drink this tea before bed every night , and I take it with me when I travel . Soooo good ! It actually tastes like sugar cookies . It 's been a savior for me on nights when I 'm craving sweets .
5 #### A little milk / creamer and a tad of sweetener and it 's awesome ! !
4 #### I 'm not sure I can truly taste the " sweet Apple " , but love it anyway
4 #### We drink lots and lots of this stuff . Do n't think of it as a coffee substitute , just as something that tastes good .
5 #### I have written this before , so I wish I could copy my report . Love this stuff mixed with regular tea , That way we do n't have to add sugar . Great .
5 #### Good , strong , natural blueberry flavor ! One bag makes a nice strong 15 oz cup ! Delicious with cream and your choice of sweetener ! Great for blueberry nuts like me ! Other blueberry herbals use " blueberry flavor " and " blueberry powder , " whatever they 're supposed to be . This one uses all natural flavors and it tastes and smells wonderful !
4 #### Nice tea , it is sweet and it has a lot of berry flavor . It is strong as far as the flavor , but it is a nice tea . Nice selection of flavors in this .
4 #### Celestial Seasonings is a very good company . Blueberry tea is my favorite type of tea . The flavor of the blueberry in this one is much better than the Carrington tea . And I think , it 's equal to the Stash Blueberry Superfruit tea . The price was very good , 14 cents per bag is great . At Shoppers , Giant , and Safeway , we pay about 55 cents per bag . My only complaint is the same as with Carrington . I wish they would individually wrap each tea bag . Instead , it arrives in very good packaging . You open the cardboard box , and there are the tea boxes , like what you see in the picture . Very nice . Then , you open that box , and there is a simple little bag holding the bags . There are 20 total tea bags . The bags are each connected to one other bag . So , there are 10 strips of ( 2 ) tea bags each . You open it , love the first tea , but then feel the clock running as the freshness leaves the remaining 19 bags . It 's a premium product , I 'd individually wrap them . Or , at least have little packages with two in each , that would save 50 % of the cost of individual wrapping , and resolve 90 percent of the problem .
5 #### I have had some other peach teas before that I did n't like , but I got this in a Celestial Seasonings sampler pack and so I gave it a try . I put some hot water in my mug , over the tea bag , then had to leave my office for a bit . When I got back to my office , it smelled WONDERFUL in there . That was a great sign . ( It 's a small office but the scent filled the whole room . ) The taste was also quite good . It 's a strong peach flavor and I was a bit surprised that peach falls so low on the ingredients list ( I guess the blend of other ingredients works very well together ; you can see the full ingredients list in one of the product images on the main product page ) . I forgot to remove the tea bag from my mug , then later threw a black tea bag in there and brewed tea again . The scent of peaches was n't as strong but I could taste it alongside the black tea and that was a very nice flavor combination . ( This tea also makes a great iced tea , by the way . ) This has got me liking peach tea again and the smell is great . Definitely going to pick up more of this .
3 #### I find this tea to have an overwhelming bitter after taste , and to leave my mouth feeling dry . The scent is delightful , but I find the flavor unpalatable .
1 #### Did NOT like the flavor of this tea . You have to buy a case of it , and it is not returnable . It has a very strong chicory flavor . Shared with several friends and they also did not like it . Does NOT taste like regular ice tea .
5 #### Five TASTEY Stars . Its been a year since being introduced to Celestial Seasonings Fruit Tea 18 - bag Sampler which contains 4 individual flavorful berry brands and 1 peach brand of tea . These are all gluten free , decaffeinated , and contain NO calories , fat , sodium , carbs , sugar , nor any protein . Each stringless tea bag and makes 8 fluid ounces of tea . In testing , these bags steep to full flavor within a minute or two , so the user should be watchful to prevent excessive steeping . The contents are : 4 bags of Wildberry Zinger ( hibuscus , rosehips , roasted chicory , orange peel , blackberry leaves , natural flavors of black raspberries , strawberries , blueberries , red raspberries , cranberries , and cherries , etc .. ) ; 3 bags of Raspberry Zinger ( hibuscus , rosehips , roasted chicory , orange peel , blackberry leaves , natural raspberry flavor with other natural flavors , raspberries , raspberry leaves ) ; 4 bags of True Blueberry ( hibiscus , rose hips , orange peel , natural blueberry flavor with other natural flavors ( contains soy lecithin ) , black berry leaves , wild blue berries , and blueberry leaves ) ; 3 bags of Country Peach Passion ( Orange peel , rose hips , hawthorn , chamomile , natural peach flavor with other natural flavors , blackberry leaves , hibiscus , peaches , etc . ) ; and 4 bags of Black Cherry Berry . Favorite flavors are Country Peach Passion , Wild Berry Zinger , and True Blueberry , but all are great choices . All are Highly Recommended ! Five FLAVORFUL Stars ( 1 each-18 bag box of Celestial Seasonings Berry Teas )
4 #### 4.5stars Tastes good , smells good , soothing , relaxing . 4.5 stars because it maybe cheaper at Walmart when on sale , otherwise this is a better deal .
5 #### Cinnamon , ginger , cardamom and cloves . Those are just a few of the flavors you 'll probably recognize when you first try this tea . The nice thing is that no added sweeteners are needed . It has a natural sweetness of its own . This is one of those tees that is just as good as an iced tea as it is hot . I drink it throughout the year . All of those flavors make me feel alert when I drink it . It really wakes up my mouth ! And the nice thing is that it does it all without caffeine . If you like these spices , give this tea a try . I think you 'll be pleasantly surprised .
5 #### Been drinking this tea for years and we get it as a subscription . A little less than our local Walmart and it just shows up when it 's supposed to .
5 #### This box of very tasty " Celestial Seasonings " Caffein Free Herbal Tea Samplers is advertised as " 100 % natural " and has 5 different decaf flavors : Chamomile-4 bags , Lemon Zinger ( hibiscus , rose hips , roasted chicory , orange peel , lemongrass , lemon peel , whole dried lemons , etc.)-3 bags ; Peppermint-4 bags ; Honey Vanilla Chamomile ( chamomile , orange peel , natural honey , etc.)-3 bags ; and Sleepytime ( chamomile , spearmint , lemongrass , tilia flowers , blackberry leaves , etc.)-4 bags . Each tea bag yields 8 ounces of tea , but has no ' steeping string ' on the bags . Each bag has neither fat , calories , sodium , carbs , sugar , protein nor gluten . Nice variety with chamomile in 3 of the 5 flavors and my favorites are Peppermint and Honey Vanilla . Highly Recommended . 5 EXCELLENT Stars ! ( Celestial Seasonings Caffein Free Herbal Tea Sampler , 5 flavors , 18 bags total . )
5 #### So good . My son requests this to be sent to him at college .
3 #### I prefer this to Morning Thunder but am not overly impressed . The cinnamon flavor is too strong for me . I appreciate that it is decaf . I just wanted to compare this to my preferred Javavana . I 'll keep drinking what is here but wo n't buy again .
5 #### Tastes like real peaches . Everyone I have served it to has liked it as well . It is sweet enough to drink without adding sugar or you can sweeten it up heavily and is good either way .
5 #### Perfect for the holiday or sitting by a fire - even good iced . Full flavored , warm and spicy - not the sharp bitting spice but very smooth . Add a little coconut milk and its like liquid dessert .
5 #### Great tea for the best value I have found anywhere .
5 #### So hard to find this tea in stores ! Love it for a caffienne free iced tea alternative .
5 #### I bought 6 boxes of this tea from Amazon because our local Walmart or Kroger did n't have it when I wanted it . There are 20 bags in each box , not individually wrapped . It is caffeine free . I put them in a metal container after opened . I found out after drinking several boxes of this tea , it helped the pain of arthritis in my knees . I drink 1 to 3 cups per day . Beats paying $ $ $ $ to get medicine from a doctor .
5 #### Bought these since blueberry is only available in sampler in my area . The taste is great as iced tea .
5 #### I combine this with Celestial Seasonings Caffeine Free Tea , lemon juice and pure stevia extract for a great cold tea with no caffeine or tannins , very little sugar and great taste . I 've been ordering this for several years now .
5 #### Sent this to an overseas Air Force Base . WOW ! They were a welcome surprise .
5 #### Hard to find in grocery store . Great tasting . Live it .
5 #### Absolutely love this peppermint tea ! The 25 - Count Tea Bags ( Pack of 6 ) is perfect if you 're like me : you love the Celestial Seasonings teas , but prefer your tea bags to be individually wrapped with a string , so the freshness is ensured , but also so you can throw a few tea bags in your purse to work without dragging a whole box of tea around or stuffing them in a zip lock baggy ! Also very good if you use a tea bag organizer /caddy , since they 're wrapped individually . As much as I understand the logic of going stringless , etc , there are moments in time where you simply do n't want to mess with that . The string is good for those who do n't like to leave their tea in past the steeping time & who may not be equipped with a spoon ( at work for example ) to remove the bag . Also bought this a few years back & this tea stays fresh even past the expiration date . This is now the second time I ordered since I ran out of this tea . My hubby & I drink this most evenings to unwind and help digestion along , but it 's perfect for any time of the day .
5 #### I have been drinking this tea for 2 years . I drink with half and half . It is a rich , nutty flavor and very satisfying . My stores do not stock and I have to order online . My favorite tea .
5 #### Great herbal tea for iced tea . I drink it unsweetened . Ca n't find it at any stores , so I have to order here . Love it .
5 #### I 'm obsessed with peppermint tea . So obsessed that I 've tried a couple dozen brands ( at least ) over the years . Celestial Seasonings tastes the best ; simple as that . There you go .
5 #### I love this tea ! It has a rich , smooth flavor -- simply delicious !
4 #### Love this peppermint tea , plus no staples or strings or anything to fuss with . Nice strong peppermint flavor . We drink it daily .
5 #### I love ginger . I have tried many types of ginger tea , but this one is my favorite . It has a nice balance of favors . The first taste is lemony , then ginger fills in . It leaves a lovely warmth behind , without being too spicy . I have been healthy , but I imagine it would be great for sore throats .
5 #### A great way to wake up in the morning .
5 #### This tea is so good . We drink a lot of it in the cooler months . Not so much in the summer . This makes a great gift along with a cute mug or teapot .
5 #### I drink up to 5 cups of this a day . You may be able to find stronger tasting from other brands , but I like the low - waste packaging and low price .
5 #### This tea is not one of my favorite flavors , but it does grow on you . It has a light lemon taste . It is not unpleasant . I like it served hot . I bought it to drink when my muscle spasms are bad in my back . It seems to help as it helps me to relax which is difficult to do when you have severe muscle spasms .
5 #### This herbal tea has a wonderful blueberry aroma & flavor . It is equally tasteful hot or cold . The blueberry & peach are my favorite flavors .
5 #### Very distinct blueberry taste . Naturally sweet . Makes a great iced tea . I use 4 bags of this and 4 bags of Lemon Zinger in a gallon of water to make iced tea . No need to heat the water . Just put the bags in water , add sweetener , if desired , stir , and put in the refrigerator for a couple of hours . Leave the bags in until the tea is gone , and the tea gets better over time . You can also make straight blueberry tea . When I made it using 8 bags , I found it quite strong . You may get a better taste with 6 bags to a gallon of water . If you love blueberries , you will likely love this tea .
5 #### Really delicious , yet contains little or no sugar . Not bitter , like some teas .
5 #### This tea is very soothing before bedtime . The flavor is a little unusual , but it definitely calms the nerves and prepares me for a good night 's sleep .
5 #### My wife loves this stuff , drinks it a couple of times a day . We go through about a box every ten days , it 's the only tea she drinks . No caffeine , no additives , just peppermint leaves . And oodles of peppermint flavor you can smell across the room . The price is hard to beat and the quality seems top - notch . Neither of us is into woo - woo health claims or mystical , magical healing nonsense but this is a good cup of herb tea and something my wife wo n't go without . :) She practically lives it while she is writing , I do n't think she could get a novel done without a cup of tea at her side .
5 #### I 'm a fairly new tea drinker as I had to get away totally from sodas . This sampler gave me a chance to try out some flavors to see what I liked . The tea is in small bags with no string ( better for the environment , I guess ) and then sealed in 5 packets to protect the flavor . My favorite one was the honey vanilla chamomile , so I 'll be ordering some of that to have for drinking in the evening when I do n't want caffeine . My least favorite was the peppermint one which reminded me of toothpaste . You might react differently , as flavor preferences are very personal .
4 #### I was not a fan of tea until I recently tried a Ginger Tea my mom suggested . Since then I have been looking for similar teas that contain some spice . My son and I were at the market and he saw the word " Spice " in the name of this tea . He picked it up and put it in our cart and said " Mom , you love spicy food - this is perfect for you " . Decided to give it a try . It 's a really nice bold tea with a prominent taste of cinnamon . Perfect for cold days and very holiday ( Christmas , possibly ) . But great for any time of year !
5 #### Ca n't always find this tea in the grocery ; often it 's just not there . So we decided to purchase on line and we 're not sorry . Better flavor than other peach teas .
5 #### I used to buy this tea in the store , but it is close to impossible for me to find except online . I love that it has no caffeine , tastes great , and does n't irritate my stomach . I combine it with Celestial Seasonings Country Peach Tea for great iced tea . I add lemon juice and plain stevia and I drink it all day .
5 #### Very nice tea that does relax you . I brew the tea in a small amount of water for a short time and then add it to a large amount of ice cold water with chia seed . The texture and taste is excellent . They hydrating and healthy mixture is a nice afternoon snack on a warm day .
5 #### As far as I am concerned , this is by far the best herbal tea Celestial Seasoning makes . I love it and will continue to drink it as long as they continue to make it . Absolutely wonderful !
1 #### Celestial Seasoning makes many wonderful teas , but this is not one of them . I did n't like it , and neither did my friends and family . Next time I will just stick to the tried and true tea products they make . This stuff ? Yuck . And that 's before the stomachache starts .
5 #### The taste is very good and it seems to make my day a little less stressful . We like a cup early in the AM .
5 #### I 've tried a lot of herbal fruity flavored teas for making iced tea and this works the best . It 's so good we do n't even need to sweeten . I do throw a couple decaf regular tea bags in when I make it for an authentic " tea " flavor . Brew it in the sun and stick in the fridge when strong enough and keep two pitchers rotating so we always have it ready .
5 #### This tea was introduced to me by a friend . She bought it in the store and it was almost $ 4 for a box . By purchasing in bulk , I was able to save some money and have lots of this on - hand for a special hot treat , or it 's great as an iced tea as well .
5 #### IF you love the smell and taste of cinnamon and apple ( freshly baked apple pie ) , this it the tea for you !
5 #### this is a great tea for peppermint lovers and a great deal if you like to use amazon subscribe and save deals .
5 #### We drink mint tea all through the year . This is good made as either hot or iced tea . Good , consistent flavor .
5 #### I first encountered this as an iced tea at my favorite restaurant , and it 's delicious prepared that way . I bought some for myself at home and drink it both iced and hot . This definitely has a strong fruity taste and it 's a lovely reddish - purple color . The aroma carries in a small room and , when I wrote this , my office smelled wonderful as a result . This does get a bit tart if you leave the tea bag in for too long . If you 're using sweetener , you probably wo n't even notice the tartness . Personally , I drink this without any milk or sweetener . I love that the tea bags are unbleached . Also , with this tea ( like with most Celestial Seasonings teas I 've tried ) , there 's no powder that comes out of the bags -- the bags are a fine enough mesh to catch everything . FYI , if you 're not sure whether or not you 'll like this , Celestial Seasonings has a sampler pack with five different fruit teas , of which this is one .
5 #### I love teas and ca n't have caffeine so gave this Blueberry a shot . LOVE it ! I have a few large hot pots of it a week and it is great after a full day of work to be able to sit and relax with a cuppa tea . The blueberry flavour is strong - not watered down at all .
5 #### This is my husband 's favorite tea to have after dinner / before bedtime . He has been drinking daily for years now and I love that we get good pricing through Amazon ( we have it on Subscribe & Save )
5 #### I LOVE this tea ! ! ! As you drink it , it steeps and just gets more delicious . If you like tea with a bit of spice you will enjoy it too .
5 #### 1st got this on vacation and could not find in my local store . One thing is that this tea has a sweet taste . You would think you added sugar . I have had it hot and cold . Love it .
5 #### if you like ginger tea , this is the way to go . the ginger flavor is mild and not overwhelming to the tastebuds . its a great way to start or end the day .
5 #### this is the most flavorful chamomile tea i 've ever tried . it lives up to it 's flavor of sweet apple . it 's the best tasting tea i ever drank .
4 #### As a hot chocolate lover , I have tried valiantly to convert to the tea drinking way of life . I 'm still working on my conversion , but these flavors are great . I also ordered this for my mother - in - law , a lover of tea , and she was totally thrilled by this !
5 #### This tea I have been using for years more than 5 yrs always liked it , makes me more relaxing before I go to bed and during the day .
5 #### Our absolutely favorite tea , and we can rarely find it in the local grocery even though many other Celestial Seasonings teas are available !
5 #### This tea is excellent hot or cold . It has a nice true blueberry flavor with a little blueberry tartness , but not like the Zinger teas , which I do n't like as much as this . These have a very natural flavor .
5 #### have it almost every night before bed and I feel it relaxes me and I can sleep a bit better . Great price for what you get instead of the store prices . worth it .
2 #### the color is hibiscus and os listed as first ingredient . I actually bought it because I use hibiscus tea to lower blood pressure , and I am used to the sour taste . It is deceitful to call it blueberry when only the flavoring is used and is actually the last ingredient listed .
5 #### love it think you am glad it here think you vary much Ill tell my friends . that 's it think you .
5 #### Delicious , rich and full bodied chamomile tea . The bags do n't have strings attached . The price is very good for this 6 pack .
4 #### I really liked the Fruit & Berry teas than other teas because it has a really good taste when I add some honey with it .
5 #### I have a cup every night after dinner and it really relaxes me . Funny enough , this contains catnip . I wonder if this is what the cats have been enjoying all along !
5 #### When I brewed this up my mom said it smells really good , I enjoy the flavor it really tastes just great . The blend is yummy all the flavors combine really to make it a great tea . I 'm thinking about brewing it with ice to drink it cold . Very nice flavors , really flavorful . The flavor is strong and delicious . I have tried other Celestial Seasonings teas and it is my favorite so far , happy to get it ahead of schedule . Really good buy . Definitely a good choice .
5 #### I 'm not a big fan of herbal teas , but this one is without a doubt one of the only ones i truly enjoy . It 's just a wonderful spin on a classic chamomile flavor . It 's sweet , warm , and comforting . Add a little sugar and milk and you can also have it as a low - calorie , delicious dessert tea . It 's definitely worth trying .
5 #### This has real blueberries in it , and the best flavor of any berry - type drink . Hot blueberry tea is a real joy to experience . :)
5 #### I like these teas . They have a nice peppermint taste . I 'm pretty lazy with keeping the box sealed so they do n't lose flavor , but even when they lose some flavor it 's still good .
5 #### Great ea , a little spicy , a little sweet , perfect end of day treat . Makes a low calorie chai with a little almond milk .
1 #### i was looking forward to this after reading the reveiws . my two tea drinking freinds and i all found this bla , bland , and very disapointing over all . even with less water , two tea bags , milk , cream , sugar , it smells ok . was just a big let down . we each had 1 - 2 bags and threw the rest of the box out that s how much we did n't like it .
5 #### This tea tastes just like sugar cookies ! Sweet without adding sugar . I could drink it every day . ( I do ) . It has none of the astringency often associated with herbal tea , and is made with milk thistle , which has health benefits .
5 #### This is without a doubt , my favorite hot beverage . No caffeine , and I love the soothing spices . It is naturally sweet and needs no sweetening nor milk , it is terrific just as it is . It is so popular locally , that I often find the shelves empty . Great to be able to get it on line .
5 #### This is a really tasty , versatile tea . The flavor is spicy strong in a good way , and wakes you right up even though it 's caffeine - free . It also makes a wonderful iced tea and I even use it iced as a no - calorie , no - carb mixer for a little rum by making the concentration heavier by using less water . Really good stuff . Amazon offers this at a good price , too .
5 #### I had bought a variety pack and loved the Peach tea but could n't find it in the peach only box . It is great hot but I really like it Iced . :)
5 #### I do n't drink " regular " tea , so I find this a very pleasant substitute . It 's good either hot or cold and the forty count boxes last quite awhile . If I make it cold , I use only two bags to about 4 - 1/2 cups of water . Otherwise it is too strong for my liking .
5 #### I love it but it causes slight allergic reaction and I am def . allergic to Ragweed which is a relative so I think that s why . FLAVOR IS GREAT - nice and apple flavor not to weedy tasting or flowery .
4 #### Roastaroma is an herbal tea made with roasted barley and chickory , plus a few other flavors . They changed the formula 5 - 10 years ago ; I have gotten used to the new one , but I was disappointed at the time . If you like coffee , but you can not have ANY caffeine , you need this product . Keep some in your bag and the glove compartment : you can have a decent hot drink anywhere there is hot water . It 's strong enough for a pint or more of tea . I buy mine by the 6 - pack from Amazon . Roastaroma is a coffee - like tea . When I am home and want something better , I drink Pero Extra . Unfortunately , unlike coffee , Roastaroma is not gluten free . UPDATE 1 - 19 - 2016 : This time I put a six - pack of Roastaroma into my cart at under 16 bucks , and went looking for Pero Extra . That product seems to no longer exist - and I forgot to order Roastaroma . When I came back a couple of days later , the price was over 24 bucks and is now almost 26 . I ordered from swansonvitamins , saved a bunch .
5 #### have been drinking peppermint tea for years-- especially at night .... it is definitely calming and smells nice . would highly recommend it . thanks
4 #### I had to order a six - pack of this on amazon after my daughter discovered it in the store over Christmas . This is n't a flavor you can just walk into a store and buy at any other time of year . I deducted a star because I have had several tea bags open in one corner and let the tea leaves out into the cup . Not a huge deal , as I can strain the tea from one cup to another , but I have never had this problem from any other Celestial Seasonings tea before . I probably just got a bum pack . It wo n't stop me from buying it again .
5 #### These are delicious herbal teas . A nice selection at a reasonable price , I will be ordering more , what higher recommendation can I offer .
5 #### This is my favorite herb tea and I ca n't find it anywhere . I do n't get it . I was glad to find it on amazon so I order a case . Done and done . Now I am going to go have a nice cup of tea . Peace out .
5 #### O YEs . this is my favorite tea because I Love Peaches ! I have drank it both hot and cold and it is " JUST MY CUP OF Tea " ! I especially appreciate being able to purchase it here because the store quit carrying it ! Thank you Amazon !
5 #### a great tea product , tasted great and it is a product I would buy again just for the taste of it
5 #### I had to go online and purchase this tea because the store is always out of it . Very popular flavor . This does have a strong cinnamon flavor but I do n't steep it too long . If you want it stronger then steep it longer . My husband bought this during the holidays and we all love it . I usually steep this with my green tea . I get the benefits from the green tea with a great tasty cinnamon apple flavor . We also love the peach flavor . We use decaf and Celestial Seasonings uses the CO2 decaf method . Highly recommend .
4 #### I really liked this tea ... wish that it was a bit spicier but that is just the way I like it !
5 #### This is a very good tea for your health , and helps you sleep , relax and other good things . It also tastes great so I know you will like it too .
5 #### I decided to try Jammin ' Lemon Ginger tea because it sounded a lot like Lipton 's Ginger Twist . However , I found it was even BETTER , with a more robust and satisfying flavor than Lipton . I first tried it when I had a head cold . The tea opened my sinuses and gave me more " pep . " It also settles an upset stomach . Add this tea to your pantry for its wellness qualities and great taste !
5 #### Excellent when mixed with other herbal teas . I have given blue berry tea to several friends they love it , a few of my s had never had blue berry tea before .
5 #### I love a good chia tea . Make this and serve with milk and you 'll have the closest to chai with ABSOLUTELY no caffeine . It is so different from any other herbal on the market because it is n't at all fruity nor drowning in cinnamon / ginger . Great stuff .
5 #### I do n't know why , but none of the places locally where I shop stock this flavor of Celestial Seasonings tea anymore . It 's great hot or iced , but I particularly like to brew it for iced tea . It 's got that cherry sweetness but is rich in flavor and a bit tangy , too . I 'll be buying more of this . Good with or without honey or other sweetener . Use enough teabags when you brew ( at least one per six ounces of hot water , and let it steep for at least five minutes ) and you 'll get nice , intense flavor .
5 #### My favorite nighttime tea for years . I drink a cup every night and therefore have this on subscribe and save order .
4 #### This is a pleasant tea with good spices . I find I like to drink it occasionally , when I 'm tired of my other herbal teas .
5 #### I 'm not an herbal tea drinker . In fact I hate the stuff . I prefer good old black tea . But when I must lay off the caffeine -- and I do n't like coffee -- Bengal Spice does the trick . Full bodied , spicy , clears your sinuses ( but gently ) , and finishes with a cardamom sweetness . It 's really great . I bought the six - pack , which is a whole carton . Whole Foods stopped carrying it in my area . More the fools they .
4 #### My favorite caffeine free tea ! I have a cup of this every night after dinner and it relaxes me just as I 'm headed to bed . I 'm not a big fan of peppermint which I feel overpowers the flavor in most other caffeine free teas . This one has no mint and the flavor is subtle enough to soothe the body .
5 #### Black Cherry Berry tea bag 1 Heaping Tablespoon cocoa 1 Tablespoon raw white honey . Add the tea bag and cocoa to a mug . Pour in boiling water and stir to mix the cocoa . Steep for several minutes to let the tea cool down before adding the honey so you do n't kill the nutrients in the honey .
5 #### I buy it for my company and it is always the first to go ! I ca n't order it fast enough !
5 #### The aroma from this is just the best . The smell is of sweet fresh cherries ! I sit down and have a pot of this with people I 'd like to stay a while . :)
5 #### My wife has used this tea for years . She brews an entire box at one time to make approximately a 1.5 liter concentrate . She then stores it in the refrigerator for mixing as an iced tea on demand . She has tried other flavors but has always come back to this one . She can not use caffeine and has problems even with decaf coffee . This tea was the best choice for her .
5 #### Ordered 6 boxes of this tea on internet . It used to be called " Granny 's Tummy Mint " . My neice wanted to try it , she loved it so she ordered some for herself . Good idea to keep this on hand .
5 #### After trying different brands of oyster sauce , LKK makes the best , in my humble opinion . This Premium Oyster Sauce is definitely more expensive than their ' regular ' oyster sauce , but the difference in taste is distinct . It also has a much smoother texture than cheaper brands of oyster sauce . Amazon sells this for a lot less than at Asian supermarkets and online stores . I will definitely order future bottles here .
5 #### Hello . I just purchased this product today . I wo n't be using it for about 4 months . I was wondering how long it will last unopened in a cool dried area . Should it be put in the fringe ? I am confident that the product is going to be great help in the kitchen , just hope I make it in time . Sincerely , E.A.C
5 #### This is an excellent product . I would say the best Oyster Sauce I have tried . Gave my Chicken wings a full rich flavor . I will definitely purchase again . Item shipped right away and packing was excellent . Definitely recommend this product . Great value for the money .
5 #### I ordered this for my wife . It makes her happy ! I like it also . Try it if you like a spicy tea .
5 #### Ordered this for my wife as she could not find it locally . Now she loves both it and me ! LOL
5 #### This is my very favorite caffeine - free beverage . Really tastes like blueberry . I gave a cup to my elderly father who never drank tea in his life , but was feeling a bit chilled and he loved it ! He drinks it regularly now . We have had a bit of a cold winter for the deep south .
5 #### I call it Bengal Tiger tea . I love tigers , but I 'm in love with Bengal Spice tea . It is the only herbal that I 've tried that does n't upset my stomach , and it is so utterly delightful and comforting to drink . Must love cinnamon and cardamon -- both excellent for health . The tea has a natural sweetness , so do n't add honey unless you 've got a wild craving for sweets . :) My favorite tea ever !
5 #### This is good stuff cold . A favorite at the office . I brew it using a coffee maker by putting 4 bags in the pot and then let it steep for about 1/2 hour before turning off the heat . Then , cool it down with a small table top fan for 2 or 3 hours and put it into the refrigerator overnight .
1 #### I was n't expecting such an overpowering of orange peel . I really ca n't taste any vanilla or honey , and that 's what I was aiming for .
4 #### all good on this one . Make sure you use enough tea bags . I use 5 for 3 cups . A very large cup .
4 #### I 'm on a tea kick . This one definitely has a spice taste to it . I do n't think it 's something I 'd drink daily but thy call it a seasonal tea and that works . It is tasty , I added some local raw honey and that made it amazing .
5 #### I bought this first at a Walmart store . I liked it so much I signed up for subscribe and save on Amazon . It tastes exactly like fresh peaches ! UNBELIEVABLE , but , TRUE ! ! ! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TEA ! My favorite of the all flavored teas I have tried .
5 #### I was extremely skeptical when I ordered this tea . I did not expect to like it , but thought I would give it a try . I brew some tonight in a teapot , two bags for the whole pot . The aroma was , well , worrisome , but , when I sweetened it and added milk , it was DELICIOUS ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I heartily recommend this tea to anyone who likes fruity teas . It does have spices , cinnamon , nutmeg and cloves , I think , from the TASTE not the box label . I am very glad I gave it a try . Just wish that more of the fruit flavors were offered one box at a time so that I could try them before I commit to a six pack . I will definitely buy this again .
4 #### This is overwhelmingly ' orange ' tasting . I do n't detect any honey at all , or any vanilla . However it still tastes amazing ! I like to add a tablespoon of honey .
5 #### I had this tea a few years ago at Christmas and could not find it in the stores again since then . I am thrilled to find it here !
3 #### I keep looking for a ginger tea ; although I have loved most Celestial Seasonings teas and the blends they come up with , this one missed the mark for me . I wanted GINGER ! There is a tiny zing here , but it 's primarily lemon that I taste and their Lemon Zinger is the best I 've ever tasted . This one was given to my office to devour and it 's not disappearing as fast as I expected . If you want GINGER flavor , Bigelow makes " Ginger Snappish " that is outstanding , but I have to order it online because it is a winter / christmas only flavor for them .
5 #### I love this tea ! The smell and flavor is heavenly but the taste is even better . I bought seven boxes to get me through until next Christmas .
5 #### This is the best Oyster sauce period . It is far better than grocery store brands
5 #### I had never heard of oyster sauce before but now I am a fan for seasoning my Chinese food with it .
5 #### We usually buy this at the store , but it is sometimes difficult to find . This is as cheaper or cheaper than the store , so I set it up on a subscription , so I do n't have to worry about running out . It is also one of my husband 's favorite . It has a very nice blueberry fruity flavor and smells wonderful . I put cream and stevia in mine and it tastes heavenly . It is also very health for you .
5 #### First time ordered this Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea , Bengal Spice , but i 'm sure again order , realy great herb tea , thanks ...
5 #### Always best is best Celestial Seasonings Fruit Tea Sampler , this is my second ordered and very good flavors tea sampler ...
5 #### I never liked chamomile much , but this blend makes it very appealing . I only tried this because I had a box on hand purchased for holiday guests , and now I am going to buy a case of 6 , I like it so much . It is a relaxing and mellow tea , and one of few teas that does well with certain additions such as cream , milk , even nutmeg , and of course , honey .
5 #### To get the BEST flavor - let this steep for about 8 minutes . I just wish it was not caffeine free !
4 #### Refreshing combinations to consume , especially in winter . Even the aroma of the tea , sends an awesome feeling to your brain and hence is very therapeutic . No sugar seems to be required as the sweetness of the ingredients come through , when the tea has steeped well enough . However if you feel the need for a little sweetness , I 'd recommend organic wild flower honey or Agave nectar . Although a bit tart , my personal favorite is the wild berry . A good buy for the price . Enjoy your tea otherwise .
3 #### Barely has any apple flavour , which is n't what I was hoping for ! It 's not bad but very , very subtle ... don't expect a proper apple tea !
5 #### This tea is really comforting . It 's a lot of cinnamon , and some apple in the background . I think it can get extremely spicy if you are n't careful when steeping it though . I microwave a huge 8 - 10 oz mug filled with water , then steep for 5 minutes . It definitely does n't need any added sugar . It 's sweet by itself , almost too sweet if you let it steep for too long . I
3 #### This was not at all what I expected . The Country Peach was OK , but the other flavors were blah . I also have a problem with any product whose ingredients contain " other natural flavors " .
5 #### Product arrived super fresh . This oyster sauce is very tasty . It 's thick , rich and flavored my Asian dishes perfectly .
3 #### Maybe I do n't understand oyster sauce . This is my first experience with it in any form and was maybe expecting some oysteriness and certainly more umami . It 's nice tossed in with braised greens and garlic but Golden Mountain is just as good IMO and I 'm going to try clam base next for a but more oomph
5 #### i love cooking with oyster sauce .... and this one is a good one ...
5 #### Yes , this oyster sauce is more expensive than many others , but it gives so much more flavor that it is worth it to me . It has a richness that the others do not have . It has a meaty flavor . It has a deep flavor . If I want to quick throw a stir fry together , I drizzle a tablespoon of this oyster sauce , a tablespoon of a hoisin , and a bit of low salt soy sauce . It makes a great sauce ! I 've been using it for years and am never without a follow - up bottle on my pantry shelf .
5 #### My wife and I love our herb teas and have tried several different brands of Chamomile over the last few months and have come home to our old favorite from the 1970 's : Celestial Seasonings Chamomile Herb Tea . It has the richest and most mellow flavor of all the other brands , consistent quality and longest lasting flavor . We add a little low glycemic sweetener ( also purchased here at Amazon online ) and the flavor is amazing ! Relaxing , soothing after a hard day at work or in my case dealing with pain as part of my disability , just as soothing and warming . Perfect for after dinner to settle the stomach , great for just before bed , a very good tension tamer mid day as well . This is our good ' ol stand - by favorite and we make sure to keep it on hand summer as well as winter . It 's a " must have " in our home , and brewing it smells like " home " :)
5 #### My wife really likes this tea and it is hard to find locally . It is great that we can get it on Amazon .
5 #### My local store was out of this , so I tried several other brands , and I have to say they were simply awful ! Lipton , Bigelow , Salada , even store brands , all make reasonable regular tea . But herbal tea ? A resounding NO ! Especially orange herbal tea , which is my all - time favorite . I just wasted my money trying a replacement brand . And while Celestial Seasonings may be a little more expensive than some of the other brands , the flavor alone would make it worth the slightly extra cost . But add in the fact that one teabag can make 6 to 8 cups of ( strong ) tea and you 've got a real winner ! From now on , it 's nothing but Celestial Seasonings for herbal tea . If my local grocery stores are out , I 'll get it here again .
5 #### This tea is hard to find even in the health food stores but I really like it and it 's one of my teas that I constant have a supply of . I find the blend has just the right amount of gingery bite and the lemon is smooth and refreshing . I drink tea with turbinado sugar or honey and enjoy Celestial Seasonings blends the most .
5 #### I never thought much about oyster sauce . I just bought whatever was available thinking it was all the same but the last two times I did that , I regretted it . They were two different brands but both were cloyingly sweet and basically inedible . Annoyed that I had ruined two potentially good dinners , I turned to Amazon to restore my faith . After reading reviews of several versions of oyster sauce , I decided to buy this one . It was the best decision I 've made in a while . This sauce is delicious and tonight we enjoyed a very tasty Beef and Broccoli in Oyster Sauce .
5 #### Made my Chinese dish taste better . Highly recommend the product
5 #### Oyster sauce is my new secret addition to many standard dishes & I 've had many compliments for them because of it . I believe this brand is the best .
5 #### high quality product which makes great lomein and other stir fry dishes . Well worth the premium price
5 #### We use in many recipes and are very satisfied
5 #### An essential for Asian cooking . I have also used it on broiled steaks as cooked on the Hibatchi or grill . Arrived carefully packed in a secure box . This is the best !
5 #### The pleasure starts when you open the box and the cookie aroma greets you . Then you have to force yourself to wait while it 's steeping . But it 's worth it when you take that first sip ... aaaahhh , bliss ! The taste is not as sugar - cookie as the aroma would suggest , it definitely reminds me of the traditional cookies but in a subtle way . I really like that it does n't have an overpowering cookie flavor as that would be too sickly after a few sips . This tea will remind you of the holidays long after they 're over !
5 #### This hard to find tea is like a little cup of heaven . I can find it at some of my local Giant stores , but glad to see it on Amazon . A hot cup of this with a bit of honey is heavenly decadence ! The flavor is impeccable . I would knock down one star for questionable ingredients ( why is soy lecithin in my tea ? ? ? ) , but it really does taste so fabulous , I just ca n't do it .
4 #### These are very flavorful teas and do have real fruit flavor . Add some goji or mulberries to the brew and you are getting a ton of good stuff in every cup . I would pkg it differently tho . 3and 4 pks now . I would make them all 4 pks . There are a lot of people who use their commuter cups for tea these days .
5 #### This is a delicately balanced blend of hibiscus , roasted chicory , chamomile , rosehips and roasted carob . Cinnamon , ginger and cardamom add background spicy notes to the mostly fruity blend . Highly recommended , I look forward to this tea every year . Just as good iced as hot . I should add that it 's available direct from CS at their website significantly cheaper than here - $ 3.59 a box - this includes shipping - if you order 12 boxes . Normally I buy locally , but for some reason I was unable to find this ( or any of the other holiday blends ) this year .
5 #### For those who truly like coffee for its liquid dessert effect this beverage is for you . I found a box in the back of cupboard that I had forgotten about and made a cup today lightened with almond milk and sweetened with stevia . I thought to myself ; ' why did I stop drinking this ' ? It smooth , tasty and gives you that warm fuzzy feeling on a cold day . I 'm trying to reduce my caffeine intake and will mix with coffee 1/2 and 1/2 for the New Year .
5 #### This met my expectations and the price was good . Put some in when you stir - fry veggies are almost done . Delicious .
5 #### I use this to boost the taste of many ramen dishes and other asian procssed foods and I know it can be added to salad dresing as well . I am keeping myself well stocked on this .
5 #### Oyster sauce is one of my very favorite flavors in nearly every Asian dish I make . I 'd previously read that Lee Kum Kee is one of the best manufacturers but had n't been able to find it in my area grocery stores . What I usually buy is in a 5 - 6 oz bottle and costs $ 4 - 5 . This brand adds just the right flavor , and it 's definitely cheaper for the large bottle(s ) than what I 've been paying . I keep it on the fridge door along with the sesame oil I purchased on Amazon . Just typing about this is makes me wish I had some leftover Chinese food !
5 #### This a fantastic sauce . I have been using it on all types of meats and in my marinades . A littles goes a long way unless you are going for a distinct asian dish , then use recommended amt . As for all other recipe , a drop or two will add a depth of flavor with a touch of sweetness that makes it a different dish than your regular recipe .
4 #### I have only used it once so far . The consistency is perfect and the taste is great . I recommend it .
5 #### I like to try various Chinese recipes ; oyster sauce is a versatile , good tasting addition , that adds that Chinese restaurant flavor to several dishes .
5 #### I 've never drank a drop of this tea hot , but it makes fantastic iced tea . We brew it in a standard Mr. Tea - style brewer on the strongest setting , and it 's never bitter or astringent . The cherries really shine through , and as fruit teas go , I 'd highly recommend it .
5 #### I could easily go through a box of this tea a week . The flavour is spicy and definitely tastes of a good chai . I found that if I steeped the tea for several minutes , it also tastes sweet enough that sugar is unnecessary . I 'll definitely be stocking up on this tea !
5 #### I love Celestial Seasonings Honey Vanilla Chamomile and bought it on Amazon when I could n't find it in the store and got paranoid that it was being discontinued . I think I was wrong- found it elsewhere later . No worries . This tea is really good sweetened with honey and lots of lemon . In the fall , I heat up 2/3 mug water , 1/3 apple cider and brew the tea in that . Heaven . I find chamomile helps with upset stomach and stops stomach from spasming when it is upset . Very calming , soothing , comforting .
5 #### Tasty and simple . I hate messy stuff and this is so simple and easy . I 'm not a tea snob so I just boil water and stuff bag in cup . Viola - yummy tea .
5 #### I 'm drinking it right now . Flavors are strong and the tea actually TASTES like it says it will . In other words the flavors are real .
5 #### Very nice blend of mint . I usually use peppermint in Celestial Seasonings , but this is another really good alternative flavor if you want to mix it up ! I just heat water in my Keurig ( no K - cup in chamber ) and put in the flavor of the day . Really good brand .
5 #### I love full flavored teas and generally do not like fruit - flavored teas . This one is great either hot or iced . Everyone I have served it to agrees .
5 #### A yummy tea for cold weather that is bursting with cinnamon apple flavor . Sweet enough on its own , but I add a few grains of Stevia to make it feel more desserty . If you are partial to this flavor combo , you might also like Bigelow 's Apple Cider tea .
5 #### I love this tea , it 's really sweet without sweetener ! Love it . I probably drink three cups a day on average ! ! !
5 #### This tea is a great mix of mild , peppery lemon and a hint of ginger . It 's great with hot water , but if you want a creamy , lighter taste of lemon ginger , add milk to it . If you want your tea stronger , I suggest adding 2 teabags to hot water . The tea has a light , refreshing scent of lemon and ginger . ( Does n't smell like Lemon Pledge like another reviewer said . ) Before I bought this , I read another reviewers opinion and she / he had stated that you can taste a peppery lemon snap in the back of your throat after each swallow . After I read this , ( Since some citrus drinks can irritate my throat ) I thought it might have a strong , citrus flavor that could burn my throat , as well as have a sour aftertaste . But that is n't the case at all . Just a hint of lemony ginger in the back of the throat after each swallow . This product is an add - on to an order of $ 25 or more . For a 20 - count box for this price is a good deal . Especially , if your trying this tea for the first time . Lot 's of other lemon ginger teas cost way more or only give you the option to buy in bulk .
5 #### Bengal Spice tea is completely intoxicating from the first whiff to the last drop ! With cinnamon being the first ingredient , it adds a natural sweetness , and the longer it steeps , the better it tastes ( though it does get spicier heat , which I like , but you may not ) . If you prefer your tea lightly brewed , you can reuse the tea bag for another cup . I usually drink it plain , but if I want a Chai - like treat , I add a little agave nectar and milk ( you can use sugar and/or nut milks or soy milk too ) . It 's also delicious cold . FYI - read the ingredients , this product does not contain tea leaves . The base ( after cinnamon ) is roasted chicory and roasted carob . Final thoughts : this tea has the most delicious spice blend . It always makes me feel happy , soothed , comfy , cozy and relaxed . Prepare to fall in love !
5 #### This is my absolute favorite Celestial Seasonings tea . I like creamer in my hot tea so I add international vanilla creamer to it . Taste is subjective but it almost tastes like a cross between a spiced tea and a special blend coffee to me . I have even put whipped cream on the top . You can clearly taste the cinnamon and spices . I love it .
5 #### Great taste and a special treat . What a pleasant treat while wrapping presents . Really makes you happy for this time of the year when you can order it .
4 #### Good stuff . I noticed Celestial Seasonings now adds soy lecithin to all their fruit teas now ( as a preservative ) . I did n't see anything wrong with the teas before that . Maybe it extended the shelf life from a few years to decades ? I have changed some of the teas I buy to organic , but have n't found a good blueberry substitute .
4 #### This tea has an excellent taste . I am also a fan of Celestial 's apple cinnamon , but I 've come to prefer this one . I use it with the Bigelow organic green tea ( 2 X 2 bags ) . Unfortunately , this is not an organic product . I do worry about what gets distilled out ; if there was anything bad in the leaves , I imagine that steeping would bring the bad stuff right into the cup . But , it 's all about risk management .
5 #### Celestial Seasonings Chamomile tea is the most intensely flavored I 've tried . Sourced from Egyptian Chamomile , the aroma and flavor are concentrated , naturally sweet , and densely flowery . We have found this to aid in relaxation and even peaceful sleep . I 've found it helpful combating colds and flu , and calming allergies . Invariably , Celestial Seasonings provides consistently excellent quality , holding to extremely high standards . Enjoy !
5 #### Smells yummy ! It also tastes delicious . If you have a sweet tooth pick up the 6 pack and have a cup any time you have a sugar craving and you will save plenty of calories . I use two bags per 8 oz of hot water . A nice after work warming drink that wo n't disturb your sleep .
5 #### This tea is great tasting . I 'm allergic to caffeine so I 'm pleased there is a caffeine free black tea available for me .
5 #### This tea is sweet but not very sweet and does not contain any sugar which is good because I have secondary diabetes . I can make hot tea or ice tea with it .
5 #### This tea is sweet but not very sweet and does not contain any sugar which is good because I have secondary diabetes . I can make hot tea or ice tea with it .
1 #### Yuk ! I guess it is a matter of taste but really did n't like it and now I 'm stuck with 6 boxes of tea .
5 #### This tea is awesome . I love the taste of regular tea but I do n't appreciate drinking things that do n't hydrate me ... so this is wonderful to make up big pots of tea but also be hydrating instead of using a dialectic . Tastes ALMOST identical to Liptons or other teas . Highly recommend !
5 #### great stuff either hot or cold , nothing else compares , try it if you can find it in the stores or on here
5 #### I love this tea ! I have Meniere 's , which means caffeine is very restricted . I 'm not a real fan of tea , but tried this flavor out when it was on sale and love it ! It 's naturally sweet , has 0 calories , 0 fat & 0 sugar . Yes the flavor of cinnamon is dominant , and the apple spice flavor tastes like a delicious apple . This in one of those teas where you wrap your hands around the mug to warm up and savor the smell & taste . I 've heard that cinnamon is good for your health & cinnamon is the first ingredient listed on the package . Great price ! Packaged well , and was here in two day w/ Amazon prime .
5 #### Love that tea and could n't find it at the grocery store , so decided to buy a bunch online . Sent some to my daughter in Alaska who ca n't get it there , and bought some for my hubby who loves it . My daughter says that this is the brand she prefers . She 's tried others , but only likes this one .
5 #### I did n't really think this was a strong enough flavor for me . I had tried to make the Starbucks drink with lemonade and Tazo Passion Tea and I did n't like it at all . But something made me think to try the blueberry tea instead and I love it ! So I use four blueberry tea bags to 32 oz . organic lemonade . Great taste and I drink it all the time .
5 #### I love this tea ! We buy it every year so we can drink it during the holiday season and the winter months . It has such a delightful , spicy sweet flavor ( Bear in mind that I always add a dollop of honey or a single bag serving of Stevia to my cup . ) It 's a lovely tea that just tastes so Christmassy . I love to cozy up with a good book and a cup of this tea , but it 's great for drinking anytime .
5 #### My FAVORITE cold season tea ! It is so silky and subtle in its spices , you just need to brew a 2nd cup . That 's an airy spicey , not sweet . Yum ! I do have to admit though , that mixed with green tea for iced in the summer , it 's great then too !
5 #### Yum ! I am a huge fan of this manufacturer and the varieties it offers in its teas - this is one of my favorites ! Not too sweet yet smooth and soothing on a cold night . I was having a difficult time locating any store that carries it and am so glad it 's here !
5 #### I discovered this tea when I was looking for a natural replacement for spiced apple cider , and it does not disappoint . The first cup I made , I sweetened it with stevia like I normally do , and quickly realized I had overdone it . This tea has a natural sweetness to it already . Just like many reviews say , this tea is heavier on the spice than the apple flavor , but with a little experimenting , I have found that a little lemon and honey helps add a little fruity flavor to it while keeping it nice and sweet . The price here is about the same as it costs at the store , so it 's really a matter of convenience and whether or not you want to buy six boxes at a time .
5 #### I drink two or three cups of this a day in cool weather . It 's pure peppermint , delicious and soothing . Would recommend .
5 #### Found this tea last week in a local market and brought it home to give it a try . You see , I love peaches in most anything : pies , eating them raw and now to find this wonderful flavor of fresh peaches in a tea -- well I am in peachy heaven ! This tea is wonderful hot as it has that taste of fresh peaches and when I add a little honey to my cup ( about 1/2 teaspoon ) , it reminds me of peach pie somewhat . Now here is my favorite thing about this superb tea : The night before I make a 8 - 10 ounce cup of this tea and cover up the cup of tea and set in my fridge . The next morning , I add this tea along with 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup frozen peaches in my blender along with 4 Splendas and blend on high . This makes a very , very peachy smoothie . Highly recommend this to all !
5 #### This tea I picked up at my local store a few days ago and have tried it both hot and cold . Serving this tasty and refreshing tea is perfect hot or cold . For breakfast , I use it as a hot tea that goes so well with toast for quick breakfast . The flavor is very minty yet not overpowering . What a great ice tea it makes . What I do for ice tea is add 4 peppermint tea bags and one regular tea bag and pour the boiling water in a 2 quart Pyrex measuring cup over all these tea bags and steep for about 6 minutes . This gives the tea a wonderful combined flavor ! Serve over ice and add just a small amount of sugar or Splenda to taste . Yummy tea ! Highly recommend this tea !
5 #### I have tried almost all of the Celestial Seasonings christmas teas and this is my absolute favorite . As I brewed a mug , my roommate exclaimed , " that smells better than sex ! " While it 's not difficult for something to smell better than sex , this tea is awesome and it tastes better too !
3 #### Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea Sampler has five solid herbal offerings . While I prefer other brands for lemon tea , the Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea Sampler has all of my favorites in one box .
2 #### I 'm glad I bought the sampler instead of individual boxes because I did n't particularly like any of them . The flavor of each is pretty weak .
3 #### I 'm somewhat disappointed the teabags are in little pouches of each flavor that can not be resealed . After a couple weeks all the teas are picking up the odors and flavors of the other teas . Another reason I dislike the packaging is because nothing will prevent the tea from deteriorating over time being exposed to air and moisture . Most of the teas are pretty tasty . The Peppermint is strong and gives that minty tingle when you drink it . Sleepytime is also good , a milder mint flavor than the peppermint with a hint of other undefinable flavors . My box did not have Wild Berry Zinger - it contained Honey Vanilla Chamomile instead . I found it to have a smooth , sweet taste but I wish it was just honey , vanilla , and chamomile without the other ingredients for a purer taste . Lemon Zinger is a bit strong for my tastes but that 's my personal opinion ; I 'm sure many will like it . The surprise of the bunch was Chamomile . One of my favorite teas , it 's always a safe choice when trying teas . However , this had a slightly ' off ' flavor and smell I 've never encountered with chamomile teas before . It is n't horrible but it just does n't taste right to me . Still , this is a good variety and a great way to try out this brand of tea .
5 #### I have been using this tea for many years , especially when my joints are giving me more trouble than usual . It not only helps my joints to calm it helps me sleep MUCH better . Lately I have added more ginger and also brewed it with Valerian Tea and added raw honey . Seems to be almost magic . Anyway , Tension Tamer is an excellent product with or without additions . The whole tea experience is quite peace promoting .
4 #### Very nice mixture of teas in the bags really nice and fresh . The only minor problem is that when you open one of the small packages you have to used it within few days , aside that is perfect .
5 #### I drink it in the evening . Just enough orange tang and great with Chai too ! Love it iced too ! Yeah !
5 #### I use this tea to make blueberry flavored kombucha . This is the only blueberry tea that tastes like blueberry after the fermentation process is completed . I love it !
2 #### This tea is ok , but if you like your tea strong this is not your tea . And if you like to use your tea bag more than once this is not for you .
5 #### This is excellent tasting mild but not wimpy vinegar . I have tried it with soba noodles dressed with soy sauce , toasted sesame oil , and a few drops of Sriracha Chili Sauce . Adding the black vinegar really rounded out the flavor and I 'll be making this my new standard . I made a wonderful salad dressing using this as a base with olive oil , herbs , and garlic . The black vinegar seemed to give a less overpowering sharp vinegary flavor to the dressing and let the garlic and herb taste come through . I ca n't wait to try this in a marinade ! You should have this vinegar in your kitchen ! You will find many uses for it .
5 #### Excellent quality black vinegar ! I use it in all my Chinese cooking and it is the secret ingredient that makes the dish truly special !
4 #### This is an ingredient I 'd despaired of finding in my suburb , many , many miles away from any comprehensive Asian market . And yet , so many recipes I want to try require it ! OK , one can sub in balsamic , but that 's definitely going to change the flavor . I was very happy to find it available through Amazon , and I hope my 2 bottles last a while . Although the packaging was excellent , the shipping cost was itself about as much as 1 bottle of the vinegar . So , if you can find it locally , that would be better than ordering it .
5 #### Something about this tea is uplifting and relaxing at the same time . Its not something I would drink every day , but it is good on occasion .
5 #### this is an excellent tea . i love it . and can you believe that these are 6 boxes of 40 count . i have been buying a 6 pk with 18 - 20 bags in them . such a great buy !
5 #### I always recommending this tea to others ! ! It has such a nice comforting taste to it and I loved to drink it with French vanilla creamer to really get a good flavor combo ! I tell people it has the body of a coffee , but it 's a tea ! ! Not that its some overpowering flavor , but I know a lot of coffee drinkers do n't like tea because its too light or subtle , but this has great flavor and can win over any coffee drinker !
5 #### LOVE THESE TEAS . ALWAYS CHECK THE PRICES , AS RECENTLY THIS TEA HAS BEEN CHEAPER IN THE STORE BY THE BOX . ' IT 'S LIKE A HUG IN A CUP ' .
5 #### This one surprised us . It has a very strong taste . We usually mix it half & half with regular tea . That being said , it is delicious !
5 #### cheap and it works .... i drink it ... and i pass out within 10 minutes ... it does calm me before i go to bed
5 #### I had a box of this tea for weeks I had n't tried until one late night when I could n't sleep I got up and made a cup . I was astonished by the sweetness , though I rarely have sweet foods so may have found this sweeter than others would , but did a web search to make sure there was no sweetener . It maybe the combination of flavors that gives it such a sweet impact on the palate . This is now my favorite herb tea , and I enjoy several cups a day , or if a craving hits I drink this tea instead . I find the cinnamon taste to be just right , since I did n't like strong cinnamon teas before . The cost through Amazon is a bit less than in my local market unless they have a sale . I use about 10 oz of water per tea bag , let steep a couple minutes to release all the flavor .
5 #### Do you love Kerns Peach Nectar ? Do you hate that it has more calories than you care to spend on a drink and enough sugar to prompt Wilfred Brimley to shout DIABETES ? Here is your solution ! Brew this tea strong , I do 1.5 cups boiling water for two tea bags , steep , remove bags and add a touch of xanthan gum and stevia . Then add a cup of ice and stir to chill and dilute . BAM ! Calorie free and sugar free Peach Nectar ! Great alone or with vodka and fresh lime juice for a great summer cocktail . This tea is great hot too with a touch of cream , stevia and nutmeg -- like peach pie dessert ! You can even make peach jello jigglers with it , flavor a smoothie , make ice cream , etc . It is super delicious and super versatile ! ! !
5 #### One word : amazing . This stuff is great , we use it in a million recipes . It 's very versatile and high quality .
5 #### First of all I ca n't find black vinegar in any local stores , thus the order here . BUT , I adore hot and sour soup and this is a must ingredient . Love the quality , fragrance and taste .
2 #### label says rice vinegar with food coloring ( caramel ) . I thought black vinegar was a unique product but this does n't seem like it is .
5 #### good variety . caffeine free a plus . variety of tastes for everday use . The herbs have some medicinal value as well . thank you .
5 #### The flavors of each one of these five flavors is remarkably intense . Each sample pouch consists of four - bags of Raspberry Zinger , Country Peach Passion , Black Cherry Berry , Cranberry Apple Zinger , and Tangerine Orange Zinger . There are no artificial additives , this is achieved naturally by the master blenders at the ever - reliable Celestial Seasonings , a company that has not compromised on consistent high - quality . The teas are not only wonderful hot , each flavor makes for refreshing pitchers of fruity iced tea . Enjoy !
5 #### I do n't drink tea or coffee - nothing religious - I just do n't like the taste . I do like the herbal teas however . This summer I put several bags in my glass quart pitcher , filled with boiling water , and let it sit for awhile . When it cooled I put it in the fridge and used it to make several pitchers of " iced tea " . Refreshing and cool on a hot day . I read online that I could make the concentrate and can it in a boiling water bath . I am going to try that next .
5 #### Wonderful tea hot or iced ! And herbal to boot ! ! Yes I know herbal does n't have the health benefits of green tea but this is a perfect tea to blend with green tea or any other tea for that matter . But all by itself the perfect beverage no sugar needed at all ! I am a true tea fanatic and this is the most perfect beverage . Steep the full 6 min . And enjoy either hot or iced !
5 #### I really like this tea it 's true to taste . Worth buying again . I like to have this item on autoship .
5 #### Has great flavor and is strong enough to make really pleasant ice tea . This is one of my favorites . I use this often .
5 #### Wish these were available in 40 count boxes . I would buy all the time ! I enjoy the flavor of this tea .
5 #### ABSOLUTELY love this tea ... didn't know if I 'd like it but I love the Celestial Brand teas so did n't think I could go wrong with this one . Came with in a resonable time from ordering .
5 #### I love drinking this tea . I tastes good and It is refreshing . Black cherry is good for you . It is a nice afternoon treat .
4 #### This gets me in sleep mode at night and Amazon offers a great deal on the autoship . Favorite tea from this brand .
3 #### The reason I gave only 4 stars is that I do n't know how safe this tea is in terms of pesticides residue . I recently got very disturbing information that Celestial Seasonings teas are full of them . I wish they had organic version of this - do n't like the idea of consuming pesticides with my tea .
5 #### I drink a lot of tea and particularly enjoy the spice teas that include cinnamon . But this tea is exceptional in that it literally BURSTS with flavor . This is especially noticeable if you brew it in a thermos mug , which holds the heat . It relates to Chai Indian tea , but this is so much more flavorful . It 's unbelievable ! This tea has cinnamon , ginger , cardamom and cloves . It 's caffeine - free . It can be drunk with milk & sugar for a true Chai experience .
5 #### This is one of my favorite herbal teas . It has a nice peach flavor & aroma . It tastes good unsweetened , which helps decrease my sugar consumption .
5 #### Love this spicy lemony tea , very tasty as hot and FANTASTIC as iced tea . I plan for this to be my go - to lemon tea , as evidenced by the fact I had to buy it online . We were on vacay and found the tea in the supermarket , but none to be found at home . Just buy it already !
5 #### or anytime you need to relax . sit down with a good book or your journal with this tea at your side . and just relax , watch your tension be tamed .
5 #### Yum ! Peppermint tea , whether hot or cold this tea has a very nice brisk peppermint taste . I use a very large tea mug and these bags can be used twice by me and still taste darn good . Granted I let it sit in my mug the whole time I am drinking the tea . I also make gallons of refrigerator tea in the summer time . Most of the family likes this unsweetened , but it also tastes amazing sweetened . I am very happy with the size of the box and that you get a 6 pack . I will have plenty for he summer and the winter .
5 #### I usually make a strong cup of tea with lemon , ginger , and honey for our head colds ( it seems to help with congestion and speed up healing ) . This had almost everything in one place . I brewed him up a cup added the honey and afterward he did n't know it was n't moms regular brew . He could n't really taste it either so I had some too . There is a strong ginger taste but since I use this formula for colds I want a strong ginger taste . I enjoyed this tea and will continue to . I like that I wo n't have to run out and get some ginger if I have this on hand .
5 #### Hot or cold I love this tea . I make refrigerator tea by the gallon in the summer , lots of different flavors . This is one of my family 's favorites so I like the large boxes and that its a 6 pack . In the colder months I enjoy this in the evenings and do n't worry about getting to sleep as it is a big help to me . I should have plenty now for a nice long while .
3 #### It 's an average flavored herbal tea , which is still priced to make it a great deal and is still drinkable . Go for this tea if you are a deal hunter . Not recommend for a true tea lover .
5 #### If you are like me and live overseas , where access to things like this are limited , this is a great deal . We are both coffee and tea drinkers and sometimes I just want a cup of peach tea , or maybe blueberry . This sample has a great variety that lets me enjoy a variety at a great price .
5 #### i love this tea and was sad it 's only available during the holiday season . first time i saw it i only bought one , then after drinking some went back for more and it was gone until the next year . i must not be the only one to like it , they always run out ( and the other seasonal flavors they ca n't seem to sell ) . i was thrilled when i could get a case of it and have it year round ! ! i make a gallon of tea at a time to keep in fridge so i always have iced tea ready to go or if i want it hot i just zap it in the microwave :)
4 #### Good favor teas but they do n't come individually wrapped which is a downside for me especially since I keep a stash of teas at work . Each container comes with 5 flavors and each flavor has one individual wrapper containing 3 tea bags which are not individually wrapped . The teas are great for ice tea or hot tea . I personally found the cherry flavor to be a little overwhelming but I am sure others will like it .
5 #### fabulous peach for iced tea . does not taste artificial . herb tea . i mix it with some black tea bags for a pick me up .
5 #### As a substitute for coffee you ca n't beat this ! The price is so much better than the other coffee substitutes like Postum and Pero and several others I have tried that have extravagant prices . I have this on auto delivery !
5 #### I drink it so often it 's probably turning my teeth brown . I love the taste and the ease of production ( like all the teas I know of ) . I usually add a little almond milk and crystalized stevia ( Truvia , which I also buy by the box - load ) , but I find it soothing and pleasant morning , noon and night . I 've tried dozens of other tea flavors , but none satisfies like Roast - a - rama .
5 #### The more flavorful of the major herbal tea brands , the Cinnamon Apple Spice makes a great iced tea . Brew a pitcher at night , no ice , refrigerate and have a great and tasty alternative to juices , soda and other items in need of sweetening . Cost effective too .
5 #### I do n't normally care for herb tea , but this is the exception . Roastaroma tastes like a flavored coffee but is inexpensive . It is particularly good on a cold day .
5 #### This is a terrific herbal tea . It 's very rich tasting , reminiscent of coffee , but not quite a coffee flavor . I put in about a quarter to half teaspoon of Ovaltine if I want to jazz it up with a hint of chocolate . I do n't know why it 's not available locally in my Wisconsin town , but it 's not , so I get it online .
3 #### I do n't taste the Peppermint in this box , and neither does my wife . It dosen't taste very good , kind of like a mixture of green and grey teas , mixed with something slightly minty . The peppermint tea from Celestial Seasonings blows this mixture out of the water . After tasting 2 tea bags , we are worried what we will do with 6 more boxes of this " stuff " . We are very sad .
5 #### This peppermint tea tastes better than I expected it to . It has a type of menthal to it , where you can feel your lungs opening up . I 'm not sure if this is the intention , but it 's much better than Mint Magic from Celestial Seasonings , and blows away any other type of mint / peppermint / spearmint type of tea . I stocked up the pack of 6 , and I really love this stuff .
5 #### My husband loves Celestial Seasonings Chamomile Herb Tea ! He enjoys a cup every evening before bed . He said it helps to relax him and helps him sleep .
5 #### This has me as buying chamomile tea , but I bought CS 's Tension Tamer Tea , and my review is on it . My favorite tea of all time -- and I 'm a tea fanatic . Besides tasting FABULOUS , it 's quite handy for health . Feeling stressed ? Brew a cup with one teabag . Ca n't sleep ? Throw in two to three teabags and you 'll sleep sounder than a baby ! On days when you feel both stressed / nervous and a little run - down , this will pick you up without making you sleepy , if you keep your cup at 1 - 2 bags . And it 's so good , I do n't even sweeten it , though you can if you want . If you check the label , you 'll see it 's got B vitamins and lots of other good things you need in it . I always have AT LEAST two boxes on hand , so I wo n't run out . As far as I know , it does n't cure cancer , but it sure can make the day - to - day stuff we all go through go a LOT easier . Folks I 've recommended it to have come back and thanked me PROFUSELY , and everyone likes the taste . It really has seemed to work for everyone just like it does for me . Try it ; bet you 'll love it !
5 #### Open the bag , insert nose and inhale the intense peppermint aroma . Love it . The tea that results is very good , too .
5 #### One teabag could be used for two cups of tea . I use one teabag for my 14 ounce mug , and the tea is plenty strong . I ca n't tolerate caffeine , so this tea is a dream come true . No strings on the teabags . The price here is much lower than what they charge at the local health food store . If you like strong teas , this is likely up your alley .
5 #### I love this tea ! It is great hot or cold . If you like cherry anything ( or everything , like I do ) you will love it . Warms you up on a cold evening or make it iced on a summer day . They do n't carry it in the stores where I live in Alaska , so I order my stash on Amazon !
5 #### Apple is really the best flavor for a chamomile tea . Not as smooth as the " other " brand I really like , but I ca n't find it anymore . Tastes way better than the other ' flavors ' I 've tried , when by itself . Sometimes I mix teas ( I have a really big cup ) to get a good flavor . Their Honey Vanilla Chamomile tea is good when mixed with a white tea orange spice .
5 #### This is a perfect anytime refresher . Just put some bags into cold water , let steep for a couple hours and pour over ice and you 've got a perfect accompaniment for something off the grill or all by itself .
4 #### I have to correct a previously made statement about Celestial Seasonings Tea . The packaging is wonderful , resealable for freshness in waxed paper . The tea is good quality . The seller was terrific and lightening fast . HOWEVER CS Teas ' never has a string on their tea bags . In my humble opinion this detail prevents a 5 star rating as I do not like fishing out a teabag stuck to the cup nor do i like using a teaspoon . This may be unimportant for you , if so , the tea is excellent , you 'll enjoy it . The seller offers value . I will return to buy again .
5 #### This is one of my favorite teas . I often make it iced by the pitche when I am expecting friends . It has flavor , is not overwhelming and dies not need sweetened .
5 #### a delicious brew available at a great price plus there 's a lot of other great ' blends ' to choose from / excellent
5 #### Celestial Seasonings teas always have the perfect blend of flavors . This tea is delicious , and you can get two good cups from one tea bag .
4 #### Blueberry is my third choice . I truly love Cinnamon Apple Spice . However , to mix it up a little bit I also ordered Black Cherry and Blueberry .
4 #### I settled on caffeine free tea . Black Cherry and Blueberry are my second and third choices compared to Cinnamon Apple Spice
5 #### I needed to move away from caffeine completely . No longer could I consume my two to three cups of coffee a day . In fact , I could n't even have one decaf coffee . It causes tacka - cardia now ( pulse rate up to 115 - 130 resting ! ) . I needed to find a tasty alternative . I tried many different caffeine free teas . I finally settled on Cinnamon Apple Spice as my favorite . I enjoy two to three cups of the tea each day now .
5 #### I drink a lot of green tea ( for the health benefits ) but I 'm not a big fan of the taste . I discovered by accident that if I make a gallon of green tea ( 4 quart sized bags ) and add a couple of bags of this into the mix it mellows out the flavor . I 've tried plain Chamomile but this ( IMHO ) is better . The vanilla is what seems to come through the strongest for me in this blend and I 've kind of gotten hooked on it .
5 #### I took a big chance on this tea , as I have never had it before . I am not a huge fan of chamomile , but was seeking an herbal tea to enjoy either hot or iced . And because Celestial Seasonings is my preferred choice , packaged without strings / foil packets , but in manageable sized boxes so that you are not leaving the package open for very long periods of time , I decided to give it a try . I love chai teas , and usually drink a caffeinated choice , I was wanting something to enjoy that was herbal / caffeine free . PERFECT ! Very pleasing smooth fresh apple flavor , without the bite of cinnamon or black pepper , often found in other choices . Absolutely wonderful . I may have to order to receive on a regular schedule !
5 #### I like this tea for work . No caffeine , but natural stimulant keeps me alert but not jittery . I start my day with a quad espresso and switch to tea after that . I added this to subscribe and save to get my total to five , which means that Amazon gives me and extra 15 % off ! Better price , free shipping , extra discount , and no tax ( at least for a little while longer ) ? What 's not to like ?
5 #### My sister found this last winter and I tried it too . This is the only tea I like without sugar or half and half . The wonderful aroma of the tea carries the great taste from the beginning to the end . I hope you like it too . My sister puts a small packet of Stevia in hers and she loves it that way . Another friend uses sugar and loves it like that .
5 #### I was a bit worried 6 boxes was too much but when I 'm in the mood for it I drink it all day . Does n't taste like coffee but fulfills what you 're looking for when you drink coffee(except caffeine ) with it 's earthy taste .
4 #### I 've tried these both hot and iced , and they 're very tasty . For an 8 - oz cup , you need two bags or it is n't really strong enough , but a single bag is sufficient for smaller cups . The Cranberry Apple is my favorite , especially on one of the first chilly days of autumn . The Country Peach Passion is excellent iced for spring or summer .
5 #### I love this tea and now I have a great supply for some afternoon sun tea this summer thank you
5 #### This is the first time I 've finished a box of tea ever , much less in a very short time . I recently purchased a whole case and am sharing with friends and family . It is refreshing hot or cold and the flavor is delicious !
5 #### I love this herb tea . It has a wonderful flavor . The stores around me do n't carry it so I 'm glad I was able to purchase it on Amazon even though I had to purchase 6 boxes . That should last me a while . Cherries are supposed to be an antioxident so this should also be good for you . I use a little Splenda and Whipped Cream on Top . It 's delicious .
5 #### Great tasting tea , which also helps reduce tension . It might even help prolong sleep ! All Celestia Seasonings teas are good .
5 #### This is on my automatic reorder . I get a couple of cases about every 3 months . I love this tea . It is great with or without sugar . If you steep it strong it tastes like it has sugar in it .
5 #### This flavor is very good if you love sweet fruity flavored teas ! I would recommenced it to anyone I know who loves tea to be part of their assortments .
5 #### I love the way this tea smells ! The aroma is gentle and very relaxing . The taste is light and naturally sweet , sugar not needed but a spot of honey is nice :) This tea also has a very smooth , almost creamy " mouth feel " that plain chamomile does n't have . Lovely tea ! ! !
4 #### Found this tea last Christmas season and really like the fact that it does n't have spice and cinnamon in it ( all the rest of the " holiday " teas seem to ) . It is a mild sweetish flavor that is nice in the morning if you do n't want any caffeine and I drink it all year round now .
4 #### I actually quite enjoyed these in the beginning and even gave a box to my sister , however , I think I overindulged on this particular flavor . I noticed that the more I consumed it , the sweeter it was , until it became almost cloying . I am not sure that 's the products fault , but that 's what happened . If you like a very sweet tea and you never get sick of ' sweet ' , I 'd try this . I think it could even calm a raging sweet - tooth . If you do n't think you could stand a very sweet tea , every day , not even to not waste the product you purchased - I 'd look for something else .
5 #### I 've been using these teas for decades and primarily as iced tea . They are very flavorful and thirst quenching on a hot southern afternoon . I use agava as sweetner . Highly recommend both .
3 #### The flavor is weak , The tea bags seem to be sparsly filled . I think I should have spend an extra dollar or two and bought a better brand .
5 #### I just started getting into drinking more tea than coffee and chose to start with the fruit sampler . I was amazed at my first cup and how flavorful it was ! I did n't need much sugar at all as the sweetness from the herbs comes through perfectly ! I will definitely be buying more when I run out !
5 #### my favorite tea of all time - it 's tough to find in the store so we were excited to be able to get it on line ...
1 #### I purchased this tea thinking it would be perfect for a holiday taste . Well , it 's not good at all . It 's cloying and has a nasty smell . I gave the entire 6 boxes to charity after trying just 1 tea bag . Yuck .
3 #### This tea as I have said is OK ... not particularly one of my favs when it comes to most of the Celestial Seasonings tea . It is very strong in taste for me .
5 #### I tried this about 10 years ago and I fell in love with it . All of a sudden it was no where to be found . I enjoy drinking this it has the feeling of coffee without the effects . I can enjoy and and still relax . I love this . So happy its back and available .
5 #### This tea is delicious . I put a box of Honey Vanilla Chamomile tea in the break room at work . Either you love it or you hate it . I happen to love it .
5 #### some teas are bitter , which I do not like . This is not too bitter and if it want it sweeter , I add a little honey and it tastes great . Some days I prefer w/o honey . There is no string / staple / tag . I like that a lot - it 's a waste and I do n't like the idea of staples in my tea .
5 #### I love this tea but I bought it for a gift . The recipient said they liked it . So that makes two of us !
5 #### I love this tea but can not find it locally . Having it delivered - in bulk- is great ! It tastes like candy , sweet without any sugar . I drink it every day . Everything in it is good for you .
4 #### I have purchased this product from the store over the years . Stopped using for awhile but with the stress thought I would try again . Must say the tension tamer does not tame the stress . However I am extremely stressed . May work for a lower stress level . The key is the company is great and did a great job sending the remaining 5 boxes not originally shipped . Thanks !
5 #### After the doctor took me off of gluten and caffeine , I 've been desperate to find something I can drink hot . Decaf coffee , decaf teas ( black , oolong , green , white ) are all off the plate right now . Most coffee substitutes rely on barley and rye , so that 's out for me . I even tried Dandy Blend , which supposedly they strain out the gluten , so it 's gluten - free ... but my eczema and skin just reacted so badly 10 minutes after I drank it . So no DandyBlend either . My favorite CS tea was English Toffee , but that had roasted barley in it ... so once again a no - no . I wanted something that I can add milk and sugar to , so fruit teas are not what I 'm looking for . As I perused the store desperately , I see Bengal Spice . Then I read the ingredients - NO GLUTEN ! ! ! Took it home and tried it -- I LOVE THIS TEA ! ! ! It 's close to English Toffee , and I like the flavor ! Yay ! ! ! I have a hot beverage again ! ! ! Thank you Celestial Seasonings :-)
4 #### This is really good herbal tea . The flavor and scent are really strong and calms me down after a long day .
4 #### This tea lives up to it 's name , but the ginger kick for me is tasted more toward the end of consuming the drink . I prefer my ginger taste noticeably strong . This tea gives you a hint of peppery ginger after a good steep . I would buy it again , though . Celestial Seasonings makes a variety of great teas . I have n't had one I did n't like yet .
5 #### This is my favorite herbal tea flavor . I was so disappointed when I went to the grocery store and learned ( duh ! ) that this is a seasonal flavor . Luckily I found this on Amazon . It 's a case of 6 so it should last me until next winter , I hope ! A friend of mine tried it and thought it was n't strong enough BUT I drink tea without adding milk or sugar and leaving the bag in my cup instead of removing it . So I can definitely taste it and I prefer flavors that are n't overly sweet or spicy anyways ! This is a great soothing tea that genuinely tastes like cookies ( to me anyways ! )
2 #### Ii was very disappointed in these teas . I like lots of different ones , but these did not move me , except the peppermint .
5 #### This is one of my favorite teas ! It tastes just like a cookie ! My favorite is to add a little sugar - free caramel syrup after it steeps . It is quite a treat . I wish I could find this all year long !
5 #### We purchased this product because we go through so much pep tea in our house . It 's a good price . However , someone in the house dislikes the fact that the tea bags are n't individually packaged . I do n't care so much and I knew the type of bag CS uses . :) I was going only for price savings on this one !
2 #### I love peppermint , so my sweet husband bought a box of this tea to try . Unfortunately , he did not realize how much I dislike spearmint , which is also in this tea . What really ruins the flavor of Mint Magic , however , is the other ingredients -- roasted chicory , cinnamon and orange peel . In combination with more robust teas , chicory is a nice , nutty additive . Cinnamon and orange peel are wonderful with fruity teas , but not with mint . These ingredients change the tea from a refreshing , cool flavor , to something more warm and spicy . Clearly , they do n't go together !
5 #### I bought this for my mom to try , and now we ca n't wait to buy more ! You can drink this without sugar or even honey . We like to put one or two in our gallon of ice tea to give it a lil kick too . A def all year tea !
5 #### I love this tea , so glad I can now order it year round instead of just during the Christmas holiday season .
4 #### I 've been buying Roastaroma for many years . Celestial Seasoning does n't always produce it , and sometimes it is hard to find , so I was delighted to find it at Amazon.com . It 's the perfect afternoon drink , and makes an excellent coffee substitute for the evening or for those who like coffee , but ca n't drink it for some reason . I hope CS will always make this one .
5 #### I 've tried a variety of tea , but this flavor is one of my favorites . It is delicious , fruity and wonderful both hot and cold . I highly recommend Black Cherry Berry to anyone looking for a flavorful tea experience beyond green . Try it , you wo n't regret it !
5 #### I could go on & on about this tea . It is spicy & soothing and warm and slightly sweet without any sweetener of any kind added . I have started ordering by the case because all three of my kids love it & this winter has been rough for colds & flu . Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice is so soothing for throats sore from coughing & drainage . And the spiciness of it helps soothe your sinuses as well . My little guy marvels at how nicely sweet it is even without adding honey . My grown - up friends have been amazed by this as well . It is also not heavy like the " chais " that have all of the milky - like stuff in them . I add a little of my own milk to this & that is all . Does n't leave me feeling heavy . Just relaxed & warm . Ca n't wait until this summer to enjoy it iced !
3 #### I love this herbal tea blend and get it at holiday . Bought a 6 pack online . This batch tastes a little different and I think the tea blend just looking at it in the bag looks different then the blend I bought in store . Still good but I think it tastes more like citrus and splenda or something . Still would reccomend but do n't love it the same . I like to add a little half and half and tsp of cocoa powder after steeping .
5 #### This is a good peppermint tea . I would recommend this tea to others and I will buy this brand again .
5 #### This is by far one of my favorite teas . I wait every year for it to come out in the stores during the holiday . Not being able to find it I went on line and bought a case of it . I held a tea for my mother 's birthday with 30 different selections and most everyone said this was their favorite . Would definately recommend it .
3 #### The best way I can describe this tea is that it tastes like Big Red chewing gum in liquid form . I must warn you that the further and further you get into the cup , the more peppery it gets . I start out getting the cinnamon , clove and a little of the ginger and by the last three sips , it 's all pepper to the point where I have to take a sip of water or iced tea . I 've found that if I make this an add a bag of peppermint tea to it , the pepper does n't hit me as hard . I love herbal teas and although this is n't the worst tea I 've ever tasted , it certainly is n't at the top of my list .
5 #### An excellent tea . If I could only have one herbal tea - this would be it . Lovely flavor . A very nice tummy tea , and useful for Irritable Bowel Syndrome patients . So glad it is still available here on Amazon .
5 #### Love the flavor , took a little getting use to at first but now along with a few of the other Celestial Seasonings Holiday Flavor I have come love this was one I had to get more of .... Seller was prompt in shipment ... I had 1 tea bag left from when I bought some before Christmas 2012 & came just in time .
5 #### i do n't drink alcoholic beverages , and when i entertain at home this tea is part of my sweet tea blend , and it makes me popular with my guests . especially the ladies ;)
5 #### This tea is my most favorite . Lots of sweetness and spices , cinnamon , roasted chicory , roasted carob , ginger , cardamom , black pepper , cloves , nutmeg and vanilla flavors .
5 #### After trying out all the zinger teas , this is my second favorite ( behind orange tangerine ) to use as an iced tea .
5 #### Friends introduced us to this tea during the summer . She had made iced tea with it . I have never liked herbal tea but this was awesome . I now drink it hot for the winter . I do believe that the herbs used in this tea has kept me healthy from the flu season !
5 #### If you are spice person , I promise you will love this tea . If you want to serve a very special cuppa just add some real cream and sugar . I prefer raw sugar .
4 #### This is a very good tea and when you add a little milk ( or cream ) and a tad of honey it is a wonderful tea . Try it , you 'll like it !
2 #### I thought this would be more fruity and less spicy . This was very spicy . I could n't taste any of the plum .
5 #### This tea is like drinking a ginger - y lemon drop after you add your choice of sweetener . It is very flavorful and has already become a favorite at our house . It is also a good tea to mix with black or green tea if you want to add some caffeine . Since it 's caffeine - free , it 's very versatile . It might even make a good lemonade style cold drink . I 'll test it out . Happy Sipping !
5 #### I hope they never stop making this , because it is my absolute favorite ! Great for breakfast or at the end of the day . No caffeine , as it is herbal only .
5 #### I tried this tea and had to order a whole case ! It is so delicious and sweet . Great to satisfy a sweet craving without calories !
5 #### This has been the favorite tea of my husband and daughters for many years . It has only been available around Christmas time each year , so I knew to stock up on it at that time to have enough for the rest of the year . Unfortunately , this year it did not appear in my local grocery store . We tried to special order it through the store , but their vendor no longer carried it . We looked online at Celestial Seasonings and it was no longer listed . Thanks to Amazon.com , I was able to secure this case of six boxes , and it came right on time . I know there are other companies with similar products , like Cinnamon Plum tea , etc . But none have the exact flavor of this one , and some of the closer in taste to this also have caffeine . I do hope Celestial Seasonings will reconsider stocking this tea , and if not , that another enterprising tea company will see about purchasing the proprietary blend or coming up with a match themselves and perhaps contacting me through a response to this review .
5 #### Chamomile Tea has always helped to settle your stomach over the years even as a kid . This particular brand by Celestial is so good with the honey vanilla and other natural ingredients . Its both warming and soothing and without any caffeine , a great cup of tea for the evening before bed and I really think it is calming and helps me to sleep .
3 #### I was excited to see that Celestial Seasonings had decided to release a lemon ginger tea . In the past , I 've enjoyed the Twinings lemon ginger , so I was eager to find out what the CS version would taste like . Be forewarned that the ginger notes are very strong in this one . Having a cup of this is sort of like drinking a volcano , but I drink through the burn because it 's a very effective medicinal tea for sore throats and nausea . If the ginger were dialed back just a little bit to allow the lemon flavor to come through more , then I would give this tea 5 stars ( as it is , it 's a 3.5 in my book , but the Amazon rating system wo n't allow half - stars ) .
5 #### I live on this stuff ... mornings are for coffee but after 4 or 5 , I start drinking hot peppermint tea and this is by far the loveliest , cleanest , most consistent pep tea on the market . It 's priced well and they are just so fresh it is just wonderful . Love them completely . The only thing I 'd like more is if they had a little string with a stamp so I could pull the around the cup , but truly that is just fluff . This is serious peppermint tea for the serious peppermint tea drinker .
5 #### Do they still make red hots ? The little red cinnamon candies ? This tea tastes like that only with fruity overtones , someone said apple , but it 's the plum , you can taste the plum . I like to make it very strong and brew it extra long , I add just a wee bit of sugar , but it really does n't need any . I took this to work in a pump pot and everyone who tried it loved and asked where it came from . Only thing is I told them it was called Sugar Plum Fairy ... oops ! lol , guess I should read better and not just look at the pictures on the box ! Mine is still delicious and it 's been sitting in the back of the freezer for a couple of years . Buy this you wo n't be sorry ! mmmm mmmm mmmmmm mmmm ( and mmmm ) :D
5 #### Since the demise of the late lamented Emperor 's Choice , Bengal Spice has been my go - to herb tea . It 's one of the few non - caffeinated teas that does n't taste wimpy . Instead , it 's a heady mix of vanilla , cinnamon , cardamom and cayenne papper ( yup ! ) that perfumes the entire house with an exotic aroma . The hint of cayenne elevates this tea from ordinary to sublime , especially with a splash of milk and a piece of gingerbread . It 's especially welcome in the depths of a Midwestern winter . I 'm very fond of traditional black teas , but like to have an herbal tea on hand for late day or night sipping . Bengal Spice fits the bill ; the fragrance is beyond fabulous and best of all , it does n't taste puny .
5 #### I love tea , but I am not a fan of camomille . However , for this tea I will not only make an exception , but I will say that I absolutely LOVE it ! I have not purchased it from Amazon , as I have been able to find it in the local grocery - so far . Really , even if it 's not your " thing , " this one is worth a try .
5 #### You 'll either love it or hate it . It 's a strong tea but I can use less sugar . I also add cinnamon and or milk to vary the flavor .
5 #### This tea is so tasty and has a hint of both cinnamon and ginger . The sweetness makes it even better . I am not a tea drinker and Ginger Spice has changed my mind . I 'm thankful to find it on Amazon as it 's very hard to locate in the grocery store .
5 #### I love this tea ! I During winter especially ( when I ca n't make sun tea outside ) I like to take about 6 bags , put them in a large bowl , add in the boiling water , and let it steep for awhile . Then I pour the tea into a large glass container with a lid and put in the the fridge . I love the strong flavor of the cinnamon . It is good hot too ! Awesome tea !
5 #### This is a great tea to substitute for too much coffee . The added benefit your liver gets from the roasted chicory is also nothing to sneeze at .
5 #### Celestial Seasonings used to carry dessert teas but sadly they were discontinued . This tea definitely replaces those teas though and then some ! It 's absolutely DELICIOUS ! ! I order it in BULK so I can have it year round . There is nothing like sipping down this tea in July , closing my eyes , and pretending that chestnuts are roasting on an open fire ! :)
5 #### I used to love iced tea , but had to give up on it because of the caffeine . I stumbled across the reviews here and decided to try this Celestial Seasonings version , and it definitely lives up to all the positive reviews . The tea essence is probably what gives it the tea taste , and it can be brewed cold , which is a plus and makes it a handy replacement for those who like instant ice tea like Lipton 's . I 'll be buying this again !
5 #### This tea tastes great ( I add extra honey ) and when I have a cold it is one if my go to remedies ! It clears my sinuses and soothes a sore throat ! Love it !
5 #### It 's a great sampler , which is why I bought a box set . I do add splenda but other than that - zero complaints .
4 #### You do n't get the apple flavor like other brands but I 'll start using this to make cinnamon apple oatmeal and it 'll all be good . The cinnamon is too overwhelming for regular tea , unless you make it really watered down . Other brands make better cinnamon apple .
5 #### This tea is so beyond good . I ordered this large pack from Amazon because sometimes it 's not in the stores & I drink this stuff so much . It 's nice and sweet without being bad for you .
4 #### I really like this tea ! I love the combination of apple and cinnimon , and that the cinnimon is not extremely strong . The nutritional facts are a definite plus , by the way , and the ease to find this locally if I am too impatient to wait for an online order is an added pleasure .
5 #### Who would have believed that one could drink a cup of tea and be so overwhelmed by the flavor that the vision of dunking sugar cookies in milk would appear . I use just a drop or two of stevia and a splash of half - n - half and my waist line shrinks while my senses are endulged . I drink a whole 6 cup pot a day and it only takes 4 or 5 tea bags . Save on money while throwing caution to the wind ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Enjoy !
5 #### I am enjoying this tea . It tastes exactly as you expect , like a sugar cookie . I wish they 'd keep it year round .
4 #### This is a very tasty tea , with a nice strong flavor ( but not too strong ) . Celestial Seasonings makes a lot of good teas , so adding this one to my list . The quality is good . Easy to recommend if you like a spicy apple flavor ( reminiscent of spiced apple cider ) . A nice Fall - Winter tea for those cold evenings .
4 #### This tea smells delicious ! It made me think of orange blossoms or a creamy vanilla dessert . Unfortunately , the tea tastes about the same as regular chamomile tea . Although this tea does have a slightly sweeter taste than normal chamomile tea , it does n't taste nearly as good as chamomile tea sweetened with actual honey . I tried this tea plain -- I did n't use any added sweetener . Maybe I would have like it better if I had . In the future , I think that I 'll stick with run of the mill chamomile tea , even though this tea is certainly very pleasant .
3 #### Was caught a bit off - guard when I was about to purchase this tea and noticed it contained roasted barley malt in the ingredients . Was n't exactly expecting to find gluten in tea , but you can never be too careful .
1 #### Usually I use Stash tea , as I have found it to be the best around . But heard about Gingerbread Spice and decided to try it . Forget it ! Just a cinnamon flavor , no ginger at all . I 'll stick with Stash Ginger Breakfast tea and their Lemon Ginger , best ginger taste .
5 #### I love this tea ... it is caffine free and full of antioxidents , I mix it with the gingerbread spice tea and they are even better together !
3 #### It 's a nice tea , but the vanilla or honey ( or maybe a combination of them both ) leave it tasting a bit " fake " flavored , if you know what I mean . The plain chamomile from Celestial Seasonings is much better on it 's own .
3 #### Yeah , I guess its supposed to taste like cookies , but I do n't see it . However , my co - worker loves this stuff so much that she buys out the store every year . So , by all means try it !
5 #### it taste good , and I like it . I do n't like that # of words are requuired here though . that is dumb .
5 #### it taste good , and I like it . I do n't like that # of words are requuired here though . that is dumb .
5 #### I bought these because it was cheaper here than my local store . Tastes so good . My husband even likes it he does n't drinnk tea much at all .
5 #### this has been my favorite herbal tea the past 3 years ... but this year it seems to have stronger cinnamon tones ... I love cinnamon but I want more of the gingerbread flavor ... if I steep the tea for 3 - 5 minutes I get a more drinkable gingerbread taste ... anything longer than that and it tastes like cinnamon tea ... I did notice the use by marking on the box ... it says use by the 2nd of November 2014 ... so I might be guessing that my previous products may not have been as fresh or that Celestial Seasons kicked up their recipe a notch .... or someone put a bit too much cinnamon in this batch or changed the type of cinnamon in here such as Vietnamese cinnamon ..... I know others complained it was too weak ... this is definitely not week ... still an enjoyable cup once I got the hang of how long to let the tea steep Ok I have opened the box and let the box open for about 2 weeks ... and now the gingerbread spice is tasting so much better ... I am tasting much more of the gingerbread and less of the cinnamon ... I like that much better
5 #### I drink this tea at work because I have already had my caffeine allotment for the morning . Celestial Seasonings changed this to a " Sleepytime " tea a couple years ago . I think this was a silly marketing decision because it is more about throat soothing . I think they call it " Sleepytime " because it has chamomile in it .
5 #### This stuff is good ! Every flavor in Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea Sampler variety pack is a favorite for us , and with an assortment that this mix presents , you 'll never have a chance to grow tired of any particular kind . I just re - stocked my stash by purchasing one lone box at a drug / convenience store , and now I 'll know enough to come back to Amazon every time . This is also a thoughtful little gift any time of year for friends at a distance . With company coming , you 'll be able to have a little something special on hand for everyone !
5 #### I love this variety pack because it contains no duds whatsoever . Each flavor is enjoyable . It also has remarkable ingiridents in each flavor . I tend to let it steep closer to the 6 minutes that is recommended . Doing that I get a nice fruit flavor and a very relaxing and enjoyable drink . With fall here and winter coming up these are GREAT to have on hand . Quality ingridients and great taste = a very nice value . Recommended .
5 #### Nothing says , " Happy holidays , " to me quite like homemade fruit cake or a cup of hot Sugar Plum Spice tea . I look forward to this Celestial Seasonings specialty every year , as it is normally available only from October to January . The roasted barley malt , chicory root and carob give it a rich , robust flavor -- almost like a cup of mocha . Rose hips , natural plum flavor and chamomile flowers add a sweet , fruity taste akin to a fine plum pudding . Ginger root gives it that characteristic holiday zing . Try this full - flavored herbal infusion yourself , and your taste buds will dance with delight !

4 #### This is a delightful little holiday tea I look forward to every year . It 's meant to taste like gingerbread -- easily achieved with a simple blend of cinnamon , ginger , roasted chicory , roasted barley , natural flavors and luo han guo for sweetener . If you are gluten intolerant , DON'T DRINK THIS TEA , as the barley will be a problem . If soy lecithin bothers you , then this tea is not for you , either . Get it while you can , as this tea is usually available only from October to January .
5 #### I 'm really dating myself here , but how many of you remember the spiced tea we used to make years ago with Lipton Iced Tea crystals , Tang Instant Breakfast Drink , cloves and cinnamon ? Oh , did we love that as kids ! If you enjoyed that , I 'm here to inform you that this is 10 times better -- and it has zero caffeine . Celestial Seasonings knows how to blend teas . Mandarin Orange Spice is one of their classic ( oldest ) flavors . With its perfect mixture of dried orange peel , rose hips , blackberry leaves and natural Mandarin orange flavor , you get a sweet citrus flavor that is beautifully enhanced by the warm , spicy zing of chicory , cinnamon and cloves . I prefer this tea hot , so all its flavors are in full bloom ; but I 'm sure it could be just as pleasant chilled .
5 #### Peppermint is one of the top 5 most amazing flavors on God 's green earth ! And of all the brands of peppermint teas out there , Celestial Seasonings ' peppermint is THE BEST ! I tried growing my own peppermint to make my own tea . The plants grew like crazy ( filled my entire planter and tried to go beyond that ) , bloomed and everything . Problem was , the leaves , when brewed , tasted smoky . I do n't know how Celestial Seasonings manages to find such perfect peppermint leaves and cuts them so they release such heavenly flavor . I DO know they have an entire room at their factory in Colorado Springs dedicated to storing nothing but peppermint , so it does n't get into the other teas . If you 've never been there , you got ta go . The tours are free and they have a gift shop with bargain - priced goodies and samples of their teas . If you read the ingredients on the box , all you find is " peppermint"--nothing else is added to enhance the color or flavor . Brew a cup , sweeten to taste with a bit of Stevia , and viola ! Peppermint stimulates the brain , clears your sinuses and wakes you up better than any caffeinated drink , plus it 's not addictive . It also helps settle your stomach and can prevent motion sickness . And what else says Christmas like this delightful hot or cold liquid that tastes as sweet and wonderful as the best candy canes on the market -- without the artificial red dye ?
5 #### One of my top 10 favorite herb teas , this is one my husband and I most frequently select . It is also one of the easiest flavors to find in stores and online . We love the sweet full - bodied flavor of the peaches , enhanced with blackberry leaves , orange peel and passion fruit . Serve it ice - cold , with honey or Stevia , for that down - home taste of the deep South during the summer . It 's equally wonderful as a hot drink to warm you up on a cold winter morning . The chamomile makes it a great option , when you need to calm down after a tough day at work or relax at bedtime .
5 #### Here 's one of Celestial Seasonings ' most fun flavors . A combination of wild blueberries , blueberry leaves and natural blueberry flavor with a hint of blackberry , this tea tastes great hot or iced . I usually sweeten it with a bit of Stevia . If you buy it in stores , you mostly find it in the summer . Buy online , and you can get it anytime .
5 #### This tea is great year - round , but is especially fun in the fall and winter , when I crave a bit of the good , old - fashioned fun of a cup of spiced apple cider . Although not as strong as the real thing , this infusion of apples , camomile , cinnamon and other spices is a mellower version of this favorite fall beverage . Add a bit of honey or Stevia to sweeten the brew and make all the flavors " pop . "
5 #### This is one of my favorite Celestial Seasoning herb teas . With its all - natural black cherry flavor , enhanced with actual bits of sweet cherries , blackberry leaves and hawthorn berries , you get a full infusion of this wonderful fruit to delight your palate -- with or without sweeteners . Hibiscus flowers add a deep red hue to delight the eyes ; rose hips add a bit of tartness and natural vitamin C. Tastes great hot or chilled . A terrific all - season drink .
5 #### This is one of my top 10 favorite teas -- almost all of which come from Celestial Seasonings . With the roasted chicory and carob , this drink has a lot of the full , robust flavor of a hot mocha drink -- but without the caffeine . The cinnamon , ginger , cloves and nutmeg give it a warm , spicy glow ; while black pepper adds an unexpected zing . If you are looking for a change in your usual hot drink line - up , you got ta try this one !
5 #### This tea is one of my favorite taste wise , for some people it may not be so wonderful . It is herbal and therefore decaf for those of us who suffer from migraines .

5 #### My wife and I love herbal teas and we just really love cinnamon . This tea is excellent to have a warm cup of in the evening as you unwind and relax . The scent of the apples and cinnamon is just aromatic and the tea warms you on those cold fall and winter evenings . I joke about eating a cookie with my tea but I am serious . My daughter - in - law makes the most delicious oatmeal , cinnamon , raisin , walnut cookies you ever had with Splenda just for me . They are great with a cup of this tea while just relaxing with a good book . Herbal teas seem to relax me and calm my nerves and this is probably one of my two favorites . This product is caffeine free , gluten free , contains no calories ( Except for the cookie I eat with it ) and Kosher Certified . I recommend it to you as an excellent product . I have posted several photos of the packaging and the nutrition label for your review .
5 #### We like herbal teas mostly because they are caffeine free and contain no calories . This is one of our favorites and it is excellent to warm you up on a cold fall or winter 's evening . We usually put a little Splenda in the tea to sweeten it or a little honey . Not only is the tea caffeine free but it is Gluten free and Kosher Certified . It also makes a great tasting ice tea for the summertime . I have included a couple of photos for you to look at including the nutrition label . We like it and it is nice to sip on while reading a book or eating a cookie ! We recommend it to you .
4 #### We drink a lot of herbal tea because it is caffeine free and it warms you up on a fall or winter day . It is nice to sip on a cup of tea when reading a book or watching some TV . We have several different flavors at our house but this is one that you might like to try as it contains 5 different sealed packets with the following teas in each packet : Lemon Zinger 3 tea bags Sleepytime 4 tea bags Chamomile 4 tea bags Honey Vanilla Chamomile 3 tea bags Pepermint 4 tea bags They are sealed in aluminum pouches to assure their freshness and to prevent cross contamination of the tea fragrances and flavor . I have attached photos of a new box we just opened for your information . My wife likes these a lot and we recommend them to you .
5 #### If you have a cold or cough with chest pain , here is a drink that will sooth your throat . Make it hot and add honey , and your home free . Add your favorite snack and a nice nap and you will be feeling better soon .
5 #### I am a tea drinker and these were a good tasting beverage . Not what I consider tea , but still worth drinking . Nice selection too .
2 #### This tea definitely smelled like blueberries but upon tasting it , it was a very sour /bitter taste to me despite not over steeping the tea . It almost tasted like cough syrup . added a bit of organic sugar and it tasted a bit better . Maybe I Just do n't like herbal / fruit flavored teas .
5 #### The scent of this tea is very calming on it 's own . I love the taste of this tea . I love the spiciness of the ginger along with the cooling effects of the mint . It 's a lovely contrast and very soothing . I like to add a few drops of honey and a splash of creamer to make it a little more appealing in the taste department but it is drinkable without depending on your own taste buds . I like to drink this day or night . One of my favorite Celestial teas .
5 #### Well , Tension Tamer lives up to it 's name . A perfect blend . Pleasing to the senses and great tasting . Just add a little Texas honey or even a splash of Carnation evaporated , or LaLechera condensed milk and walla !
5 #### I drink Chamomile tea to make the day " go away " and hubby drinks this , he says its the only thing that can make him feel calmer from anxiety , stress and constant worry . I can SEE the diffrence in him after he 's had a cup or two . If you 're looking for tea for anxiety issues , tension tamer , hawthrorn tea and St. Johns wort are your best bests IHO . Drink up !
4 #### I liked these teas . I found out I do not like lemon tea . Wow , strong . The peppermint tea is wonderful . Not as strong as the stash peppermint tea . That one is extreme . FYI
5 #### I 've been a Celestial Seasonings fanatic for about 3 years now . Their sleepytime , tension tamer , chamomile , honey vanilla chamomile , and mint magic teas all were pretty pleasant . Oh , and around the holidays the local stores get the Sugar Cookie , Candy Cane Lane , and Gingerbread blends . This tea closely resembles the Gingerbread blend they currently sell , however , it tastes so much better . There is an added ingredient or taste that just simply is missing from the gingerbread tea . Bengal Spice tea is my new favorite tea . I love the spicy initial taste , and depending on the cream you use , the after taste following is very uplifting . It is a very rich tea and tastes very good with a sweet treat like some peanut M&Ms , or any other milk chocolate . Celestial Seasonings , hats off to you again for making such a great tea . Tea drinkers , you have to try this . I 'm a bengal spice - o - holic .
5 #### I purchased this in the hope that I could make coffee like beverages from it . from the cup I just drank ( hot)it seems like it will work just fine for making " iced coffee " and mocha like beverages . I love this brand ! ! ! it does smell like cinnamon out of the box but it stated to smell simmalar to coffee once i slipped it into water , once it was brewed though it did smell like coffee but close to it . it is a bit weaker compared to coffee at one bag per cup , even if you seep it for a long time . bitter , black , hot , ya that 's like coffee .
5 #### We order by the case . This peppermint is clear and strong tasting . Celestial Seasonings is great at packaging the taste as if you just picked the leaves . During cold winter months we drink this tea every night .
5 #### i just purchase the tea today and i already enjoy it,,,there 's different flavor and 5 in each flavor packet this is going to last me a long long time .... great bye thank you * Lord * .
5 #### taste is subjective . That said , for me , this tea is fantastic . needs no sugar , but tastes just sweet enough , not too much . great flavor and stands out among herbal teas . My new herbal tea favorite . still good as it cools down . addictive . about to go back for a second cup . a little strong , yes , but you may like it that way . I would not change a thing about it .
5 #### I buy this flavor by the case - it has a very sweet , nutty , cake - like flavor which is great on it 's own or even better , I combine it with another tea and it 's even better . My favorite companion to " True Blueberry " , making my tea taste and smell like a blueberry muffin hot from the oven . This is great stuff , I 'm glad even when I ca n't find it in stores in the summer , I can order it here .
5 #### I ca n't get enough of this tea . I use a boiling water kettle that I purchased here on Amazon to boil 32 ounces of water . 4 bags of this tea , with 3 packets of stevia goes into each pot . I make two pots at a time , fill them half full with boiling water and let them steep for a couple of hours . Then each pot fills one half of a liter ' bormoglio ' canning bottle , fill the rest with filtered water and in to the refrigerator they go . It keeps me out of serious trouble with diet colas :) It 's wonderful iced or hot , but this time of the year the refreshing cold tea right from the fridge is perfect and tastes sooooooo good . No caffeine so great for those of us that are sensitive to caffeine too late in the day . I finally have something good to offer friends that drop by and they have all commented on how good and refreshing it was . No aftertaste left when using Stevia as opposed to artificial sweeteners or sugar .
5 #### Wonderful aroma and taste . A natural perk - me - up without the caffeine jangles . Add a touch of honey for a real treat . I drink it every evening and most days .
5 #### These teas are so yummy and a great introduction to the Celestial fruit teas . Individual tea bags are placed into larger wrapping in the box . When you unwrap the larger wrapping , the teas smell so fragrant . The teas do n't come with individual tea tags , which I thought was kind of annoying at first because I would have wanted to take the tea bags out once they steep , but in consideration of the teas being eco - friendly , alright ! My favorite among the bunch was the passion tea .
4 #### Tried this tea for the first time recently , and was pleasantly surprised . Found it to be a good alternative , and similar in taste , to the Good Earth Sweet and Spicy Caffeine Free variety , which seems lately to have had both a packaging change and a price increases at least via Amazon . One difference between the two is that the Celestial Seasonings tea bags come bulk packages in each box , with the tea bags group in tear - apart two - bag pieces . No strings and no individual tea bag packaging . Whereas the Good Earth varieties come with both string and tag attached to each bag , and then each bag individually packaged . But actually , since I use these teas for making homemade pitchers of iced tea , I do n't really care about the packaging or wrapping differences . And I found the taste of the Celestial Seasonings Bengal Spice to be pleasing and enjoyable . That and , unlike the Good Earth varieties lately , I do n't have to worry about getting the caffeinated tea variety by mistake with Celestial Seasonings . It 's clear that their product is just herbal tea .
2 #### I have drank Bigelow band peppermint tea and loved it . But , by current supermarket does n't carry Bigelow 's peppermint tea and I figured how different can they be .. after all the ingredients on both is " Peppermint " . I was very surprised to find Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea is very weak tasting . I am using two tea bags just to get more flavor . Also , there is a subtle difference in the taste of the two teas . Bigelow 's brand has a slightly sweeter taste , which I enjoy . In the future I will not be purchasing Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea .
5 #### I love this tea and forgot to buy it around the holidays . I drink it year round so it was great to find a 6 pack . Great transaction - pricier than buying in the store , but that 's my own fault ! Would buy again if needed .
5 #### I thought there could n't possibly be THAT much difference between this and other peppermint teas out there on the market . Oh , how I was wrong ! This one is WAY better ! Steep that bag for the time indicated , and you will be taken away to peppermint paradise ! I 'm so glad I did the " subscribe and save " on this . :) And the best thing about peppermint tea is that you do n't need any sugar ! It tastes great on its own !
5 #### I drink this tea because it actually helps elevate my blood sugar up . I have to low of a blood sugar . I also notice its good for constipation as well . To graphic ? ? Welll at least you know of some beneficial effects of this tea !
2 #### The " most critical " review says : Do not buy for the Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange ! The picture and description is NOT accurate for this product as the shipped package replaces Cranberry Apple and Tangerine Orange with Wild Berry and True Blueberry ! - - - A few years back I bought a box of 6 packages of the Fruit Tea Sampler and it was different . As stated above , they have now replaced two of the flavors with cheaper fare . I looked at the graphic before ordering a few days ago and it said 18 tea bags . I wondered how they could do this . What I got before was 5 flavors , 4 tea bags each . Yes , 5 times 4 = 20 . How did they get 5 flavors and only 18 tea bags ? Well , I found out today when I received the package , the obvious fact being that two of the flavors only have 3 tea bags , being two of the better flavors , Raspberry Zinger and Country Peach Passion . Doh !
4 #### I have tried almost every flavor of Celestial 's holiday teas , and all have been amazing . This one , has a warm " cookie " flavor , with stronger notes leading to the lemony side . I was expecting it to be more of a strong cookie / spice type flavor but On first impression , It reminded me of those lolipops that have the loop instead of the straight stick . Maybe the green one ... lol . I found that this one is best if you steep it a little longer than the recommended 5 minutes . It can be a faint light taste at first , but does get that " warmer " feeling if steeped a bit longer . Overall , it 's a great flavor and tastes great with and without milk . I often force my friends to try all my new teas , and everyone seemed to enjoy this one with no complaints . If you are looking for more of a spice / warm cookie type flavor of tea , I would HIGHLY recommend Celestial 's Gingerbread Spice .
2 #### What I was expecting were individually wrapped tea bags . They come 4 to an envelope , so once you open it the others are exposed to the air . They definitely can not be used in a public setting where no one knows who originally opened it or how long it has been open . I suppose they would be good for batch brewing at home .
5 #### With " peppermint " as the only ingredient , this tea has an outstanding flavor . Nothing weird or unexpected , just pure peppermint tea delight . Tastes very similar to the Peet 's peppermint tea ( not presently sold on Amazon ) that first pulled me in to herbal peppermint tea fandom .
4 #### True to its name , the tea taste like you have real blue berries in your tea . The tea gives off a nice aroma . However , if you let the tea bag set for awhile it will taste very berry , but a little is perfect .
3 #### The tea that I got here was stale . I would not recommend buying this tea here , especially since it ends up costing alot more ( if you have to use twice as much tea ) . Plus you ca n't return it .
4 #### Bought the sampler just to try it and I did like all the flavors . But I was n't blown away by it and I do n't know if I like it enough to get it again anytime soon ( since there 's so many other teas to try ) . But it is good tea and has an antioxidant content . Also it is a nice change if your a constant green tea drinker . Definitely worth a try if your in the super market .
5 #### Best tea I 've ever had , and I 'm no spring chicken . I drank coffee until about 8 years ago . Lately I 've been craving a coffee substitute . Something I could enjoy at home , but that would n't keep me up or give me the coffee jitters . Decaf never really did it for me . But this tea is the best . I probably would have been drinking this instead of coffee years before I gave up coffee if I 'd only known about it . This tea mix will be in my kitchen from now on . And when I travel I will take a few bags with me . In fact I 'm going to put a few in my travel bag right now . Get some , you wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### I love Celestial Teas because they are all natural so I 'm a huge fan . I use this and mix it with Luzianne Sweet Tea over ice to give it a hint of Mint . I 'm from the south and LOVE sweet tea and am very picky about it . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Luzianne - Iced - Tea - Family - Size-48 - Count - Tea - Bags - Pack - of-6 / dp / B002ZOIKMY / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Luzianne Iced Tea , Family Size , 48 - Count Tea Bags ( Pack of 6)</a >
5 #### I drink this Bengal spice tea everyday ! For some reason , it 's very sweet , I thought it has sugar in it but according to rep at Celestial , they said sweetness is coming from natural mix of spices , and there are no sugar added ... I usually leave it in the container for at least half day to get the full flavor of the tea . Having a case of this tea makes me happy !
5 #### The other reviewers can definitely give you more information on this type of tea ; the purpose of my review is just to recommend it . This is hands - down my favorite tea to drink in the evening as I am unwinding . I usually prepare an oversized mug of it with 2 tea bags , a to - taste amount of clover honey , and a packet of sugar in the raw . It 's wonderful ! I also sometimes use the same method with one bag of this tea and one bag of Celestial Seasonings ' Vanilla Tea . That 's also a soothing and relaxing blend . I desperately wanted to find a brand and flavor of tea that I would truly enjoy and after many , many purchases -- this is it ! This comes with my highest recommendations !
5 #### I have been so hooked on my Rishi and Twinings and gourmet coffees in the last couple years , that I pretty much have n't bought Celestial Seasonings teas for a spell . Well , yesterday I went to a birthday " tea party " and I wanted a non - caffeine variety . So I picked this one . HEAVENS ! I had three cups . So lovely . Beautiful deep red color . Really nice aroma . And totally tastes like cherries ( which is a flavor I love ) . I came home and ordered up a 6 - pack on Amazon ( hope it 's not a staler batch , as I 've had issues in the past with ordering tea / food items from Amazon and it being close to " sell by " date ) . This is gon na make crazy good iced tea . I could tell sipping it hot , that this would become my second fave iced tea , displacing the Republic of Tea 's pomegranate one . :D If you like the cherry flavor in foods and beverages , and you like to eschew excessive ( or any ) caffeine , you will want to try this . If you 're afraid of getting a 6 - pack , then just get it at your grocery store , but try it . This is delicious , delicious ! I do wish they 'd spell out the specifics of the ingredients -- like what these " natural flavors " are from . I have a lot of sensitivities , and I worry about the undisclosed . But , I did n't have a reaction at the tea party , so should be okay . :D thumbs up . Enjoy .
5 #### My teenager loves this tea . It only seems to be available during the holidays , so I bought her a case of 6 boxes . She is so happy , and this tea is delicious - makes you feel warm and cozy .
5 #### I have IBS and some days I wake up and just know that I 'll have a hard time eating throughout the day , but when I make a cup of this , by the end of the cup I have my appetite back and I eat regularly the rest of the day . This stuff really does work , better than any medicine I 've tried . It soothes upset stomachs and makes my nausea disappear completely .
5 #### This tea is delicious as an iced tea . It is sweet enough that you do n't need sweetener / sugar added . I do n't like a real sweet tea so it has the perfect amount of slight sweetness and it taste fabulous on a hot summer day or anytime . I prefer it as an iced tea .
5 #### This tea is delicious . We go through box after box and it 's my husband 's most favorite flavor . If you like black cherry , give this a try . Caffeine - free and so comforting . We love it !
5 #### I 've been hooked for 30 years , which says something about the intoxiating blend of Indian spices in this wonderful , versatile tisane . One of the few brews I do n't add sugar to , it 's naturally sweet , making it a fantastic iced tea you can drink all afternoon without worrying about caffeine overload . It 's also a pretty good herbal chai alternative , with classic chai ingredients such as cinnamon , nutmeg , ginger , black pepper and cardamom . Just add a little milk to your cup once it 's done steeping and you 've got a rich treat that feels indulgent , but without all the calories . Now my husband is hooked , so we buy in bulk . Highly recommended .
5 #### It 's tea . I 've always gotten this brand in stores and really like it . So I decided to get them online for much cheaper .
5 #### great Price and great product . Love this tea , it 's very calming and nice and mild , and you ca n't beat the price , considering the grocery store cost .
5 #### Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Herb tea is the best tasting Peppermint tea on the market , bar none . With the holiday meals groaning on the table , it 's very nice to have a box of this Peppermint tea about to sooth overstuffed tummies . I highly recommend it .
5 #### I was never much of a hot beverage drinker until recently . In fact , these are the first tea bag products I have ever tried ! But I must say that the Fruit Sampler is both a great variety and great value . Each of the flavors are distinct and aromatic . I typically combine 1 packet of Splenda , 8 ounces of boiling water and 1 tea bag to a ceramic mug and wait about 5 - 10 minutes for the flavors to seep while the beverage cools . When I reach the bottom of the mug , I often pour in an additional 8 ounces of water and a bit of sweetener and the second cup is equally flavorful ! My pleasant experience with these teas caused me to expand out a bit and try some other flavors and varieties as well ( see my review of&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Celestial - Seasonings - Madagascar - Vanilla - Red - Tea / dp / B000E63LQU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Celestial Seasonings Madagascar Vanilla Red Tea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Celestial - Seasonings - Cinnamon - Apple - Spice - Tea / dp / B000E65OII / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Celestial Seasonings Cinnamon Apple Spice Tea</a > ) . I am especially partial to the blueberry and cherry flavors . These teas lend themselves well to additional little seasoning . For instance , I sometimes add a bit of lemon or orange peel or perhaps a bit of cinnamon or nutmeg to give them a little extra pizzazz . Overall : I 'm very pleased and continue to keep my pantry stocked with these refreshing and flavorful beverages .
5 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Celestial - Seasonings - Mint - Magic - Tea-20 - count - Pack - of6 / dp / B001OHX1HW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Celestial Seasonings Mint Magic Tea , 20 - count ( Pack of6)</a > I have purchased most of the available mint teas on the market plus choose it whenever available in restaurants and have learned that Mint Magic is the best mint tea anywhere , plus it is 100 % caffeine free .
5 #### In the winter , I drink peppermint tea by the gallon - love , love , love it ! I keep a box at work so I can drink it during the day and if I 'm chilly at home , I make a cup of hot tea and nursing the cup warms my hands while the hot tea warms me from the inside . The subscribe and save price makes this very reasonable and now I do n't have to worry about running out of tea as a new box will be delivered regularly , so I 'm really glad I found it .
5 #### Somehow , Roastaroma is not always easy to find in the stores . I was glad to be able to order it here .
5 #### The tea is excellent and buying bulk allowed me to pay a much cheaper price w/o tax AND it was delivered to my door . What more could ask other than to have the UPS guy come in and make the tea for me . I say YES to this purchase if you are considering .
5 #### Love Celestial Seasonings Herbal Teas . This Fruit Sampler , which is a fantastic deal , has some of our favorite flavors : Raspberry Zinger , Country Peach Passion , Wild Berry Zinger , True Blueberry , and Black Cherry Berry . Just as the pix shows , which is what I wanted . Just as a Flavor Warning : the product description lists Raspberry Zinger , Country Peach Passion , Black Cherry Berry , Cranberry Apple Zinger , and Tangerine Orange Zinger . ( two flavors different from what you get ) .
5 #### I drink lots of mint tea in the evening , helps calm my digestion . I 've tried many , and this one 's the best . I always come back to it ; recommended !
3 #### I love the strong scent of this tea and it tingles my throat after I have myself a sip . It could 've have been better if this tea had more sweetness of an apple because it is rather bitter . I 'm not too sure if I would buy this flavour of celestial tea but I certainly enjoyed other ones .
2 #### I bought this with serveral other teas because soda has gotten too expensive . We make tea by the gallon and then put them in the frig . This saves a lot of money as there are 9 people in our household . This tea does have a very nice flavor but you have to hunt for it . All - in - all I will not buy it again because it is just too weak .
4 #### Like peppermint ? Like tea ? Look no more , Celestial Seasonings is here ! This tea is super potent and intense , delivering a powerful mintiness that is n't sweet , and slightly bitter . I use this tea to help settle an upset tummy , which it does do . It soothes it and can help control mild nausea . This is a tea you sip slowly , because it is just too intense to drink fast . Though it is hot , it tends to create a cooling sensation from the mint as it slides down my throat , which is nice . It can help clear sinuses , too ! This tea does not taste like a sweet candy cane , unless you load it up with sweeteners . On its own , which is how I drink it , it is just minty . I like that the only ingredient is peppermint . Nothing else which is fabulous ! Highly recommended .
5 #### I really like this tea I was looking for a Chai Tea that I could drink all the time and ran up on this . Although it tastes nothing like Chai Tea I like this much better it has the taste of something like red hot candies and since that is one of my favorite candies this fits the bill for me . It may take some getting used to for some people I put a little sugar and milk in mine and it 's perfect for me I do n't know if it 's a popular tea with people it does have a unique taste .
3 #### Though the tea itself is good , the buyer pays in two ways for the privelege of having multiple flavors : first , they charge more for this box and then they give 2 flavors in each individual box one less tea bag - this results in a net loss of 24 tea bags overall as there are 6 individual boxes in each large box . I feel that one or the other would have been sufficient , but the two together is just too much to pay for the convenience of having several flavors on hand . However , if you want to get it one time to check out the different flavors to see which you might like to purchase later , then it is a decent deal .
1 #### The serial labels on the boxes says it is dark berry cherry but the box is the green tea raspberry version . It must be replacement for cherry BEWARE .
5 #### I make this tea by the coffee pot full ! I add milk and honey an it makes some of the best chai type tea . Too bad our local grocery stores have stopped carrying it .
5 #### The best decaf herbal -- can even have English - style with milk in it . I order this item on a regular basis and use it daily . So glad Amazon consistently carries it .
5 #### I have been drinking this tea for over 10 years . I make a gallon of this iced almost daily . It is the best thirst quencher on a hot day .... or any day for that matter . I sometimes add 2 bags of Harney & Sons Hot Cinnamon Spice and woooooooooohoooooo baybee ! ! ! If you add any of the H&T cinnamon flavors , you probably wo n't want to add sugar as it naturally sweetens . I LOVE Bengal Spice soooo much , that I recently put it on auto - delivery ... also cheaper to do that here and you get free shipping as well . Most stores charge $ 3.75 per box or more . Good deal Lucille !
5 #### Delicious variety of flavorful fruit teas . Perfect to tuck into a tea - lover 's gift basket ! I also add one or two bags to a pitcher of iced tea for a refreshing flavor change .
3 #### This is a good cold weather tea - BUT very strong on the cinnamon side of the equation ... I was expecting more apple flavor . Most likely wo n't buy again but then I still have plenty left ... will last a long time I 'm guessing .
5 #### I 'd like to mention that I am not a doctor and there are people that have depression / anxiety that can not be solved by using herbal resources . This tea is amazing . It is no overpowering , has a very light tingle of spice ( probably the ginger ) followed by a cool , minty sensation all the way down your throat . I suffer from a lot of stress and anxiety ; this tea gets rid of it all . If it were n't for this tea , I may have became an alcoholic to calm myself down . It is amazing how much this tea can help you if you suffer from stress and anxiety . I drink it in the morning and at night , I find that it really makes the day run a lot smoother for me and I have been referring to this tea as " medicine " since it relieves some anxiety without all the side effects of diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , addiction(I am addicted , but it 's not a drug ! (: , and finally , high blood pressure and weight gain . Day to day stress has always been bad , and this cup of tea always makes it better . I 'd recommend it to the worry - warts , and the people that have small panic attacks from time to time . It surely helps , and the best part is that it tastes delicious !
5 #### I have a friend who loves tea so when I saw this I knew the she would enjoy it . She called me recently and said she really like the tea . the flavors and sampling was very good .
5 #### I like sweet foods and I add at least 2 tablespoons sugar to regular leaf tea , but this is so sweet I do n't need to add sugar . I also do n't add milk because I prefer the strong herbal taste and milk makes it more bland but creamy . For me personally it helps prevent and reduce headaches and stave off appetite . Highly recommended for people who want to reduce sugar in their diet .
5 #### This does not taste artificial . It 's delicious ! Better tasting than most actual pulpy peaches these days . You 'd have to have the tastebuds of a Macho Montana Iguana to not enjoy savoring this tea . I know whereof I speak , having entertained an Irascible Iguana who only deigned to eat raw elk - burger . Then he 'd run around and try to bite the cat 's tail . He grew large and monstrous on elk - burger , but would never eat a peach , or any other foodstuff he was supposed to like , aside from meat . So , go for it . Be an Uniguana and drink your serene peach tea sweetened with&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Splenda - No - Calorie - Sweetener - Granular - Individual - Packets-700 - Count - Box / dp / B000I6JPQQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Splenda No Calorie Sweetener , Granular , Individual Packets , 700 - Count Box</a > . This true peach adds to the fantastic spectrum of Celestial Season 's flavors . PS : The cat was given to a rural artist , grew large and happy , and did not miss the lizard .
5 #### This is very flavorful cheese . Sometimes your not too sure about powdered cheese ( the flavor & texture ) , but this is an exception . It is really great on popcorn & homemade mac & cheese . My family loves it and I 'll definately be purchasing more .
5 #### I could n't find this product anywhere and my 86 year old mother kept talking about the days when she could make cheese popcorn . She has jars of this cheese all over the house now and is happy as a jay - bird in whistling time .
4 #### This tea is good . A nice variety . But to me they all have the same sharp sweet after taste to it . You will hit the fruit taste then after you get an after taste that is the same for all of them . Its not bad if you like it but i am more of a unsweet guy .
4 #### On a cold night , when I want something warm , with no caffeine , Celestial Seasonings True Blueberry herbal tea hits the spot . Wonderful berry flavor . Add a bit of sweetening and it 's the perfect hot drink . It also makes a very good iced tea . I ca n't keep enough of these around the house . This tea is even flavorful enough to drink without sweetening .
5 #### What a delicious , soothing , calming tea that caps off the night perfectly ! Also , if you suffer from stomach problems ( as I do ) this tea tends to help calm it down a bit . It 's worth it . The hint of honey paired with the tranquilizing chamomile is the perfect way to end the night .
5 #### I like Peppermint tea for helping out relieving my headaches and upset stomachs . It seems to work well for me on both . It is very relaxing as well and it taste great .
5 #### My husband and I love this tea - it soothes the stomach and it relaxes you . It tastes good , too . We drink it every night . We have been subscribing to have it sent from Amazon for a long time now and are very pleased with the arrangement .
5 #### This exceptional tea reminds me of running in the Rocky Mountains past fields of peppermint , fragrant in the afternoon sun . We drink this tea by the bushel - load , from morning to night . The flavor is exceptional and consistent , delicious during the summer , or warming you through Winter . Enjoy ! PS : Best accompanied by U.K. mysteries , like&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Midsomer - Murders - The - Early - Cases - Collection / dp / B0011B9W38 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Midsomer Murders : The Early Cases Collection</a > , and buttery biscuits , lots of 'em .
5 #### I saw this in my local Wholefoods and decided to give it a whirl . What a wonderful surprise - full flavoured , spicy , sweet and very satisfying - I have never had another herbal tea that comes close to this one - and even better can have it at any time as there 's not any caffeine in it ( or any calories which defies logic as it has quite a sweet flavour ) . The blend of spices is masterful - although cinnamon is listed as the prime ingredient I would n't say it dominates - the combination of ingredients used in this is a work of art ! ! Very pleased to find it sold in bulk at a good price on Amazon ! ! ! !
5 #### I have in the past maybe partaked of some tea every once and awhile . I always just drank&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Celestial - Seasonings - Herb - Tea - Sleepytime-20 - Count - Tea - Bags - Pack - of-6 / dp / B000E65OF6 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Celestial Seasonings Herb Tea , Sleepytime , 20 - Count Tea Bags ( Pack of 6)</a > , and that was that . My boyfriend brought his love of tea into our place and Now its a daily and nightly ritual . Tea is so much more soothing than say a cup of cocoa or coffee . Less heavy , caffeine free , and natural . We found Tension Tamer amoungst Celestial Seasonings multitude of tea flavors . Who does nt want their tension to be tamed ? Its absolutely the tastiest , relaxing , comforting hot beverage ever . It contains eleuthero ginseng , ginger root , chamomile , peppermint , cinnamon , and lemon . Nothing over powers , everything connects and leaves you content as can be . Seriously just smelling it will make you close your eyes and breath easier .
5 #### This is the best caffeine free tea ever . Since I have started drinking this tea I have not missed drinking regular tea , and I have been a avid tea drinker for years until the caffeine started getting to me . Give this tea a try , you wo n't go back to the regular . Great flavor !
4 #### I jokingly refer to this as " catnip tea " . My cat does n't seem to notice this particular ingredient though - which is a good thing because we 'd have to fight over this wonderful tea . It has a smooth , unique flavor . I do n't know if it " tames " my " tension " but it makes for a lovely cup of tea either way .
5 #### Bought this flavor on a whim ... and I absolutely love it ! It smells divine and tastes wonderful . I could drink cup and after cup of it . Perfect example of what a cup of tea should taste like .
5 #### Bengal Spice by Celestial Seasons is my favorite herbal tea . I drink it in the summer and inhale it in the winter . I love the overwhelming cinnamon taste and I enjoy all the flavors . To get the really full bodied flavor that I like , I only get one cup of tea to the tea bag ; for that reason I have this on subscription so that I will not run out . Great product .
4 #### The tea 's fine but the flavors shown in the item picture and listed in the product description were not the same as received earlier in the week . Cranberry and Tangerine were replaced by Wild Berry and True Blueberry . I called this to Amazon 's attention after receiving mine . Now the photograph appears to have finally been updated but the " Product Features " is still reading : " Includes four bags of Raspberry Zinger , Country Peach Passion , Black Cherry Berry , Cranberry Apple Zinger , and Tangerine Orange Zinger " At least they 're making an effort so this review is based on the tea itself . It 's pretty good but personally I think the flavors of most of the Celestial Seasonings fruit teas I 've tried thus far are somewhat weak unless brewed for a full 5 - 6 minutes . The peach especially benefits from a little extra time , after which it becomes very good and most soothing - more peach pie than fresh peach . The no individual packaging is nice and convenient but , really , would a couple inches of string be that much of a strain on the environment ? Really , really hate having to dig the bag out with a fork .
5 #### It 's a whole lot of powdered cheese . Makes a yummy popcorn topping or goes great in rice dishes .
3 #### My family might mock me , but I like this stuff for making " craparoni & cheese " for myself . ( I make excellent homemade mac&cheese , thus the mocking when I use cheese poweder for my personal consumption . )
5 #### I love this tea - it tastes just EXACTLY like old fashioned black tea ; BUT IT ISN'T ! This is a healthy , caffiene free , herbal tea that does n't keep me awake , does n't give me acid stomach , but gives me real taste satisfaction . This tea is just right !
5 #### Bought these for the office . This is a nice big pack with a good variety . If you 're looking for a nice mix of herbal teas , this is an excellent choice .
3 #### Sort of sweet the way American cheese is sweet
5 #### Great buy ! ! ! This is what they uses to use on the nachos they uses to serve you in middle school for lunch , the same cheese in gas stations and movie theater nachos . I m pretty sure its the same with velveeta mac n cheese . It is great in soup as well .
5 #### This is a wonderful soothing tea . Citrus with a hint of cinnamon . No sweetener needed , great all on it 's own . Very soothing . Caffeine free . One of my favorites !
5 #### I drink a giant mug of this almost nightly . Peppermint is very soothing and relaxing , and it 's great for settling an upset stomach . It 's up there with ginger for homemade remedies . The aroma is too good to resist and the taste is just as good . It 's minty and a little sweet , but not too sweet . It 's much healthier than soda ( barely different from warm water ) , so if you 're trying to break a soda habit this tea is a must . It 's a great thing to drink any time of day . Great for settling out a large meal , relaxing / calming down during a hectic day , and great for unwinding before bed . Celestial Seasonings always has the best teas , and this is no exception . It 's great to find it at such a bargain online .
5 #### Another great tea from Celestial Seasonings . This one has a subtle spicy lemony flavor . Very unique . I have tried many varieties of tea , gourmet , loose leaf , etc . and I keep going back to Celestial Seasonings . All natural , easy to find and very reasonably priced .
2 #### this has a very strange taste , not a blueberry taste at all , at least not concerning my taste buds . Bigelow is much better .
5 #### The cheese powder we were sent was fulfilled by an Amish co - op , and was absolutely terrific . I mean it was really first rate stuff ! Finally we can recreate the cheese grits of yesteryear . Makes great cheese sauce for other dishes too !
5 #### I have fond associations with this tea . It takes me back to some of the fondest days of my youth . It is a tasty blend of orange and spice - what 's more , it is also herbal . This tea tastes best with a teaspoon of honey . Enjoy !
5 #### What can I say ? This tea is delicious and calming .... it is wonderful during any season ! Love it ! :)
5 #### This is awesome , awesome tea . Does not taste like coffee - though I can see how it has a sort of grain - based civil - war coffee stand in appeal to it . My favorite Celestial Seasonings tea was Almond Sunset which they discontinued - it was AWESOME . This tastes someone what Almond Sunset , but without the amaretto tones . I am scared they will discontinue this , though my husband is convinced that will never happen . I think I may buy a few cases just in case . If you loved Almond Sunset , you will like this tea .
2 #### I bought this tea on a whim thinking it would be perfect for this autumn and winter . When I opened the box , the smell was fantastic . I had such high hopes for this tea , but was sorely disappointed . It was much too sweet for me . I was expecting something that was heavily spiced , but it seems like the apple flavor is more prominent . I did n't want it to go to waste , so I experimented , trying different things in hopes that my taste buds would be satisfied . I tried steeping it for a short period of time , making iced tea , adding a splash of milk , adding more cinnamon , etc . Nothing seemed to do it for me . I really wanted to like this tea , because it smells so great , but I guess I 'll be on the look - out for something else .
5 #### This really is a very cherry tea . The cherry flavor is not the fake kind , and it is very noticeable . I brew it together with the Twinings Mixed fruit tea for a superb blend of fruits ; it 's a very well balanced and sophisticated flavor . Try them both !
2 #### Unfortunately not very peachy ! Packaging is great - but taste is n't . Wo n't try again .
4 #### This is a very tasty tea - nice and spicy , plenty of cinnamon and the ginger gives a nice bite , and no caffeine . Every box I 've gotten has been fresh . My gripe however is the lack of strings . The box claims they save 3.5 million pounds ( ! ? ) of landfill waste every year by not using individual wrappers or strings / tags / staples . That seems like an exaggerated claim , and the lack of strings and staples is a real annoyance in my book . It means I always should use / carry a spoon in order to agitate the bags a bit while steeping , and remove them from the hot tea . It 's so annoying I even considered only 3 stars . Mostly I drink tea at the office , and bringing a spoon around with me to meetings is odd , so instead I tend to wait until tea is cooler and use my fingers , which also is odd . Individual wrappers I can do without because I drink frequently enough the tea does n't go stale , but please give me strings and staples .

5 #### I love the flavors of this variety pack It was a good price too with the free shipping
4 #### It 's a good product . I bought it to experiment with making my own cheesy chex mix . Modest success , probably just need to tinker with the recipe some . Good flavor .
5 #### I use it in a chili cheese cornbread I make . Tastes great .
3 #### Taste was ok . Price was a little steep . Found a product that had a more cheese taste at our local Mennonite store and was cheaper .
5 #### I ordered this item about a month ago because it was the most economical option for this peppermint tea . I figured I would have the product for the next 10 years and still not use it all up . BUT I actually tried making iced tea ( three tea bags make a perfect STRONG quart of tea)as someone suggested here . WOW ! It is the MOST refreshing drink I have had in a long time and I have just reordered this item , only having one box of 40 tea bags left . My entire family is addicted to this peppermint iced tea and THAT is a good thing since the only thing in this product is peppermint leaves . TRY IT , it is totally amazing as hot tea and iced tea !
5 #### The best peach flavored tea I have ever found .... thank you Celestial Seasonings for a great taste treat of a hot cup of Country Peach Passion on a cold winter evening or a refreshing glass of ice tea in the summer . Will buy again and again .
1 #### If you like salt , you 'll love this product . If you really like your salt cheese - flavored , you 'll be in heaven .
4 #### This makes a delicious cheese sauce , very similar to kraft . Others who have said it does n't dissolve well maybe just need to add a little more liquid ? I found it dissolves just fine . Also , it DOES reheat much better than the boxed mac n cheese . Really good on popcorn . My main incentive for buying it was that I have recently had to stop eating gluten and the gluten - free mac and cheese kits are so expensive ! It has been really convenient to have on hand with some pre cooked noodles I keep in the fridge for my 2 year old also , who asks for Mac n Cheese almost everyday lately ! My only complaint is that it does have the artificial coloring ... the ones kraft just took out of theirs . Otherwise really happy with this product .
5 #### I performed a side by side comparison to the Kraft powder . No comparison ! ! ! This cheese powder is far superier to the Kraft . The cheesiest . The consistancy is more of a soft flour where as the Kraft is granulated . The flavor of this powdered cheese is richer , tangier , and more robust than Kraft .
5 #### I discovered spiced tea on my vacations to India . Now , I have a way to drink it at home . This is a tea with a real flavor . Not every supermarket carries Bengal Spice and by ordering it from Amazon , not only do I save money , but I am sure to have it .
5 #### This is a very enjoyable tea at a bargain price ; with no shipping charges it 's as cheap as driving 130 miles round trip to Costco . Makes great iced tea , too .
5 #### I have tried - out this fine tea in several ways now . It was great each way -- hot or icy by itself -- or hot or icy added to regular black tea . My primary purpose was to find a good cherry tea to make my own black cherry black tea blend . This black cherry herbal tea does very well for this -- at about one bag of black cherry herbal tea per three bags of regular black tea . It is not as tart as a " zinger " type tea -- rather just spot - on to back the black cherry blend . Celestial Seasonings has fine - tuned this blend of various organic ingredients very well -- to find a mix which is most like a rich tart black cherry tea -- great on its own or in a further mix + + +
5 #### I like the mild flavor of this tea . I first tried it when I was looking for something to help with a bad stomach and acid reflux caused from stress and tension . Then I found that I liked it anytime just for the flavor of it . I like to mix it with the Sleepy Time tea and the Tension Tamer tea as well . The 3 teas mixed together makes a good tea for a cold winter night . I 've found the Chamomile tea is good for when your down sick with the flu and ca nt get anything down and nothing sounds good . I usually use this tea for its medicinal value but its also good as just a beverage .
5 #### Damn , I 'm hooked on this fantastic tea . I usually drink it with 3 - 5 packets of Splenda or Equal , and I 'm up to 4 or 5 cups of it a day . I guess I should be a little worried about my artificial sweetener intake , but I ca n't help it this tea is so darn addictive . I 've tried all of Celestial Seasoninings other herbal offerings and I would list them in this order of preference Blueberry - > Cherry - > Raspberry - > Multiberry - > Peach ( yucky aftertaste on this one ) .
5 #### Everybody in my house loves Cheddar Cheese Popcorn . This is more economic to buy . We pop popcorn add the cheese powder and whala ! Really good and yummy ! (: I 'm sure it can be used for recipes like mac and cheese too .
5 #### Excellent flavor . Compared to Kraft Mac'Cheese powder this is weaker . Use enough and it makes a great meal . You can use it in anything . :)
3 #### I liked being able to get a whole lot of tea in one go , it comes with a lot of tea with some variety . Each type of tea is put in its own cute little package inside the tea box . I am not partial to the flavors . They seem to artificial to me . Without sweetener , they do n't have much flavor , and with sugar they taste a little like kool - aid . The berry flavors were the best , the peach is not palatable . NOTE that the product description on this page is ( currently ) INCORRECT . Go by the picture for the flavors included . A single tea bag could be used for two cups of tea , but was best for only 1 cup , maybe a cup and a half . All in all , convenient package , I like the variety , but only so - so flavors . I would not purchase any of the teas individually , and will not restock my tea cupboard with the sampler . Update 1 - 7 - 11 : I have tried a couple new variety packs , and recommend either this&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Stash - Premium - Green - Tea / dp / B000CQBZRE / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Stash Premium Green Tea</a>&nbsp;variety pack , which has some fruit flavors that are delicious , or this&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Stash - Premium - Herbal - Tea / dp / B000CQID92 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Stash Premium Herbal Tea</a>&nbsp;variety pack which I like much better than the Celestial package .
5 #### It 's a great cold - weather tea . First it 's sweet , then the cinnamon kicks in , finishing with a crisp apple cider flavor . Nothing is overpowering , nothing is awkward . The folks behind this blend did an excellent job . Give it a shot . If you 're a spice hound like myself , give Bengal Spice a try as well . Same company .
5 #### This is the sampler to purchase if you like Celestial Seasonings teas . All of the flavors are terrific , especially the ' zingers ' which are the cream of the crop . Enough for over 100 cups of tea , this will last you quite a while if you just drink them yourself . However , as must everyone knows , tea is best enjoyed with a friend !
4 #### We serve both tea and coffee on Sunday mornings at my church and since we bought this multi - pack we 're serving more tea and less coffee ! I love tea myself , and it 's nice to know that we 're serving something drinkable even if it is inexpensive . The ' zinger ' flavors are the best of the bunch , especially the Wild Berry Zinger which is good enough to make me buy some for my own home . A good assortment at a great price . Well worth buying if you enjoy tea .
5 #### Alright , I 'll admit , I was n't expecting much when I picked this box up off the grocery store shelf for $ 2.34 . I used to drink my favorite loose leaf green teas at night , but when I started working earlier , even the green kept me up . I needed to lose the caffeine . I love spice , so I went with the kitty box here , Bengal Spice . I ca n't believe this is less than 12 cents a cup . Right when you open the pouch you 're overwhelmed with this amazing sweet smell of cinnamon and spice . It only gets better . The whole room ends up smelling like a bakery while you 're steeping it , and it tastes as great as it smells . Now I 've got all my jars of fine loose leaf green teas , and one jar with the kitty box attached to it filled with Bengal Spice tea bags . It has carved out a spot in my collection for years to come . Forget dessert , it 's in the cup .
5 #### I 've been drinking this tea for over a decade . It 's delicious and Celestial does n't waste paper like the other tea bag companies . Most grocery stores carry it . If you really like it , Amazon 's subscribe and save will save you some money .
5 #### What a wonderful selection of fruit - tastic flavors ! ! I love drinking these teas on a cold winter day -- the fruit flavor jolts me back into the warmth of summer , even when the wind is howling and it 's below zero outside . Each fruit selection brings its own unique flavor to the taste sensation -- whether one adds sugar or not -- and of course , in the summmer , they are fantastic as iced teas-- pour the sugar in when it is still hot , for better sweetness distribution . And for the adventurous , why not brew a two - or - three - bag tea , add sugar , then freeze and make granita ? ? ? Yum ! ! !
5 #### I have enjoyed herbal teas for many years . Several years ago my wife and I started to entertain groups in our home . At the first session I decided to offer the guests some tea . Many of the guests liked my tea , so at subsequent meetings I always put on a pot of tea . I offered numerous different teas to my guests until someone gave me a box of Celestial Seasons Black Cherry Berry . Guests raved about this tea . Some of my guests drink it hot , other prefer it cold , but everyone likes it . After some months of constant praise for this tea , I decided to make this my tea of choice when entertaining . Now when I entertain I make several pots of Black Cherry Berry and everyone is happy . Black Cherry Berry has a simple mildly sweet taste . Black Cherry Berry is caffeine free and has zero calories , and no sodium or sugar . The tea has all natural ingredients : such as hibiscus , rosehips , roasted chicory , blackberry leaves , hawthorn , natural black cherry natural flavors . I highly recommend this tea for entertaining guests .
5 #### Blueberries . I could eat blueberries all day . I guess I need to move to Maine just so I 'd be near all those blueberries . This blueberry - flavored tea is mouth - watering and quenching . I put the bags in my water bottle , and the bottle goes in the freezer until ice shards begin to form . Then I can drink it . I even tried this blueberry tea with sparkling seltzer water , and it is really good . The rich blue packaging is also appetizing .
5 #### Bengal Spice tea is rich with cinnamon and a hint of sweetness . I drink it with or without honey- it 's great either way . The aroma is fantastic ! My nine year old daughter likes it too- though she does n't steep her bag so long , as the sharp " spice " can be a bit overwhelming for her if allowed to become strong . I have to add that we love the artwork on this box as well . All the Celestial Seasoning boxes are nice , but this one is exceptionally beautiful .
5 #### I have been a fan of Celestial Seasonings products for many years . I have tried many of Celestial Seasonings teas and this one is one of my favorites . I like this tea both hot and cold . As a hot tea the honey chamomile blends into a very soothing drink . I enjoy honey chamomile on cold evenings or when I have had a hard day . I keep the pot on and have several cups while I relax . As a cold tea it is refreshing yet soothing . It is a great drink to sip during conversations or when reading a good book . This is a healthy product . The tea is caffeine free , contains no sugar or carbohydrates . It is sodium free and has zero calories . Many Celestial Seasonings teas are herbal teas that are free of artificial ingredients . Finally , Celestial Seasonings teas comes in a box of six that is at least $ 2.75 cheaper than in the grocery store . I highly recommend Honey Vanilla Chamomile Tea
3 #### This and the " Hoosier Hill " powered cheddar cheese are about the same
5 #### Talk about the perfect Mac and chese ! This is an awesome deal and we combine it with gluten - free noodles , butter and milk for the perfect doop Mac n ' Cheese . Amazing product !
5 #### This stuff taste great - I note the nutritional info was for 1/4 cup , but I ca n't imagine using that much unless you were making a dish that was for several servings - I 'm very happy with this product
4 #### Cheese powder without the filler . This stuff is n't 100 % the same as Kraft and the like use . They may use this powder but they add fillers , such as corn starch , to thicken and such . So if you 're going to replace this for box Mac and Cheese be aware you might have to add a touch of thickener . Also works great on popcorn , oil popped or air popped it sticks well either way when added to freshly popped popcorn .
5 #### After having a few adominal surgeries I get stomach aches quite often , especially at night . If I 'm awaken with a stomach ache I will brew some peppermint tea which always helps . Unfortunately , it 's not great for my bladder so a couple of hours later I 'm back up but I can then usually get back to sleep again .
5 #### If you love cinnamon red hots , this is it in liquid form . I make iced tea ; it is not for the faint of heart and very unique .
5 #### this is one of the best flavors i 've found in tea . I also buy the strawberry and blueberry , they 're also very good .
4 #### It 's great when buying in bulk that you are able to have such a nicely balanced variety of teas . The price can not be beat and Celestial is a very satisfying tea . I 'm never disappointed .
5 #### This True Blueberry tea has a wonderful fruit flavor and a delicate taste . It is marvelous when used for iced tea . I drink so much I buy it in bulk . Tea lovers everywhere should try this tea . It 's herbal so it does n't have caffeine and wo n't keep you up at night !
4 #### This product is a bit heavy on the cinnamon for me , but my wife likes it- that 's why I gave it 4 stars .
5 #### This is the closest you will get to having an old fashioned cup of tea with no caffeine . It has a great full bodied flavour and it 's gluten free which is also important to me . I have enjoyed this herbal tea for at least 10 years now .
4 #### Celestial Seasonings seems to have cornered the market on good chamomile tea . I 've tried a few others out there -- this one consistently has a fresh , slightly sweet flavor that others lack . Their quality control is obviosuly good ; I 've never had a cup of this tea that was rancid or flat .
5 #### I use this to make cheese sauce to have with with my gluten free noodles or spaghetti squash .
2 #### Just barely OK . Really salty . Not at all like the Kraft style ' Mac & Cheese ' flavor .
5 #### This is a wonderful , soothing tea that just helps you to remember the important things . Stopping to make a cup , smelling the soothing scents , breathing in the steam , all help you to get back to the task at hand with a more relaxed mind ! Also , the packaging , pricing and shipping are exemplary as usual . Can not always find this one on my local grocery shelves .
5 #### Black cherry is one of my favorite flavors and scents . I love tea , so put the two together , and the result is outstanding . This tea has a dry , bitter ( in a good way ) cherry flavor , but also sweet and a hint of berries . The flavor is perfect . This herbal tea has no caffiene . I do n't even bother to boil it ; I simply put it in my water bottle with water , and then put the bottle in the freezer , and in not too long , I have cold , refreshing tea . Black cherry brings back childhood memories . It has always been one of my favorite flavor / scents . It is one of those flavors / scents that reminds me of the smell of wood and Grandpa 's house .
5 #### I love tea . I love peach . Peach is one of my favorite flavors , and probably my very favorite tea flavor . This tea is just awesome . It has the mouth - watering taste of peach . I look forward to fresh peaches every summer , because that 's the only time of year I can get them . Fortunately , I can have peach tea all year . And not only is peach my favorite flavor of tea , but there are certain things ( and certain flavors ) that just go together . For example , cornbread and iced tea ; fresh - cooked tomatoes and pasta ; Italian bread sticks and homemade minestrone soup ; and tea and peach . The tea flavor and the peach flavor blend together perfectly for that heavenly taste .
5 #### I love tea . There are lots of flavored teas , but the only flavored ones I really like are the fruit ones . Therefore , this box of tea is what I buy . So many variety packs have at least one or two flavors that I do n't like . But this box has only has flavors that I do like . My favorite is the peach , and then the black cherry . Next is orange , raspberry , and cranberry apple . I love this particular tea . It is perfect because of all the lovely flavors . They are all rich and fruity - the perfect amount of flavor . Like I said earlier , the peach is my favorite flavor . I am a peach person - I love fresh peaches , but can only get them in the summer . Peach tea is heavenly . The other flavors are awesome , too .
5 #### This tea is absolutely amazing . It smells great , and more importantly it tastes great -- hot or iced , sweetened or not . I drink a ton of iced tea , and this has quickly become one of my favorites .
5 #### This is a delicious herb tea , with a mild yet distinct cherry and berry flavor , just right for iced tea . I often combine this with Chai .
5 #### This is a delicious herb tea , with a mild yet distinct blueberry flavor , just right for iced tea .
5 #### This is a delicious herb tea , with a distinct yet mild peach flavor , great for iced tea .
4 #### I purchased this for my Hubby . It 's another great tea by Celestial Seasonings . He also loves a good cup of tea . Thanks Celestial Seasonings and Amazon
5 #### I love the umami flavor of this powder . I avoid salt , and even though this is salty , it is n't as salty as table salt , and I do n't use as much of it because the cheese gives it a flavor boost .
5 #### Delicious ! A cheaper way to make homemade mac and cheese ! Or any type of casserole .
4 #### Very creamy - not a strong cheddar taste - mild and less salty than most , but great for certain recipes and diets .
4 #### I guess I grew accustomed to drinking Yogi Teas that are individually wrapped . They tend to hold their flavor longer . The strength of this tea weakened with every day after opening , but initially this tea has a very robust flavor !
5 #### My husband loves this tea which is n't always available at the local grocer . The fact that the Amazon subscribe & save program brings it to our door at regular intervals just makes life easy .
5 #### I go through a lot of Celestial Seasonings teas making iced tea . The Blueberry is especially good combined with the red zinger . The price is fair when set up on autoship with free shipping , no sales tax and an added discount .
3 #### Chaomomille tea is always my drink of choice at the end of the day because of its calming effects that last well into the night and next day . While at the grocery store , I saw the tension tamer and thought I would give it a try . I use 3 tea bags in the pot , so after one cup of the tea I am pretty much super relaxed and through for the night . The tea tastes alright , but the combination with the peppermint makes it taste funny . Fortunately , I do n't drink calming teas for the taste so it does n't bother me . Also , I use Splenda in the tea after it is through boiling so it tastes bearable .
5 #### I LOVE this tea ! When I first tried it , I mixed it in my regular blend of white , green , black and some kind of flavored herbal tea and brewed it for iced tea .... hated it ! ! eeewwww ! ( love berry zinger and mandarin orange etc ) ... however I thought I 'd take a box down to my mother - in - law and see if she enjoyed it ... stuck with nothing to drink I took a few bags and threw it in my 32 ounce travel mug and let it sit at room temperature till I remembered it ... sweetened it with a bit of sweet - n - low and FELL IN LOVE ! ! I felt like a kid again enjoying my icey cold Choo Choo Cherry ( boy , does that date me ) on the back porch ! It 's cherry without the cough syrup back taste - I have no idea how it tastes brewed as hot tea , but throw this in a pitcher of water ( 1 bag per 8 oz ) leave it in the fridge over night and you will have a delicious iced beverage ! ( I leave the tea bags in till it 's gone , the flavor just gets more intense) ... love it- just ordered six more boxes ! woo hoo ! ! I do the same thing with the True Blueberry - since they left me without the cold brew Blueberry Tea ... oh the humanity - bring it back , Celestial Seasonings !
4 #### I purchased this as a flavor enhancer for my backpacking meals - both the ones that I purchase and the ones I make myself . I 've added to a few meals so far but only a small amount so I ca n't really comment as to the flavor . But it 's cheddar right ? ? ? ! ! ! It has to be great ! haha I 'm sure I 'll find out sooner or later and add the review to www.letsgohikeit.com
5 #### Forget about buying the single portions of mac and cheese , this does the job using any kind of pasta ! ! Awesome flavor also to sprinkle on anything !
5 #### I tasted it as I was putting it in a jar . It tasted good and I know I will be happy with it . Thank you
5 #### ... I recommend that you try this tea . I admit that I used to drink this tea , I then tried another tea , which also has a very strong cinnamon flavor , and then I decided to try this one again . I did not know how good I had it . I am so happy that I came back to this tea . It is without a doubt a winner .
5 #### ... you will enjoy this tea . I also recommend Bengal Spice . It is very tasty too .
5 #### I received a sample of this tea from FatWallet & have been addicted for over two years now . My pantry is full of every flavor they make but this is by far the best . WOW -- the best part of my day is getting up & curling up for " Tea Time " with my dog . Life is good ! ! ! You must make it the English way with a touch of milk & honey . Chai just means adding lots of milk & sweetner to it for that smooth taste .
1 #### Garbage . The product we got was not made by Barry Farm and was full of ingredients that Barry Farm does n't list on their product website . Buyer beware ! This product has hydrogenated oils and several other food - like - products . We bought it to compare to some more expensive and natural dried cheese powder products , but due to the terrible ingredients we did not eat this one .
3 #### Iy arrive threee days early . It lack the zest I expected and needed to be doctored . It did not adhere to the popcorn . Never - the - less It allowed me to use healthier vegetables instead of processed and enriched foods .
5 #### Springtime in Central Texas signals a turn towards lighter and more refreshing flavors of tea , especially for those of us who drink gallons of the stuff iced . True Blueberry is a staple around our house during the spring and summer months . It 's been difficult to find at our local grocery store , and I was glad to see it back on the shelf . Buying the " six - pack " that Amazon is offering here is a good option for those of us who will probably make it often over the course of the next few months . The Celestial Seasonings brand is a virtual guarantee of quality and freshness . They rarely miss the mark with a flavor , and the True Blueberry is one of their best . Sweeten it just right and you get a delicious tea that goes down smooth and smart on a hot afternooon or a cool , breezy evening . Most excellent all the way around . I 've never bothered to try it hot . This flavor just SCREAMS ice tea , and that 's exactly how I recommend that you drink it . Try brewing it as a sun tea , ot just leave a few bags in a pitcher in your fridge for a few hours . It 's worth the wait , guaranteed .
5 #### I love this tea . It does n't have to steep long to get the flavor . Powerful and good .
5 #### " It may drive your cat crazy . But if you use it , it will probably have just the opposite effect on you . Catnip is a calming , safe , and mild sedative . " ~ pg . 36 of God 's Healing Herbs by Dennis Ellingson Celestial Seasonings has a few wellness teas for soothing your soul . Tension Tamer Extra has a lemony herbal flavor . Peppermint , cinnamon , lemongrass , lemon flavor , ginger root , licorice , vitamin C , B6 , B12 , Eleuthero , Chamomile , Tilia estrella , lemon verbena , catnip and roasted chicory make this earthy and lemony with calming power . Licorice is believed to have stress reducing properties and lemongrass makes this a lemony herb tea . Eleuthero , also known as " Siberian Ginseng " is a stress reliever but can also help improve concentration . This tea is not for children or for anyone with heart problems or high blood pressure . Tension Tamer Extra seems to have two effects , first it calms you down emotionally and then it wakes you up intellectually . This tea might be good to drink in the evening if you want to feel peaceful , but you are not quite ready to fall asleep . I find it clears my head and helps me to focus . ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### Celstial Seasonings makes a wide variety of excellent teas , of which Bengal Spice is my favorite . Naturally caffeine free - it contains no tea leaves but rather is totally herbal - I like it with milk and a bit of sugar . It is very aromatic and very much like a true India " Chai " tea . We serve it often to friends who all love it too . Ingredients are cinnamon , roasted chicory and carob , natural spice and vanilla flavor , ginger , cardamom , black pepper , cloves and nutmeg . Wow ! ! It is especially convenient to purchase from Amazon , as I typically find it hard to find in local - even large - supermarkets .
5 #### I like to mix it with one regular black tea bag per three caffeine free tea bags for a much lower caffeine great tasting ice tea . If I make a second batch in one day I 'll use the caffeine free tea bags straight . Either way , great tasting refreshment after sweaty chores . I 'm very glad I found this BEFORE summer ! !
5 #### I love ginger , I make ginger tea by grating fresh frozen ginger root into a pot of tea and steeping . I bought this tea after reading some reviews and because I love ginger ... and now .... I love this tea . The other reviewer is right - this tea is delicious . I 'm sure the aroma of baking gingerbread and warm cinnamon help , but it does n't need sugar and it 's fantastic ! I 've had it both with and without milk and it 's delicious either way . I highly recommend this tea - just do n't buy it all ! :D ( and I 'm not a huge herbal tea fan )
5 #### it 's good ! mmm ! great on popcorn , ca n't wait to try on mac n cheese
5 #### This is a very good version of Indian chai , a mixture of black tea and various spices . The exact balance of spices in all versions of chai will vary of course . This version is sort of in between the Northern Indian version and the Pakistani version . It has more of a butterscotch sweetness to it and is less likely to give you digestive trouble .
5 #### I have been drinking Bengal Spice for thirty years . It is hard to find Bengal Spice in the grocery stores , so I was thrilled to see it here on Amazon . Bengal Spice has concentrated spices in it , which give it a warm , sweet flavor and is highly aromatic . I have put a bag to " brew " in warm applesauce which gives the applesauce a great flavor .
5 #### So far of all this brand 's teas I 've consumed , this is my favorite . It has a very fruity flavor , and when sweetened , it is like adult Koolaid or something even better than that . If you like fruit flavored tea , you will like this tea .
4 #### I 'm not usually a Celestial Seasonings fan . I find many of their offerings decidedly below par . But Bengal Spice is actually pretty good . It 's perfect for cinnamon fans , as that is undoubtedly the boldest taste in this blend . And it 's true that you do n't need to sweeten it ; the cinnamon takes care of that itself . In terms of strength it 's nice and bold . The vanilla smoothes everything out though ... it 's not too strong , unless you let the bag steep for an inordinately long time . But Bengal Spice does have one notable weakness .... for those looking for a great chai , you might be disappointed . Because while it 's strong and has a nice flavor , the ginger , cardamom , nutmeg etc . is hardly noticeable , masked by the strength of the cinnamon . It 's a shame , because this blend is definitely better - tasting than some , such as Yogi 's classic India Spice . If the other " chai spices " in this blend had been stronger , this would be a 5 - star tea .
5 #### This is an excellent product , both tastey and priced right . It 's difficult to find this product in regular local grocery stores , so I was thrilled to find it .
5 #### This is an excellent product , both tastey and priced right . It 's difficult to find this product in regular local grocery stores , so I was thrilled to find it .
5 #### I really like this cheese poder . It 's great for mac n cheese but I also put about 1/2 Cup in a big pot of stew and my guys do n't know what I put in it but they think I make the best stew ever !
5 #### This is exactly what I was looking for : Orange cheese powder from childhood . If you crave that childhood taste , this is it . Mac and cheese .
5 #### This tea provides a luscious and refreshing break from your daily grind and helps you relax as well . It 's got a great cherry taste to it that is not overpowering with just a hint of berry flavor thrown in for good measure . Let it steep about three minutes and you 're bound to enjoy it as much as I do ! Each bag contains all - natural ingredients ; and there are no artificial ingredients . The stringless tea bags can easily be removed from your cup whenever you want just by using a spoon or anything similar to get them out of the cup . Stir the tea bag around and up and down a bit while it 's in your cup before you drink it . The tea is also caffeine free , which is a plus for those of us who do n't want caffeine in our diets . That is something I always prefer . If you like a cherry flavored tea with a slight berry twist to it , I highly recommend this tea ! Enjoy !
5 #### We all know this tea . Its great . This is a great way to buy it too , in bulk . Makes a person more mellow . Peace .
4 #### We bought in the past to replace a cheese sauce powder we bought for years .. but this is not it . However we 've found we like it for other things and so use it in a mexican macaroni bake and other sauces too . But have gone back to the other cheese sauce for the Kraft mac and cheese kind of quick meals we like but prefer to make up rather than buy it in the pre - boxed package . We always add real chedder cheese and never use the American processed stuff . Too much salt . Also this is good for camping meals at times too . Lots of uses if you are an open minded and creative cook . Not as yellow or make that as orange as a similar brand but it 's pretty much identical in use and flavor . Both sold here on Amazon both in similar fashion .
4 #### I used this for a recipe , seems to work just fine .
3 #### Ok for homemade mac and cheese . Not so good for popcorn .
4 #### I absolutely love this tea . I have to watch my sugar , with this tea I do n't even miss the sugar . It tastes good all by itself .
4 #### I loved the smell of this tea but found the taste to be a bit to sickly sweet for me . I use little , if any , sweeteners in teas , so the sweet taste of this put me off ! I have a friend who loves the sweetness , so this is going to be a matter of personal preference !
5 #### Chamomile tea has to be my favorite herbal tea . I like it iced in the summer and hot in the winter . Some people do not like the mild flavor but it taste good to me .
5 #### This tea taste better iced than it does warm . I add stevia to it and it taste really good .
5 #### This is my favorite tea of the Celestial Seasonings makers ! It is a light refreshing herbal tea and it tastes perfect hot or cold . I have trouble with many teas on the market because they have so many things blended together and I take medications for high blood pressure and cholesterol . I also have some trouble with headaches and upset stomach and a warm cup of this tea at bedtime with a little bit of honey is my " cup of tea " !
4 #### As I believe other viewers have noted , this is a real salt bomb . It 's SUPER salty on its own . So far , I 've used it to augment cheese sauces , and you have to be really careful not to end up with an overly salty sauce . I intend to try baking with it as well , but I 'm concerned about how salty things might end up . Ultimately it depends what you 're using this for . If you 're trying to add it to cheese sauces , it works very well , just watch the starting salt levels . I 'll update once I 've tried baking .
5 #### I drink a lot of tea and I 've tried many different brands and flavors . This is one of my most favorite teas . My only complaint is that the wonderful spice flavor it 's quite strong enough for me . I love the smell of the spices ; the cinnamon , cloves and other spices . The blend between the apple flavor and cinnamon and spices is about equal ; no one over powers the others . Other brands I 've tried are way more apple or no apple at all ( depending on the brand ) but none I 've tried have the blend of spices , which I love in this tea . I really think liking the flavor of a tea is personal preference , but If you 're a tea drinker I think this one is worth a try .
5 #### I love black tea , but no longer drink gallons of it day and night , because of the caffeine . This tea is the only caffeine - free tea that can come anywhere close to passing for real tea . It 's not as wonderful as real tea , but compared to the herbal drek that most people consume , it 's heaven . It 's an herbal formulation , but it contains " tea essence " as an ingredient . I let it steep a long time . Sometimes I put in a splash of milk or cream . I take the bags with me on trips . It 's not so easy to find , and I 've always snatched up all the boxes I could get my hands on ( when I could find it in Whole Foods , for example ) , so buying it in bulk on Amazon is great !
5 #### This tea is herbal , but tastes like a smooth regular tea . Makes great hot tea or cold tea . I especially like it hot with a teaspoon of honey - mmm delicious . It also seems to be a natural diuretic , so especially nice when you feel like you 've got a little extra fluid . Do n't drink it right before bed , or you 'll be getting up during the night . This is my favorite tea .
5 #### This tea is such a treat ( especially as a crisp minty companion to chocolate ) . Offers the taste of premium tea without the extra price . Thank you , Celestial Seasonings ; I owe you this 5 - star review .
5 #### I love this peppermint tea , by Celestial Seasonings , so much . It 's great as an iced tea or brewed hot . I 've also noticed that when I have a stomach ache or a sore throat , this really helps me soothe my pain . This is great tea to have around when company is coming and ideal when served with cookies or a nice slice of cake .
5 #### It is excellent on popcorn and it was purchased for nachos . thanks
2 #### My rating is unfavorable conditionally : Years ago Kraft packaged a dried cheddar in a gold metallic foil - wrapped shaker tube ; Safeway and other stores carried it , they may have called it Kraft American Cheese . At one time the same product was in the same size shaker under Kraft 's but the container was blue . Our family used this as an add - on topping for popcorn until Kraft stopped making it ; I do n't know why . Once before I bought this bulk from Amazon and used it for the topping we used the Kraft American and it worked out . This time I find the cheese is unimaginably salty , it could not be applied to popcorn , even unsalted popcorn that was coated using unsalted butter . The salt content of this cheese is just off the charts . Well , no one I know of claimed this to be the same as Kraft 's American Cheese or suitable as a popcorn topping ; so no harm no foul between me and certainly Nots [ with the ] Barry Farm . This cheese is probably meant to be used in a casserole with noodles , milk and other ingredients that it is complimentary and diluted with . I 'm going to give it to my daughter who feeds the grandkids " mac and cheese " and she can use this in that and in other recipes that the cheese can be a part of .
5 #### I had been buying this tea sampler box from my local grocery store and paying a lot more than this offer on Amazon . I love the selection of different fruit teas , I enjoy them in the afternoon and evening when I am trying to limit my caffeine intake ( they are non - caffeinated ) and having the individual flavors in separate packets allows me to carry a selection with me when I travel or to the office . Price is very good - Amazon is the only place I buy these now .
5 #### This is excellent tea ! ! Real blueberry flavor but without the caffeine ! ! ! I really like tea in the winter and was suprised when even my kids loved this tea . My 5 year old thought I was making muffins when he smelled it steeping . He tried it and then the rest of the kids had to try it . I now order it here in bulk ! !
5 #### I can drink this tea all day , every day . Does n't need sweetening . Best herb tea I 've found !
5 #### Much better than the teas Celestial labels as chai teas . I use two bags of Bengal Spice to one black tea bag , add a packet of Splenda and a dash of milk and have a wonder rich chai tea .
5 #### Love this stuff . Makes popcorn taste out of this world
5 #### This tea is one of my favorites . The flavor is very cherry , and the longer you brew it the better it tastes . I prefer it unsweetened , and even without sugar it has turned me from my Shasta Diet Black Cherry soda addition . We recently got one of those instant hot water dispensers installed in our kitchen , which has reawakened my love of tea . This is definitely one to be tried and will be a good addition to anyone 's tea choices . This is still one of my favorite teas . One of my favorite desserts is a pot of this tea to sip while nibbling on a couple pieces of dark dark chocolate . Tastes like eating a chocolate covered cherry ... yummmmm
3 #### I usually use the fruit teas for ice tea , and even when I used 4 flavored tea bags with 4 plain tea bags , it still seemed too strong of a fake , fruity flavor . The only flavor I would buy again individually is Black Cherry Berry .
4 #### The product was a good consistency and had good flavor . It is harder to make cheese popcorn than I thought . I probably would not attempt to make cheese corn again , but would buy this again to make a cheese sauce or soup more cheesy .
4 #### This was very much like the package powder you get with a box of mac and cheese . Far superior I thought to other cheese powders out there . You did n't have to use that much either to make the flavor of it noticible . Would buy it again !
5 #### I have a cup of peppermint tea most mornings and this is what I buy every time . It has the best , cleanest taste for this type of tea . No caffeine as it 's just pure peppermint leaves . Quality product .
5 #### even just the smell of this when its brewing has a calming effect it is sweet and yummy . it has no caffiene naturally but does not make you sleepy
5 #### B"H A while back , Celestial Seasonings discontinued my favorite tea , Strawberry Kiwi . Since I drink mostly Celestial Seasonings iced herbal teas ( which I make with stevia since I 'm diabetic and holistic ) I did n't know what to do but I found two flavors that work very well together -- True Blueberry and Moroccan Pomegranate Red . I used two bags of each , sweetened to taste , in each half gallon of water .
4 #### This tea is the closet to real tea you can get with out extra caffiene of regular tea . I mix 4 bags of this tea with 3 bags of organic black tea , and 3 bags of organic green tea . It makes a more healthy tea plus taste great .
5 #### Seasonings / Spices / Herbs are so expensive in the stores . I have started ordering almost all of mine in bulk online . GREAT VALUE .
5 #### Once again , the bulk spices from Frontier ( this time Thyme ) are of an exceptional quality , very well packed and at a tremendous savings over just about anywhere else . You may not use 2 pounds of Thyme in years , BUT , the savings is worth putting one pound in air - tight storage and leave the other pound in the foil pouch til you need it . Why pay absurd prices for spices in tiny little plastic jars at the market when you can have a lot around for 1/8th the price per ounce and it is likely much fresher than what makes it to the store . I 've been using Frontier dried spices ( both regular and organic ) for years now and I am beyond satisfied . Highly recommend !
5 #### Every bit as good as what you buy in the grocery store , but only a fraction of the cost . If you can can split the order with a friend , the deal is even better . This is a lot thyme !
5 #### I bought this thyme because I had already purchased the Frontier rosemary and had an excellent experience . Its price was less than I 'd pay for 1/10 the amount from other companies , yet it has the same quality . I keep what I need for a short while in a spice jar , and store the rest in an air - tight bag in the freezer , where it keeps perfectly . I 'm not sure what makes this so much less expensive than other brands ( less packaging ? bulk quantity ? ) , but I 'm really glad I tried it !
5 #### We all have stressful days and upset stomachs . I reccomend this tea for comforting your tummy .
5 #### This is Celestial Seasonings at their best - a plump bag of fresh tasty peppermint leaf , which brews up to a clean delicious cup of tea ! Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet , clean taste . Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine . It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea . Peppermint combats flatulence , promotes bile flow and digestive juices , and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion . It is supposed to relieve anxiety and tension , soothe headaches and calm symptoms associated with the menstrual cycle . Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging : they utilize 100 % natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they do n't package each tea bag individually . Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it . It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag . The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface . Quote from the box : " Beauty is not in the face ; beauty is a light in the heart . " Kahlil Gibran
5 #### Tastes like the old blue box mac and cheese powder . And has the same crazy glowing orange color ! Great on popcorn , making mac and cheese , queso dips , etc .
5 #### We use a lot of this and so we appreciate finding this herb in this volume of a bag . tyvm
5 #### Better price than in the store and lasts a long time ! Tastes and smells wonderful !
5 #### Excellent product . Using it to steep a tea to add to the chicken water .
5 #### Great product very fresh . Suggest vacuum sealing in portions , since it contains between 6 - 7 cups total .
4 #### This powder is for popcorn or for creating that familiar blue box color when making homemade macaroni and cheese . It 's flavor is acidically cheese - LIKE , as opposed to cheesy . For the latter , Cabot 's cheddar powder shaker , in supermarkets , is much better . Combining the two makes an extra - good popcorn topping .
5 #### Unlike a piece of cheese that eventually dries up if you do n't use it , this seems to last forever . Mix a little in mayonnaise for sandwiches and salad dressing . Mix up a little to dab on vegetables and potatoes . When you need cheese flavor you can have a teaspoon or a cup . I put it in an airtight jar in the cupboard .
4 #### I like this thyme . It smells good and does n't have stems in it .
5 #### Quality product at a great bulk price . It arrived promptly in good condition .
5 #### I have bought a number of Frontier spices , and have been very happy with all of them . This one is another that has more than met my expectations . Most of the spices bought from the store are much more expensive , and there is very little fragrance . Not so with this one . Granted buying is bulk supplies enough to last for a very long time , but I put small amounts in jars for daily use and freeze the rest . Freezing keeps the spice fresh for much longer , and buying in bulk is much more economical . In addition , the quality of spices from Frontier is so much better than anything you can buy in the store .
5 #### This stuff is great for making a tastier box - style mac . My recipe : prep 6 oz of your preferred macaroni , add 1/2 a stick of butter , 1/3 cup ( 45 g ) of cheese powder , and 1/4 cup of milk .
4 #### Ever wish that the packet of cheesy sauce in your box dinner or quick noodle dinner was larger ? Two extra tablespoons of Barry Farm Cheddar Cheese Powder will supply that added flavorful kick that you 've been craving . Enjoy !
5 #### This product is great for making a cheddar cheese sauce , smooth as silk ! If you enjoy mac & cheese , or broccoli or spinach with a cheddar cheese sauce , this product is excellent . Great on popcorn too !
5 #### I purchased this mainly for use on popcorn - tastes great have n't tried yet for macaroni or other foods will update if I do so .
5 #### Cheese in snortable form is too dangerous to be legal . I kid of course , but super tempted . Overwhelmed by just how this powder can carry the exact taste of mac & cheese to anything you put it on . The possibilities are endless . And the calories , 49 for 1/4 cup , sooo much better than the amount of cheese I otherwise would have needed to acquire this much flavor . Have n't tried a bath in it yet but tempted to . ( I kinda love cheese . It 's my kryptonite ) .
5 #### I 'm avoiding wheat so using rice macaroni for macaroni & cheese ... I just melted butter , added the cooked macaroni , added milk , then scattered the cheese powder over the mixture just like macaroni & cheese that comes in the box ; the powdered cheese melted into a sauce with the milk and butter so now I can have macaroni and cheese ... aaah ! So much regular cheese these days melts into stringy goop , this stuff is great to have around for cheesy sauces .
3 #### The ones you have from Hoosier Hill Farms are much better . This one tends to clump up too much . It is a pain in the but having to keep breaking up the hard clumps before I can sprinkle it on my spaghetti . It taste good , it just clumps too much .
2 #### Contains whey , hydrogenated oil(s ) , and a long list of non - cheese ingredients . This is not " cheese powder " it 's " cheese - flavored powder " but even that is arguable it seems .
5 #### We have been buying this cheese now for a while : great for food addition this is simply yum ! In soups and popcorn everyone enjoys it .
5 #### I bought two of these , a small one and this one . They are a must have for the prepared minded person . Add some to any dish to add wonderful cheesiness without grating or making a mess . Very easy to use and has awesome flavor .
3 #### Packaging could be more compact and there are no instructions for use . I am new to powdered dried foods and not sure how to re constitute ..
5 #### Make your own mac & cheese , and can use in casseroles and breads , great to have on hand for emergencies
4 #### I mix this with milk or water plus a little butter ( or oil ) and heat it up to create a sauce for pasta . Using your cooking creativity , I 'm sure you can come up with other uses for this flavorful cheese powder .
5 #### It arrived earlier than estimated time of arrival . It looks exactly as what 's in the picture and qualiy is great !
5 #### And also makes nice macaroni and cheese , too . It has no glutens , sugars , soy , or yeasts as preservatives or flavor enhancers , either , so I can actually have it ( does happy dance ! ) The price is pretty good too ( I did some shopping around to compare before I bought it ) .
5 #### i was a bit skeptical at first but it 's a wonderful addition to eggs , chowders , anyplace you want a cheesy flavor that tastes like cheese and not a chemical . plus it is not salty . it 's a true cheese flavor . this is a must have in my kitchen . just adding this : you can mix it with a buttery spread for a new twist on garlic bread , bake it in the oven for a few minutes , bread wrapped in foil at 350 . my company could not get enough . i 'm sure i 'll come up with more uses . stay tuned .
4 #### This tastes like Kraft 's mac & cheese . If you buy this and some elbow macaroni , you 'll have the world fooled into thinking your dish came from a blue cardboard box . But hey , I enjoy boxed mac & cheese , and I enjoy using this cheese powder with other types of noodles to make shells & cheese or linguine & cheese . Perhaps I could even mix it into a white sauce and make nacho cheese . But the further away I went from mac & cheese , the less enjoyable I found this powdered solution to be . For example , I tried using it to make my favorite broccoli cheese soup , and the results were so disappointing I did n't even eat all of it . This definitely can not replace regular cheddar , but it sure can make a quick and easy , cheesy meal .
1 #### I bought this for popcorn after reading all the reviews . To keep it short here , it 's way too salty , so you have to use just a little , then you ca n't taste it because all you can taste is salt . Then there 's that super artificial bright orange color which is not at all close to the color of most cheddar cheeses . Too artificial looking . To sum it up , I do not recommend this for anything . Ca n't imagine putting on pasta for mac & cheese ! Way too salty ! Ick ! I will continue my search for cheese powder .
5 #### I use this to make my vape juice , and it awesome . Really good flavor .
1 #### Tasted like s * * * and will never buy from this vendor again .
2 #### We eat a lot of popcorn . I mean a lot . We buy it in 50 # bags - just the two of us ; the wife an I. I like flavors on my popcorn , and use garlic butter , Parmesan cheese , and other flavors . This cheese powder seemed like just the thing for a great flavoring on my popcorn . But , I was wrong . I tried it once . The bag is still clipped shut in the cupboard . The texture was gritty , and more stuck to the bowl than the popcorn . The color is more intense than the flavor . I did n't find it to be that cheese flavored popcorn I imagined . I told my wife to use it up in other dishes that could use a bit more cheese , but I do n't think she is too thrilled to try it again . Live and learn .
4 #### This powdered cheese is very flavorful and rich a little goes a long way . Made a thin paste for drizzling on steamed veggies and it was really quite good . Stirred a couple tablespoons into sour cream for my baked potato - absolutely divine ! So convenient to use it makes you want to try new recipes . Cheesy cheddar mashed veggies ? Yes please ! Cheesy scrambled eggs ? Next on my list ! I did deduct a star because I think the artificial color is wayyyy overdone . This is real cheddar cheese without fillers , but the artificial colors make it look fake and unappetizing . I guess I understand they 're going for that " mac n cheese " look with this powder , but honestly , I think it would be more appealing if it were n't fluorescent orange . Maybe with just a touch of anatto to give it a warm tint , or even leave the coloring out altogether and market it as " white cheddar " . The bright orange just looks ... odd , especially on dark green vegetables . If the color does n't bother you one bit , think of this as a five star product rating !
5 #### This is the best powdered cheese we have found so far and we just ordered some more . I have n't made any sauces out of it as we only use it to make tacos like one of our favorite taco joints here in KC . Nice sharp flavor . The bag looks small when you receive it but there is quite a bit in that little bag . Edit to add to my original review - We absolutely love this cheddar cheese powder ! Since Jan 2012 we have ordered 7 bags from this company . Sometimes the color is lighter or darker than the previous batch but it always tastes the same . It is strong and delicious . It does n't take much to flavor something and is excellent for making mac & cheese . We mostly use ours on tacos though . There is a taco place that my husband and I have been going to since we were both kids and they use powdered cheese on their tacos . For the last 4 years ( ever since we found this here on Amazon ) that is how we 've been doing our tacos at home . We both like a lot of the cheese on ours so we put as much on as we want and enjoy them so much ! Even though we do use a lot , a pound goes a long way . Unless this company stops making it , we will always order Barry Farm .
4 #### I tried both this product and ' Hoosier Hill Farm Cheddar Cheese Powder ' . Both are very similar with a very slight nod to Hoosier Hill Farm 's for better flavor ( IMHO ) . The products do not have a strong cheesy and are a little more salty than I would like , however it is powder cheese after all . I tried both water and milk in the preparation , and not surprisingly , milk yields a more favorable result . As a standalone cheese sauce it OK but not great , however I find it works well as a flavored binder or thickening agent with marinara or spaghetti sauce . The long shelf life ( if stored correctly ) makes it a nice product to have around , Ill buy more . Preparation : Like most powdered food stuff , mixing the product takes a little care to avoid a lumpy result . Its best to the powder in a small cup , add a little HOT liquid , and fold together with a spoon to form a thick paste . Continue adding small amounts of liquid at a time until the past becomes a thick liquid consistency , and then the remaining liquid can be added .
5 #### I use this as an ingredient in my dehydrated meals I prepare for backpacking . When it hits the food , it becomes this delicious gooey coating that is great on pasta , potatoes , rice , eggs , or anything you would prepare with cheese . Perfect cheddar flavor ! I 've vacuum - sealed little packets that I include in my " surprise camping bag " as well as in complete meal packets that I make ( I call them MRRs ... Meals , Ready to Rehydrate ) to take backpacking and camping . It also works pretty good ( without reconstituting ) sprinkled on bread and toasted ( the escaping moisture from the bread rehydrates the powder ) , and on hot popcorn . It also has a very long shelf life , and I 've augmented that by keeping it in a vacuum - sealed container in the pantry , sitting right next to the butter powder and egg powder . If you have a need for lightweight backpacking food flavorings , or just like having emergency cheese on hand , this is the deal for you . Highly recommend !
5 #### Item was recieved in a timely mannor and was packed as to protect item . would recomend this item for purchase
5 #### I tried this to add flavor to any otherwise simple and boring " in the field " meal . It is just a tad salty but that is probably just me because I do n't use salt . Well worth the price .
5 #### made a rainbow cake for my daughter and every color was flavored . It came out GREAT ! If you too wanna do the same , get to drams and do a test run to see how many drops for each color . Some of the flavors needed 2 Caps full and others just 1 cap full . Give it a whirl ; it was loads of fun !
3 #### I was hoping it would be more like the Kraft M&C but it was n't . I could see where it would be good on popcorn though .
4 #### Good stuff , I can pretty much choose how much cheese flavor I want in my foods . Great for home or camping & because its powder I do n't have to watch for shelf life or mold ;-)
4 #### not what you might think but good all the same with the sour cream and powdered cheese make for some good potatoes
4 #### My daughter loves this in her water . She does not drink enough water , but this really helps ! Only ONE single drop in a 16 oz . bottle is enough to taste like those expensive flavored waters . Saves us lots of $ $ $ ! The price on this tiny bottle could be a little less expensive , though . I saw it at a craft & hobby shop cheaper after I bought this .
4 #### Great product ! I wanted it to sprinkle on popcorn and it is just what I was looking for ! Strong cheese taste , clumped a little , not too salty and tasted good .
5 #### Consistency of the cheese powder found in Kraft Mac n Cheese . Tastier and creamier .. tastes like they actually left the fat IN the cheese for a change from most powdered cheese products
2 #### While this maybe more versatile it is definitely not cheaper than buying boxed mac and cheese . The only benefit you get is that you get to pick what kind of pasta you use it for . When i got this I thought this would be great to have , now i can make wheat pasta with this mac and cheese . That was the only benefit .... This powdered cheese is in my opinion too expensive and not natural or organic or anything of that nature . It is exactly the same cheese you d get in the Kraft box . It has yellow dyes in it and all the other chemicals and preservatives ... Do yourself a favor spend the extra buck and buy the Hodgson Mill Wheat Mac And Cheese Dinner . No dyes no artificial colors or flavors . Its whole wheat pasta and white cheddar cheese . Its not half bad either for a wheat pasta but none of the artificial stuff like this cheese .
1 #### I 'm so tired of false advertising on Amazon ! And fake reviews ! This stuff is mostly whey and a very small amount of cheddar and also contains two food dies ! ! ! It 's crap ! ! And your site advertising it as dried cheddar ! I 'm almost to the point of leaving Amazon for good !
2 #### I was hoping to use this as a lightweight substitute for some of the cheddar cheese I carry on backpacking trips . It turns out to be poorly suited for that purpose -- didn't mix into the food easily , did n't taste like cheese , and did n't feel satisfying to eat like a slice of cheese . Unless I find someone to give it to , I 'll end up throwing it away .
5 #### Oh , this was heaven at first bite ! It is the exact cheese that Kraft uses in their little boxes of macaroni and cheese . I never liked the little noodles they used though . It is so delicious with regular ( Anna 's ) elbows . Just add a touch of vegetable oil , a touch of milk and this powdered cheddar with a pinch of salt . I have since purchased a different brand of powdered cheddar and it is no match to this brand . I will buy this brand from now on .
4 #### This stuff is good . I use it for the usual mac n cheese as well as cheese sauces . Light weight and easy to store on a boat . I 've read that it clumps up and does not make a good sauce . Do it this way : Mix 3 - 4 Tablespoons powdered cheese with a can of cream soup , add 1/2 can water , mix thoroughly WHILE IT IS STILL COLD then warm the sauce and use as desired . Works great . Thanks AU //(~_~)\\
4 #### just a word of advice to those of you who are considering BULK ORDERING this product ... it does NOT store well ... ! if you order more than you can use in a few SHORT months , make sure that you have a DRY and preferably vacuum - sealed environment in which to store the unused portion . i bought a couple of lbs of powder and used it a couple of times ... stored the extra lbs in a kitchen cabinet in their original packaging ... months later , the UNOPENED bags of powder were as hard as rocks ... !
5 #### I can add cheese flavor to everything from box packages that contain dry cheese ( and I want a stronger flavor ) to sprinkling over cooked veggies . Sometimes trying to add melted cheese causes problems- like mixed with scrambled eggs . So I use the dry cheese as if it was a spice ( for flavoring only ) .
5 #### I was looking to replace the Kraft Mac and Cheese powder that comes packaged with the macaroni noodles . I used this with rigatoni , macaroni , and ramen noodles and it tastes JUST like the Kraft version . Follow the directions for making Kraft Mac and Cheese and you will not be able to tell a difference . * * * UPDATE * * * - I would like to see the nutritional information for this stuff .
2 #### I gave this a few tries and ended up binning the rest . I am not a Mac and Cheese person , I did try to roll my own with some pasta also tried with instant mashed potatoes . Worth a try in either case .
5 #### I wanted to make " instant " macaroni and cheese with whole grain macaroni , and had been wondering for years why we could n't buy packets of cheese powder ( like the ones inside the boxes of Kraft ) . Was thrilled to find this product ! ( One suggestion to the seller is to include basic recipe instructions . ) I did some research , and it takes about 1&1/3 cups macaroni and 1/4 - 1/3 cup of the powder , ( plus 2 T. butter and 1/4 cup milk ) to be equal to a box of Kraft . You can jazz it up a bit by adding a few dashed of parmesan or some grated cheddar . Maybe a little garlic and a few dashed of Tabasco , if you like it spicy . I searched the web and found lots of tips . This is also good sprinkled on popcorn !
5 #### This is exactly what I was looking for and it is exactly what I wanted . Thanks for making it available . Will be buying again .
5 #### This stuff is the real deal all right , completely chock full of salt and about the same yellow color as a school bus . It 's the stuff you get from a mac & cheese packet , and it 's absolutely divine . I 'm going to use it to make emergency soup , extra cheesy mac & cheese , popcorn , whatever I can think of as an excuse .
5 #### If you like Kraft mac'n'cheese , this product is for you . By purchasing this cheese powder and your favorite brand of macaroni noodles , you can make a wonderful macaroni and cheese for much less money than you pay for Kraft 's brand . I also use this cheese to flavor my scrambled eggs , popcorn , and casseroles . I highly recommend this powdered cheese .
5 #### Great product . Websiet has some decent recipes if you do not know what to do with it . I have used it to make Mac and Cheese and Cheese Popcorn . Shipping was a little slow but I guess you get what you pay for . Over all I love this product .
4 #### Seems some folks in the review space have a problem when a pound of cheese powder comes in , when they ordered a pound of cheese powder . Let me break it down for you . If you dump this stuff straight on macaroni , you 'll get stubborn clumps and a thin cheese gruel that 's much more watery than your kraft stuff . You need a thickener , I use a tablespoon of flour for each serving . You need to break up the clumps in the cheese powder . I accomplish this with a blender bottle , basically a wire whisk in a shake bottle . Now here 's how I make one serving of macaroni . Your mileage may vary , my measurements are guesstimates as I always " eyeball " my quantity . 3 tbsp cheese powder 1 tbsp flour milk , if desired salt , to taste enough water to get it to the right consistency , not sure how much 1/2 cup macaroni elbows Cook the elbows , dump the water , blend the cheese sauce ingredients with like a whisk or something , dump in with macaroni , simmer until it gets gooey . Add butter if you want . I 've paid the kingly fee to have barry farms ship me five pounds of the stuff so far , it works for macaroni .
5 #### this product is amazing . for any popcorn freaks who like cheesy corn , this is the product to buy . I use a little unsalted butter ( to make the powder stick ) , but I could probably do without . It does n't take much of the powder to give great flavor . I know you can use it to make mac and cheese , but the popcorn is so great , i 've never tried it . Tip : use a fine strainer and a spoon to tap the powder over the corn in layers . works great and you can control how much you use and need . p.s . I bought a bag for my sister but I ca n't bare to part with it ! maybe next order ! yum !
5 #### I pretty much agree with all the other reviews , and I am glad I read them before I tried to use this . No , it is n't quite as smooth as Kraft mac and cheese powder , but it 's still great for what it is . I put it on steamed veggies , and it is just yummy . I may have to take a little extra time to break up a few little lumps , but honestly , I kind of like getting an extra strong taste of cheese powder with the occasional lump . I use it in a wild rice mix , and it is delish . I found if you mix it in stuff , hot stuff , and let it sit a minute or two , it is sometimes easier to sort of smooth it out . If you really HAVE to eat it lumpless , mix some ahead of time in broth or liquid by adding liquid a little at a time to the powder , and smooshing out the little tiny lumps . It 'll probably take you quite a while , but if that is what you want , that is what you will have to do . Any way you cut it , this cheese is great ! ( pun intended ) A tad on the salty side , so do n't add salt to whatever you are cooking until you taste this in it first . I bought two bags , and am almost done with the first . Great on popcorn , too . Try it , you 'll like it !
5 #### I live in California and we arguably have some of the best cheeses in the world out here . I 'm originally from New York where I worked 4 years in a Sicilian restaurant , and my taste buds prefer whole milk products with low salt . I 've tried a lot of dried cheddar cheeses in my cooking and baking , but I have to admit that this cheese powder from Ohio of all places is the best I have ever used . I am 50 years old , but I also have to shamefully admit that by adding a teaspoon of this cheese powder to the mix , I am once again like a little kid and I now occassionally enjoy a box of Kraft macaroni & cheese .
5 #### This was my second time ordering , got two bags this time . I use it on popcorn , on potatoes , for cheese sauces for over rice or pasta ... I also came up with a thicker version of a sauce that I use for a wonderful cheddary home made pizza that I just LOVE ! Just one of those handy ' always on hand ' pantry items that I now dread being without ! Will be ordering again and again !
4 #### I really enjoyed the flavor of this powder . It was great on popcorn ! My only gripe is that it would be nice if it came in a recloseable bag so I did n't need to make sure I had large enough zip - close bags for it to be transferred to ( which just caused a lot of wasted plastic ) .
4 #### I 'm on my 2nd bag of this stuff . This IS the KRAFT cheese powder ! I at one point emailed Barry farms concerning something about it , and they told me it they buy 50 lb bags of the stuff from Kraft and break it down into 1 lb bags . All the same , its cheaper than buying the little round canisters of cheese powder that kraft sells for popcorn . To compare to the stuff in the blue box mac and cheese , so I suggest 1/4 cup of cheese powder to 1/2 cup of pasta ( uncooked ) -- but you can experiment for yourself . In terms of making mac and cheese , I suggest mixing it up with a little oil and milk ( as suggested on the Kraft Mac & cheese boxes ) and making sure the sauce is smooth BEFORE putting it on the cooked pasta or it will clump . The stuff for the blue box contains something to make it mix in smooth that the stuff for the popcorn does n't have , so you do need to work a little to make sure the texture is smooth . It is kind of sad that the shipping for this is so expensive ( over twice the price of the item itself ) but that s more about the post office than the company that sells it . Even so it still comes out cheaper than buying the little blue Kraft tubes of the stuff -- your not paying for the extra packaging .
1 #### I bought this dried cheese last year but will have to go elsewhere for more - the shipping is 137 % of the price of the product and that is too much .
4 #### Having used Kal , Red Star , and then this brand , I must say that these have a less desirable flavor than the before mentioned brands . They smell different and taste slightly different . I will probably go back to the Kal brand .
2 #### big metallic pouch . the kind that you ca n't find a way to make it fit into the cupboard . will update after i use the yeast for cooking . but the tracking lied . It said that this package was " handed to the resident " . UM NO , it certainly was not ! it was handed to my front doormat .
5 #### This adds a cheesy flavor to vegan foods that need a little oomph . It makes eating healthfully more tolerable . Starting the vegan pathway is not easy , it takes time to get used to no salt , no oil , no sugar . This makes it easier . Take what help you can .
5 #### Purchased this to try & replace the more expensive non - fortified Sari brand we usually buy , so far we are happy with our purchase ! :)
4 #### I knew going into this purchase that these were not going to bring me luck because they were not 4 - leafed clovers . What I did n't know was that the meal I would make with these cloves would be so awesome my girlfriend would want to go " get lucky " immediately after dinner . Thanks , Frontier Natural ! !
5 #### These are very good . Better than the ' usual ' brands you get at the grocery store . I just opened the jar and the whole cloves are big , fresh and not broken up . I put about 5 of them into a ham sauce made with canned pineapple chunks , salt , brown sugar , a little bit of ground cloves and butter and slowly simmered them ( stirring occasionally ) on low for about an hour . The whole cloves softened and flavored the sauce beyond the ground cloves , but not too much . After , I removed all of the whole cloves except two and sightly pureed the mixture in a blender . Now , it 's an incredible , sweet and savory and FRAGRANT sauce / jam that I will use on all kinds of things , like ham glaze , as a jam on biscuits , toast , croissants , or even to puree even more and strain to make cocktails or sodas . Try a toasted / grilled peanut butter n'pineapple jam sammy ! Or , grilled ham n cheese n pineapple jam sammy toasted w / butter and topped with sprinkling of confectioner 's sugar ? ? :) I could go on and on . Make it into a ' salsa ' and serve with hash browns and eggs . YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM . Do n't buy that stuff in the grocery store . It 's likely way too old . Spices like this must be fresh , and that 's what I found this product to be .
3 #### Seal was open under the plastic top and the cloves have very little aroma as if they are not fresh .
5 #### Hands down the best whole cloves . Right from the moment you open bottle , you will notice the great size of each cloves and strong fragrance . Most likely they are hand picked and packaged which explains the high cost . If one is picky about quality of ingredients , this one is for you . Otherwise for $ 5 you can easily get 2x amount of whole cloves at any local Indian grocery store .
5 #### I do a lot of pickling in the summer and use a lot of cloves .
5 #### That 's a lot of cloves at a really good price .
5 #### They taste strong . I like to chew on them during the day after I eat for a cleaner mouth feeling .
5 #### This a very good tasting nutritional yeast . I and my dog loves it and know I m getting the results I expect ! !
4 #### I bought these for a foodfest of German cooking back in my home town . Flavor was bright and clear , just what I need for a strong dish . I ca n't say whether " Natural " make them any better than standard whole cloves , but I was not unhappy with them .
1 #### I bought mine elsewhere , but the expiration date is far away so it is not old or stale . In the past I 've used nutritional yeast , including Frontier brand , and liked it . However , my latest bag of it was terrible . It has a nearly gagging effect when tasted - strong and foul . Adding seasoning , etc . did not help . Last night I started a batch of kale crackers with the nutritional yeast in the food dehydrator , and my home has been reeking of the yeast , despite the lemon juice , garlic , and chia seeds that were added to the cracker batter . It 's just disgusting , so this morning I threw out the remainder of the yeast . I notice that many people like this yeast , yet other people get a nasty tasting & smelling batch of it . This is the first time I 've gotten a nasty one , and I see - rather taste & smell - exactly what they are talking about ! After this gag - me batch of yeast I 'll never buy nutritional yeast again .
5 #### Great product and a very good Amazon price ... I use it daily/
5 #### Love these and use them daily . Great find at a great price !
5 #### These cinnamon sticks are 6 " long ! I was surprised They are very healthy looking sticks and some are quite large in diameter , about a 1/4 inch or so .
5 #### A lot of sticks ! Wo n't have to buy any for awhile . Worth the money .
5 #### Perfect matching lengths and very close to matching in diameter . They are a little slimmer than the shorter versions often found at stores . I was really impressed that not one stick was broken and they were so similar in size . ( about as big around as a pencil ) Good aroma and flavor .
5 #### So far very happy with this product . I accidentally ordered the 6 " . However , they are fresh .
5 #### This is perfect for energy . Very high in B12 Love the company Frontier .
5 #### Great price and works well in the recipes we have used it in .
1 #### Has a smell and taste of burned plastic to it . A very unwholesome and disconcerting thing .
1 #### I do n't know what happened but all of a sudden the smell & flavor has changed & it smells very chemically . Almost like burnt plastic . I made an entire huge pot of all organic homemade soup ( spent like $ 25 on all of the vegetables , maybe more ) and had to throw it out because it smelled so bad . Amazon sent me another bag of this stuff but I wasted all that money & time on cooking . I got my 2nd bag this weekend , just did the same thing & ugh ! ! ! ! It smells off & chemically again ! ! I m so annoyed ; all that money and time wasted . I have serious food allergies & have to cook in bulk so I can have leftovers to eat through out the week & this is a huge waste ! There is something wrong with this new batch of nutritional yeast ! ! Be ware ! ! I was subscribed ; ordering 2 bags a month and something has changed . Its so unfortunate ! !
5 #### I use my Nutritional Yeast for making my vegan foods . the flakes are just the right size . I love the taste and the freshness of the product . Also , you get a 1 pound bag at a great price . I have used this brand more than once and will continue to order from this company .
3 #### This is n't the best tasting nutritional yeast I 've ever had , but it 's a good deal considering the price ( $ 11.35 per pound ) . It has an odd , plastic after taste when tasted on its own . It makes me wonder how and where this was grown , and the company 's website does n't provide that information . The flake size is true to the photo - a mix of powder and small flakes . I 'll finish this bag , but I 'm not sure I 'll buy it again .
5 #### The only non - fortified yeast that is affordable . I love nutritional yeast but do not want the synthetic stuff that is added to the fortified yeast . This is just pure yeast . 100 stars ! !
5 #### I really love the flavoring of this but have recently found that I am also allergic to brewer 's yeast in addition to gluten ( this is apparently not uncommon for those with gluten allergies ) and there is n't much difference ( if at all ) between nutritional and brewer 's yeast . I unfortunately had to give this away because it was literally making me ill , but overall the taste is great and I was so bummed to find my favorite new flavoring was causing me bodily harm . Gave it to a co - worker who says she loves it , she 's a big fan of the quality .
5 #### This was such a fantastic deal . So my only thing that 's not really an issue , just a thing lol , is that it was extra bland . The one I usually buy from my co - op actually tastes salty ... maybe they season it ? This had none of that which is a good thing . You can truly flavor it the way you would like it to be or whatever you 're making without fearing extra salt . I say try it . And this is just too good of a deal to pass up .
5 #### Our local health food store recently changed their nutritional yeast which I had been buying for over 20 years . I noticed it was darker but did n't think much of it until I tasted it . It was just horrible ! ! ! I tossed it as I knew I would never eat it and had not kept the receipt . So I got online and ordered this yeast from Frontier . Very tasty and though the bag had a hole in it I was quickly sent a replacement bag . I 'm really happy with this nutritional yeast and happy to have a new , reliable source for a staple in our house . I try to buy local but when a good item gets replaced with an inferior one what 's a girl to do ?
5 #### Perfect and very fresh . Nutty flavor . I add it to most of my savory foods .
5 #### Arrived on time , great product . I am well satisfied .
5 #### loving the nutritional yeast . use it anywhere i 'd use parmesan cheese . and it 's awesome on buttered popcorn !
3 #### Flavor is just okay , I prefer the flavor of the now brand nutritional yeast
3 #### I usually purchase Bragg 's premium nutritional yeast , but thought I would try one a little less expensive . It 's okay , but Bragg 's tastes waaay better !
5 #### So much cheaper than buying a shaker size ! I just use this bag to fill up the shaker I already own and I feel like I have a never ending supply of nutritional yeast . I use it most often for my vegan mac and cheese , but many vegan recipes call for nutritional yeast . I 've actually finished one 1 - lb bag and am on my second one . That 's a lot of nutritional yeast !
5 #### Love nutritional yeast a / k / a nooch with DIY popcorn . Sometimes I 'll throw some in a dish that just needs something . Very healthy .
5 #### Really like this yeast , much better taste than other brands I used in the past , more fresh and the price is just right . Will buy again since I use it in my medical diet .
5 #### These are great tasting and so good for you .
5 #### This is my first time to use nutritional yeast . It has an interesting taste , however , I ordered it to use in the making of seitan from gluten flour . Since my recent attempt at making Seitan ( faux meat ) was an absolute success , it only stands to reason that this nutritional yeast contributed in making a delicious food product . I plan to learn more about nutritional yeast and it 's uses .
5 #### Perfect from beginning to end . Great product . Great delivery time . Will buy from them again . Recommend .
5 #### Nutritional yeast is such a magical thing - I ca n't believe I had n't tried it sooner ! Like cilantro , it 's one of those things you can just keep piling more and more of into dishes for great effect . It 's really quite superb , and wonderfully versatile ! Looking for a vegan - friendly way to make your dishes taste rich and cheesy ? Look no further than nutritional yeast ! And , here 's a secret : add a pinch of smoked paprika . The depth of the smoky paprika brings a complexity to the nutritional yeast that makes it taste more like real cheese .
3 #### These have a strange taste compared to Braggs Nutritional Yeast . I probably wo n't buy them again . I used to swear by Frontier , but more and more their herbs are sourced from China and I do n't want that .
5 #### Great flavor , great price . Wish I had bought more .
3 #### Disclaimer : I would probably have rated this nutritional yeast higher had I not tried Bragg nutritional yeast prior . The overall flavor of is what I would describe as underwhelming in comparison to Bragg . I would nt exactly describe the product as mini - flakes either . I think a more accurate description would be dust . Over all , the product is mediocre . Would I buy it again ? Probably not .
5 #### Used to make vegan nacho sauce ! Love it , and way cheaper than buying it locally .
5 #### This has been a choice of mine , mainly because is so smoothly grounded . Tastes great too , and excellent value in my opinion .
5 #### I could n't get the powder I ordered before , but I like these mini - flakes much better -- they do n't clump together in liquid .
5 #### Nice quantity for price . Very tasty ! Seems quite fresh and well packaged .
5 #### I use it as an ingredient in making Saitan ( " wheat meat " ) , & the Saitan has always been excellent .
5 #### Easy to dissolve in my juice . It has a good taste .
5 #### I have a potato and leek recipe that called for this product . I made the soup without it . It was ok . I 'm not a vegan or eating strictly healthy but I love trying different foods . Out of curiosity I bought some of this yeast . ( There is a web site linked with Amazon that explains this product and it 's uses . ) It was a filling and tasty addition to the potato and leek soup . I 'll be using more of this product . Thank you Amazon you 've widened my world and maybe me .
5 #### Very very filling . I also liked the cool mint flavor . These make a great snack , but I would not consider them breakfast , too much sugar and too sweet in general . Very good though .
5 #### Delicious and nutritious ... and there 's lots of recipes that make good use of same .
5 #### Really love this nutritional yeast . I like to eat nutritional yeast , so this was perfect as a cheap bulk option . It tastes fine and mixes well .
5 #### This is by far my favorite brand of nutritional yeast . It has a great flavor , I use it for everything , sprinkle on soups , popcorn , use in recipes , etc . The consistency is good , it is a bunch of small flakes although it seems almost powdery when you first open the bag , do n't sneeze ! The pricing is the best you can get on nutritional yeast and the quality is very high . It comes in a big bag , I just keep a shaker on hand to put this in . Overall , amazing nutritional yeast , the only brand I use now !
5 #### This is a delicious product ! I had been using a different brand , which was good , but when I got this Frontier brand yeast because of a better price , I was really surprised ! It has a really good cheese flavor and the smaller flakes adhere to salads better and blend into stuff better . I will continue to buy this as well as other Frontier spices and herbs and teas . They have really good quality .
5 #### What a fun way to add ' cheese ' without actually torturing cows :)
5 #### Great yeast at a great price . Very small flakes and sharp taste
5 #### Love these , Clif bars a always good and this flavor is my favorite .
5 #### Great healthier snack to keep plugging throughout your day !
5 #### Love it and use it regularly . It works very well in a broccoli sauce .
5 #### These cliff bars taste great , like a girl scout mint cookie . Has 20 % of recommended fiber in it for sustained release of the carbs , a great start for the morning with a little caffeine in it to , not a jittery amount , just a little pick me up . Has 10 grams of protein and a well rounded vitamin profile . it is soy protein isolate so guys would want to avoid eating heavily due to phyto - estrogens and is also recommended to avoid for women who have had breast cancer . Otherwise for the general public soy does have a lot of benefits .
5 #### tasted great . feels like maybe there 's too much sugar if it tastes this good but I knew that going in . I would buy again but want to try other flavors first to see what else is Clif makes
5 #### Excellent quality product . Easily dissolves in liquid , good flavor .
5 #### So happy to have found this since we use it to make a cheese - less cheese sauce for my dairy -free daughter .
5 #### tastes just as advertised , comparable to my local store where I buy it loose / bulk
4 #### Being vegetarian for about half a century , I have used a lot of nutritional yeast in my life . It boosts flavor , protein and B12 , among other things . This product is typical of Frontier 's approach : Quality in a protective bulk package . My opinion of the qualities are somewhat middle of the road . Overall quality , excellent . The flakes are smaller , which is not a big deal to me . The flavor is not as " buttery - cheesy " as some I 've had . Good , but not the knock - your - socks - off wonderful . Still , I 've ordered it twice on here . There seems to be some worry about MSG . I did notice one reviewer described being sensitive to MSG and said this did not affect her negatively , as MSG does . Nutritional yeast has protein , therefore almost certainly glutamates , which contrary to some claims , is NOT MSG . I think it is important here to distinguish between natural glutamates and MonoSodium Glutamate , generally an industrial product which is produced by GMO bacteria , typically on GMO wheat and such . MSG is very concentrated and has factors related to the source materials . Natural glutamates are found in practically anything with PROTEIN . Some people lump all glutamates together with MSG . To avoid all glutamates you 'd have to avoid all protein ! I do n't consider that practical or desirable . Obviously I do find this nutritional yeast desirable , though possibly not quite perfect . I might order it again .
3 #### A good deal on this yeast . It blends nice in recipes . BUT ..... when I use it on popcorn , the taste is not as nice as my local health food store . Blended into my cashew sauce , I do n't notice at all ; just when it 's a stand - alone do I note the difference .
5 #### Excellent quality ! I use this to make a Parmesan like cheese substitute . Delicious ! I once had a Great Uncle who lived to be 98 . He took this yeast every morning INSISTING it was what kept hm with a full head of hair . No idea if that is true or not but he did have a full head of thick hair ... LOL
5 #### Delicious and fresh . Tastes like cheese . Delicious on popcorn and healthy . My dog begs for it . All of their products are top notch .
5 #### Great quality .. very tasty and versatile . I will order this again . Thank you
5 #### This is my second bag and I got ta say this is a really excellent way to substitute cheddar cheese in meals . I do n't think it would work on a burger but it goes great in my combo healthy casserole . I can use as little or as much as I want and the taste reflects the amount used very nicely . Its a really nice way to have your cake and eat it too without all the calories :)
2 #### This was nothing like any Nutritional Yeast I have tried in the last 2 years . The flakes are more like a powder . This barely had the smell of Nutritional yeast . The flavor was nothing like any other nutritional yeast I have tried . It did not have that cheese flavor that I expected . It was so bad I had to return it . If you like Nutritional Yeast do not but this . Stick with Red Star or Now Foods .
5 #### Good deal and good nooch . Very happy with purchase .
3 #### A little bland . I had better flakes before from GNC which has a more salty flavor which is great on popcorn , but ( sadly ) ca n't find that particular brand anymore .
5 #### although I love larger flakes have been using this product on my popcorn it sticks to the butter and makes a tasty snack that I enjoy on a regular basis , even the neighbor kids love my popcorn .
5 #### Use this for raw cashew cheeze . Love the flavor .
5 #### I heard that nutritional yeast was good on popcorn , so I bought a large shaker bottle of Bragg 's nutritional yeast to try it out . Turns out , it was great on popcorn ! When I ran out , I decided to get a bulk bag of this Frontier yeast because it was more economical , and honestly , I could n't taste a difference . They are mini flakes , but the flakes are so mini that it 's practically a powder , if that matters to you . I use it for : 1 . Popcorn . I add melted butter , sprinkle powdered seasoning salt ( regular seasoning salt ground up in the blender ) and this yeast . Absolutely delicious ! 2 . Pasta tossed with butter , nutritional yeast , and capers . Squeeze some lemon on it , sprinkle minced fresh parsley . Add grilled chicken , if you like . Tastes similar to chicken piccata , but takes a fraction of the time .
5 #### This is great on popcorn . ( We also use the Frontier Organic White Cheese Powder on our popcorn . ) The flakes are not big at all . It 's more like course powder than flakes . This is a plus for us . Also , it 's high in B vitamins . It 's a good vegan alternative for recipes that call for cheese or a cheese flavor .
5 #### Wonderful . Every bit as good an any nutritional yeast I 've bought a much higher cost . I am pleased . Feel like I got a great deal and excellent product . I appreciate the small almost powder like flakes . Really helps makes the " cheese " spreads smooth . taste and smell are on point as anyone might expect from nutritional yeasts . Once again Frontier comes through on quality and value .
5 #### Nutritional Yeast is a complete protein and as a vegan that is important to me . It is also chucked full of fiber , minerals and vitamin B. This is the first time I have ordered nutritional yeast from Frontier it arrived in packaging expected ( transferred into mason jar ) product was fresh and had great taste . Nutritional yeast should be stored in refrigerator to keep fresh .
5 #### This is the only nutritional yeast that I will use . It has a beautifully smooth cheesy taste . And I use it on everything . You definitely wo n't be sorry using Frontier
3 #### This is the second brand of nutritional yeast we tried . The first one was Hoosier Hill Farms . We did n't know there would be a taste difference . This is edible but for some reason tastes much more salty than the first one we tried . We plan to go back to Hoosier Hill Farms brand .
4 #### Quality and energy expected from Clif with good flavor . Four stars because this is a little too ' cool ' tasting for me . That is a personal preference and others may really enjoy it .
5 #### My favorite ! ! ! ! I keep two in my purse - I have hypoglycemia and boy is this just the ticket for solving my problem when I get that blood - sugar drop ! Fortunately the ingredients are all ones I can tolerate ( some have made me very sick because of what they 've added to preserve the product ) . This is on my list to reorder as needed .
5 #### One of our family 's favorite flavors of these organic healthy bars - wonderful minty flavoring !
5 #### Yum ! I like the small flakes best , I use this to make a popcorn topping and these dissolve better than the large flakes . This was a good price .
5 #### Usually buy Kal brand but these are TASTY & competitive priced . Have purchased several Frontier products & have ALWAYS been satisfied with the packaging , the product AND guarantee .
2 #### This was my first time using nutritional yeast since starting our Vegan lifestyle . I have to say that for me it was a miss . I 'm not sure if it is this brand or all nutritional yeast but each time I used some I would develop a headache a hour or so after eating some . Also as they state these are " Mini Flakes " , but I found them more to be powder than flakes . You may not have the same problem I did but these are just not for me .
5 #### The new vegan super food . Adds a cheesy flavor without the fat and cholesterol . Nutty cheese flavoring . Sprinkle on EVERYTHING . Well , maybe not on your vegan ice cream . Or cereal . Everything else though .
5 #### Yummy vegan cheesiness . I love my Vitamin B enriched nutitional yeast . As a vegetarian it is important to find extra B vitamins in your diet and these are a tastes solution . You can make yummy Mac n cheese with your flakes . You can sprinkle them on soups , curries and veggie stir fries for extra flavor and nutrition . I 've gone through two bags and will continue to buy more .
5 #### My kids love this flavor and are a great after sports snack !
2 #### There;s something funky about the taste . I wo n't be buying this again
5 #### Love this nutritional yeast on popcorn and pasta and baked potatoes ! it 's a fine grain consistency whole others seem to be flakes . You 'll want to have a container ready for daily use since the bulk bag is a lot to keep on a table .
5 #### I use nutritional yeast ALL THE TIME . My kids favorite nutritional yeast use is to make Vegan Cheese sauce , the one for nachos . We use potatoes , carrots , nutritional yeast and spices and it is done so quickly . I normally buy the large flakes at the co - op , but the convenience of buying it on amazon and having it sent to my house can not be beat ! I am not sure if I like the large or small flakes best . I feel the smaller ( these ) flakes will be amazing for folding into un - meat - balls or sprinkling on vegan pizza or popcorn for sure . The quality is good , the taste is perfect and I will be ordering more . You can not go wrong with Frontier 1 pound packages on amazon . This is how I buy most of my seasoning anymore !
1 #### If I had realized this had folic acid in it I would not have bought it . See article pertaining to folic acid / folate and breast and prostate cancer https://www.drfuhrman.com/library/folic_acid_dangers_and_prenatal_vitamins.aspx This is a synthetic form . It is fine to get folate in the food we eat naturally . I know I was surprised too . I just do n't want to take the chance .
5 #### I have not tried this yet , as I 'm still gathering items that I will need for a life style , diet change . This is on my list , but I bought Frontier brand because I have learned in the past , they are high quality on everything I 've ordered from them . I have many more items to purchase and hope Frontier makes them .
5 #### Love this stuff ! Just what I was expecting ; I do n't care whether the flakes are large , crushed into powder or anything else . ( I sprinkle it into dishes , so it does n't matter ) . Cheesy yummy flavor !
5 #### I recently found out about this and have used it several times a week since . I love adding it to vegetables and fake Mac & Cheese . No problems with this brand , have gone through several bags .
5 #### Freaking delicious . I use NY in my salads , dressings and pates I make with almonds or sunflower seeds . This has a rich , deep semi - cheesy flavor . Great product !
5 #### yum . great in eggs , soups ( especially ! ) and other stuff .
5 #### The puppies and cats thrive when is is added to their food .
5 #### I use this as flavouring on popcorn mostly , so the finer size is as important as flavour . Initially I thought this was more bitter than the other yeast I 'd purchased at a local store , but once I put it on popcorn it was delicious . Far cheaper than simile product in stores , and stored in glass all sealed up it has a decent shelf life .
5 #### I am relatively new to Clif bars , but this is now my favorite , probably because I love mint chocolate ! It says it contains caffeine , and the fact that I am up at almost 2 am writing this review is proof that it does ( I had one at 5 pm ) . With that in mind , learn from my mistake and do n't eat them too late , or you will end up an energetic insomniac !
5 #### A great buy for this certified kosher nutritional yeast . We put it in soups , cooked cereals and sauces , sprinkle it on vegetables and add it to rice and pasta . It has a nice nutty flavor that enhances any dish and will boost your all - important vitamin B levels . Recommended
2 #### I really hate giving this a 2 star review . I really do enjoy the taste and simplicity of the packaging ! We simply dump it into our jar and go on about our day . It 's very good in all of our " cheesy " vegan recipes . Popcorn , cheese sauce , mac n cheese , gravy , soup , etc . I routinely toss nutritional yeast into something I 'm cooking at every meal . Tasty stuff ! However , having just read a report mentioning this brand having elevated levels of lead , I can not recommend it or purchase it any longer . It 's not a huge amount , and many others are still probably comfortable with it , but we tend to be overly cautious in our family . I have purchased from this company on multiple occasions with a variety of products and always been pleased . I will be waiting to see what the company does to change their lead levels and possibly purchase from them again in the future . For now I will stick to Bobs Red Mill , Bragg , Dr. Fuhrman , Red Star , or NOW Foods nutritional yeast .
5 #### I luv making kale chips . If we take some bell peppers and food processor or blender them until a pulp tjen add this to it and smear it all over the kill when you bake them in the oven they taste like cheese chips . Really really good .
5 #### Ca n't eat popcorn without this stuff ! Add nutrition and great flavor to mashed potatoes too .
5 #### This a a great price ! ! ! Nutritional yeast is a staple at my home and this was a great deal !
5 #### Delicious ! Great value on Amazon . I even got this delivered overnight ( Prime 2 - day shipping ) . I guess it 's because I 'm close to the Amazon distribution center . Nonetheless , this is one of the BEST TASTING nutritional yeast products on the market .
4 #### Really good , though a bit more than I wanted to pay . Still , it 's very good product . I use if for cooking every day and it 's fantastic on popcorn ( especially with some lemon pepper ) !
4 #### I use it on Popcorn but , I must admit it 's not my favorite flavor so , I just ca n't be fair . If you are like me and eat it because it 's good for you , this is a good choice .
5 #### My family buys nutritional yeast all the time to make vegan cheeses and several other recipes that call for it . Seems like great quality , and I 've never been disappointed . I used to buy Bob 's Red Mill brand , but was concerned about the possibility of MSG being a by - product of the process . From what I 've read Frontier 's method gives less potential for MSG . If anyone can back that up , I 'd appreciate it . The only downside with Frontier Nutritional Yeast is that it 's not available for Subscribe & Save .
5 #### I make a " yeast gravy " with this + we put it on the cats ' food . Also , my husband loves it sprinkled on his brown rice .
5 #### This is a Very Great Product and we recommend it to everyone .
5 #### Great price for this product . I use this regularly to make a vegan " cheese " sauce . Great that it has vitamin B12 added to it . I have purchased this several times and will get more in the future .
5 #### I put it on kale when making chips along with almond flour and a number of other ingredients - yum
5 #### Taste is great , helps add savory tastes to every kind of cooking . Big ingredient in flavor and nutrition of home made baby formula via nourishing traditions recipe ... many uses , lovely fresh meaty / nutty smell and taste . Will buy again !
5 #### I got this for my dog - really . He has a lot of allergy problems and skin conditions . His coat and his persistent scratching has stopped with the use of the yeast flakes - 1 teaspoon daily mixed in his homemade food .
3 #### This is not a very nice tasting yeast . Normally it ( other brand ) does n't stand out that much but this brand is a lot bolder which I do n't care for . This is more of a personal preference in taste so to others this may taste great . I wo n't buy this brand of nutritional yeast again .
5 #### Product arrived fast and in excellent condition . The product 's texture is perfect and works great on anything ! Do not hesitate on buying this over other brands .
1 #### To be honest , I ca n't believe all the good reviews this product got . I 've been using yeast flakes for years , and this brand is just awful . First of all , it 's more like a powder than a flake , but more importantly , it has a strong , bitter taste other brands I 've tried just do n't have . I use yeast flakes as a substitute for grated cheese ( I 'm a plant - based eater ) , and KAL and Bob 's Red Mill brands for example , are excellent - mild tasting and delicious . I dislike giving bad reviews , but I 'll never order this product again . Amazon carries both KAL and Bob 's Red Mill brands . You ca n't go wrong with those .
1 #### I used to consume Yeast for folic acid . Lewis Labs was the best till few years ago Russian chose to play with it since it became so valuable for the production of their alcoholic beverages . After the fermentation process is completed the yeast is harvested , thoroughly washed , pasteurized , and dried on roller drum dryers . The B vitamins are both naturally produced during fermentation , and added to the cream prior to the drying process . Riboflavin ( B2 ) and Cyanocobalamin ( B12 ) are created during fermentation . Additional Riboflavin ( B2 ) and Cyanocobalamin ( B12 ) are added after fermentation along with Thiamine ( B1 ) , Pyridoxine HCL ( B6 ) , Niacin and Folic Acid . Infact what this bag contains yeast and supplements , where I could care less for unregulated business for supplements . Nutritional yeast flakes are nothing than vitamin supplements and this Frontier is no different . Frontier is a superb brand but no need to consume supplements . I consume the yeast which is sold separately as inactive yeast that has no added supplements since for every single spoon , 30 g it offers only 30 calories but a whopping 3 g of complete amino acid protein .
5 #### This is more like powder than the usual big flakes . Perfect for popcorn and all kinds of seasoning . I never eat msg or flavor enhanced products so to me this has outstanding flavor .
5 #### Love it .. use in mac and cheese with other cheese and a tablespoon of this . Recommend it and recommend looking up that sauce .. great stuff .
2 #### These are definitely not flakes but more like granulated yeast . Make sure you read the product description before buying this product ! Carpe diem
5 #### I use one everything I eat . Soups , sandwiches , ice cream . Healthy eating is when you can add B12 to your diet even when eating ice cream .
5 #### Great deal ! Way more expensive in health food stores . These make great wraps and quick meals . You can put seaweed in anything !
5 #### I have had other brands , but this one is the best for flavor , quality and price . I use it as an alternative for bread . I fill it with tuna , uncured cold cuts , scrambled eggs ...
2 #### I 'm not surprised that groceries cost more to have shipped than to pick up at one 's local store , so I was n't deterred by that . I have been making a lot of sushi lately , so I got 50 - sheet packs each of Sound Sea Vegetables nori and Sushi Chef nori . I have to say I find the Sound Sea Vegetables nori to have a fishier taste , but what I really dislike is its rubbery texture when moistened by the rice , which makes it unpleasantly chewy and even hard to cut . In my opinion , which is not that of an expert or purist , the Sushi Chef nori&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Sushi - Chef - Nori-50 - Count-4 - 5 - Ounce - Toasted - Seaweed - Sheets / dp / B00176MV3A / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Sushi Chef Nori , 50 - Count , 4.5 - Ounce Toasted Seaweed Sheets</a>&nbsp;has a far more pleasant flavor and delicate texture that does not overwhelm the flavor of the filling or make it too chewy to enjoy . Yes it is quite a bit more expensive , but good eating should not have to be unpleasant .
5 #### I have used many brands of nutritional yeast . The frontier brand is my favorite . It adds a very pleasant flavor to dishes .
5 #### This brand is excellent . The flakes are small and sticks to popcorn and blends easily in recipes too . I will buy this again .
5 #### Many brands of nutritional yeast come in large flakes . This one is a fine powder so it 's really nice stirred into soups and served on top of pasta . Definitely my favorite brand .
5 #### Frontier Nutritional Yeast - This is a great tasting yeast to add to vegetables , rice , ect . to give things a slightly cheesy flavor . Great for vegans for a cheese alternative !
5 #### These are very good and tastly yeast flakes . I would not hesitate to buy this same brand again . I just transfer them from the bag into a clear plastic container that came with another brand .
5 #### Really tasty ! This is a really good product for vegan cooking or sprinkling on foods . It is well packaged and should store well too .
3 #### well not really a flake at all , I am use to a flake not a powder . This is closer to a powder than a flake , if a flake them very tiny ones . Flavor is good .
4 #### This product was satisfactory , but please be aware that these are minis and more like a powder than a flake .
5 #### I love nutritional yeast . I 'm thrilled I was able to find this size at such a good price . This can be pretty $ $ in stores . I use this on my salads and pasta and the taste is so good .
4 #### I sprinkle 2 tbsp of nutritional yeast over my breakfast of eggs and sauteed spinach . It 's a great source of b vitamins , and adds a very pleasant nutty taste to the dish . As others have said , these are n't " flakes " . It 's a very fine powder , which I like as it just dissolves into the dish .
5 #### I am a vegan , so I use this every day in order to get the B12 from . I like the test , sometimes I eat this like my snack .
5 #### I love this product . It has a nutty , cheesy taste . And way less calories than regular cheese , so I use it in the place of cheese in some recipes .
5 #### I am new to being on a plants only diet . I did some research before buying Frontier Brand . I knew it would be small pieces , so no complaints here . I find that makes it easier to blend together when creating sauces . It is a learned taste , but I regularly sprinkle it on everything now . I only buy it here due to the reasonable price . I wish it was a subscribe item . I would buy it in a larger size if it was available . I keep " cheesy " sauce in my fridge to put on many things , pizza , quinoa , stir fries and tortillas . The right recipe and you have a wonderful mac ' n cheese !
5 #### Starting on this while I was pregnant as I had a b vitamin definiency with anemia so I started add this to everything ( and took floradex ) and it help a ton with my iron number as they go hand an hand . Anyways I love the taste of Frontiers Nutritional yeast and sprinkle it on my eggs every morning it taste like a powdery cheese which is really good if you have enough butter on your eggs to make it all moist or you can use coconut oil ( which is what I usually cook my eggs in anyways ) . This is the highest quality Nutritional yeast available due to there processing methods ! Highly recommend this brand , the yeast is almost a powder form for the mini flakes so if you do n't like powdered form you can buy it in large flakes also from Frontier .
5 #### I used to buy the Kal nutritional yeast flakes , but when those went off Amazon Prime I decided to try out this brand . I 'm very happy that I did and I will only be getting the Frontier brand yeast flakes in the future . I use nutritional yeast mainly in vegan cheese recipes . Compared to the other nutritional yeast flakes I 've used , I believe this one has the best flavor . As other reviewers have pointed out , these flakes are much smaller than other brands I 've used and are more like a powder . However the difference in size / texture has n't seemed to make any major difference in any of my recipes . Overall , these yeast flakes have the best flavor I 've tried to so far and I will continue to buy them in the future .
5 #### GREAT ! Just freeze dried garlic- not powder or even flakes really . More like finely diced . Tastes just like the fresh stuff , without the mess or stink .
5 #### I really like these flakes , I love garlic , and enjoy to extra texture this adds , and a little goes a LONG way . I will buy them again ,
5 #### This is the best garlic powder ever ! After trying it in several recipes , I bought some for all of my daughters who also love to cook , and they agreed . This garlic powder does n't have that strong , bitter taste ( and aftertaste ) , that many do . It is a good substitute when you have no fresh garlic for making garlic bread . It does n't lose its ' flavor in a strong soup or sauce .
2 #### I usually use actual garlic cloves , but tried this as a sub when I ran out . The powder flies everywhere and sometimes you ca n't control the amount . I then bought the granules , and they are a bit stronger in garlic taste and can be controlled . I did n't find the flakes any better than the powder , either . So , if you need a substitute , the granules are the best . But try to keep " real " garlic instead.-- and beware of the " bad " Chinese garlic cloves being imported / sold in the U.S. ...
3 #### Nothing amazing . The garlic taste is not as strong as I 'd expected , I find myself using a lot of it . And it is not cheap , so that is a little disappointing .
3 #### This garlic powder has good taste , but is ground VERY fine . When I sprinkle it into my soups , it forms little balls that have to be mashed up so a person wo n't get an over dose when eating . I probably wo n't order this again .
5 #### This garlic is almost sweet in flavor . It is definitely different from the spices I 've tried in over brands , that seemed bitter now in comparison . I probably literally put this in almost everything I make , even stuff I added lots of chopped garlic to already . A little goes a long way , but I still buy it in bulk ( I like to try them in the small size first and then I have bottle too . Trying frontier spices was one of the best culinary chances I ever took . I started with parsley because it was in bulk cheaper than what I used to use ( mcC ) . The best part is giving my family the best by buying organic .
3 #### I am used to garlic powder where you see little granules . This powder is too " powdery , " i.e. , it is a powder and has no small granules . Now that said - the garlic works fine and is strong enough . It just is not the consistency I like .
3 #### Too finely ground . Tends to cake in my humitity .
5 #### We use a lot of garlic , and have tried many brands . This is The Brand ! Just try it on popcorn ! And better buy 2 jars at a time , you wo n't want to run out . The taste is true garlic and the powder is super fine .
5 #### Arrived on time and I am enjoying this spice . It nice to know that it is really healthy for you .
5 #### It takes a little time to get used to using this fine powdered garlic but it is well worth the time . The texture actually helps distribute the garlic over the food being treated . But most important : it has a very fresh garlic taste that allows me to substitute it for the more tedious preparation of garlic buds when I doing last minute taste adjustments on recipes . I do n't think I will ever get any other garlic powder !
3 #### This took a little getting used to , it 's a very fine powder . But you can dispense it in exact amounts , it blends right in to anything , and it 's very tasty . ... adjustment to review . If you live in a humid climate , you will find that this stuff turns into a solid brick soon enough . Seriously , it all turns into one rock - solid mass . At that point , you can either get out a hammer or throw it away .
4 #### good flavor but really messy when opening . very finely ground just like dust . I like all Frontier products very much .
5 #### Malden Salt is a wonderful salt that I use in small amounts in all my cooking .
4 #### Delicious ! Great product but I with it came in a resealble bag . A little goes a long way with this salt so this one box will last a long time for a regular home cook
3 #### It 's fine but the flake is a little too flaky for my desires .
5 #### This is not just salt it is snowflakes from heaven . If you want something that wants that salt taste & crunch this stuff is it , salted carmels , chocolate chip cookies ( yes try it ) and so many other things
5 #### I love finishing salt flakes . It has a nice crunchy flaky texture without being overpowering salty . was amazing with the product . will buy again ! !
4 #### I do n't get the rave about these flakes , 8.5 oz will last me a long time .
5 #### I do n't use as much turmeric root as some others , so the Frontier Herb Ground Turmeric Root in a 1.92 Ounce bottle is perfect . Its fresh , ground finely and uniformly , bright in color , and I like the bottle as well as the cap . I 'll be ordering again when this bottle is empty , but I 'll also reuse the bottle instead of recycling it .
5 #### The flakes are a good way to add flavor to food without overpowering it . You only need a pinch . Amazon had the best price .
5 #### It was our family first try from Frontier . The delivery was as promised . The quality is as expected . My wife said that she can feel the difference in quality compared to non organic products . We are going to use products of this brand / company
5 #### Make sure you read the size this is a very small box
5 #### Turmeric is great for inflammation and I use it in my cereals , yogurts , and different items that I cook .
5 #### Excellent flavor , and I adore the GLASS bottles . It 's refreshing to see that , rather than icky plastic .
2 #### Bought for OTC ingestion . Ugh . Tastes awful , and powder form in mouth is unpleasant . Much better for the purpose in capsule form with pepper extracts .
5 #### When I purchased this is was simply because I 'd never used turmeric , and I have so many other spices in my cabinet . Why not this one too ? Not the best of reasons . But since then I read about how awesome this root is , and I use it religiously . It has a very earthy scent and taste . We love it .
5 #### High quality ground turmeric root . Seems to be fresh and has good colory .
5 #### So happy that I purchased this from Frontier . It is so fresh and aromatic like all of Frontiers spices . A little goes a long way so this will last me for quite a while . Thanks Frontier !
5 #### Great for making face masks . I love it . Great value .
5 #### It 's good for certain foods . Helps relieve joint inflammation . I really did n't notice any difference . Maybe I need to use more .
5 #### I discovered ground turmeric root when it was used as part of an Asian combination spice . Since I was familiar with the other ingredients , I knew that the eye appealing golden color and interesting taste had to be due to the turmeric root . After I read about all the health benefits , I decided to order some to experiment . I do not cook a lot so I did not want to start out with a huge quantity . I had used Frontier spices before so I chose this small bottle . I was very pleased when it came with a best by date that was more than a couple of years away . However , after successfully trying this tasty spice in several soups and savory dishes , I know that I will be reordering it on a regular basis . The glass bottle is also a nice plus . It has an easy open flip top cap with just the right size holes that allow me to add exactly the amount that I choose . I really am pleased to see that the turmeric does not clump at the bottom of the bottle .
5 #### I tried this salt in a cooking class and it taste really good . It is so much better Than regular table salt or kosher salt .
4 #### very nice . I use this with raw honey as a brightening mask .
5 #### Turmeric helps control blood sugar levels . I 'm not a scientist , but I am a diabetic and I can tell you my person experience has been an average of 20 points lower on my readings since I 've been eating this daily . I sprinkle some in my eggs every morning and even add it to tuna fish or sprinkle it on whatever meat I 'm cooking . I 've been buying this brand of organic seasoning for years and have always found them to be very high quality . I am on subscribe and save with this turmeric and I go thru almost two bottles a month . BTW ... If you want to try the blood sugar experiment , remember to also add black pepper , it helps your body absorb it better . Research it .
5 #### This is great for my homemade soups and healthy for my brain so I do n't get Alsheimers .
5 #### Almost as good as the fresh stuff - and without the orange fingers !
5 #### This has a very good flavor and Turmeric is known as a cancer fighter . My teenager daughter ( who is very picky ) now only wants to eat ' yellow chicken ' and also puts this on her potatoes when cooking on the stovetop . It will turn things yellow in color if you use more than just a few sprinkles but that does n't bother us : )
5 #### There 's just something about it . It 's the perfect size for adding sparkle to your food . Not just sparkly looks , but a sparkly flavor .
5 #### Maldon sea salt flakes from Maldon Lake in Essex , England , a hard salt that resembles snowflakes . According to legend , flake salt was first manufactured in Maldon by accident nearly 2,000 years ago , when the slaves of Casius Petrox overheated his bathwater . His slaves had inadvertently discovered a method of producing salt from sea water . Still produced and hand - harvested to ensure the old world traditional salt with the distinctive flaky texture and taste that lends a certain piquancy to virtually any dish . flake salts have dry , thin , parchment - fine brittle crystals that create bold , sparks of taste when eaten . Typically used as a finishing salt , it provides a snap of texture and a brief explosion of pungency to fresh vegetables , green salads , or wherever a more vibrant , salty presence is desired .
5 #### I use Turmeric daily and really like this brand . Turmeric has many health benefits and I also take in capsule form .
5 #### Really good product that stands behind their name I 've used this brand for many years now ... Really healthy too ! ! ! ! Add it to you fish brings out the flavior ! ! Thank you , David
4 #### It helps me get rid of excema mixed with castor oil .
4 #### I use this in eggs and any other thing I cook for the nutritional value .
5 #### Just what I 've come to expect in terms of quality . A brand you can trust .
4 #### very good ! glad I bought through Amazon . nice and pungent without over powering .
5 #### Excellent . I like to use this salt to finish off my steaks
5 #### Much better pricing than competitors . Smaller crystals than I prefer , but much better price .
5 #### just what i needed great in eggs and stuff
4 #### I am just learning to use turmeric , but the product seems to be very good .
5 #### I cook alot and have tried many brands of fish sauce and this is by far my favourite - light and delicate and adds a subtle and rich element to many Thai , Vietnamese and other dishes . Most other brands that I have tried are more overpowering and pungent and tend to dominate the dish rather than enhance ( at least to my US taste buds ) . Also tends not to accumulate too much of the sediment that accumulates in most bottles of fish sauce which is even more strong and pungent that the rest . This also gets delivered very quickly and nicely and after buying half a dozen bottles or so , none have been broken . Highly recommended .
5 #### This is a really big bottle . Two in fact ! I really needed a smaller amount but it does n't expire for 2 years so I suppose I will be making a lot of Thai food . Anyway , I bought this as my grocery store did not carry it and I was making Thai food . The recipe turned out really well . Now I am looking for more recipes to use this in .
4 #### I 've used all kinds of fish sauce over the years but I think Three Crabs is my new favorite . It has a nice fish flavor yet is n't overpoweringly salty like some brands . That 's a plus when you want to add soy sauce to your Asian food in addition to the fish sauce . The ingredients are water , anchovies , hydrolyzed wheat protein ( secret name for MSG ) and sugar . I wish it did n't contain MSG , so I 'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 . The price for two bottles is $ 16 , but you get two 24 ounce bottles . The average recipe calls for a couple of tablespoons so it will last a long time . If you cook lots of Asian food like I do , give this tasty fish sauce a try !
5 #### I love frontier products ( they hail from Iowa ! ) The turmeric itself is perfect for my usage . I take a tsp and down it in a bit of hot water every morning just in case the reports about turmeric reducing inflammation are true .
5 #### Really good stuff . I love to make curry home fries with tempeh and good turmeric + curry powder make all the diff . This is fresh and pungent , others seem a bit more dried out . I like this one .
5 #### turmeric is good for the brain and reducing inflammation , I have no complaints .
5 #### wonderful for putting a nice finishing touch on your baked goods . Maldon salt has a really nice texture and mouthfeel . it 's very delicate . I put it on top of my cookies and ice cream :)
3 #### It 's just salt , a little chunky but not really what I would consider flakes .
5 #### Use it in every thing to help with ' arthur '
3 #### I mean if you are into turmeric , this is it . I 've used it several times and I do n't really get the fuss . I know it 's good for me , but it really has little if any taste to me and what I do get is bitter after notes , especially with rice . Also , it will stain anything you got it can get on . Your sing , your dishes , your rice , your rice cooker , your shirt or the back of your hand , if it can get on it , it will stain it . I think this will last me for sometime while I experiment with what to do with this to keep it in my diet .
5 #### This salt takes whatever dish its on up to a new level , my new go to finishing salt , crunchy and bright taste . I never knew simple salt could be so gourmet , this is an extraordinary item I will never be out of thanks amazon for stocking . I brought some home from Spain and did not want to run out , how awesome to know I never will since I can prime it ,
4 #### What can I say ? I like it . It 's natural and it 's a healthy herb known to fight / ward off cancer . Only wish it was organic , but one ca n't have everything , can one ? Overall , a worthwhile purchase I do n't hesitate to recommend to others .
4 #### We really like Hummus and we wanted to try to make it on our own . This should be really good .
5 #### i m very happy , . its alot cheaper then the stores i go to , very fresh ! ! fast delivery ! , I use it like garlic salt or powder ! I use it in rice in My rice cooker to make yellow rice instead of saffron
5 #### The best price here on Amazon . The quality is the best too . You do n't need to go to the store . You will get the best product at your door . Sprinkle on your yogurt , mix in your milk , use it for color for baking bread , cookies , etc . Enjoy !
5 #### The perfect finishing touch on salted caramel chocolate chip cookies . Yum !
5 #### I will order many times again . Great value and I like the crystals ' size .
5 #### Love these flakes . Perfect for baking and cooking - from cookies to making one 's own butter to on bread .
5 #### I love the Maldon Sea Salt . This is the first time we ever tried it and we are now fans ! I like to use it in tuna salad and potato salad . I can never seem to have enough salt in those two dishes but with these flakes , there 's a nice crunch of salt that you can actually taste !
1 #### Fine cut , diamond texture whatever , it 's missing the thing vital to really be popcorn salt and that is the flavor that true popcorn salt has . Slightly buttery , very strong , and always good . There;s a trend lately to re - lable regular salt as popcorn salt , this trend needs to stop .
4 #### I love this salt and use it on my french fries as well as on popcorn . It is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other " gourmet " salts , but it is only 15 cents per ounce , not 15 dollars . Note that this salt is flaked , unlike the normal crystals for which Diamond Salt is known . It absolutely CLINGS to the surface of the popcorn , fries , and other similarly - textured foods MUCH better . It has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and CLEAN is always good in my book . As a treat , I sometimes Iick the tip of my index finger , sprinkle a little of this on it , and then pretend like I 'm getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter , but without the lime . Almost like a couple of hours on the beach . I can only give it four stars instead of five because it is NOT IODIZED and you could end up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you do n't get enough iodine . This is not a problem for people who eat a lot of seafood , but if you live in the Midwest far from the ocean it could cause some difficulties .
5 #### I love this salt . It is easy to use , the flakes are much better than grains because it helps from over salting . I even gave some to family for Christmas stocking stuffers and they loved it .
5 #### Some cookies with this and it turned out delicious . It 's salt .
5 #### I love using this as a finishing salt , and I have used it for years . The little pyramids of salt sprinkled over , say , a steak fresh out of the pan looks impressive . Sprinkled over a salad , it adds a little bit of extra crunch and flavor . Very nice salt , highly recommended .
5 #### This salt is so good , I eat crystals of it plain sometimes .
5 #### Just like the theater , I actually saw the same container there . It does n't cake up either .
5 #### Wow ... tastes like no salt I have every had before . So good ! Just takes a small pinch ... it can be overpowering if you splash it on like regular table salt .
5 #### I just love this sea salt . I fill my salt grinder with it . I use it to tenderize steaks , Fabulous flavor . Great product .
5 #### Perfect sized salt granules for popcorn . Why did I wait so long ?
5 #### This is the best all around multi - purpose salt . Wonderful on anything .
5 #### Fancy Salt . Not sure that I need it , but the flakes are fun . Is this better than kosher salt ? Um , it is salt . Do I use less salt , no probably not . Would I put this in pasta water or when cooking a stew ? pretty pricey . But on a salad , I like it . And I keep buying it ...
5 #### This is lovely salt ! I can not have pepper or many other spices , so I 've indulged myself with these flakes . I keep them in a round bamboo container and use a tiny stainless steel spoon to sprinkle it on my food .
5 #### Processed to have uniform flakes and no clumping . Lovely finishing touch .
5 #### This is my favorite sea salt at a really good price .
5 #### Perfect , light and flaky . Works well with assorted recipes .
4 #### When i buy nuts in bulk , i prefer to get unsalted so i can add the amount i want . This stuff is ground to a powder and sticks great .
5 #### Was reading chefs recommending this product and I had to try it . FANTASTIC ! ! For gourmet cooking , seasoning all your favorite dishes .
5 #### I usually use Flavacol popcorn seasoning ( available on Amazon ) , but I purchased this popcorn salt to use when making popcorn for health conscious friends when they cheat a little on Movie Night . I did n't want to try to explain the artificial coloring and artificial flavoring in the Flavacol . I popped a batch of popcorn using organic popping corn ( Great Northern , available on Amazon ) , organic coconut oil and this popcorn salt . I was impressed ! Simple as this treat was , I think I liked it as well as the popcorn made with Flavacol . I used a stove top popper with a hand crank to stir the popcorn as it 's popping , and I simply dumped in the ingredients and started turning the crank . The very fine grain salt was very uniformly applied to the popcorn and it adhered very well with no loose salt in the bottom of the bowl afterward . I used 1/2 cup of popping corn , 1/4 cup of coconut oil and 1/2 teaspoon of popcorn salt . Delicious ! It 's also a fairly healthy snack . If you want some variety , try adding garlic powder , onion powder , nutritional yeast ( sort of cheesy / savory ) , smoked chipotle powder ( caliente ! ) , taco seasoning , etc .
5 #### Finally , a salt that sticks ! Well done . I used to have to spray oil on the nuts , then salt and bake to get them how I liked . Now I just poor salt on and I 'm good to go .
5 #### Very fine salt . A lot finer than morton 's popcorn salt .
5 #### This is good stuff ! Very finely milled salt so it sticks to popcorn really easily . I love it . The $ 7+price is AWESOME compared to paying like 2.69 for 4 ounces of the little bottles at the grocery store . tastes fine too .
5 #### Although I am Satisfied with the salt ... I do believe product packaging needs to be re evaluated as it does not appear to hold up well I had to request a new box as the first one was busted open all over the bottom of the box it came it . the replacement I received also had issues the box was broken open but the bag of salt inside was still intact
5 #### I use this extravagant salt on any stir - fried food ( e.g. steak , teriyaki and etc . ) . It 's a wonderful coarse sea salt that 's going to boost up your appetite . Worthy investment :)
5 #### A magic ingredient for all types of cooking ! We love maldon flakes !
5 #### Love this salt . Give that extra crunch and not too salty .
5 #### This is really , really good sea salt and it 's different in that it is salt flakes rather than salt granules . I like this even better than Penzeys grey sea salt . A little goes a very long way ; be extremely judicious .
5 #### salt flakes , not the usual salt shaker salt . this salt has a tang to it , a slightly mineral flavor that is different from table salt and gives food a wonderful and tasty flavor . be careful not to use too much as the flakes are larger than regular salt . you will find a million uses for it .
5 #### Love the fine crystals for my hot air pop corn
5 #### fantastic sea salt , have bought many times , french sea salt way tooooo expensive , this I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ...
5 #### Maldon is a great supplier of Sea Salt Flakes .
5 #### Purchased online because I could n't find it locally , Maldon sea salt flakes are the best " bang - for - the - buck " table salt alternative . Milder than regular salt , the unique flavor and texture add a new dimension to meats and vegetables . Delicious !
5 #### High - quality sea salt with a great flake ! ! Perfect for finishing savory dishes and baked goods .
4 #### its ok , it does n't stick to popcorn that well
5 #### I wanted a tasty light - weight salt for my air - popped popcorn and a friend recommended this brand . I could n't find it in the stores so I was happy to run across it on Amazon , and at a reasonable price . Wow tastes great and covers nicely . I even find that I use less salt , so that s a plus . I pair it with Winona Pure Popcorn Butter Theater Style spray - $ 2.67 at Walmart . Its low - calorie and helps the salt stick to the popcorn . Yummy ! I also use this salt on potatoes , veggies and meat . The large container will last forever . I ve passed on the recommendation to friends and family and they ve also fallen in love with it . You wo n't be disappointed with this one .
5 #### I use it for my popcorn . This will last me a long time .
5 #### My second favorite sea salt . So tasty and delicious ! I love to sprinkle it on bread slathered with unsalted butter .
5 #### Searched for a flake that could really get the job done . This is so far beyond table salt . I wondered if the flake would survive shipping , it did . Covers the tongue with tangy mineral goodness !
3 #### Kind of a gimmick thing , I feel . The flakes take a minute to melt into the food it 's put on . Not knowing this , I over salted lots of food initially . I had heard such rave reviews about flake salt . It 's ok , but , for me , I still prefer to grind sea salt . It 's definitely not bad tho .
5 #### It 's a fine salt , exactly as it should be for popcorn . And possibly a lifetime of it . It 's exactly what I wanted .
5 #### Excellent fine salt for popcorn and peanuts . I love salt and love putting this on chips , and almost everything .
4 #### I liked it . I ca n't say I loved it , as it turns out I prefer bigger kernels and this one is small . But it 's a tasty one , especially if you prefer smaller kernels .
5 #### Salty , beautiful , great on pictures and on the eyes . Awesome .
5 #### This is good popcorn , small and flavorful ... I pop it in the microwave with no oil and I add popcorn salt on after it is done . Yummy ! ! Only 110 calories and whole grain good .
2 #### My family was put off by the musty taste of this popcorn . It was chewy / stale in nature . The tiny seeds do not pop well in hot air popper , I 'd estimate 30 - 35 % failed to pop . Pan popping resulted in about 75 - 80 % popped kernels .
5 #### it 's great popcorn . It does NOT pop big .. the are small kernels . but the taste is good and since it 's hull - less ... no floss needed !
5 #### I own a nut vending machine . Everyone was complaining because the cashews did not have enough salt . This salt was the perfect answer . It is like powder and blended well .
5 #### You will love this popcorn salt , makes popcorn taste just like in the movie theaters .
5 #### Simply the best cooking salt out there ( within reasonable price range )
5 #### We love this salt and will be buying more of it !
5 #### Pops very small kernels but so tasty and have popped it 3 times so far and I have n't gotten a single hull caught in my teeth . This will be our special occasion popcorn given it 's price and the volume it makes ( small ) . Used with coconut oil and a little truffle salt and this is just decadent !
5 #### this is a good pop corn with small shells this is good pop corn with small shells and we enjoyed it
5 #### This Amish Country Ladyfinger popcorn is subtle in taste . The size of the popped corn is quite small . I have yet to get a hull stuck in my teeth ; yes , there are still hulls on the corn but they are insignificant . For example , at the bottom of the bowl I see a few hulls . I touch them with my finger and they break apart / crumble . With regular popcorn the hulls are hard and have a sharp edge and they do not break or crumble when touched ... and they stick in my teeth . With the Ladyfinger popcorn they literally crumble and have no hard or sharp edges . The seeds are approximately 1/4 inch long . The Nutrition Facts on the bag say : 3 tablespoons , 110 calories , 1.5 g total Fat , 10 mg Sodium , 27 g Carbs , and 4 g Protein . There were no additional instructions / suggestions on how to prepare it . Personally , I like making my popcorn on the stovetop . I have used a method recommended by other popcorn : heat 1 tbsp oil in pot on high with 4 kernels , once the kernels pop lower heat to medium and add the rest of your kernels . Gently shake the pot every minute or so . Once the popping slows to 1 - 2 per second , turn off heat , continue to gently shake pot until all popping stops . Pour into bowl and season as desired . This method seems to produce the least amount of unpopped kernels as well as reduces the chance of burning the popcorn .
5 #### Smells like eukalyptus leaves but not overwhelming . It 's chopped in small almost quarter inch pieces .
1 #### I was so disappointed when I received my order because there is basically no scent and the leaves are quite faded . I love this company for other things but I can not recommend this product for using it . I would return it but I already threw the package out . I will need to find eucalyptus leaves elsewhere . I purchased them specifically for placing throughout my home .
5 #### I LOVE this popcorn . There are hardly any hulls and I like the very small kernels it pops into . Delicious !
4 #### The taste was good and its interesting that its much smaller than what I usually have . Although I personally think that Trader 's Joe and Eden are big fluffy which I prefer
5 #### Expensive , but just as expensive as it would be in the stores . It 's a pretty hefty amount though . It 'll definitely last for a long time .
4 #### Thankful for Amazon & the availability of products like this . As a care - giver I do n't have the freedom to physically get out & go shopping , so when I find a fun recipe that calls for something a little different , like this , it 's great to be able to have it !
4 #### Fancy sea salt . I like it ! I have to thank Red from Orange Is the New Black for this recommendation .
5 #### Best salt around , if you bake bread this is a must have salt !
5 #### We eat a lot of popcorn at our house . Buying those little 3.5 oz bottles of popcorn salt at the grocery store was n't making much financial sense , so I bought this large 24 oz pack from Amazon . A way better deal . Salt is salt ; why pay more than you have to ?
4 #### its a bit pricey , but it works like no other for popcorn ! Regular salt just rolls off of popcorn , and this seems to grab better due to its powdery form
5 #### I really ca n't describe it but this salt tastes wonderful . There are no added flavors or artificial colors which is great for me because with my allergies and asthma , I can not tolerate additives like yellow # 5 . This salt is super fine and coats the popcorn perfectly . It does such a good job that popcorn is good without butter .
4 #### Great on nuts or anything needing a salt cling . But it does n't stick to air popped popcorn .
5 #### Very good , very strong herbs , well packaged , good delivery / on time - highly recommended .
5 #### Maldon makes everything better . It 's much better than typical sea salt -- these look like snowflakes ( well , ice flakes ) and pack a nice briny punch that makes for a great look and taste .
5 #### This salt sticks nicely to nuts and popcorn . Picky I know , but it works .
5 #### All it takes is the tiniest little sprinkle , but this salt packs a punch ! Be careful not to use too much , as it can ruin your popcorn . But if used just right , it can make a whole bowl the best part of your movie .
5 #### Great stuff , perfect for popcorn . We eat a lot of popcorn but I do n't know what I was thinking trying to use table salt before I discovered this stuff !
5 #### great deal for the money .... will last a long time . prompt delivery as well .
1 #### I have used a screen popper over heated coils for 50 years ... then add unsalted butter and popcorn salt . Perfecto ! Too many of these did not pop fully to cut the mustard . Perhaps hot oil fans will have more success . Or hot air poppers -- but being so small my guess is these kernels will exit before popping ? I ended up with too many old maids that tested the ivory . Also , I usually use 1/3 cup of popcorn to fill the screen popper . I used OVER 1/3 cup for this and only filled the screen 3/4 full -- my first clue that too little popping was going on . My guess is that the smaller kernels are trickier to pop fully . My search continues . Next up is their Baby Rice . My dentist is loving it . Using our new microwave PowerPop gave much better results ! Because of this I 'd up my rating to 4 or 5 . Next up is our new Hot Air Popper with the advice to pre - heat the unit AND tilt slightly for such small kernels .
4 #### I love this type . It pops up very small but is so soft , not at all tough and it really tastes good . I 'm a huge fan .
1 #### I 'm a popcorn gourmet but this is HORRIBLE . Was elated day I received so popped one batch in oil in pan . Very tiny kernels that only 1/2 pop & very little product when finished . This is NOT HULLLESS ( but maybe no popcorn truly is ) This popcorn made my mouth so sore I could n't eat for 2 dys & gave me terrible tummy upset -- which I had to go to Dr. about . Writing Amazon about this product . Beware ! ! Will return this product
5 #### Amish Country Lady Finger popcorn is not hull free but we had to search to find any ! This product arrived quickly and well packaged . It is crisp with a mild flavor everyone seemed to enjoy . Anyone with dentures will appreciate this product , I should think .
2 #### The kernels are very small , much smaller than movie theater popcorn . There are also a lot more unpopped kernels and because the popcorn is so small , it tastes like I 'm eating larger hulls because the ratio of kernel to hull is closer . This is the worst of the three Amish flavors I tried , with Baby White as the clear winner . Skip this and go straight to Baby White .
5 #### If you love to cook at home and are passionate about your dishes then this is a great salt . It is a finishing salt , so a little goes a long way on top of your finished presentation . It gives the dish exactly what it needs . I love it and think you will too !
5 #### Bought two of these one for me and one for my girlfriend we both are popcorn fan . It works beautifully .
5 #### Absolutely the best popcorn salt ! Much better than the Morton 's from the grocery store . Tough to find , so thanks to Amazon for stocking it .
5 #### I really do like this product I use it to make a tea hair mask or to put in my bath but u can drink it but I only do that when I have a cold . ^_^ It just really helps when u have a stuffy nose . Just opens u right up yay u can breath the world will not end to day at least . ^_~
5 #### this salt really makes a difference , its very thin so it actually goes all over your popcorn and does not stay only on the top popcorn as other salts do
5 #### Ca nt beat the size ! I use it to refill my morton table size containers when they empty .
5 #### I 've been hooked on the crunchy pyramid salt flakes for a while now . This was my first time ordering Maldon brand . I could n't be happier . The quality is just as good as what I 've been paying a lot more for ! Whenever I 'm needing to reorder , this is where I 'll come for my Maldon ( crunchy flaky yummy ) Sea Salt Flakes ! * Update Feb 2018 * I ve re - ordered twice . Same prompt shipping and quality packaging / delicious salt . Ill continue to be a repeat customer .
5 #### This is the best tasting salt I 've ever had ! I want to use it a a finishing salt on everything ! I 'm definitely going to buy more .
5 #### Great salt to use on Sea Salt Carmel cheesecake . Arrived quickly . No spillage , packaged well . Sparkly iridescent flakes
5 #### This salt is special ! I love it and have moved to strictly using this for all my cooking needs . It has beautiful flakes and imparts a wonderful flavor that is unique . I 've used dozens of specialty salts over the years and find the Maldon salts to be my favorites ! Consistency . Quality . Worth the money .
5 #### Nice flaky salt . Good flavor and very clean high quality salt .
3 #### I used it twice , it burned both times . The corn that did pop were very small . I do n't think I will be using it much anymore .
5 #### Great product purchased it for my popcorn , unlike regular salt it does n't overpower the actual taste of the popcorn .
5 #### For popcorn lovers everywhere , you need popcorn salt . Regular salt just falls to the bottom of the bowl , forever lost to flavor your delicious kernels . Popcorn salt is the savior to flavorless kernels . Just sprinkle lightly -- it 's easy to add more salt , but impossible to remedy too - salty popcorn .
5 #### This surpasses ALL my expectations ! The best tasting salt . I 've tried most all of em . Pink himalayan , grey , IRISH . I GOT the wee travel tins also they make dispensing and traveling very easy . I was turned on to this from SERIOUS EATS DOT COM
1 #### Absolutely did not stick to the popcorn at all using a hot air popper . ( No butter or oil to adhere to . ) For those who want salt and use butter or oil , it is probably great . Not really trying to knock the product . Just not for us . We were trying to be healthy - ish so we thought a small amount of salt might help . Now we just eat it plain .
5 #### This salt really enhances the flavor of nuts and popcorn . I see these as opposites of a coin and how could it do it . It does it very well . It 's amazing how well it clings . I have n't tried it on air blown popcorn , but on regular popcorn and nuts , it 's a clinger
4 #### This is very , very finely ground salt ... it 's almost ... airy . But that makes it nice for popcorn because it coats more evenly . I oven roast my own nuts and seeds . I found this type of salt is so nice for the same reason as the popcorn use , even coating . Would recommend .
5 #### It seemed expensive , but it really is worth it when you are eating popcorn without loads of butter , but the salt stays on anyway . I makes air popped corn that much better
5 #### I eat popcorn almost daily & this is the best I 've had in a very long time
5 #### I will only eat non - gmo popcorn from now on and if it ever disappears ( thanks to evil monsanto ) , I will stop eating popcorn ( and corn ) altogether . I do n't like the thought of eating " Round - up" .... do you ?
4 #### Good salt flakes . These are good for a finishing touch to your meal .
5 #### It is really tasty , I use it as a finishing salt . Too a long time to get it then I found it at a couple of stores like Sur LaTabl
4 #### The salt is good and the flakes are large . I would give it five stars except that I prefer smaller flakes
4 #### Flimsy box arrived crushed and torn ; looks old and abused in my cabinet . Product inside plastic liner is fine . Nice size ( 1/16 " - 1/8 " ) crystalline flakes great for topping salted caramels or adding finishing sparkle to a savory dish .
5 #### Want amazing looking macro instagram pictures ? You need this salt on your meat .
5 #### It took me so long to find this . No flavors , no sugar , no frills at all . It sticks to popcorn . It sticks to homemade chips . Comes out the perfect speed . Perfect amount the first try . No more gritty salt . Perfect salt . Has a pour spout too .
5 #### At first I thought its just an experiment but now i wo n't make popcorn without it . PROS : * Really does what it says and sticks to most of the popcorn and not like the regular sized salt that leaves waste at the bottom and your popcorn bare . * Hardly any waste at the bottom * Easy pour container has Amazon Prime for fast shipping and reliable product quality * Salt is so small it get caught up inside the grooves of the popcorn which is great for flavor CONS : * when using watch out this stuff is hard to see so if your counters are light colored you wo n't notice its all over the place when your tossing the popcorn for layering as it scatters until it sticks . No other cons to mention I love this stuff and ca n't believe i did n't know about this till now .
2 #### The experience trying to open the popcorn is an adventure in itself . The Amish country popcorn is not very crunchy , no matter how you prepare it . It reminds me of the cheap Safeway brand stuff . Very soft and chewy . I highly recommend Arrowhead Mills Organic Popcorn instead . Also available on Amazon .
5 #### This popcorn pops big full kernels with very little hull . We use cup for 1 tablespoon of coconut oil and have great popcorn . We love this popcorn . I bought my husband 6 different types of popcorn for Christmas . This is the 3rd one we have tried and we will definitely buy it again . It does n't leave any unpopped in our popper so we love that .
5 #### Great tasting popcorn . We do n't be buying any other in the future .
5 #### Much fewer hulls than popcorn you would get at a supermarket . Very good and consistent otherwise , though you do pay for that quality .
5 #### This is a great popcorn . We use it in our microwave popper and there are very few unpopped kernels left . I like the fact that it is non GMO Too !
1 #### i popped one bowl of this popcorn and it was awful . it did n't pop well at all and the popcorn popped up so small . i through the rest of the bag in the trash . i would never order this again .
5 #### For Popcorn lovers everywhere , easy on you belly ! This popcorn is an ' oil ' Popcorn ... not an Air Popper . I got the old fashioned turn - the crank popper , add a little Vegetable Oil ( NOT Canola - it 's too sticky ) , pour into a bowl ... the best , butter or not . I happen to be a butter and salt person !
2 #### When you first add the popcorn for popping it smells just like fresh corn . Since the kernels are very small it does n't pop up to be nice fluffy full popcorn . We were very disappointed and did n't even finish the bowl , unusual in my household . The burlap bag it comes in is very cute .
5 #### I had bought a cool Tupperware type thing to make popcorn in the microwave a few months ago and no one in my family was ever remembering to make popcorn for a snack . So I bought this salt and a. Couple other flavored salts and arranged them in a prominent place on the counter . My husband and kids very much like this brand of popcorn and nut salt and now they are making popcorn a lot !
5 #### Always perfect salt . Great for topping baked goods or anywhere coarse , flaked salt is needed . Repeat purchase .
5 #### Best salt for finishing dishes that I have tried , and I have used most of them as a chef . Excellent consistency , clean , fresh salty taste with no aftertaste that is common from other sea salt products . Highly recommend this product and seller .
5 #### I never would have thought I 'd be a salt evangelist , but I push this stuff on every friend and relative that makes the mistake of engaging me in a cooking discussion . I 've actually given this stuff as a Christmas gift ; it 's impressed me that much . I 'm the type that shudders at terms like " mouthfeel " , but damn it , it really does add something incredible to a well - cooked steak to have a slightly crunchy layer of really tasty salt on the top .
5 #### Salt is not just salt ! This product has beautiful crystal shape and exquisite taste , at least on my palate . Salt dissolved nicely when mixed into food , no gritty mouth feel , this salt also served to create a nice presentation when used as a garnish because of its large thin crystals .
5 #### Heaven on earth ! I primarily use this on popcorn , but anything else that I added it to has been really good . In addition to particular uses for this very finally grained salt , I also use coarse salt for other things . Having a selection is a good idea and very nice when you 're expanding your cooking skills .
4 #### Diamond Crystal Popcorn & Nut Salt . I eat a lot of popcorn and this is the best popcorn salt I 've use . Very fine . That being said , the packaging leaves a lot to be desired . The spinner that opens and closes is not connected and sits loosely atop the cannister . Also unlike in the past there is some clumping .
5 #### Best salt for popcorn . Use it sparingly . I kept an old Reese popcorn salt shaker to refill from this large container .
5 #### This salt is a must for popcorn or toasted nuts . The salt is ground to near powder consistency makes popcorn taste consistent and does not taste grainy like regular salt .
4 #### Good fine , or actually extra fine salt for popcorn , nuts , vegetables or anything . Use sparingly , you will find you will not have to add quite as much and it distributes very well .
5 #### this is so nice salt is so light actually flakey great for home made popcorn , ca nt wait to use this
1 #### As another reviewer wrote , I too ordered this salt since it has an ultra - fine texture . It arrived in a flimsy box laying on top of a popcorn popper box . A slight hit on the box during shipping and the salt container was damaged . I did not realize that " This item is not eligible for return . " , not until I needed to return it or have it replaced . I do n't know if the product would have been good or not . I just know that I threw away my money this time and had a mess of salt to clean up . Keep in mind that grocery products purchased from Amazon can not be returned even if the packaging was poor , at best . 10/18/2013 EDIT : Please see comment from Mrs. Kilo on my review .
5 #### Just a pinch will do to add delicious flavoring to your food . Very unique taste !
5 #### I have reviewed plenty of salts for Amazon , both ones I have purchased and ones I have been offered to test as a result of my verified purchase ' product reviews . My ' gourmet ' cooking salts experience began with Maldon and I discovered the product by watching cooking shows featuring British chefs a good few years ago . As a ' Francophile ' ( lover of French products and cooking and Julia Child ) I switched to pricier French sea salts . I still feel they might offer a bit extra ... but I have gone back to Maldon 's star - shaped pressed crystal salt because most ' upper end ' Amazon customers will find this salt to be just fine and more reasonably priced than the French alternatives I also love . Maldon has a clean , non - iodized briny flavor and a crush - able texture that allows sprinkling or strewing over meats and vegetables . Very possibly this is the price / value champion for every day use .
5 #### This stuff is amazing . Super thin flakes for finishing . Fantastic on just about anything that could use finishing salt . I love it on my eggs !
5 #### So , I wondered why anyone would pay top dollar for this salt . I mean , it 's just SALT for crying out loud . I already have a couple of sea salts , as well as the ubiquitous pink salt , and I figured that was more than covering the bases on salt . But I had to find out what all the fuss was about , and now I know . This is the angel 's version of salt ; like solid snowflakes with bright and fresh salt flavor ( hey- it 's not really explainable , but I 'm trying ... ) . This is the finishing salt they use in heaven . It 's light , crispy , relatively large flakes of salt which taste very pure . Comparatively , the iodized stuff in the round box ( that we all grew up with ) tastes as though it has been in that iconic box since the beginning of time . This is tactile , and more fun than I 'd like to admit to pinch and grind between your fingers onto your food . I would n't recommend a grinder , it 's too fine for that . It arrives in a plastic bag contained in a rather flimsy outer branded cardboard box ( that is NOT the shipping box- just the product itself ) so you will need something to store it in . A non - metal , non - plastic salt cellar is the thing for everyday use .
5 #### We 've tried every kind of salt imaginable for a variety of cooking . This salt is excellent on popcorn and veggies . It is so fine that it gives you all of the flavor without that crunch . A little goes a long way so be careful when pouring from the container . About the container ... Put it in something else if you can . Just remember - those cute theater shakers rust to beat the band . If you are going to use them - unscrew the lid when finished and cover the container with a baggie - then screw the lid back on . Keeps the salt fresh and dry and helps the container last longer . Just my opinion of course .
5 #### We love this fine salt for popcorn and french fries especially . If you own a popcorn popper , you must use coconut oil to pop and this salt !
4 #### I bought this to salt some peanuts that I accidentally bought unsalted . It worked out pretty good , though it did n't stick to the nuts . I probably needed to add just a little bit of oil to the bag of nuts to make the salt stick better , but I did n't , so most of the salt ended up in the bottom of the bag . No problem , I just shook the bag a bit before grabbing a handful . Tasted good and the price was right . Mmmmmm .
5 #### I love popcorn salt- It flavors evenly and I feel like I can sprinkle on less since it gives everything such a fine coating . This was a great deal in a large quantity !
5 #### I use this on fresh baked bread with unsalted butter and it 's slightly amazing . I 've also used it on caramel with great results . It 's not something I 'd use for regular seasoning , but when you want a real salty bite . ( Seriously , crackers , NutKao ( a better Nutella ) and a bit of this is a go - to midnight snack for me . ) The item came fresh and flakey , no clumps at all . This is now a pantry staple .
5 #### Love the texture , taste and size of these flakes . The only downside is the bag inside the box tends to leak and salt escapes out the bottom after many uses .
5 #### These salt flakes are delicious . I first tried a tiny pinch on sauted eggs . Although I used less than I would normally have put on with traditional table salt , the taste was extremely satisfying . You get wonderful bright , clean , little pops of salt taste on your tongue . When it 's concentrated like that , it 's far more recognizable and satisfying , and you can use less , and still feel very satisfied . Your mind and body are very aware that you got your salt , unlike when finely milled salt is distributed evenly throughout your food . I was surprised by the sensation . After eating fresh , organic , home - cooked meals for a couple of years , I 've become very aware of that weird " factory food " taste , like you get in Jello , Twinkies , cake mixes , etc . It 's the same with salt . Real , unadulterated food tastes so much better , and unadulterated nutrition seems to be unreservedly welcomed by the body , adding to your eating pleasure . Your body recognizes all the ingredients and knows what to do with them . When you do n't have to subconsciously " tune out " some of the odd chemical flavors , you can really and truly be open to the full taste of your food . I prefer the taste of these beautiful , pure white flakes over pink Himalayan salt and French Celtic sea salt ; I use all three , and this is my " very best " salt !
5 #### This , in my humble opinion , is just about the best salt that there is . It 's quite mild , and comes in lovely small flakes that you can crumble and sprinkle on your food , to give a very satisfying little crunch as you bite into it . So good to see it here .
5 #### Need salt flakes ? These Maldon Sea Salt Flakes are really good I see now why they are the standard for many cooks and chefs .
5 #### Using the right salt makes all the difference when you make popcorn at home . This fits the bill . I know it 's expensive , but I bought this a year ago for my husband and we 're still using it , so I consider it a good buy .
5 #### After trying 2 or three other Popcorn & Nut salts , this one is the best ! Other brands claim to be fine grain , but do n't do the job as well . And here you get a lot for your money .
5 #### LOVE this sea salt ! The salt grains have a neat pyramid shape , making it great as a finishing salt . However , I love it so much , I have made it my everyday salt !
5 #### Very tasty salt , in large delicate pyramidal crystals . An excellent all - purpose salt - the Romans knew what they were doing .
4 #### I love this stuff ! The flakes are a bit bigger than I expected , good - sized chunks in some cases . I really do like having it , though , for that random hit of saltiness . If I ever get around to making salted chocolate chip cookies again , these would be perfect .
5 #### I make popcorns microwaving dry kernels ( without oil ) in a paper lunch bag . Then when they are done , I add salt . This salt , and most likely any salt , will not stick to the dry popcorns , however a tiny bit of oil or Pam spray is enough for it to stick well , and much better than a traditional salt . It also does not clump in the box , and a little goes a long way . Very satisfied and I will definitively purchase again .
5 #### Hands down , the best salt flakes out there . You will not be disappointed !
5 #### Love the flakes ! Love this salt ! Love the price ! I added it to my subscribe and save items to get a discount !
5 #### a gift and loved Recommended in many gourmet recipes - especially the sweet and salty ones .
5 #### I actually bought this for homemade french fries , after noticing that fast food restaurants use a special " French Fry Salt " in their kitchens . This is essentially just finely granulated ( not powdered ) salt . As a result , it clings better to the surface of small foods , and does n't add the crunch and grit of standard granulated salt .
5 #### I am really enjoying using this salt . It has a great flavor . I would highly recommend it . The shipping time was quite long , however .
4 #### This is a " large supply " for me , as I do n't use that much sea salt ... but it is really top quality sea salt for when I do use it . I now have enough to last me quite a while . I recommend this brand of sea salt as it does not clump while it is in storage in my pantry .
5 #### My go - to finishing salt in the kitchen . This add - on price is about half of what Maldon usually costs in a store , making it easy to throw two in the shopping cart to have on - hand as a nice host / hostess gift . Everyone I 've given these to ( and there have been many ) has been thrilled !
5 #### Took a long time to arrive from the UK , but I have to say , the flaky - crustiness of this salt is excellent for finishing your finest baked goods or for topping off a finely prepared dinner .
5 #### Who knew about so many choices of salt ? Great to have the salt actually cling to the popcorn instead of sticking to the bottom of the bowel . I used way too much regular salt , could n't seem to get enough . Then find it all on the bottom ! Will always use this product from now on ...
5 #### This is a superfine salt perfect for salting fresh popped popcorn , nuts , french fries , and other things that you want salt to stick to .
5 #### There is something magical about biting into a steak sprinkled with these salt flakes . It 's about texture . Try it , sprinkle on your food and you will be amazed . Worth every penny , as you will only use a pinch to finish your dish .
4 #### This is a finishing salt . Very nice flakes , great for steaks . I will purchase again when needed .
5 #### Bought this on Cooks Illustrated recommendations and we love it .
5 #### I love this stuff . Makes me feel very chef - like to have it in a covered container by the stove . I use it to finish a dish . The flakes give a nice pop of saltiness to dishes without being overwhelming . To be honest , I mostly use it on my fried egg in the mornings .
4 #### I do n't know , it 's salt ? I 'm sorry I do n't see such a huge difference as maybe some people can . I am not a salt whiz :)
5 #### I have to take extra salt during the day for my low blood pressure and this is my favorite salt to each by itself . I 've used it for years in cooking and really enjoyed it , but when you have to eat salt by itself , you really get to taste the stuff and this tastes great . The flakes are huge , so it looks beautiful in cooking and adds to any dish .
5 #### Great value for money on high quality product , thank you .
5 #### A great tasting salt I use on practically everything !
5 #### My go to when I want big flakes . Consistent from year to year . Always in my pantry .
5 #### This salt is a game changer . I did n't think that salt could make such a difference but it makes any and everything taste so much better . I 've been telling everyone about how much I love this . I 'm telling you , you will never use regular salt again after using this . I actually hide it from my husband because he uses too much and I do n't want to share it - does that make me a bad person ? Perhaps . Sorry not sorry .
5 #### I love flake sea salts . This is one of the best , IMO .
5 #### I love this sea salt for topping cookies and other delicious treats ! I am so happy I can get it at Amazon .
5 #### I used this flaked salt on a salted caramel chocolate cake . I sprinkled it on top and it looked really great . It clung to the frosting and retained its shape .
5 #### One of the best sea salts in the world . It goes superbly on salads or vegetables etc . Great clean taste . Too expensive for cooking , but fantastic for ' finishing ' any dish .
5 #### It is the first time I used this salt . I absolutely love it .
5 #### Good product . Sprinkled on chocolate - caramel brownies . Yummy . Crystals sprinkled on top hold their shape , and do n't melt away . Makes the brownies look even better .
5 #### i do n't subscribe to cable , or magazines , but I do subscribe to buying this salt . I love it . i could n't detect the smokey flavor of the smoked version , so this one does the trick for me .
5 #### Excellent product . Light , delicate and great addition to desserts .
5 #### Great for a perfect finish to many , many dishes both sweet and savory . Thin flakes of salt rather than grains . Gives a great texture when used as a finish . Less than half the price than I can buy at the grocery .
5 #### I love both the texture and the taste of this salt . These big , crunchy flakes are perfect to sprinkle over a meal to finish it before serving . To me , this has just a nice , ' clear ' salt flavor .
5 #### maybe too good . i want to put it on everything .
5 #### This is a damn fine salt ! The texture is divine and is perfect for finishing . It 's got a really delightful , yet delicate crunch that is not too salty .
4 #### Recommended by cooks illustrated.com . This is a lovely finishing salt . However , do n't try to use this when your recipe calls for table salt or just regular salt as it does n't measure the same .
5 #### Love this salt , rub it between my hands over food and the flavor explodes . Ca n't go wrong if you are wanting a high quality sea salt .
5 #### Box was slightly damaged . I 'm ok with that but wo n't be if sending directly as a gift next time .
5 #### My wife uses this salt to cook her gourmet recipes and tells me it is very good , bring out the flood flavors . The five stars are from her .
4 #### great product if you do not mind waiting 6 weeks to receive it !
1 #### The flakes of salt are to big , unless you 're food is very moist the flakes of salt will fall off the food .
5 #### I was VERY skeptical paying 5 $ for a tiny box of salt , but it is definitely worth it . If you just put ONE flavoring on something , this would do . More taste to it than regular salt , and the texture is amazing . Whenever I am going to put salt on top of something , I use this .
5 #### Love the shape of these salt crystals and the zing burst of flavor when you bite into one .
5 #### Really nice flavor and texture . Although the description here says " Simply crush over foods . " I prefer it as received for the large , flaky crystals and crumchy texture . I also prefer it after cooking ; putting it on before or during cooking gives a different effect . Jim
5 #### Tasty , and delicately flaky . A little goes a long way .
5 #### We 've ordered this multiple times and it is our go to for salting all of our food when cooking and finishing diushes .
5 #### I love this sea salt ! It has an almost addictive subtle crunch which adds a layer of delight to the tongue on top of whatever I am eating it with , and it has no harshness or chemical after taste that I have experienced with some other salts . I take a small amount of the salt and store it in my two mini salt pigs on the table where it is easy to take just a pinch of salt when I want it . I then store the rest in a strongly sealed container , because I find that if it is not stored well , it loses some of its snow like consistency and gets too hard .
5 #### Love this ! Totally elegant for sprinkling on food as a finishing touch ! Beautiful , too ! I love to serve it in a crystal pinch - bowl !
5 #### THE BEST for rimming drink glasses , salting fancy dishes and just eating out of the box . It is crunchy , crisp and nice and salty . I would buy this again and again ! Everyone always wants to know where I got this salt - very unique !
3 #### This type of salt was recommended in several recipes . I do appreciate that the flat flakes are better for adhering to certain baked goods ( cookies , for instance ) . However , I do n't find the taste any better than that of regular sea salt .
5 #### A very nice sea salt ~ I love the flake form . It 's especially good if you want to sprinkle it on top and really have that crunch without it feeling like you 're crunching on little pebble , this is THE texture . It works well in both cooking and baking recipes also , what 's not to love ? Came quickly and in sealed condition , I would definitely order again !
5 #### I love this salt . I am a salt fanatic and use at least 15 different types . This is the one salt that I use every single day . The flakes are quite large and thin so it really adds to the dish from a presentation perspective . I wo n't serve a steak or tomato without a pinch of this salt . I just wish it came in better packaging . I do n't use salt containers . The majority of my salt comes in fancy containers . This one has a simple plastic bag inside that is not resealable . Moisture has never been an issue for me . I do live in an area with high humidity but the salt never picks up the moisture .
5 #### I prefer Maldon salt over the French fleur de sel ( which seems to be a tad wetter ) . I like the big flakes which works so well as a finishing salt . I always have a reserve box so I do n't run out of Maldon . I found a small Maldon sea salt refillable tin at Sur la Table which I always carry this my purse for when I 'm eating out because most restaurants only have the ubiquitous shaker of ( Morton ? ) iodized salt . I was pleasantly surprised that Michael Symon 's Lola Bistro has it and brings a little Maldon salt cellar to the table .
5 #### Excellent salt , a must have for anyone serious about cooking .
5 #### This is some top of the line salt . These crystals are formed in a shape of a pyramid , which gives them excellent texture and crunch . This is a finishing salt , meaning that you do n't cook with it , but rather sprinkle on your food right before eating . It is also available in a travel tin with a sliding lid . You can refill the tin with this box of salt . It gives a gourmet touch to your meals - Bon appetit !
5 #### Screamin ' value . Indispensable for just about every recipe I use . I am a veritable " cheapskate " and I found this product to be of very high quality , good value and the perfect accent to everything from scrambled eggs to grilled salmon . Will DEF buy again .
5 #### fantastic salt - nice flakes , somehow I use way less salt when I use this , the flavor is so pronounced , worth every penny
4 #### Great flaky salt . Great flavor and price . Shipping was fast enough ..
5 #### My very fave salts . You can actually SEE the formation of each pice of salt . The taste is delicious . My fave way to serve is sprinkled on homemade ricotta cheese !
5 #### Very satisfied with these flakes , easy to use , very tasty .
5 #### Great taste . Fun to salt when i am crushing the flakes :)
5 #### This time I 've bought this sea salt in 2 pack lots . I find the taste a bit more complex than table salt . I cook a great deal , and am very satisfied .
5 #### I love this salt . Cooks Illustrated recommended it so I got it to try and both the flavor and texture are fantastic espeically using it as a finishing salt . I like it so much that I added it to my orders and regularly have it as a pantry staple now .
5 #### We use this sparingly for all kinds of things - this is a great flavorful sea salt . Awesome with radishes and butter .
5 #### Having lived near Maldon for a number of years , this was the only salt I used . When I moved to the US , I was so happy to find that Amazon sold it . Much healthier than table salt and without the overly salty taste . Still the only salt I use , great for cooking and as a seasoning to my meals . Thoroughly recommend this lovely flaky salt . Better than fleu de sel
5 #### This is the nicest finishing salt ! I 'd tried several others and enjoyed those as well , but this is my favorite so far . The flakes are delicate and snow white . They impart a depth of flavor I would expect from French Fleur de sell .
4 #### Maldon salt is all the rage on cooking shows , cooking magazine , cooking blogs , etc . I bought a box thinking it was going to be something amazing . Truthfully , its salt with great fluffy texture . But in the end , its still just salt ! Buy it if you 're looking for something to impress friends at a dinner party , but do n't expect that it 's going to turn Tuesday dinners into an amazing 14 - course meal .
5 #### This is my favorite salt . Not as overpowering as my Himalayan - which I also use .
5 #### Wow . Just wow . The finish is excellent and have turned Green Beans into a treat for the kids and parents alike . Thank you !
5 #### Searched high and low for this type of fancy salt . I love the large crystalline structure and delicate taste of this maldon salt . I use it as a finishing salt for all of my vegetables , and even sprinkle a bit on my baked goods , trust ... it 's delicious .
3 #### Taste is good , but it is pricier than grocery store even you use subscription . Trader Joe 's pink Himalayan salt in grinder is cheaper .
5 #### This salt is a little luxury that really adds some texture and fun to everyday dishes . These are very thin but large splinters of salt -- they almost remind me of snow flakes in that they start to melt the moment you place them on hot foods . But enough of the flakes stay to add crunch and saltiness . There are no other salts quite like this . Great on asparagus , salmon , tomatoes-- everything , but especially warm things where the flakes melt a little but not too much . When I purchased my first box I wondered how long it would take-- seemed like it would last forever but we like this so much that we found we were using it very frequently . Came to Amazon to order more and discovered that the price here is really good -- the sticker from WS on my old box showed me that I paid about twice there as I did now on Amazon . Maybe that is an outcome of the strong dollar ?
2 #### This is an odd salt . It is too expensive to use for salting the water , say , for pasta . I tried it over the food without grinding , and that did n't work either . I tried in sauces and could n't get the measurement right --- it goes from not salty enough to too salty . Perhaps you 'll have better luck than me . I wo n't be buying this again .
3 #### I ca n't tell any difference in taste than any other Sea Salt I 've ever used , the Maldon brand however does have much larger salt crystals , some almost tiny chunks which you will have to find a way to grind down or it is just too much to get a mouthful of . Not sure I 'd pay this price to buy this brand again . From reading about it , I expected some kind of taste sensation , no , just large chunks of same old sea salt , I guess salt is salt .
4 #### love this salt for all my salted caramel and chocolate recipes
5 #### I love how handy this was to order . The salt is very good quality , and it 's useful to be able to mail - order it .
5 #### Love this salt , great texture and taste , the crystals are like little pyramids , bought this to refill my Maldon pinch tin . Great price well worth the wait .
5 #### My favorite finishing salt by far . It 's almost creamy in flavor and has some crunch .
5 #### It 's the best salt there is . As simple as that . It just gives your food a nice clean taste .
5 #### What 's not to love about Maldon ? Love the crunchy , chunkiness .
5 #### Fun , almost fluffy . Nice for dusting crackers & surfaces of foods .
5 #### Impressed by the quality of this salt . It is both delicate and flavorful . Great with chocolate !
5 #### the perfect finishing salt and I use it to make flavored salts as well . Lemon , red pepper , cumin , use your imagination .
5 #### Like the sea salt - more refined - use it in baking - delivery was excellent
5 #### Simply the best salt ever . I 've tried a bunch & wo n't even pretend to say I can trace all the " nuances " , and " back flavors " there are . I 'll leave that to the pros . Simply put - best salt ever .
1 #### it clumps in the shaker and wo n't come out .
5 #### I 'm a salt sommelier aka " saltmmelier " ;) and I have to say this salt has the best flavor and texture of any salt I 've ever tried . My absolute favorite .
5 #### I collect and enjoy sea salt from all over the world ; I have some pretty amazing hard - to - get salt in my collection but by far this has to be one of my favorites , next to Rokusuke salt ( almost impossible to find ) . Maldon is crunchy and has a slight sweetness to it which makes it appealing on a variety of food , not only visually , but taste - wise . I 've sprinkled it on salted caramel cupcakes to grilled asparagus - heavenly ! ! Lends a salty flavor that is not overpowering if used in the correct amounts ( usually a sprinkle on the food after it 's done cooking ) .
5 #### I love this big flaky salt . It has a clean salt taste , rather than the harsh chemical taste of , say , Morton 's table salt . And it 's just slightly sweeter than regular sea salt . Do n't take that to mean that it actually tastes sweet , though , if that makes any sense .
5 #### Love this Salt Even my husband noticed the difference Nice flakes ! Great Finishing Salt
5 #### Excellent salt that I wish I could get in my local store !
5 #### This is the first ' finishing salt ' I can get behind . I love the [ mostly ] thin flakes . I 've put on so many dishes over the past week . Really delightful flavor and crunch to this salt .
5 #### I love this salt . I keep a little bowl on the counter and just grab a pinch to sprinkle as a finish to my plate . Crunchy and salty .
4 #### Fantastic flavor . Nice , big , white salt crystals . Nice as a finishing salt and is particularly fantastic on fresh tomatoes . This is not my everyday salt as I find the flakes to be too large for that . You do n't always want texture with salt , so I tend to use French Grey as my daily salt , and this for things like seasoning pasta water , tomatoes , salads , and other foods where I either want , or do n't mind , there being a slight crunch to the salt flakes ( or things in which the salt is going to dissolve anyway ) . I gave this 4 - stars instead of five simply because it 's just * good * , it 's not mind - blowingly amazing . There 's nothing wrong with it at all , I just personally rate it 4/5 .
5 #### LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND ITS PRICE CAN NOT BE BEATEN
5 #### I love this salt . It is great to top off any plate that needs a little extra flavor . BUT because they are flakes , you have to crush them with your fingers as you sprinkle it onto your dish .
4 #### The only salt I use for cooking and baking now . Very good quality .
3 #### Always love Maldon Salt , and this was no exception , but the store / shipper beat the living daylights out of it getting it to me . I can only imagine that they were abused by a container Maldon Salt as a child and now fulfill their revenge daily by beating boxes within an inch of bursting before shipping .
5 #### Good taste , real flakes , would buy again , also very good price . Comparable to far more expensive products .
5 #### I can never go back to regular salt again . This stuff rocks .
4 #### I purchased these salt flakes because I had to re - fill the Bodum combination salt and pepper grinder which I purchased a couple of months ago which came with salt already in it . I like the idea of salt flakes , but to be perfectly honest , it 's easier to use Morton Kosher Salt for cooking . The flakes are good for sprinkling on after the food is cooked but that 's about it .
5 #### Go - to gourmet salt , we have used this product for several years since we first discovered it in NY . We keep a container of this and the smoked variety on the stove for use in most all of our dishes , and we always have extra , just in case for gifts .
5 #### It 's the best salt ever ! The flakes are never too hard or too large and it tastes fabulous . Another Subscribe and Save item I 'm thrilled to have in my pantry !
5 #### This salt is cool as it is flaky and adds character when you pinch it over your finished dish .
5 #### This product is used and recommended by chefs worldwide ! ! Excellent
4 #### One of the best sea salts you can find . Mild , minerally taste that adds great flavor to finishing dishes . Use sparringly as a little goes a long way .
5 #### I really enjoy the flavor of this salt for seasoning . It does n't have any sort of bitter taste that some salts have , and it seems to be pure because I have n't had any cross contamination issues as our family has food allergies ( wheat , corn , guar gum , dairy , eggs ) so it has been safe for us to eat , unlike some other salts I have purchased that have corn derived dextrose or other traces of impurities that have resulted in allergic reactions . The Maldon Sea Salt Flakes are just really nice flavored , pure salt .
5 #### The best finishing salt out there . So crunchy . Yum !
5 #### This salt is sooo good . A perfect finishing salt .
4 #### Maldon salt flakes may seem expensive , but they add a special flavor that ca n't be had any other way . And the fact that they 're so finely flaked means that you only need to use a small amount . This is a finishing salt - for use at the table or just before presentation . To use it for cooking is a waste , since what makes it special ( and effective ) is the flaking process . Use regular sea salt for cooking . Well worth the money . Just be sure that you 're getting it from a reliable seller . Some of those here ship from overseas , and if you 're not very careful you could end up waiting the better part of a month for your order . Highly recommended .
5 #### This is a wonderful product , have been using since i discovered it on a trip to NY and saw it in a exotic spice store , we use it for everything cooking , salads etc . It 's the bomb .
5 #### This is such a great tasting salt . I like the texture of it being flaked and how it feels while eating it . Love it on vegetables and meats . I will always have it in my kitchen .
5 #### Fantastic ! I was completely incredulous about salt cubes and salt grinders - it is just a rock people ! - a rock tastes the same no matter where it gets smashed to bits ... but this made me change my view . See ... it is n't about the salt , it is about the texture . Maldons adds a crunch and a burst of flavor you ca n't get from regular sea salt or even table salt . It is a new dynamic to seasoning .
5 #### Great flavor . Nice finishing salts . A little pinch goes a long way . Great price for fancy salt . I have purchased from amazon.com a few times and will continue to do so when this batch is goes too .
4 #### I had a recipe that called for flaked salt . This worked .
5 #### It has interested me for many years that in a society where we know sodium contributes to health issues , our supply of assorted gourmet salts is increasing . In all honesty , for average cooking as in salting water or soups , I grab the old standby of Kosher salt , For applications where the salt is added after the preparation , I often add Maldon Sea Salt Flakes from the UK . My arsenal includes salts from all over the world , but there is something about this one that is my favorite when chocolate items are finished off with salt . Caramels made with salt really pop when the Maldon is used . I 've had Maldon sea salt flakes in my cabinet for many years and doubt that I 'll ever be without it . It 's that good .
5 #### I do n't know why I have always resisted buying this for so many years , I do n't know if the term flake put me off or what but it is SO good . You crush it between your fingers and sprinkle over food . I think this goes great whole on top of sweets like chocolates or cupcakes for the salted caramel flavor - you get a flaky salty crunch that is awesome . I think its great for cooking with as long as you break it down with your fingers , we keep it in a salt box on the counter and it is all we use now .
5 #### Love this salt ! ! I use it all the time now .
5 #### Love the flakey texture , but pretty expensive for salt . Oh well , life 's to short to worry about a couple extra bucks . I 'm willing to spend it for the added enjoyment . Salt lovers will really enjoy this product . Best I 've found .
5 #### I read about this and had to try it , being skeptical none - the - less that it was worth the price . But I love salt and there are so many kinds with subtle differences . It 's hard to describe but the flaky slightly wet quality makes it delicious to sprinkle on dishes and to cook with . It 's really exceptional -- I ca n't really define why , but if you already buy different salts for various parts of cooking and serving food , you 'll appreciate the subtle qualities .
3 #### The gourmet corn is smaller kernels than I like so would probably not buy it again . But with their special oil and the Stir Crazy Popper every kernel pops every time . I will probably return to good old Jolly Time .
5 #### I love the grain structure of this salt . It is not a salt shaker salt . It is a " pinching salt " that I use at the dinner table .
5 #### I use it for popcorn , pasta , corn , meat , etc . Really anything you would normally use salt on , this makes it even better . The texture and size of the flakes somehow makes it taste like superior salt . Like others have said , it does n't have a super strong salt taste , which is nice . Will buy again !
5 #### I had heard of Maldon flakes before but I figured that salt is salt so what is the big deal ? The big deal is that this takes salt to the highest possible level , so light and flakey that it plays on your tongue and greatly enhances the food that it is used on . Just remember that this is a finishing salt so do n't waste it by cooking with it-- use it after the food has been plated . I actually keep a small container of it on the dinner table so that it is always right there . BEST . SALT . EVER !
3 #### This is salt . It is very large flakes of salt . It can be easy to oversalt your food as a result unless you crush it as you sprinkle it on your food . I ca n't say it is any more flavorful than any other salt either . I think I will stick with kosher salt in the future .
4 #### Although it 's really good , I thought it would change the taste of the dish it was being added to just a little more
4 #### I wanted to try this salt after reading all of the reviews . It is a good salt . I do not use it very often as it is a very large flaked salt and I prefer kosher salt for everyday cooking and use .
5 #### Greetings ! I like this salt because it is a status symbol . If I put this salt on the table everyone will know I have excellent taste and refinement . In any case , if Maldon is good enough for the Queen it is good for sure ! Not only because she is a Queen but because grandmothers just seem to know what is good to have in the kitchen . I take a pinch of Maldon salt flakes , crush and sprinkle on foods . Makes the food quite tasty . The texture of Maldon salt flakes is neither too hard nor too soft . Seems just right . I recommend giving Maldon Sea Salt Flakes a try . Cheerio !
1 #### Orville popcorn far exceeds this . sorry i do not like giving bad reviews .
4 #### tiny little popped kernels , but delish ! a bit on the higher price side of things , but if truly non GMO , organic and all that good stuff , a good deal then . note that most all kernels pop . i use a very old Revere ware fry pan with lid , and just enough HOT avocado oil to almost cover these little babies and set the heat at medium high on my new glass top range , cover and POP away ! sometimes a good dinner substitute if desired even . I do n't use butter when cooking them in the small amount of oil , just is not needed ! a taste experience you should try . some use coconut oil , but lends a very coconut taste which i did not care for in popcorn . season as desired , I simply sprinkle sea salt on . ENJOY !
5 #### This popcorn is our favorite for use in our whirly pop stove top popping kettle . Great taste and nice light kernels !
3 #### This is not a complaint about the seller " British Grocery " , just an " advisement " . They are located in Great Britain , and ship from Great Britain . . . so . . . . my order took a month to arrive . I did n't realize that from the start , and should have checked a little more before ordering . I read something about this salt online , and decided to try it . As salt goes , it 's quite " salty " / strong so I do n't have to use much . Personally , I 'm not a huge fan . I 'll probably just use it in cooking , which is kind of a " waste " as this salt is supposed to be used as a " finishing salt " by people who like to add the crunchiness this salt gives to an item . If you 're going to use it for cooking , then you certainly can find a lot less expensive salt to use . But if you like a little crunch . . . . and you like adding salt to things right before you eat them . .. . then this salt is for you .
5 #### Great Salt ! Love the texture , I exclusively use it as a finishing salt right before I serve my dishes . Highly recommended for any foodie or salt lover .
5 #### This has to be the best salt I have ever tasted . I love salt . It is imported from England and comes in 8 ounce bag / boxes .
5 #### Have been looking for some of this salt since reading about it online . Could not find any at a local store so finally broke down and ordered it . It 's nice because some of the flakes are large and some are small . You can also put some in your hand and pinch it into very small granules .
3 #### Not quite the rave that they were supposed to be . The kernals were extremely small and quite flavorless . I was not impressed at all .
5 #### While browsing through a new recipe , I saw Maldon sea salt mentioned and I had never heard of this brand of salt . I decided to do some research on this Maldon sea salt and everything I read about it was all raves and positive . I saw that it was available through Amazon so I decided to order some for myself and some for my daughters who are good cooks in their own right . Although it was shipped to me from England , it arrived quite promptly so the distance should n't worry anyone ordering this salt . I keep a small container on the dining table and just sprinkle it on my food as you would a finishing salt . I 'm one who loves salt , and this less salty version has a very pleasant crunch . A small box of this salt will go a long way .
5 #### This salt has given every dish that I finished it with an extra pop . I was skeptical but it 's worth the price .
5 #### A pinch between cheek & gum will get you through anything . Except high blood pressure .
4 #### This salt tastes brighter and more alive than regular salt . Not something I buy all the time , but its nice to have something a little different .
5 #### This baby white popping corn is so tender . I make it in the microwave with a few teaspoons of melted coconut oil . It turns out fantastic and is way better than the bagged stuff you get from the grocery store . I had to actually go ahead and order more , once I tried it ... do n't want to run out . ! ! !
5 #### If you really enjoy caviar with a salty taste you will LOVE this . The fact that it comes in a huge jar does n't hurt ! Be aware it IS a wee bit salty with a fine " pop " so pair with with goat cheese or cream cheese to " cut " some of the saltiness . You wo n't be disappointed .
2 #### I thought this might be like Paddlefish roe . It 's not . The only use for this is as a little garnish on an omelet or sushi . Maybe mixed with cream cheese as a luxe bagel spread , but do n't make this the star of your hors d'oeuvres spread . It is watery , over salted , and has no pop .
5 #### This is not the salt you want to dissolve in your everyday cooking . What it 's good for is an added salty crunch atop your fried eggs , or other cooked foods . A crunchy surprise in salads and completely marvelous when added to your cookie batter . There you are eating your cookie and all of a sudden you get a tiny salty treat . The sweet and the salty together are unbeatable !
5 #### i first came across these at my parents place . they keep a handful of this stuff in a jar on the kitchen table for dinners and just cooking . its awesome . the flakes are great and slightly thin so if you want smaller grains , you throw some in your hand and just crush them up some more before throwing them onto what your using . i really ca n't think of a better salt personally . now you do n't need to buy the grain salt , then the rock salt for grinding . really a two in one here .
5 #### I was sceptical at first given all the hype in the media . I must say these really are amazing . More about the texture / crunch than the flavor , but I am finding myself adding these to as many meals as possible . Dare I say planning meals around the salt addition ? Yes , expensive in terms of salt , but an relatively inexpensive luxury .
5 #### I love salt ... even though I know it 's supposedly bad for you . I have all kinds of salt at home , pink , black , sea salt , etc . I read about Maldon Salt and have to say it 's the only salt I 'll use now . Has a very mild taste and , well , just love it . If you 're a salt lover you need to try it .
3 #### So I think this salt is fine , but maybe my palate is terrible . It is fine sea salt , but can not tell the difference over other quality sea salts .
5 #### I will never have a pantry without this . An excellent finish to veggies , especially edamame . the crunch really does make a difference . Simply my favorite . Everyone asks ' what kind of salt is this ? "
3 #### A lot of kernals do n't pop , BIG DEAL ! I plant em then harvest the results later , What do n't pop furnishes a years supply of popcorn & the heat does n't affect 90 % of the kernals . TRY it sometime .
5 #### These kernels are small so they take a few more to get a full popped bowl and cooked with extra - virgin coconut oil results in supreme popcorn . Also there are very few hulls to get caught in your teeth ; a plus . Not everyone would agree but the popped corn is more tender and delicate than larger corn . I think regular yellow corn is the worse does n't come even close in quality and taste .
5 #### split bad & cost with 2 friends so made it more affordable - little hulls if any - great as I have crowns - pops nice in my orville redenbacher microwave popper .
5 #### I searched for a long long time in local grocery stores and pursued other avenues because I did not want to buy this online . I had no choice : I had to order it . Seems that since this is such a highly specialized product , you have to order it online . I know more about salt and its process by going directly to the Maldon Salt Company 's website than I ever knew before ! Unfortunately , you can not order directly from them , so Amazon ( being one source ) is how I ended up getting their product . I am not disappointed . I just hope that Amazon continues to carry it in the future . You need very little of this to flavor anything , so this box will last YEARS for me ( unless I store it wrong and it clumps together ! ) . Well worth the $ $ I spent .
5 #### How can you not love Maldon Sea Salt ? This is the real thing and I love it . One of my favorite salts .
4 #### Nice flaky finishing salt with a good taste . The flakes do n't stick on food or melt easily and they seem to end up all over the table and floor . This was highly recommended in the New York Times holiday gift list . Would not buy it again .
2 #### This is the first time I tried it , and it is too fishy and too salty for my taste . Even adding 2/1 parts of butter does not help .
4 #### Strange , I have reviewed this item before - it is less salty than other caviars I have experienced . I do n't get the pop when I eat it , like other caviars . Taste is good . Price is good .
5 #### this was recommended by a friend who said there was almost no " trash [ hulls , unexploded kernels , etc ] . " he was right ! also , just by the way , this popcorn is delicious
3 #### It 's good popcorn but not the best of what I have tried . I like the small popcorn the best but this corn was n't the best . I started mixing this popcorn with my favorite so I like it this way much better .
5 #### This is the best tasting popcorn I have ever eaten . The very best way to fix it is in a hot air popper such as the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Culinair - AP201R - Hot - Air - Popcorn - Maker - Red / dp / B00856PALU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Culinair AP201R Hot Air Popcorn Maker , Red</a > . Virtually every kernel is popped and popped perfectly . After popping spray a little butter flavored spray such as&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Pam - Butter - Flavor - Cooking - Spray-6 - oz / dp / B003M5Y7GI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Pam Butter Flavor Cooking Spray , 6 oz</a>&nbsp;on the batch to help the salt or other flavoring stick to the kernels and salt lightly with healthy sea salt such as&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Celtic - Sea - Salt - Fine - Ground-1 - Pound - Bag / dp / B000EITYUU / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Celtic Sea Salt , Fine Ground - 1 Pound Bag</a>&nbsp;and you will have a very tasty , low calorie and healthy snack ( sea salt is very healthy for your body - Google " Health Benefits of Sea Salt " to find out ) to eat in front of the " Boob Tube " . P.S. Popping this great popcorn in hot oil ruins it IMHO . It 's not only less healthy , but a lot of kernels are let unpopped and what does pop is sort of tuff and not fluffy .
5 #### I bought a bowl to pop the corn in along with this popcorn . And put two handsful in the bowl and set the microwave on Popcorn . But it needed more popping for all to pop , in fact almost twice as much time . But the results are great . Today we will get the seasoning I bought for it and look forward to using it to have a woderful snack while watching TV .
3 #### If you like your popped corn small this is for you . Taste is good and it is crisp yet tender . The only real complaint is it has a disproportional amount of hull .
1 #### I should have known such cheap caviar is going to taste .... cheap . Very salty and has no body or flavor to it . It 's like eating chunks of salt marinated in fish water ... yes that bad . I once tasted a more expensive caviar so I can tell the difference . My husband wo n't eat it after one bite and so I 'm left to finish the whole bottle now . Next time I want real caviar , I better be ready to shed some money . Lesson learned .
5 #### Want to feel like you 're doing better than most ? Buy this caviar , it 's very nice quality !
5 #### I love the texture & snowflakey composition of this truly marvelous salt ... of which a treat is simply to eat it straight out of the package .... also excellent on chocolates & atop buttered bread . Honestly , I am a Salty Dawg & Maldon 's is the best ( HENCE MY PURCHASE OF 2 MORE BOXES ) ...
5 #### This is perfect for making any kind of salted caramel recipes , and I like it for pretzels , too . Glad I found it .
5 #### Do n't waste money on expensive and often inferior designer salts . This salt is good , REALLY good as a finishing salt . I 'm a chef , and I ca nt recommend this enough . If your thinking of trying all the exotic harvested salts , give this a try first . It is just as good as the classics like fleur de sol , while being a fraction of the cost . The only reason to buy the more expensive salts is to have a jar to put this in to fake your hipster friends .
5 #### I absolutely love this salt . I have a little salt cellar that I use at the table , and just pinch some the salt over my unsalted foods , and it gives it a nice zing , clean taste . This is my 2nd box in a year . It 's a good buy for me , I 've cut way back on my salt consumption be- cause of this product , and I will continue to use it , because it also makes ones food so much better tasting ,
3 #### No popcorn is truly hulless , but this one has fewer than most . It 's a little short on taste , though , compared to full - size white popcorn kernels .
4 #### I used to grow the Japanese hulless in small quantities for my stovetop popper . This is the closest I can find . If you are appalled by the shipping cost , like I was , try looking elsewhere for a better deal . For instance , one popular site offers 6 lbs for $ 11.95 with FREE shipping if you sign up for repeating shipments ( which you can cancel any time ) . Try [ ... ]
5 #### I just made some in my Whirley Pop . It really is lighter and crisper than the larger , yellow kernels . None of those large hulls either . The only difference is , it pops up much smaller than the yellow , so you need to almost double the amount of kernels used per pot . Lovely homemade popcorn .
5 #### Use olive oil to cook this , salt it well , and it is the best , most tender popcorn I have ever eaten . I add a tiny bit of butter to mine , but do n't need it . My nine year old daughter did n't like popcorn until she reluctantly tried this . After a few bites , she consumed half the bowl ! I bought mine at a specialty popcorn shop in Long Grove IL , so I did n't have to pay shipping costs , but when it 's gone , I might have to bite the bullet and order it from here .
5 #### Got three different Amish popcorn 's for my daughter 's Birthday .. she is always on a diet , I got her the hot air popper same time ... she & my grandson .. ( he 's 4 ) loved it .. she ate a bowl every night & still lost 15 lbs ! ! not saying it 's a diet food , just satisfiing ! !
5 #### I love this stuff . The taste is salty - but fresh ... nothing like table salt . It enhances anything , but is pretty spectacular on foods where salt is the star . Try a sprinkling on a freshly grilled steak , or a slice of perfectly ripe watermelon . Perfection ! If you have never purchased a finishing salt , this is an excellent one with which to start . It is not as unique as some others , but the price is right and the taste is there for a beginner . It may seem crazy to spend $ $ $ & on salt - but you WILL see a difference !
5 #### Maldon Sea Salt is a wonderful salt , which I highly reccomend , and these 2 salts are a very good deal .
5 #### I bought this for my daughter 's new microwave popcorn popper as a Christmas gift , and she says that it is delicious , but pops up smaller than other popcorn . She likes it a lot .
5 #### This is very high qulity pop corn , I recomend it . Almost all kernels pop and they are a crisp white when they pop . Very healthy and yummy !
5 #### Pops fully , few spare kernels with the traditional stovetop method . Small , fluffy kernels , not a lot of ' misfires ' that are only partially evolved . My wife says they 're a tad too small for her taste , but the kids and I really love this popcorn .
5 #### I love this brand , all kernels pop and they are a nice size , texture and flavor .
5 #### I have not eaten this popcorn or tasted it myself , it was part of a gift for my daughter in Grad School . She likes the fluffy quality of the popped corn and the not so many hulls - also the big bag makes her think she can make it last until Christmas ( that remains to be seen ) without having to buy more . A very good snack for a poor Grad Student
5 #### Crunch , mouth - watering , with just the right size and consistency of flakes . Turns simple bread and butter ( and countless other things ) into gourmet , in an instant . At least that 's what my family says :D Either way , we love them and use them as often as we can . Highly recommended . Foodies , this is a must have if it 's not already in your pantry .
4 #### For the price its good . Do n't eat caviar often but its OK .
2 #### Not what I was expecting . I never had caviar with so much preservatives and food coloring .
5 #### Great chunky salt flakes . I 've come to prefer the flakes over the table salt . Works well in all aspects of cooking and baking . Amazon offers a nice price on these as well . Gives cooking a nice boost .
5 #### The Maldon Sea Salt is perfect for a crunchy , briny finish to your dish , whether it 's a roasted fish , a steak , stew or simple sunny side - up eggs . The crystals are large and flaky , making for a pretty finish to a dish and for great texture on the palate .
3 #### This product had me crapping " blue / green " for 2 days after i ate it . Large amounts of dye that is used in the product make me wonder how healthy this is . Lumpfish should not be considered as Caviar . I would not order this product again ...........
4 #### It 's not Beluga Caviar but its almost as tasty and with similar texture . And its one - tenth the price . In this size the value is even greater , It is so good and reasonably priced that we use it to serve as straight caviar with finely chopped egg white and onion , but we use it with soups , rice dishes , salads and it gives dips a really elegant touch and taste .
5 #### What can I say ? I 'm a cheap date ... I love this stuff ... well - chilled and slathered on hardboiled eggs in particular ... I even add it to freshly made thin - crust pizza ... it 's relatively inexpensive and while this black version ( like the red ) obviously has some added dyes , the " pop " is nice , the flavor salty and I 'll order again as long as the price remains the same ... a fun treat to have on hand when I 'm craving the pop and flavor of lumpfish caviar :-))
5 #### A little smoked salmon , creme cheese and some crunchy bread along with this caviar is awesome . Great product .
3 #### A great option for the price . It is extremely salty ( at least for my taste ) and the colorants used ( blue , red and yellow ) freaked me out a bit . But , all in all this was a good purchase . Ca n't really complaint because if I had to pay for a good / real caviar , then I would have to spend major bucks .
5 #### so I have been wanting to try some different finishing salts as I typically use sea salt for cooking and himalayan pink salt in a grinder for finishing . Maldon is an interesting fun salt to try . It is very light and crunchy . meaning you do n't get a lot of salt in a large flake but you do get a nice crunch . So this gives nice texture without overpowering your food . I find myself cooking with less salt so that we can enjoy finishing salts .
5 #### I purchased this salt for a recipe for pretzel bread , and now it 's starting to show up in other recipes I 've been looking at ! The flavor of the salt is strong , bright and clean . I would advise to use sparingly !
5 #### I do n't know how the Maldon people managed to make salting your food so much fun , but these flakes are tasty and visually pleasing , and just make cooking even more enjoyable . Great finishing salt !
5 #### I was just introduced to this product . I could n't want to get a box of my own . I have a stupid number of different salts in my kitchen , but this is just the best thing in the world . I do n't know why the taste is so wonderful , but it is .
3 #### After reading the reviews , I expected these salt flakes to be really special in flavor and texture . I was looking for a real " flake " that would melt on warm or hot food and blend into the flavor . These do n't . They are too large and too coarse . I would not buy again .
5 #### This finishing salt adds a dimension to food that is nothing more than amazing . Will always have it on my counter to have it handy . It 's used as a gift for my foodie friends they just rave about it .
5 #### This salt is a pleasure to work with , the taste is clean and pure . The coarse crystals give a nice tactile feedback as you pinch them between your fingers to crush them as you distribute them into your dish . I had used Kosher salt for years but after using this salt I 'll never go back .
5 #### The perfect finishing salt for fried or fatty foods like coconut shrimp and beef . Lends a special flavor and texture .
5 #### Excellent , as advertised , delicious , large jar , very happy with this product , would buy again .
5 #### very nice indeed suggest by Momofuku cookbook that I love to create from cooking for days upon days to wow my friends and family
5 #### This is the best salt I have tasted ! I have been using it for years . It has a great flavor . I do n't cook with salt , preferring to take pinches of this as I eat .
5 #### This is my all time favorite salt , and I have tried many kinds , crystals you grind yourself , french salts , etc . This is light and flaky and so flavorful , but not strong .
5 #### Wonderful and just right for cheese making ! I have used it so far when I make cream cheese , it 's perfect and blends easily .
4 #### Fantastic for the price ! So much better than Romanoff which is usually gummy .
1 #### Worst tasting caviar I have ever had . Three it away .
5 #### Really good . Used it ( along with the red version ) in caviar pie ( see Charleston Receipts or any Southern Junior League cookbooks from the ' 60 's ) at Thanksgiving and the crowd nearly forgot to eat turkey . Now it 's the on - demand app for any / all holiday gatherings .
5 #### A nice big jar of delicious little caviar eggs . Very pleased .
3 #### It 's OK . I should have bought red color . Toshiko Hall
5 #### This salt has a really nice look on dishes , but it also dissolves quickly . It has a very crisp ( I do n't know if that 's the right word ) taste and I could tell the difference between the flavor of this and other salts . It did blend nicely with the dish though . I think it 's a pretty good size , it should last me for a few months with somewhat regular use .
5 #### This is great tasting salt and this bag will last you a long long time . I grid it with a hand grinder and use it all the time .
5 #### The flakes really melt in your mouth and give a crunchy little salt burst that is amazing . Great on steaks .
5 #### This salt is a great finishing salt for sweet or savory foods . It flakes well between the fingers and has a pure taste . I buy on amazon because it beats out my local grocery price any day . I will be buying again .
5 #### always perfect ! have purchased many times . Please hurry with reorder :)
3 #### I love salt which is a good thing . These are on the salty side . Cheap and tasty but not a ' caviar ' experience . I love it with cucumbers instead of bread as a no - carb alternative to other salty snacks .
5 #### I am posting this product review because some of the other reviewers have problems . Firstly , using stainless steel utensils does not affect the great taste of this caviar at all . Also , comparing this product with others is foolish because its like comparing horses with cows . A review should be based only on the merits of the product being reviewed . Reviewers who try to impress others as being " food smart " are not smart . This ROLAND Black Lumpfish caviar is excellent quality in every way . Try it on Roland hard boiled Quails eggs split in half , with black pepper and paprica , from Amazon of course .
5 #### this is the classic " gourmet " salt . It is very coarse and hard , so this is not a finishing salt , nor should you use it in an application where it ca n't sufficiently dissolve . It has a very bold salty taste , so a little goes a long way !
5 #### We had a recipe that called for flake salt so thought we would try it ! ! Love trying new culinary stuff !
5 #### this is very tasty with hardboiled egg , or on crackers with cream cheese . i have eaten this all my life .
5 #### I 'm a pedestrian eater of caviar and was very pleasantly surprised by this product . It 's a good buy for the price and tastes as good / the same as any lumpfish caviar I bought at the grocery store for twice the price . It is quite tasty on toast with a little cream cheese . This caviar has a nice little pop , does n't smell and is not too salty ( and I 'm fairly sensitive to salt ) . I also have n't had a problem with the coloring that others have commented on . Keep in mind , with respect to taste , I 've never had caviar from the Caspian Sea ( as far as I know ) . Also , the jar I received states that this is a product from Iceland . Update : If you 're worried about size and storage after opening , we just finished a jar that took almost 3 weeks to finish from the day we opened it . The only thing I noticed was that the faint fishy smell became a bit more pronounced as time passed , but it was still good & tasty on the day we finished it .
5 #### I use this Maldon salt nearly every day ! It is perfect for finishing , so you get that beautiful crunch from the perfect little salt flakes . I would definitely recommend for any cook !
5 #### < div id="video - block - R2A5ZCF8TYZECU " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / B1OWkDs5FyS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/71vM2Hx7U5S.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;Maldon is my # 1 salt for anything needing a noticeable crystal . As you can see ( more photos in the picture section ) , the crystals are large enough to give sparkle while avoiding the classic opaque pretzel salt look . And the taste is much cleaner than pretzel salt . This salt sparkles in EVERY way ! Maldon is perfect to top breads ... before baking , brush with beaten egg and sprinkle some on , adding sesame , poppy , onion , or any savory thing you like . But it does n't stop there . Make your favorite cookie without salting the dough . I 'm showing an almond cookie , but my fave is my lavender or rosemary cookies . Before baking , brush with egg or cream , sprinkle and bake . I bake a LOT , and love this stuff . Feel free to comment if you like this review and want a recipe or tip .
5 #### If you 're a foodie , then you know salts have distinctive flavors just like anything else . Maldon is my favorite salt . I use it on everything ! But , it 's EXPENSIVE in my local grocery stores . After finding it here on Amazon for such a fantastic price and quantity , I 'll never have to do without it again :)
5 #### I 've been looking for some nice sea salt flakes that can serve both as regular salt and add that special crunch as a finishing salt . I would highly recommend this salt ! In a pinch if I 've ran out of my other salt , I use this and it works great ! !
5 #### I have become a huge fan of different salts for different dishes . Maldon salt is one I saw on a cooking program and I just had to have it to prepare the recipe of the day . It performs just as they said it would . I recommend this to anyone wishing to expand their salt collection .
4 #### So far this is he best sea salt . It has a very good taste , no after taste and pinching between your fingers the salt actually gets distributed better than a shaker or grinder . Will keep buying this !
5 #### Maldon is the best for making salt blends and encrusting things in salt ! I 've tried so many others but this is the perfect shape for the best salt base !
5 #### I do n't use a lot of salt -- so when I do , I want it to be good stuff . This is super . I do n't have to use a lot to get the flavor I want -- just a pinch or two . The flakes are easy to " crush " and that seems to release the flavor . Amazon 's price for this is super , too . The 8.5 - oz box lasts a long time for me . Definitely my first choice in salt .
5 #### This is a nice finishing salt for all your cooking needs . It 's big , flaky , and crunchy and goes well with just about everything . It 's the real deal .
5 #### I bought this partly because my pink Himalayan sea salt , while fine for cooking , has a tendency to coat my fingers when I pinch it to spread on food . Salt flakes sounded like a better idea . I was right . These salt flakes are more coarse , perhaps a bit larger than sesame seeds but certainly not on the level of corn flakes . They taste fine , have a very nice texture while pinching , and give a delightful crunch when chewed . It 's tough to argue with all this . The container has a certain dclass air about it and would be right at home in a French bistro , so you might not feel a need to get a salt box . One would be advisable anyway , just in case , since box ca n't easily be used as a dispenser once it starts to empty out significantly .
3 #### I did n't find this salt particularly different or exciting especially given the price . I 'm using it but not sure I would order again .
5 #### I love salt . I would not eat it out of the box but I add a lot of salt to my food and this salt is fantastic . The taste is lovely and the crunch is great . I have been using it solely on desserts thus far and I works so well with my salted caramel chocolate torte . A sprinkle on top of the chocolate top makes a world of difference . It did not dissolve or get watery the way regular salt or even other sea salts would have . It stayed crunchy and whole to the end . You can not go wrong with this salt .
5 #### This item features large crystals of salt . When adding to this to any meal , it is best to pour the right amount because a normal intake of salt might be too much in this case . That said , this Sea Salt has nutritious value that rivals&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Sayulita - Sea - Salt - Organic - Coarse-16 - oz - by - RealGoodSalt / dp / B00AYIQH1E / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Sayulita Sea Salt - Organic Coarse - 16 oz - by RealGoodSalt</a > . You will be getting a lot of salt from this product , and you will find out that this item is long lasting .
5 #### The shipping was almost TWO WEEKS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE ! ! ! Product was above and beyond the description . Many of the flakes were still in the quad - pyramid formation ! Soft , flaky , crunchy .... completely everything advertised and more ! Thank you Maldon Crystal Salt Co ! You have a buyer for life in me ! :)
5 #### Fantastic , quality item ! We love it and constantly find new uses for this salt ( lately on top of homemade chocolate chip cookies ) .
4 #### I tried this salt because of a certain cookbook I got that recommended it . The crystals are larger than I am used to but the flavor is very nice . I recommend that when using it you grab a pinch and grind it between your fingers as you put it on food .
5 #### I love this Salt , I always used it in England . My son used to bring it for me , every Easter and Christmas . Now = I buy it direct from Amazon . Wonderful ! !
3 #### I really thought I would love this salt ; I really tried to love this salt : I am just not a big fan of this salt . This salt puts the Sea in Sea Salt ( more so than other sea salts ) -and for me that equates to a C in flavor . I really get an ' ocean aftertaste ' that I do not care for . Perhaps this salt would go well with sea food , but since I do n't eat a lot of sea food it is not for me . Another disappointment for me is the loss of crunchiness when this salt touches anything moist ; other salts seem to be able to hold onto their crunch a little better . I will raise this review if I find a food that embraces this salt 's uniqueness to my liking .
5 #### I have tried Hawaiian , Peruvian , French , South African ( west coast ) salts and keep coming back to this . Every once and a while I like to use black lava or red salt from Hawaii for effect , but this finishing salt has a wonderful texture and is a fraction of the price .
2 #### because of the shape of the crystals makes it is difficult to get a even spread . Some parts of your steak are saltier than others . It does have a nice crunch but the taste is not so special , to my buds anyway . I prefer French Grey Salt for taste and since it is a fine grain it can be ' applied ' evenly . Not to mention the price 17 bucks for 5 lbs delivered .
5 #### Best salt ever ! A little goes a long way , and works great in cooking , especially chocolate !
5 #### Having this flake salt on my table is n't a big deal , but when I sprinkle it on my food , it 's a burst of sea saltiness that I enjoy very much , and I know I 'm also caring for my health , in one more small way . I 'm the only one who uses it , so the two boxes last a long time , and I 'm almost out , so I just ordered more . I have other sea salts for other uses . I just realized lately that this one makes an awesome salt to coat the rim of my margarita glass .... also healthy , made with organic fruit juices and 100 % agave tequila . Life is good :)
5 #### Maldon salt is acknowledged to be the most elegant salt made . Irregular flakes make it ideal for finishing although it would be something of a waste to dissolve it in cooking . The flakes provide a ' surprise ' when you encounter them , rather than an all - over saltiness . For another dimension , I recommend trying the smoked Maldon salt . The smoke flavor is much more subtle than the aroma . Maldon flakes occupy one end of the spectrum ... very clean and balanced , while a good Fleur de Sel adds it 's own flavors due to the microorganisms contained in it . Again , it is for finishing and would be a waste for cooking . Both represent the epitome of sea salts . No other sea salts are in the running . Those red and black salts ( colored with clay ) are no more than novelty products manufactured for a curious public .
5 #### There are many different varieties of sea salt out there . What makes Maldon unique is its large , pyramidal flakes . Some people use it for general cooking , but it really shines best as a finishing salt . That means cook with less salt , but sprinkle salt on the finished dish . You really get a chance to experience the unique characteristics ( primarily texture ) of each salt that way , and Maldon has a light crunch that I find very pleasant . Some people claim to be able to taste the difference between salts , but as long as there are no additives , I find all sea salts taste the same . The pleasant texture and relatively reasonable cost make Maldon an excellent choice . Regardless of whether or not you buy this salt , try tasting a standard table salt next to a sea salt . The iodine and anti - caking agents have a distinct and unpleasant bitterness . If you 're not willing to get spendy on sea salt , at least find a salt with no additives , something like Diamond Crystal Kosher salt .
5 #### A Chef recommended Maldon 's as a must have for the serious cook . I could n't agree more . Not to be wasted , it provides a excellent finish to serious dishes .
4 #### I do a lot of cooking and find this a nice touch as a finishing salt to my menu . Good flavor and fun to pass in a little dish for my guests to use .
5 #### Save yourself the trip to Williams Sonoma and save some $ $ , too . I have used Maldon Salt for years . Good product for cooking . I wo n't use any other .
5 #### Slate Magazine has a review on table salts and this was the winner . So I ordered some from Amazon and compared it myself to the brands available where I live , including Celtic Sea Salt . There is no comparison ... Maldon is the standout winner . It is big flaky , crunchy pieces of very tasty salt . This is not a baking salt . It is more of a finishing salt to go " on " foods . It 's wonderful on avocado , steamed yellow squash , baked potatoes ... etc . The Slate reviewer said he loved it the best on chocolate Hagen - Dazs ice cream ! It 's that good .
4 #### Product is exactly as described in it 's literature . Nice flaky salt with a gentle flavor .
5 #### I love this salt ! And for the reviewers concerned about it not melting quickly ... it 's not supposed to . It 's a FINISHING salt . It 's a complete waste to cook with it , plus it 's hard to come up with equivalent measures if you were to use it when cooking in place of kosher or table salt . But sprinkled on a rib eye fresh off the grill , on a pan seared salmon filet just before you serve it , on roasted aspargus right out of the oven , or even over a fresh , crisp apple half - it 's " Na " heaven ! If you already use finishing salts , you know what difference they can make . And if you 're not , it 's an easy way to take your dishes to the next level . Bon appetite !
4 #### This salt is good for putting on top of focaccia . It looks good and has a nice crunch without getting a " rock " in your mouth .
5 #### Man I love this salt . I swear even compared to other premium sea salts there 's something special about this stuff . I have been using it exclusively for a year or so now and have even given it as a gift along with good peppercorns and olive oil and my friends that are n't foodies were really surprised at what a difference good salt makes . Not that this matters but I see this salt being used on Iron Chef America frequently .
3 #### I heard Maldon was supposed to have a wonderful taste . After using it for a while , my husband and I do n't care for the tast so much . As far as the use of it , I was under the impression it was to be used in cooking , but heard later it was for garnishing on a finished plate . When added to a pan to saute , it takes alot longer to melt than kosher salt . Some of the thicker flakes never melt completely , so we get a mouthful of large salt flakes with some bites of our meal ( which I do n't like ) . Used as a garnish , it looks cool but again , it 's way to salty and thick for me to eat . The flavor is a very clean , super salty taste- more salty than the other sea and kosher salts we use . I know it is very popular so I am probably one of the few that does n't care for it .
5 #### Tapioca flour makes great rolls or pizza crust . It is easy to work with and performs well every time . People with Celiac Disease would love this product .
5 #### This product , too , was mentioned by name in " Cooking for Isaiah " as the best tapioca flour to use for making one 's own all purpose gluten free flour . So far , the results have been more than satisfactory , making me miss gluten only slightly , if at all .
5 #### The Good : He loved it . Very hard to find Rhubarb filling without strawberries . Not my thing but it made him happy . The Bad : The Price , but is a specialty item so you should expect to have to pay more . I will order it for holidays and such .
5 #### WEll , it was so delicious we did n't make a pie , we put it on ice cream . In case you 've never heard of anyone doing that , it was DEVINE , a little sweet and a little tart ! Next time , I may do a pie , but in the meantime , you may want to try it over ice cream ! WE LOVED IT that way . Having tried several of their pie fillings , I know that even a store bought crust works for these delicious fillings , of any flavor .
5 #### Got this to try out in some bread recipes that call for it ! ! !
3 #### I think potato flavor in bread is a necessity and this should fill the bill but the flavor is lacking . I use it for White bread but it disappears in 7 grain or wheat where water from boiling potato 's is much better . Good in a pinch though when you do not have potato water . Potato flour is also quite expensive although much cheaper on Amazon compared with my grocery .
4 #### Having never used it before , it seems to help with lightening up baked rolls and such . A pound should last a long time .
5 #### Good price , fast delivery on this gluten - free specialty four . It is hard to find ( except if you buy a 25 - lb . bulk size ) . This is a very versatile flour that can replace grain - based flour in many recipes .
5 #### Really fantastic stuff . I have been baking bread at least once a week for a few years now . Some recipes call for potato flakes . You know the packets of dehydrated potato flakes for instant mash potatoes ? What they really mean is this potato flour . I guess maybe it is hard to find ? ? Comes in small plastic bag . I thought that it would be bigger . Like the size of a sandwich bag . In most of my recipes I use 2 tablespoons in place of the instant flakes . THIS STUFF REALLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE . I also recently purchased some gluten . I now add in 1 tablespoon for everyone cup flour . These days all my loafs and rolls really turn out like a professional quality . I will be buying again soon ! !
5 #### In response to " I wonder if consuming Tazo really does improve a person 's outlook on life and affect his or her well being ? " I think it does ! Whenever I drink this tea I feel happy and warm all over ( especially now , since we 're under 18 + inches of snow ) . The tea is yummy . It took a little getting used to since I 'm a devout coffee drinker , but now my morning is n't complete without a cup of Tazo 's Green Tea .
5 #### Long one of my favorite teas . I like most of the Tazo blends and wish that Starbucks still served Tazo .
4 #### My husband is a coffee drinker and I am very particular about green tea , yet we both enjoyed this delicious Tazo Zen tea ! It 's a great beginner tea , for someone who is not used to the flavor of green tea . I think the lemongrass , lemon essence and min , t was a great addition to the green tea , as they added a slight fruit flavor , that was delicate and in no way overpowering . I have personally bought this many times from my local Publix store and would continue to purchase in the future .
5 #### I used to go to Starbucks to get their green tea every day until I figured out that this is the exact tea they use . I absolutely love the flavor and drink it both hot and iced . I 'm not a fan of anything minty , so the fact that is says flavors include lemongrass and mint means I would never have tried it on my own , but the flavors are perfect . UPDATE : I have been drinking this tea for 6 months now and I 'm still not tired of it ! Love it !
4 #### I love black tea in the mornings but most are pretty high in caffeine . Awake is the perfect tea for me because it is lower in caffeine than most black teas . It has a robust , strong flavor that goes nicely with a splash of cream or half and half . However , it is mild enough to drink black as well . Tazo is definitely not one of the best brands of tea , but overall , it is a great everyday tea at an affordable price .
5 #### I love the product and the timely manner in which it arrived . Thank you
1 #### It takes 2 teabags of this to make a single 12 - oz cup of tea steeping for 5 minutes . Overpriced and expensive tea -- that does n't even taste very good and has no fragrance whatsoever . I 'm going to post this review to every TAZO AWAKE listing on amazon.com that I can find , so others are n't taken in by Tazo 's hype . ( Purchased at my local grocery store . Not an expired package . )

4 #### I am not a fan of Green tea but this is amazing . Even without sugar . It wakes me up in the morning and its not bitter . I love , love , love this tea . The price is just right , in the stores its rather expensive and online its a decent price . I
5 #### Tazo Black Awake Tea 20 Bags ; I like to mix this tea with tazo chi or any number of other herbal teas for that extra kick furring finals
5 #### This has become my favorite iced tea . It is full of flavor , especially the spearmint , and so refreshing on a hot summer day in Houston . It 's good as a hot tea also , but I ca n't seem to get enough of it iced .
5 #### This Black Raspberry Pie Filling was EXCELLENT ! I would not hesitate to order this again and again ! The flavor is fantastic ! I will definitely order this again . I used it to make a cobbler and it reminded me of Blackberries ! Super tasty and delicious !
5 #### Shipping was fast and that product was as advertised . Fresh is always best , but this pie filling was excellent , and lacked the flavor often found in canned goods . We made pies for Thanksgiving and everyone really liked them .
5 #### This salt is great . Large flakes , a briney and flavorful salt , great for finishing .
5 #### Best price . Fancy salt for my fancy desserts . Would recommend to buy it on here if you need this salt .
5 #### I ve used this salt for years . It is excellent . Texture and flavor are very good .
5 #### I love salts from foreign countries and this is very special . Would certainly buy again .
3 #### I was disappointed in this order of Camargue Sea Salt . The lid is now plastic with a thin top of cork ... the salt inside was clumped and made sprinkling impossible . I enjoy using this as a finishing salt for various dishes , but that 's not going to happen with this container . I 'm going to google " How to dry salt " and see if this might work . Otherwise , same good flavor .
5 #### Great Finishing Salt for cooking , and at a really good price compared to specialty stores !
5 #### We enjoy this salt with every meal . Finishing salt reduces salt in your diet .
5 #### Amazing . I can eat the salt grains all alone ! This stuff is incredible . Ca n't stop buying it !
1 #### I have used this so for many years and it has always been excellent . However , this time it was totally different and the salt was ground much finer a lot like Morton table salt or maybe even finer yet . But the real disappointment was , the flavor was n't there what happened to your salt ?
5 #### Not many people have an exact preference when it comes to salt . But if you demand quality , if you have a discriminating palate , and if price is not a factor , you will love this salt .
5 #### If you know what this is , you are a most likely a chef or cook . This is the real deal , for showing off your kitchen or use on special dishes .
5 #### I was trying a recipe for salted caramel sauce that called for this as the ingredient so I bought some . I did n't know it existed . I really like this product , I feel like I 've taken my baking to a new level and am looking forward to trying it in more recipes .
5 #### Excellent for cooking and the last minute to add flavor
5 #### This is really good salt - a little pricey , but good .
5 #### A few seeks ago we had out - of - town guests coming in from a part of the country where escargot a pretty much unknown although they really like them . We usually go out to a local French restaurant , but a flood last summer had put that out of commission . Ransacking local markets produced numerous blank looks and a few comments along the " Snails ? ? ! ! Eeewww ! ! " line before yielding one small can of " medium " escargot . Amazon and Escal saved the day . These are great escargot , with a good flavor and texture . A quick rinse , mix with snail butter in a little ramekin , 425 degrees for 12 -15 minutes and snail withdrawal will be avoided for you and your guests too .
1 #### Damaged container ... had to dispose of it ... could not use it .
5 #### This is one of the best consistent escargot products out there . Very good size , excellent mouth feel with that lovely loamy flavour that real escargot have . I have made them Burgundy , in mushroom caps and just with garlic butter on toast points . Every can they are great quality and flavor . I like this size for convenience at holidays but they never last very long because they are so GOOD ! Do n't worry about this one , it will arrive on time and as promised .
5 #### This is my favorite salt ! I am on a very restricted diet , and this salt makes all the difference in taste . I highly recommend it !
4 #### I used them to make a snail and mushroom soup . The snails tasted good , but was n't blown away . A little too earthy compared to some others I 've had .
4 #### Nice flavor , the flake is a larger size than usual , but this is a white salt and I doubt it has the mineral content of a pink Himalayan or brown - grey Real Salt .
3 #### The cover does n't sit tight on the jar it comes off very easily and results in spills . Not a happy experience when it lands on the floor .
5 #### I love my salts . There 's a preferred salt for almost every type of food . Fleur de sel , or " flower of salt " , is a * finishing salt * . This means that after a meal is cooked and prepared , fleur de sel is added as the final touch to enhance your food . Add a little bit right before you eat and it will add a kick of flavor .

5 #### Love this stuff . Great sprinkled on chocolate chip cookies before baking . Yum !
3 #### good sea salt , but over priced , make no sense to charge a higher price just because it comes from French . get Malodon , better salt with only 1/4 the price .
5 #### This is the best salt in the world ! ! ! Worth the money !
4 #### They changed the package and it is not as attractive The old box was prettier . The salt is still great .
5 #### A lovely tasting salt . A really nice addition to most meals , and great on a nice cut of steak .
5 #### Sent as a gift to a couple that love this salt .
5 #### I have been using this salt for five decades and even spent time in Martigues , France which is near Camargues . I have used salts from Guerande . France ( I lived in the Touraine for seven years ) and the salts from Maldon , UK , the Himalayas , Hawaiian Black Lava salt , Swedish Falksalt and many others . After all my trials , and I keep multiple salts on the table , I still come back to Le Saunier De Camargue as my favorite finishing salt . I recommend that people experiment with multiple salts to find out which is their taste preference and which works better for specific purposes .
5 #### I first bought this while in France and I 've found it several places in Ca . I 've used it in a variety of dishes . You ca n't see from the image but there are flamingos on the container , just like I saw near Montpellier .
5 #### Really like the taste of this finishing salt . Will order again .
5 #### Always used this while in Switzerland . Better than US table salt .
5 #### It is a fine product and actually highlight the flavor of foods . I am not much into cooking , myself , but my wife is a good chef and she prizes this salt . For that reason I am giving it five stars .
5 #### Great alternative to other salts . I really enjoy using it for a finishing salt - lovely , deep rich flavor .
5 #### I really like the consistency . The packaging is great to out right on the table , no need for a separate salt cellar . Keep it away from moisture !
4 #### Very good product at a fair price , would purchase again
5 #### This was a gift from a French friend who recently moved to the U.S. , and boy is it great ! ! She has turned me on to the real thing !
5 #### Excellent product , absolutely the best salt I have ever tried . The craftsmanship and care that went into cultivating this wonderful salt is evident every time I taste it . BRAVO !
5 #### we eat this a lot . I am going to try some other fleur de sel for comparison , but this one is excellent . Fleur de sel has more flavor and less saltiness than regular salt .
5 #### I love this sea salt ! It has the best flavor and texture of all the sea salts out there ( at least in my opinion ) . One of the very best features is that it is not " wet " like the grey sea salt . The flakes are soft and loose ; they melt so easily . Very fresh tasting ... and salty ! Yum !
5 #### Item is just as described and makes the perfect finishing salt . Awesome flavor .
5 #### Amazing what this salt does to food . Never thought Fleur de Sel Sea Salt could make such a difference in the taste of food . I will never again be without this salt.in
5 #### I bought this because I was curious , wondering why a salt would have such high reviews - it 's not like there 's designer salt , right ? Well , I 'm converted and now an adventurer in different salts . This one has larger flakes than you may be used to and a much more intense salty taste . I think that perhaps regular salt is so adulterated with fillers and additives that the taste gets lost . I typically use Himilayan pink salt or Redmond Real Salt but I must say this salt seems to have a better taste than those as well . I suggest you use your regular salt for cooking and have this as the salt you may add right before serving . It seems to me a waste to use this in a recipe but great for salting right before eating .
5 #### I originally bought this salt because it reminded me of a childhood friend from the south of France , who had sent me a picture of the salt fields of Camargue . I keep buying it because it tastes better than many other natural salts . Try it ! You 'll like it !
5 #### actually , i bought it for the packing that the salt comes in . it 's too pretty .
3 #### It 's certainly not my favorite fleur de sel that I 've purchased . I would rank it towards the bottom . It is fairly ' wet ' so it is n't the most fun to deal with in a humid environment . The grains are large and hard . It does n't break down nicely . I 'm guessing the reason it is top rated is because people are stupid ? It most definitely does n't deserve a top rating as it is a particularly average product .
3 #### The flakes were n't as large as I expected so if that 's the presentation you 're looking for , you might want to try a different variety . Otherwise , it 's good stuff ! I use it in homemade salted caramel sauce and sprinkle it on top of chocolate cakes etc ...
4 #### The salt itself is a good sea salt but in my opinion , not that much different than other sea salts I 've bought and tried . It has a clean taste and the grains are a perfect size . My only complaint , is the use of the word " Canister " in the description . It 's purely my interpretation but that leads me to believe it is a can of some sort . It 's not , it 's just cardboard . That , and it 's " eye catching container " description on the selling page feels misleading . I never mind paying more for a condiment when it comes in a fancy canister and I erroneously believed this was one of those times . I live in a high humidity area so I always remove my salt from the cardboard box and into jars to keep the moisture down . I opened and closed this " canister " three times and the lid no longer fits tight because the hardboard has rolled a bit . The sea salt is imported and will enhance any dish calling for a sprinkle but at this price , save it as a finishing salt , not to be incorporated into a recipe . The taste is not that prominent to stand out .
5 #### my little indulgence . i saw the PBS Mike Colameco show , where they went to this town and saw the salt harvest ... so , having this salt reminds me of ' being there' ... if i close my eyes , pretend to smell the sea air ... ;-)
1 #### This is salt . It 's just salt . It 's nothing more than salt . I do n't care what kind of mood the people who collected it were in . I 'm not interested in what country exported it . After all the hubbub , I expected an entirely new experience . Other than having grains that are sized between standard iodized table salt and kosher salt , it 's just freakin ' salt . And WAY too expensive to be just that . There 's nothing special about it at all -- except the price . That said , it 's fine salt . It 's neither better nor worse than any other salt you may have ever tasted . So it 's usable , but just supremely overpriced .
5 #### Nice salt , I can ' t compare because I have never bought any before .
5 #### bought to make salted caramel and this was perfect !
5 #### We 've tried many other brands over the years , but we always return to this one . The taste is mild and does n't have the " crunch " some lesser brands tend to have . This is a SEA salt , so will naturally have some moisture . This does n't mean it 's gone bad . . .it means it was properly packed .
5 #### Yum , yum , yum . There is no better salt than French Fleur de Sel Sea Salt . It is definitely worth spending the money .
5 #### This salt is delicious ! As described this is a finishing salt , so do n't waste it on adding to recipes , you only want to use it on things where you will get it as a grain of salt rather than disolved , for example it is amazing on steaks , added on top of a prime rib durring the resting period , on salted caramels , chocolates , or on veggies after they have been cooked . It is a small amount , but because it is just a finishing salt you do n't need much of it so it will last a long time .
5 #### Take a piece of artisan bread and butter it with unsalted butter . Sprinkle it with Le Saunier Sea Salt , and voila ! You have a very tasty snack . As previous viewers have mentioned , the grains are larger , similar in size to Kosher salt , and the larger size gives a good pop of flavor to anything you sprinkle it on . I 've had other fleur de sel salts and this is one of the best for taste and whiteness .
5 #### such a great flavor and nice big chunks of salt unlike table salt , its great for sweets ! I highly suggest this !
3 #### Its salt in a pretty ( corked ) container . I ca nt tell the difference between 99 cent salts and the million dollar ones to be honest with you .
5 #### Great brand and delivered at a fair price . Beautiful flower like crystals , one of the finest finishing salts you will find .
5 #### Is the best salt , we recomended always for cook healthy food for your childs . The normal salt is really but
4 #### This is a very clean tasting salt , I like it . I also like the packaging , the top is cork and it just twists or pulls off the container . It looks nice sitting on the counter unlike some other products .
5 #### Many people think salt is salt . But I have tried a bunch of kinds , and Fleur de Sel is my favorite . I have converted people just by putting a pinch on their food . I recently got this one , and it is great . A real Fleur de Sel should be moist , and this one is . I DON'T use this for cooking , I like it best at the end . It 's like adding a touch if fine flavor . Plus , one can have the amount of salt preferred this way .
5 #### This tasty salt has a delicate flavor and a wonderful texture . It 's a great finishing salt . It 's so convenient to have it brought to my door in two days with Amazon Prime , all for such a reasonable price .
5 #### I purchased a " salts of the world collection " here on amazon awhile back . It was in a beautiful glass front cabinet / box and ran about $ 149 . That was my first experience with salt other than kosher salt . Of course it had Fleur De Sel . 7 different to be exact . I liked the " Velvet " gray salt 's texture But this has been by far my best salt . It feels almost damp and the crystal sizes vary . I grilled two steaks the other day and decided not to salt before or while cooking . I used my other favorite seasonings but waited until the steak was plated to add this salt . I watched it melt on the surface of those still sizzling steaks , It was so excellent . Morton 's girl still has her spot in history and this is n't for everything ( like using this to pickle would make me miss a mortgage payment ) , do n't miss a payment ! but try something different every now and then . It helps my worldview . I also enjoyed the pink Himalayan unprocessed coarse grain salt I just got here on amazon as well . It 's a big crunchy bite of pink salt .
5 #### This was a gift for a friend who requested it specifically . We love this salt for cooking ! It lasts forever .
5 #### This is the only sea salt I 'll use now . This has the right texture , size , and taste for all my cooking needs . Just a small amount sprinkled on food gives an abundance of flavor . The package is comes in is an added bonus . Try it -- you'll love it !
5 #### I love this salt , and use it constantly . It really tastes great , and adds to any dish . Shipped promptly . I will definitely order again .
4 #### This is a product I seen on the food network . Works great on steak . I mix it with crushed pepper to season my meat .
5 #### Love this salt , it is the Rolls Royce of the salts on earth . I used to use this product in Provence , France . Now I found it at Amazon , cheaper and it is perfect for sea food , the scallops are super delicious . Love it ! Kiki
5 #### As as vetetarian , I experiment with flavors and spices , and deccided to spend a few bucks and try this salt , and wow , I used it right away , I am not a huge fan of Avacado , but man this gave it such a great taste , I can eat it daily , it makes a huge difference and deffinitely not your ordinary table salt , high recommend . Just a pinch and it goes a long way , so all in all not a bad buy .
4 #### Expensive but good salt for seasoning . Have used it for grilling steaks and other beef but for nothing else yet .
5 #### This is used in addition to my other salts of choice , sea and Kosher . I delivers a type of vanilla flavor , especially when used in things like pancakes , waffles , and some deserts that call for a touch of salt .
5 #### Lite flakes , full of flavor . When you are trying to create ... and not just cook ..... you will certainly reach for Le Saunier .
5 #### I purchased this Fleur De Sel and am very , very happy with it . It is deliciously salty and crunchy . I do not use it for cooking , but rather at the very end of creating a dish , cold or hot , to add delicious salty crunch . And the salt taste is just right . Wonderful .
5 #### I 've tried others and even did a side by side taste comparison with other sea salts and this one is definitely the best . Other salts just do not compare .
4 #### This is excellent salt . I really enjoy the flavor and enjoy my food with this product . It 's a bit pricey , but a nice treat once in a while . It was n't as finely ground as I thought it would be , but the flavor makes up for that minor detail .
5 #### Yes , this salt is lovely . It makes me feel like a " real " cook when I use it . Excellent price . So happy I ordered it . You will be too .
2 #### I read a review and was excited to try this salt . I did n't think it was anything special and would highly recommend Morton 's Kosher Salt which is far superior and more flavorable in my opinion . It is available at any grocery store and much cheaper too !
5 #### This stuff is awesome . Makes the best tea or coffee you 've ever had . I have only used it in hot drinks as it comes in rough cubes / chunks . If you have n't tried this I definitely recommend you do .
5 #### This is the perfect size for coffee and tea .
3 #### I do n't like the rough - cut cubes , because it 's hard consistently portion . Some cubes are half the size of others , and none of them are the same size . It 's so much easier to just get a flat or heaping spoonful of granules and avoid the hassle and guesswork .
5 #### I have a grad student who has introduced our department to Turkish coffee . So I started making it at home . This sugar works great for it , and I also found that it 's excellent for both Turkish coffee and tea as well .
5 #### Unrefined , so you can use some sugar without guilt . Big box so fill a small container and control yourself . Vet good quality & price .
3 #### You can get the same cubes in the grocery store for around $ 3 , so these are pricey .... The cubes have a nice taste and have various sizes to adjust the amount of sweetness to your beverage . As long as your beverage is hot , they will melt ...
5 #### Love the rich molasses taste of this sugar in my morning coffee
5 #### I use these with espresso from a Nespresso machine , and they have a better flavor than plain sugar cubes .
5 #### I really like these sugar cubes . I feel like they sweeten my tea better than traditional sugar cubes ... so much so that at times I accidentally sweeten my tea a little too much . Regardless , I enjoy these and like having them in my little sugar jar .
5 #### Delicious and priced reasonably compared to the white , refined , Domino Dots sugar cubes . We use for hot tea almost exclusively , but occasionally will pop one of the smaller ones into my mouth for a treat . The sizes vary and the cube shapes are rough , but they are none of them are too large for a cup of tea , which I was concerned about when first ordering them . I plan to get them again when we finish with the three boxes . They are sealed in a plastic bag inside the box , so they should store well if you were wondering about that .
4 #### It is as advertised a rough cut - meaning if you want to make an old fashioned or sazarac calling for one cube you may end up trying to estimate two smaller pieces mass as there are relatively few whole cubes in my opinion .
4 #### I use these sugar cubes for my special nespresso coffee .
4 #### Nom nom nom .. Perfect for making an old fashioned !
5 #### I enjoy these , more flavor than white sugar , and they look better in the sugar bowl
5 #### I continue to order these cubes from Amazon - best price and lovely for morning espressos and lattes . Great for company too !
5 #### I love these cubes , use them every day for my tea .
5 #### love this in my morning cup of tea . love the brown sugar / molasses taste , not overpowering , just highly enjoyable . tried other sweeteners after using these for years , but do n't care for the taste of anything but the demerara sugar in my tea . i keep the cubes in a glass container and they look lovely and inviting .
5 #### I have buying the smaller boxes which come 6 in a set for years until Amazon discontinued selling them . I got this one which is double the size but the product itself is the same . I love adding these to my cappuccino every morning .
5 #### Great product at reasonable cost ! Made me switch from the other one in the pretty box .
5 #### Purchased for the purpose of making the classic drink , Old Fashioned , for which these cubes are perfect ! Love the added level of flavors these cubes add to this drink as well as my coffees and teas .
5 #### The product was delivered on time as promised . I like this product because unlike the white free flowing sugar , you can enjoy a cup of coffee with just 2 cubes . When compared with the white sugar , these cubes dissolve quick enough , lend a very balanced sweetness to coffee / tea and definitely seemed to have lower calories . I am now reluctant to go back to using white sugar .
5 #### I bought two different kinds of raw brown sugar cubes on reviews , The other was a lot more money and I would definitely say that this one tastes a lot better . My older son even says this one is better . They taste great and I will be ordering again .
5 #### A kilo of tasty rough brown sugar cubes with the slightest taste of molasses , made from cane sugar in Mauritius . Great in tea . They take a minute to dissolve but it 's worth the wait . Some people brew the tea with the sugar in the teapot . I do n't mind stirring it in the cup until I ca n't hear the crunchy crystals anymore .. I ca n't get this anywhere within a hundred miles so the slightly high price for Prime shipping was worth it . The only sugar I want to put in my tea . Try it !
5 #### First off these are fancy sugar cubes . I use them for parties and such . Really massively expensive , but really super cool .
5 #### I love these and love the look on peoples faces when they taste authentic sugar ! It 's awsome . I 'll never use plain old white again .
3 #### These cubes are very hard and difficult to dissolve in coffee , at least coffee of the temperature my Keurig produces . I have to zap my coffee in microwave to get it to dissolve . Ordered this because since moving out of Florida I can not locate Florida crystals brand in local stores in the state I now live in . ( New Mexico ) I can buy it on Amazon , but too expensive . Roland 's cubes are also not very sweet and I have to use twice as much . I really missed my Demerara sugar and thought I would give this a try , but will not order again .
4 #### These are offered in various sizes and quantities per order , and the most favorable price per ounce choice seems to change frequently . The largest quantity is not always the most economical . Check all the choices . I like the product , and find that I prefer it to other Demerara cubes available on Amazon .
5 #### We love the real deal sturgeon caviar and this really satisfies the craving without breaking the bank . Mix some with cream cheese and spread it on a bagel or cracker ... bought some as a gift for my daughter .
4 #### As the other reviewer said , this is NOT top - of - the line fancy - schmantzy stuff - but , then , I 've never HAD that sort of caviar ( only what friends have bought off the shelf at local grocery stores ) . This is better than any of those , and it arrived super - quickly . I served it at a New Year 's Eve appetizer buffet at the home of friends , with a cream cheese / chive base , chopped hardboiled eggs , and ringed with chopped parsley and two types of rather plain crackers . Everyone either loved it , or at least found it OK . I would certainly buy it again if I 'm ever asked to do a caviar appetizer in the future . I 'm only giving it four stars because it is NOT fancy gourmet caviar , but it has a relatively mild fishy taste , and is not too salty ( and it 's a very attractive bright red color ) . I read on the Internet that you 're not supposed to use metal utensils with caviar , so I prepared the appetizer presentation with rubber spatulas , and placed some plastic knives left over from a summer picnic around the edges of the platter .
3 #### This Lumpfish Caviar arrived quickly , tasted ok , but will NOT buy this again as it has Red Dye # 3 , Red dye # 40 , and Yellow Dye # 6 , and there was nothing noted about this when I read the description .
5 #### If you are sampling inexpensive caviar , you will probably love this one ! It has a lightly buttery taste with just the right amount of salt , and no " Black teeth or other black coloring " . I love this with either cream cheese , salmon salad or even by itself . Also makes for a wonderful decoration on foods . You and your guests will enjoy it immensely . I 've had many brands of the black inexpensive caviar , and I found this to be much , much more tasty and pleasant ( I even blindfolded myself so I could n't tell which was which ) but this came out on top consistently .
5 #### Purchased for my husband 's birthday . He loved it ! I will buy it again
1 #### As with the Black Lumpfish Caviar , this product left me with an overwhelming fish taste and heavy salt after taste . It also left me crapping a pink / red color for a couple of days . I would not buy this product and am waiting for this product to NOT be considered as Caviar . Too mush dye or combinations of dyes .
5 #### good utilitarian caviar to use in serving , as well as eating . not at all salty , .
2 #### I love black salty caviar so I thought I 'd give this a chance - but salt is the only flavor / taste for this product . Lesson learned .
5 #### Great tasting salty snack on crackers . Also spread on toasted roll .
4 #### Not too bad for a cheapie ! Obvious coloring added ; however the pop was nice and it looks festive on hardboiled egg halves and shaped crackers . A fun , inexpensive " treat " that I 'll purchase again !
3 #### Having tasted some pretty good caviar in the past , this is just , " okay " . For the price , it is a good choice . Just do n't set your expectations too high . This will allow for experimentation with flavor combinations ... My favorite creation to date : Whole wheat cracker , topped in this order : seaweed , sliced green olive with pimento and red lumpfish caviar . Yum !
5 #### This arrived promptly and was packaged safely . I could n't wait to get into the jar . It 's delightful stuff . It 's not too salty or too fishy , and while it is n't Beluga , it 's very , very tasty , and I can afford it . I will absolutely buy this again , as it is n't a product commonly found in my local Save A Lot here in eastern Kentucky . I top a rice cracker with a dollop of cream cheese and top it with a small amount of this caviar . Ok , not really a " small " amount . A fairly large amount . I 'm addicted to it ! Some days I do n't bother with the cracker or the cream cheese .
5 #### Exactly what we 'd hoped for . I love this on sushi and wanted to try it . I thought this tasted better than what we get at the restaurant . A bit saltier . It arrived on time . We had this with crackers and a wasabi flavored seaweed snack . Really good . We tried different combinations with crackers , sirachi , mayo and also sour cream and cream cheese . Very good . Tomorrow I 'm going to make an Asian kani salad with this . I 'll order from them again . For those people wanting an expensive caveat I do n't know how to rate this . For my family we have always eaten the tarama or taramasalada by Krinos which is an inexpensive Greek spread made of carp roe . We also eat this and the salmon roe at the Japanese restaurant . So for the price and for what we 're accustomed to this is an excellent product .
4 #### 12 oz jar is a lot to use for a couple ...... not knowing how many days it would be safe to eat after the jar is open . We used them at a cocktail party on a thin cracker a slice of hard - boiled egg , dab of mayo , ' caviar ' and grind of pepper . Looked delicious and guests loved them !
5 #### French night would n't have been the same without these !
1 #### I am confused by the positive reviews , because these are a rip - off . I opened a can and drained off the water , the can was half full ! I paid for a can of water . The Burgundy is also misleading , as there is no wine , just water .
4 #### Very tasty . I rinsed per the recommendation of other users . I cooked very briefly to warm them up . I was happy with the size and tenderness of the snails .
5 #### Delicious ! absolutely delicious ! I would order this brand for my next recepies ! Beatriz
5 #### Wonderful as long as thoroughly rinsed before use . I was caught short a while back , and cut them in half in order to have enough for my shells . I kind of liked it better than using a whole snail .
5 #### Served these at a dinner party . Guests were licking their hands . Certainly Made out dinner a little moore elegant than just everyday appetizers .
4 #### Taste and texture were very good , but there was a little bit of an aftertaste . I ca n't describe it , maybe a little metallic . Not bad , but I will try some other brands .
5 #### This is amazing stuff . Buy it . Sniff it and think " it does n't smell all that great , " but trust that it 'll taste a lot different when cooked . Use a pinch or so in red sauce or wherever you want a richer , more complex " Italian " taste . Taste the results . Make noises and gestures like the Gourmand Skeksis from " Dark Crystal " in the feast scene . I 'm not kidding . It 's that good . It 's fennel , but you wo n't taste fennel once it 's cooked . It 's more like ZOMG WHAT DID YOU PUT IN THIS . It tastes a bit of a spicier , richer oregano , maybe a hint of cumin . If you love good food , and you love Italian , please treat yourself and try this stuff . 1/2 oz is a tin the size of the ones you see at organic shops at the registers with the hard European fruit - flavored hard candies in them , like 2.5 " or 3 " across . They 're not even half filled , probably due to settling , but you really do n't use a lot at any one time , so it 'll last a long time . The manufacturer I ordered from thoughtfully included recipes and free samples of other spice blends using fennel pollen ; I gave one of the little samples to a friend , who was sniffing it all day with the biggest smile on her face . This is a definite good thing to have .
5 #### This new taste sensation is a wonderful addition to one 's spice arsenal . IMHO , it should be used as a dusting ( like paprika might be used ) just before serving for greatest flavor impact . It is subtle , ethereal , haunting . I want to use it on everything ! ! ! It tastes , to me , a little like fennel fronds , a little like curry , a little like flowers , but better than all three ! BTW , the supplier sent free samples of some of their other blends . They were wonderful too .
5 #### This is the missing seasoning for my curry . Fennel pollen adds an aromatic quality to the curry that really makes it authentic . This tin lasted about 8 dishes worth and I will be reordering it soon . My only complaint is in the packaging . Although the puck design is stylish , it takes way to long to open . Why not just package the pollen like saffron or in an airtight jar ? At any rate , the product is fantastic .
5 #### Gives a nice locoricey taste to food . Very nice products .
5 #### This is great stuff ! A pinch or two is enough for most applications . Gives your meal a flavor that can not be duplicated . Superior to fennel seed in my opinion .
3 #### The fennel is very nice ! However , I almost had to return it because I could n't get the tin lid off . My Strong husband had difficulty opening up . Now he knows my secret . Now am afraid to seal the tin tight or I will never get it off again . It took me over 20 minutes and patients . I would have given it 5 star except the tin . I hope it does n't go stale .
5 #### OMG good ! I mixed just a bit with panko crumbs and olive oil and topped off some fresh - caught mahi which I then baked . A very different take on baked mahi . Loved it ! Will buy more .
5 #### A little different flavor than fennel seeds or fennel powder . I would call the flavor sharper and cleaner .
5 #### Lots of great flavor . The can should have a lever to open it though !
4 #### Fennel pollen is my new favorite flavor . It ads a flavor that is reminiscent of sausage to anything you put it in because of the heavy use of fennel seed in many sausages . I used it in a fig and prosciutto stuffing for Thanksgiving and it was fantastic . You 'll definitely find yourself adding to dishes on the fly just to up the savory - ness of the dish . For those that do not like fennel / anise / black licorice flavor , do not fear fennel pollen . It does not taste like anise . The only reason this product did n't get 5 stars is because the tin it comes in is awful . It 's so hard to open that you will end up dumping half of the product on the counter when you finally do pry the lid off . Unfortunately I ca n't buy this specific product again because of the packaging . But , the pollen itself is high quality .
5 #### If you want flavor , then this is the product you want . Keep in mind that you only use a pinch because of the bold flavor . EXCELLENT
4 #### I found this fennel pollen to be identical in flavor and impact on my foods to fennel seeds . In fact I found the pollen to be closer to finely shopped fennel seeds than anything else . That said , it is a great quality product and compliments foods well , in any case that fennel seeds would . The flavoring is more concentrated , so you need less pollen than you would use with seeds . Therefore a tin of this size will last a lot longer than the equivalent size tin of seeds . Overall , I would recommend the fennel pollen , just do not expect it to be different in flavor to standard fennel seeds .
5 #### I saw Chef Ann Burrell use it on a TV show , and had to try it . Roll the edges of a steak or chop in the Fennel Pollen and grill ... really yummy !
4 #### First time I 've tried Fennel Pollen and the flavor is very unique . I will buy again for more delicious meals .
5 #### Have n't used this yet , but it will be used after canning season to make up homemade packaged meals or sauces .
4 #### I wish this came in a jar instead of a bag . Would make it easier to ship with less problems . The bag had a few slits in the it where as molasses powder covered some of the items in the bag . I did get to use a little of it in baking cookies . Did great . Makes good tasting Molasses cookies . Will eventually buy another bag .
5 #### My husband loves Molasses Cookies and I want to make sure I could make them for him during a crisis situation . Molasses are better for you than white sugar so we actually use it occasionally already . Guess I 'd better order more ;-) Fast shipping , well packaged and good quality item .
1 #### After waiting six weeks , Amazon finally emailed me to tell me they have received no response from Barry Farms , so they will not bill my credit card . Does this company actually exist ? So this is more a review of the company and not the product .
4 #### i was thrilled when I saw that you carry this product . It is my favorite licorice and I could not find it anywhere . Your service is very quick .
5 #### This stuff is completely different from other black licorice . Soft black chews that do n't have that strange harsh burning flavor you 'd expect but has a mellow smoothness . Somehow it retains intense licorice flavor . Mildly sweet , not cloying at all . A look at the ingredients list is very revealing : molasses wheat flour licorice extract natural flavor ( aniseed oil ) That 's it . Hooray for a great recipe , natural ingredients and keeping it simple .
5 #### I will come clean to you , here and now , and admit that I do have ONE addiction . That addiction is this totally wonderful Panda licorice . For starters , it is n't too sweet . Secondly , it is made with anise oil and has a wonderful flavor . Plus , the blurb on the side of the box is right . Licorice does have mellowing properties and helps with digestion , and I also notice that I feel less stressed after I eat it . [ Or is this purely psychological ? ] It 's wonderful for those days when you are craving a treat , but do n't want to feel guilty afterwards . It 's fat free and you should definitely keep it in on a high shelf out of reach , or you might find yourself eating the box in just a couple of days !
5 #### Outstanding licorice ! Hard to stay away from . All Natural . Ca n't stop reordering
3 #### Very muted licorice flavor . Loved the texture and color . Very fresh . Would nt buy again . Plus the order showed 2 bags quantity and I only received one .
4 #### Not bad . The bag I received had pieces falling apart . The licorice had a nice flavor and contained no corn syrup .
5 #### My wife could n't find black licorice any where but she did find it on Amazon . She bought it because she has been having stomach problems and heard that black licorice was good for that and since she liked black licorice when she was a kid , she thought she would give it a try . When it arrived , we both tried it and immediately ordered 2 more bags because it was so good ! ! Oh , it also solved her upset stomach problem .
5 #### This licorice has many things going for it . The taste of " real licorice " is yummy . The bite - sized pieces are handy ... and I prefer this size . The bag is resealable ... a nice feature !
5 #### My favorite black licorice . But be careful if you have cardiac issues .
5 #### Very yummy , very fresh , package was not a box but rather a bag , delivered quickly .
5 #### Gifted this licorice to my uncle who LOVES quality black licorice with anise . He ripped into this bag and shared a few pieces with his adult children . They also commented the taste is good , not overly strong or sugary tasting and the anise licorice flavor was all natural which they loved . Thank you vendor for sending the item undamaged and a day earlier than expected .
5 #### Simply the best all natural licorice marketed . Price creeps up over the years . Ingredients used are natural .
5 #### My favorite licorice ... Been eating this for at least 30 years ... this has real licorice in it ... No comparison to Twizzlers ... this is far superior .
5 #### Wonderful ! All natural ingredients ! Softer and smaller than other brands I 've tried but that 's OK . Easier to eat that way . I plan on ordering more !
5 #### Love this item . Hard to find locally . Worth the money . Best licorice in my opinion .
3 #### This licorice did n't do much for me . It was very , very sticky and the flavor was not exactly what I was expecting . It is definitely licorice , but with a heavy under - flavor of something ... what comes to mind is chicory . At any rate , we all have our own preferences , this licorice just did n't fit into mine . I do n't regret buying and trying it because I would have wondered about it . Now I know I wo n't be buying it again . If you really like licorice a lot , then I suggest trying it - you might like it .
5 #### I love this licorice . Reminds me of my childhood and how much my mom loved it and for good reason . Soft , chewy and flavorful ! This company had the best price at the time of purchase also . Not a huge fan of the blueberry or raspberry flavors , but that 's just personal preference .
4 #### I love black licorice , and these taste great . However , they did n't come in a box like is pictured here , and they 're ever so slightly unpleasantly sticky ( almost slimy ) probably because they were exposed to to much heat during shipment . I ca n't be sure - they were delivered to an indoor temperature controlled location so it was n't anything I caused .
5 #### Simply wonderful ! Excellent texture and flavor . I could eat the whole bag in one sitting !
5 #### So delicious ! I tried to ration myself ; tastes nothing like the fake stuff !
5 #### So fresh and tasty not overly sweet , very soft perfect texture , will be ordering more . arrived quickly .
5 #### What you 'd expect from good licorice . Not too sweet . Just right .
5 #### This is a very fine licorice . I wanted something organic and without corn syrup , and the flavor is great .
5 #### I was taking these to soothe my stomach and now my problem is cured . They taste great !
5 #### Great product excellent quality and taste , very natural and as they stated only has 4 ingredients .
5 #### Excellent licorice - simple natural ingredients - soft and delicious .
5 #### The best black licorice on the market . Buy it .
5 #### love them . and these are the highest quality ingredients I could find on amazon .
5 #### Though the image sometimes shows it in the old boxes it came in bags now which I actually like better . The candy was as good as I remember , full of licorice goodness I was craving and fresh as well . I will order again as we can not seem to find it locally anymore .
5 #### I have ordered these several times & will continue to do so . Love the flavor & not bitter like some . Soft , chewy & fat free . Rather than take licorice herb I prefer this way .
5 #### I ate a whole bag in one sitting , and then I started on the second .
5 #### I love this licorice . Soft and tasty and addictive .
5 #### Always a great item ! We live in a small coastal tow with few choices to buy or access products . Amazon is our life saver and we can get exactly what we want or need . Prices are always cheaper and the reviews tell us what users think or experience . Thank you .
4 #### These are okay . I was not happy that it also contained anise seed . I was looking for a product that contained only real licorice .
4 #### I could not wait to enjoy one out of the box upon arrival . Really good quality . Panda 's other great product is their " soft chew licorice pieces " also on the Amazon website .
5 #### This was supposed to be a Christmas gift for my son as he absolutely loves this licorice but I could n't wait and wanted it to be fresh so he has eaten most of it already . Great company ! Arrived quickly and very fresh .
5 #### These gloves are awesome , I am buying a second pair . They are well made . Purchased first pair for fireplace , like them so well purchased again to use in kitchen removing hot items from oven . The blue color looks great .
5 #### Excellent Black Licorice , very soft and tasty . No aftertaste like some others have . Made in Finland with only 4 ingredients , maybe this is why it 's so good . Will buy again for sure !
5 #### I forgot how much I love this licorice ! It is the BEST ever ! I will never buy another brand again - spectacular - soft - delicious ! !
1 #### As I had written previously this is simply in a class of its own when it comes to licorice --- simply the best . HOWEVER , I have changed my rating because I have sadly come to learn it is selling on here for substantially MORE THAN 2X the price it sells for in my local market . That is outrageous enough to warrant the one star rating
5 #### These taste great ( if you like anise / black licorice ) and do n't leave a sugary residue in my mouth
4 #### this is a very good soft licorice with great flavor . this is my second favorite , darrell lee being my first because of the smooth / non - ridged feel .
2 #### I am a fan of soft licorice , except this brand . The aftertaste is horrible , rather earthy . Yuck
5 #### delicious licorice , and it seems to be the only " higher quality" .. one on the market . Thanks for making Panda available . Have a beautiful day , Aloha from Hawaii .
5 #### This is the only licorice I buy . It is very pure and delicious . Have been eating Panda Licorice for many years .
5 #### Who does n't like black licorice ? Brings back memories of the corner candy store . I love this stuff . I buy it with the cherry and raspberry ones too . A few of them make a nice treat .
5 #### This is the best licorice . Flavor and texture is wonderful .
5 #### Sorry I did n't order more than 0ne bag of these wonderful Panda All Natural Licorice ! ! ! ! So GOOD ! ! ! ! ! - You ca n't stop eating these ! ! ! ! ! !
5 #### best tasting licorice I have Ever eaten and it is relatively Healthy to boot . It cuts my craving for sugar and I have actually lost 3 lbs . THANK YOU ! ! ! !
5 #### The licorice is outstanding . I have n't been successful finding black licorice and finding Panda I was delighted and it was well worth the wait .
2 #### I love black licorice and this just did n't have the taste I like . was good but not the best .
5 #### Bought these for a friend who loves licorice , just received her comment on this item , and she gave it a great review . Delivered on time , would buy again .
5 #### Just as described good flavor all the way through ! ! !
4 #### Okay , maybe a little too natural to be really good .
3 #### Has s good taste , but a bit gummy and sticky .
5 #### I am over 60 and in the 50 + 60 's --- this product was in my grandparents ma and pa grocery store ! I still like eating it ! If you have crowns and bridges , I would suggest eating it slowly other wise you need electric flosser to get all the stuff stuck on your teeth !
3 #### darker , truer licorice flavor than supermarket vines , but texture and tooth is disappointedly similar
5 #### Husband ate the whole Bag in one day ! He loved them .
2 #### I 'm hooked on licorice . I usually buy a different brand on Amazon but , alas , I ran out . So , I purchased this Panda brand locally . What a huge disappointment ! This stuff is awful . Dry , hard , no flavor . If any of you are licorice snobs , stay clear of this brand . Best brand on the market is Darrell Lea available in different sized on good ol' Amazon .
5 #### Super soft and tasty . Great flavor . Did n't last long .
5 #### Real licorice .... Contains licorice extract ( glyceryhiza root extract ) and aniseed oil . NOT flavored candy like Swizzlers . The product besides tasting good has medical / pharmaceutical properties in that it is a very good expectorant ( loosens mucus / phlegm in lungs when needed to address common cold / flu ) . Works much better than products like Mucinex and far less expensive . The Panda product is similar to USP / NF pharmaceuticals that were prepared / sold in early / mid 1900 's .
5 #### I picked these up at the grocery store and they were awesome .
2 #### I have better licorice in my day wo n't be ordering again from this brand yuck ...
5 #### It do n't get any better than this ! I 'm taken back to my youth , when most of the time I had a black licorice in my mouth , and since then , I 've not been able to find that great candy . This is it folks ! If there is any better than this , someone is hiding it !
5 #### Takes a little getting used to as this is stronger than the usual overly sweet American fare .
3 #### Good licorice , pd too much for them though compared to what I could have paid at the store .
5 #### I love these and they do n't last long when I have them . My favorite licorice product .
5 #### I have been trying remember where to buy this excellent product , now I know . Real licorice without the chemicals so common in packaged food , well worth price .
3 #### We liked that they were " all natural " - as if there are trees of soft black licorice in the forest that they chopped down and sent off in boxes . Anyway , they are relatively mild as far as flavor goes . We took a trip to Iceland and fell in love with their black licorice and are trying to find a replacement . These were fine , but disappointing .
5 #### I buy these for my mother ... she says its the best licorice she has ever had . Soft , not overly sweet , great flavor .
4 #### Soft , high quality . Could have used more licorice punch though was a bit weak on the flavor . No garbage ingredients like HFCS or odd preservatives . Box is much smaller than I expected but packed to the brim with product .
5 #### Very good , not too sweet . Reminds me of the licorice I had years ago , as a child . It was always my favorite treat . Switzers ( sp ? ) was much like this . Nice small bits so you are not tempted to overindulge . Eat it !
5 #### I love this licorice . I love licorice , but this is my favorite .
5 #### I 've been searching for a natural licorice for a while , and could n't believe when I found this on Amazon - our one high end shop that sold this went out of business years ago . This is a wonderful , albeit expensive treat , but then I realise these are high end ingredients - no fillers here !
5 #### Very good taste . Licorice was very fresh , strong flavor but not overwhelming .
5 #### This has regular licorice in it ! Most of these products do n't . It really help with digestion and gerd .
5 #### A favorite with the whole family ! No chemically flavors . Delicious .
5 #### This licorice is very soft with a ton of flavor . Tastes a lot different that your store - bought brands . Highly recommend .
5 #### Yummmmmm ! As good as that Australian brand .... LOL Seriously , one has to LOVE the taste to love this !
5 #### Have throat issues and decided to ' try ' this ALL NATURAL product ! ! Well it IS true to form ! ! Smells wonderful , has a smooth texture and natural taste ! ! I would highly recommend ! !
5 #### Panda licorice is not too sweet and a good licorice flavor . It is the licorice I include as part of a package in gifts and the feedback from recipients clearly makes Panda a go to gift or treat .
5 #### My favorite licorice although once I open the box and start eating it I have difficulty stopping till it is all gone .
5 #### Panda All Natural Soft Licorice is some of the best licorice you can find in the US ; bought this as a birthday gift , and it was greatly appreciated !
5 #### It is just the right strength of licorice that helps me with my hay fever and allergies . Not too sweet .
5 #### A really great soft licorice . I bought this size ( 7 oz bag - they are resealable ) by the carton . One bag will last me three or four days . A very good licorice flavor ,
5 #### I was looking for licorice that was made with the real licorice extract rather than artifical flavors and colors , and this candy fit the bill . There are only a few ingredients , and they are all natural . The only problem was , the candy tastes so good that I ate the whole box by myself in no time at all even though the package is a generous size . I usually only like licorice as a hard candy , but I found these shoft chewies very good and with outstanding flavor . Granted , they were a little on the expensive side , so I will only occasionally treat myself to them .
5 #### Panda licorice , There is not too much I can say about panda licorice It 's very good that 's why I keep on buying it .
5 #### Nice and soft , super licorice flavor . I love licorice and have since I was a kid . This Panda product is very good licorice .
1 #### This is an awesome product , natural , not a lot of ingredients , good flavor , not too sweet . But I no longer love our scaredy - cat friends at Amazon ! :P Now they wo n't let you write honest reviews of the product , so lame . What 's insane is the price ! I can easily get this same thing at the grocery store for 1/3 to 1/2 the price ( not even on sale ) . But here it 's at a greatly inflated rate AND they 've made it an " add - on " item - shameful . Add - on is the worst new " feature " I 've seen in the many , many years that I 've been shopping at this site . I am a Prime member & signed up for that so I could get FREE shipping on ANY item at ANY time - not so I would STILL have to group items into $ 25 & higher orders . Pathetic . Way to go Amazon . :P BUT - this is ABSOLUTELY the best licorice out there ! Just be careful if you have high blood pressure : it uses real licorice as the main flavoring & licorice root can increase a person 's blood pressure . OK , Amazon , will you chicken out & block my review again ? ?
1 #### Licorice is my favorite candy , and it promotes good digestion . Since I have some digestive issues , I eat licorice on a regular basis . I 've tried basically every brand . I bought this because it 's advertised as soft licorice . However , it is the same consistency as the cheapest stuff on the grocery store shelf ; the difference is that this has a stronger flavor . The flavor is nice . The consistency and texture is terrible . I bought another package hoping the first was just old / stale , but the next package was the same . I threw away both packages .
5 #### I often buy this licorice at the health food store and it 's expensive , but with the add on item program , I can tuck it into other purchases and get a great price . So if you want the real thing a a great price , tuck it into the cart and get a bargain .
5 #### I have tried other brands and this one is by far the best Licorice on the market today . Buy it !
5 #### I 'm fairly new to making no knead breads . In doing my research , I discovered dough enhancers that make breads look and taste like the professionals do . I never heard of it before , so I ordered it on Amazon and it came in 2 days . I am delighted with the results of my breads and rolls and so is my husband . I have not been baking in this hot S.Carolina summer , but I will return soon and post a photo of my no knead breads .
5 #### I recently came across a recipe that called for " dough enhancer " I had never heard of it . I 'm so glad I ordered it , this product changed my baking ways forever ! Everything is coming out better and looks like the pictures in the magazines . I will be purchasing this product in the future .
3 #### It 's ok . I 've tried Prepared Pantry , which is marvelous , and I never had a bad loaf unless I forgot something , like yeast . This is n't as good . In fact , I ca n't tell if I 'm using it , as far as results go . I got it because the shipping on Prepared Pantry is ridiculous .
4 #### I 've used it . I 'm not sure which is best the gluten or the dough enhancer . I 've used both on whole wheat bread & rolls .
5 #### This gives homemade bread a nicer texture . It works well . Perhaps too well ! When I returned home after putting a loaf in the bread maker I found that half of the loaf was gone ! It seems that my husband and son were responsible for the disappearance . Good dough enhancer is important since my husbands allergies require that I make bread rather than purchase it .
5 #### This dough enhancer works very well . I had not used this brand before but I like it and it does give the oven baked bread a nice texture which allows for easy spreading of butter or whatever is spread on it . I used it for the first time when making bread in my bread machine today and I must say it made a big difference in the texture of the bread . I use only home milled hard wheat berries so it was great that it helped in the baking process . I will buy from them again .
1 #### I ordered 2lbs of this dough enhancer but what did they send me ? Amaranth ; what ever that is . They said they were sorry and would send the right product , another week of waiting , but I decided to go to a store here in my area to get some more . Still waiting to use it .
5 #### Great product and I will buy again . I make several loaves of whole weat bread each week and this product makes a better loaf . I highly recommend .
5 #### this powered milk is great for so many things . It is so much finer than the kind you buy in stores . And the flavor is just like milk . I love it
5 #### I am on disability and do not get out frequently ( once every 3 - 6 weeks ) so I have been experimenting with longer shelf life foods that I can buy for a reasonable price that are delivered to my home . For years , I have been making quick microwave soups from scratch and I have found that while meats can be easily frozen , vegetables can not be bought in bulk for long term without a lot of waste . There are all sorts of veggies available at Amazon , a bunch at this vendor , that are remarkably flavorful AND economical . This clelery tastes to me just like fresh when used in my soups and for $ 2 you ca n't go wrong . Barry Farm Foods also sells dried jalapenos ( excellent -- kept for cooking only cause I ALWAYS have 5 - 6 cans on hand for table use ) , onions , shallots , sour cream powder , cheese powder , etc . which I have all tried and endorse . There are also dried mushrooms but I have not hit on the type that suits me as yet . The trick to these dried vegetables is to soak them before hand in boiling water , if planning to cook the entree quickly , to ensure that they get fully rehydrated . Longer cooking times do n't require soaking . Beef stew made with dried vegetables , frozen peas , frozen strips of beef and some sour cream powder makes a wonderful dinner in less than 1/2 hour , with prep since anything dried will already have been chopped , diced , sliced or maybe smashed to ensure effective drying .
1 #### Tasted terrible . Had a plastic taste to it . I 'm assuming it got that flavor because of the baggie it came in . Bought it to color frosting for my son 's cake . It made it a funny color and the frosting had to be thrown out because of the taste . I used a recipe from a good natural foods cookbook to make the frosting , and it tasted good before I added the beet powder . I added it per instructions . Add to this that it arrived a day after it should have ... Two - day shipping was actually three day . Really disappointed .
4 #### This is a fairly good product especially if you want a little more ' kick ' to your pickled beet eggs making . It adds more flavor and color to the pickled beet eggs . Also , I use them in my smoothie . I am not sure if it help for enzyme therapy or just makes it look red . For natural red food coloring , this product is great .
3 #### ii do not like the way it is packaged but i wanted a small pkg to see if it did as it said .. i then cleaned an empty medicne bottle and switched to it.easier to use that way and more sanitary makes my bowels move more often so it is cleaning me out as it said it would do .. but energy no i have had no extra energy yet from it .. i do not know if i will order a bigger supply from a different place or not but this one is ok for a small test to seer if you notice any changes ..
5 #### Very nice red color . I used it in lip balm . It looked a little purple - ey when I mixed it with the sweet almond oil but in the tubes it was nice deep red .
5 #### Woo - hoo . Works great . I just used it in an eyeball guessing type recipe for some homemade lip balm . Used the Beet Powder with mango butter , candelilla wax flakes , and olive oil . Hooray . I 'm very pleased .
5 #### The first shipment , I opened the mailer envelope and the inside bag had broken . I was unprepared and got powder everywhere . I contacted them , and they sent a new one immediately . This time shipped in a much sturdier box .... which our mail service STILL managed to break somehow . But I was prepared and was able to get the powder into another container with no problem . Seller was extremely friendly and helpful and sent a replacement immediately . We use the powder to make red pancakes for our 3 yr old who loves them . Without having to use artificial dyes . It works great ! It may affect the taste if you use too much ... this IS a natural food product and highly colorful foods tend to be strongly flavored . But I ve found this to be very minimal and not an issue .
4 #### Purchased for a friend who is really into organic food and nutrition . Sorry I ca n't tell you more about it as I did n't use the product myself but I was told this was exactly what she wanted . It was shipped and arrived quickly .
2 #### I bought this to make cookies with red color , not wanting to use an unnatural red dye . The flavor was off - putting and the color was not what I was looking for .
5 #### I 'm trying to get away from artificial colors , and I wanted to deeply color some poached apples- this was ideal ! I love this stuff . I 'll definitely buy more .
5 #### very easy to use . taste great . mixes very easily with smoothies . will be purchasing again as soon as supply depleted .
5 #### I have been using all natural foods as much as possible for many years . I buy presitive free , artifical color and flavoring free foods . Since this is not always possible , esp . with baked goods , I make my own . The kids get tired of plain white icing so this is great . I made cupcakes for Valentines Day and used this to make pink frosting . The kids were delighted !
4 #### I tried to make a homemade lipstick , but it came sheer . I wanted a bright color , but unfortunately it did not work .
4 #### I bought this for the frosting on my 1 year old 's cupcakes . They looked like Elmo and I was hoping to use the beet powder instead of loading the kids up with red food dye . It turned out more maroon than red . I was able to use the beet powder and just add a little of the Wilton red dye and they turned out great . Less is better than full dye ! Did not notice any bad taste .
1 #### I wanted to avoid using food coloring due to it containing the ingredient red 40 . So I used this powder for my red velvet cake . The color of the red velvet cake was light brown ; this powder does not work for red velvet cakes .
5 #### Just smelling the spices in the opened tin , knowing that a sprinkle on anything you eat , especially ice cream or drinking hot chocolate will spice up the dish / cup , gives me pleasure to give as small gifts for visitors . I love this product in any spice .
5 #### Great discovery ! ! I use these peppers every day . A bit on the pricy side but they go a long way .
5 #### This is the first time ordering this as I use it in my husbands egg muffins and he liked it . I will be ordering more . Nice to have around for tacos .
5 #### I use these in soups , stews , even homemade bread . I normally have some in the freezer from the garden , but there are times when in a hurry , or just not feeling up to the prep time , that I choose these .
5 #### I needed this for a recipe . Could n't find it anywhere near me . So I thought I 'd try Amazon . Yep , I can find almost anything at Amazon . Love it .... and love this product . One thing that would have made it better , have the dimensions of the bag that it comes in . I had no idea how much 2 oz . was . I ordered 2 packs in case , and one would have been plenty .
5 #### I LIKE THE FLAVOR OF JALAPENO BUT NOT THE JOB OF CLEANING THEM . THIS IS THE PERFECT PRODUCT TO ADD SOME ZING TO A SOUP . PICANTE SAUCE , OR JUST FOR A CHIP DIP . THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT . THE SHIPPING WAS FAST . AND THEY WILL LAST US A WHILE . I LIKE THIS COMPANY AS THEY HAD MANY THINGS I USE ON A REGUALR BASIS AND I HAVE NO NEED TO HAVE A BUNCH OF JARS IN THE FRIG . OR PRODUCE GOING BAD BEFORE I USE IT . THIS IS THE WAY TO GO .
5 #### in the 80s , I worked tor a chef who made fresh vinaigrette every day - using this particular mustard . the crock is hand made , fun to use in the kitchen , and the flavor is ( to me ) superior . this mustard has only a few ingredients , and is very simple in design . that is why I love it . before the internet , it was really difficult to find . now , thanks to companies like amazon , the availability is incredible . please ......... if you like whole grain mustard , I think you 'll love it .
5 #### This mustard is delicious . I was never a huge fan of whole grain mustard but this stuff is otherworldly delicious . The lid is plastic and my wife ca n't remove it or put it back in the jar because it takes a bit of strength to do which is really unfortunate . I would imagine if you 're elderly you would n't be able to open or close this jar and I really think that 's unfair and something that should be thought of . I 'd hate to think when I 'm 80 years old I have to resort to mustard out of a plastic squeeze bottle . I wo n't knock a star off because I 'm reviewing the mustard and not the jar , but beware .
5 #### My that 's a spicy mustard . Just like it should be .
4 #### I wish it did n't have seeds and was just a bit smoother . I recall a french mustard made with white wine , smooth , spicy . This one is great for the big roast beef or ham sandwich with a slab of cheese on a big crusty roll .
5 #### Just terrific ! Love this mustard . No other mustard will do ! I am updating this review w\ a great little recipe or 2 . 1 . Mix this mustard w / honey for a great dipping sauce w / kick ! Another great one , mix mayonnaise , ketchup & this mustard as a sandwich topper or best of all , a French fry dipping sauce . Sooo good . U will , love it . Excellent mustard .
5 #### We love this mustard . However , we really hate the stopper . Fix that and I will find some way to give this product 10 stars .
5 #### the taste , the texture wonderful . love french grainy mustard . it is good on everything and anything you can think of to pair it with making the ordinary extraordinary .
5 #### This stuff is wonderful . I feel like I just got it and almost down to a 1/3 of the jar . I will buy more ! !
5 #### This is the real stuff - French country - style whole - grain mustard . It 's not loaded with horseradish like , for example , Dijon . This is a mild mustard with a thick chewable texture and a delicious mustardy flavor . I like to spread a thick layer in sandwiches . When this type of mustard is not available , I would instead use a very thin layer of Dijon due to its higher spiciness . These crocks used to be sealed with wax and were tedious to get into . However , this one just uses a press - in kind of a cork molded from plastic . To save your fingernails , you pry up the edges with a dinner knife to pull out the cork . It 's a good thing this crock is so large , because you 'll want to use a lot of this great spread .
5 #### This mustard is delicious . I 've started putting it in many more dishes & sauces because it adds that something special kind of flavor . The crock it comes in is great , can be used for many things once the mustard is gone .
5 #### World 's best mustard , as far as I know . Not cheap , but well worth the price .
4 #### s good as I remembered . Be mindful that the royal pommery is a smaller jar
3 #### Overrated , tastes very good , not sure its worth the price
5 #### At last the secret touch of my mother 's fame as chef .... so often spoken of but never revealed . But , it could not be located here in the US and we often ran out of the supply hauled back from France .. Now , with a touch of this added ( to a little cream and a little .... ) to a seared steak , a roasting chicken bathed in it and perhaps a dab to scrambled eggs and .... I attain , at last , the accolades due my legacy . A delightful mustard flavor and only a little of the heat of others that often masks the flavor of the main star of the dish . Thank you Amazon .... for listing it ! Also to Lynne Rosetto Kasper for reminding me of it and letting me know where to find it ... ( So now , all of you a sworn to silence ... no one must know ' cept us . )
5 #### This really is better than any other mustard I 've had . I love that it 's not too spicy . The jar is a pain to open the first time though . Thank goodness for husbands !
5 #### Okay , so I do n't like to cook much , but like to throw something together and toss in the mike ... Quick ! I always keep dehydrated onions on hand ... But could n't find green peppers anywhere ! These are perfect and very fresh . Just do n't let them overcook . Example would be to make sure they are well mixed in the food ( for moisture ) , or if you mike them , toss in the last 20 seconds or so . Also great on tacos ! Will be buying these again before long !
5 #### Third time I have ordered this mustard . Love the flavor and texture . Ca n't go wrong .
5 #### This mustard has been great no matter what I use it on . I bought one as a gift for a friend .
5 #### This is the best mustard on the planet . These dudes have been making this for hundreds of years ; once you try it you wo n't want to eat any other mustard .
4 #### I expected more but dried peppers seem rather expensive , overall . Still , they make a nice backup for sauces and soups .
4 #### They add a nice sweet touch to homemade soup . They go further than I thought . Very good flavor . Seems to be about the same cost as fresh .
5 #### I like to keep these on hand for when I 'm making soup . They are good & so much easier than dicing green peppers . Just toss them in . Also much better shelf life than fresh . And they last much better than frozen , no freezer burn .
5 #### Heard about this mustard on NPR . Never been a big mustard fan , but really like this one . Great in mustard sauces such as a mustard dill cream sauce for pork tenderloin .
3 #### This is the most perfect mustard that I have ever encountered , and it is my favorite forever . I just need to quit ordering it from Amazon . The first time I tried to get it from them , I got the wrong flavor . This time , I got the right flavor but the crock was cracked in half right around the lid and mustard had seeped out around the tape . I 'm grateful that Amazon made it right by me both times , but I 've learned my lesson . I 'm heartbroken -- I do n't know anywhere else to get this stuff from . If you 've never tried this mustard and you 're so - so on the idea of mustard , TRY THIS . If you 've got some sort of favorite that is n't this kind and you like mustard , TRY THIS . Not too strong , not too hot , with a sharp distinct flavor that enhances anything that seems like it 'd benefit from mustard being applied to it , and a texture that is very pleasing on sandwiches and in salads , this is the best one around . I know it 's expensive , but trust me . You 'll never be able to go back to ballpark yellow mustard again .
5 #### This is the best mustard for us . We lived in France many years and found we liked that one better than any of the others . It 's a treat to be able to have it here in the US on demand .
5 #### Second order for this mustard which we absolutely LOVE ! Greatest mustard we have ever tasted . Unfortunately this order cam with a fractured rim around the top and had to be refunded and thrown out . I*m hoping the company will read this review and PACK VERY CAREFULLY THE THIRD ONE I AM GETTING READY TO ORDER FOR THE HOLIDAYS . I do want it to arrive safely so we can enjoy it! ... it is highly recommended to everyone ! you 'll never taste better !
5 #### I LOVE this mustard . I ve been using it for years and years . . . .BUT . . . I totally disagree with the listing of this item on Amazon for two reasons . # 1 . Its listed under Dijon Mustard . This is NOT Dijon Mustard . # 2 . Its listed as smooth . It is NOT smooth . This is WHOLE GRAIN mustard . This is NOTHING like yellow mustard . Its bold . Great for sandwiches . . . salad dressing . . . and more . If you 're using it on a sandwich you will want a heavy bread like rye , pumpernickel , etc . You will NOT want to use white bread . This is the plain Pommery mustard . It also comes in Firemens ( spicy ) . . . .Green Peppercorn . . . Royal with cognac ( my favorite , actually , but a bit pricy ) . . . . Honey Mustard . If you 're looking for a smooth mustard , then try Pommery Moutarde du Lion . This mustard is what you think of when you hear the words Dijon Mustard .
5 #### I never cared for Dijon like mustard , all the one 's I ever tried had to much of a " bite . " I hesitated on this purchase because of the price but at last decided to " bit the bullet , " no regrets , this is hands down the best mustard I 've ever had .
5 #### What can I say ? If you 've had this , you 'll want it again .
3 #### VERY salty , lots of vinegar and quite grainy . I will use tiny amounts in salad dressings or risk overpowering it with salt and vinegar . Some might also like to know that the crock is not easy to open . I transferred the mustard to a pint jar . The crock is charming and I will use it as a vase , so that is some consolation . I will not order this product again .
5 #### I bought a jar of this years ago and carted it all the way back to the US . Boy is it good . I make my own mayo using the now - popular stick blender method and this is just awesome as the mustard in your mayo . If I could eat bread it would make a great sandwich ( gee I miss those carefree , bread - eating days .... ah youth ) . It is also dynamite in a vinaigrette . Do n't be surprised that it does n't look enormous . But it does have a full 16 oz inside . And do n't drop it on your foot . It 's a very heavy ceramic crock .
5 #### Seriously good mustard . I 've been eating this with meats and making dressings for many , many years . I first came across it when I lived in Paris in 1970 . I 've been able to find it in various gourmet food stores but only occasionally . I 'm happy to find it on Amazon . As I said it 's fantastic on roast beef and steaks . I also use it with a little sherry vinegar and good olive oil as an all purpose salad dressing .
4 #### I love the product but it 's priced better elsewhere .
5 #### Now my wife and mother - in - law are addicted too . Great for cooking not just for smearing . Larger size is much more economical . Appreciate that .
5 #### I did n't know what to expect when I ordered this jar of pommery Mustard and was surprised when I tried it to see the consistency of the spread . It looks like a mustard that has n't been ground up [ completely . Okay , if I had read up about it I probably would have known that the name tells it all . There are always consequences for your actions , sometime good and sometimes bad . This time I was lucky , this mustard is great on a sandwich . I love the stone jar . '
5 #### A superb mustard that ca n't be beaten . Goes well as a salad dressing mixed with EVOO and some lemon juice and a spice of your choosing ( with a little garlic too ) . Great with sweet midget pickles . Love this stuff .
5 #### This is my third purchase of this particular mustard . It has a very unique and pleasant taste . Its not for wimps . Great on sandwiches and in dressings . A little pricey , but a nice treat . Ca n't wait to taste the Green Peppercorn variety of this same mustard .
5 #### Ok , * this * is real mustard . ;-) This is what you want when you 're having something special : mustard with the seed .
5 #### First time I ever tasted this mustard was at a friend 's house ... she used it in potato salad and it wowed me ! The French do have a great product and it keeps forever in the wonderful crock that it comes in . The mustard is preferred by many professional chefs , because it has just the right tang and deep flavor necessary for sauces and salad dressings . I have used it on baked ham . Ca n't go wrong by purchasing this !
5 #### It is no wonder that this is the mustard of French royalty . I have n't seen this in stores ( or tasted it ) for probably 20 years now ( when it only cost about $ 7 -- I notice that if you buy six at a time , the price is less than $ 10 a jar -- good deal . Gifts , anyone ? ) . I belonged to a " foodie " group back in the early 80 's before such things were popular , and I was always " the designated bringer of the mustard " because this is the mustard I brought . It makes all other mustards seem harsh , acrid and acidic , as well as puny and washed out in comparison . There is simply nothing else like it . Now , if they would please bring back the CORK ! !
5 #### I remember eating this as a kid . My mother was a big fan of unusual gourmet food items and elaborate recipes were the norm in my home . Anyway , this is THE mustard she would buy for parties and it was just amazing . PLUS I got ta say it is pretty cool to have it come in a container that you can keep and re - purpose - no empty plastic jars . It has a great flavor and is n't overpowering . I will probably try the other flavors this company makes next time . Nice to have it again .
5 #### This is the finest whole grain mustard in the world . It has an intense , robust , but not " hot " flavor . It is becoming almost impossible to find in any store because of the cost of import so online is becoming the only resource . Try it ( combined with a tiny bit of flour ) as a crust on pan - fried pork , veal or lamb chops and you will understand that this is a condiment necessity .
5 #### I love this mustard . It 's perfectly grainy and has a nice hit of vinegar . I use it from salad dressings to sauces .
5 #### You think , Mustard is mustard ? put this mustard on a hotdog , And you will say wow . That is so good ! Kurt
5 #### Pommery is a seriously delicious mustard that I will eat straight from the crock with a fork . An absolute personal favorite and a crowd pleaser . Pommery is neither a hot nor a sweet mustard , but savory ( a Dijon mustard style ) . It combines a woody vinegar with a unique crunchiness of whole mustard seeds . The label says that : " It was in the year 1760 that a superior of the ancient religious order of Meaux transmitted to the Pommery family the secret recipe of their marvelous specialty , " Mustarde des Chanoines " ( the Abbot 's mustard ) . This mustard has been served at the tables of kings of France since 1632 . " Comes in several sizes : the 17.60 z / 500 g stone crock is the large and traditional size .
3 #### I was expecting this to have a cork lid , as I read the mustard does , and looking forward to the challange of getting into it , so was surprised the lid is plastic . This may sound trivial , however it adds to the feeling of authenticity of this ancient mustard .
5 #### We 've used this mustard for decades , literally . It is one of the finest mustards in the world and you wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### This is a stone - ground mustard that is just wonderful on a sandwich or in recipes that call for mustard where it is not completely blended into the other ingredients but is still visible on its own . The flavor is wonderful ; not too strong or too hot . This is n't a Dijon - style mustard and there is no hint of horseradish . Try it and you 'll be hooked .
5 #### Delicious and well worth the cost . Delivered on time and as agreed . A versatile product I can use on many things including sandwiches , fish and meats .
5 #### ohhhh ... this stuff is WONDEFUL ! ! ! Nothing else is quite like it . The exquisite flavor not only adds to any mouthful of food but also wakes up the flavors of everything else you 're eating . Best mustard to go with prime beef . Best mustard for sandwiches with lean meats , lettuce and fresh sprouts . Best mustard with crackers and gourmet cheese ( or , hey , just with crackers ! ) . A little goes a long way , and you feel coddled whenever you have some . We used to live near a gourmet food store where we could buy this whenever we ran out . We got spoiled , and now it 's VERY hard to find . So great to see it on Amazon -- wow ! ! ! !
5 #### This is my favorite mustard , and always in my fridge . I 've been known to eat it like peanut butter , from the jar with a spoon . It 's amazing . That said , the price is insane . It is readily available in this size for half the price elsewhere .
5 #### Delicious . Put it on EVERYTHING ! Great for steak sauce . Do n't know mustard if you have n't tried this one ! The jar looks good too ! We got one for ourselves and on second ocassion , another for a friend . One jar had plastic lid and second one had cork lid . Our friend found the cork lid easier to put on / take off than the one with plastic lid .
5 #### Authentic French mustard , same recipe used by the kings of France hundreds of years ago . There 's only like 2 or 3 ingredients in here too , and its all natural .
5 #### ohhhh ... this stuff is WONDEFUL ! ! ! Nothing else is quite like it . The exquisite flavor not only adds to any mouthful of food but also wakes up the flavors of everything else you 're eating . Best mustard to go with prime beef . Best mustard for sandwiches with lean meats , lettuce and fresh sprouts . Best mustard with crackers and gourmet cheese ( or , hey , just with crackers ! ) . A little goes a long way , and you feel coddled whenever you have some . We used to live near a gourmet food store where we could buy this whenever we ran out . We got spoiled , and now it 's VERY hard to find . It would be fabulous to be able to acquire it via Subscribe and Save -- wow ! ! ! !
5 #### If you are looking for a good diet soda without a litany of strange ingredients or chemical flavors , this is the one to get . It has the added benefit of being in a glass bottle : easy to recycle and no leeching of contaminants . Tops though is the taste ... absolutely delicious ! Just watch out , guests will want seconds , thirds and some to go .
5 #### This is a very delicious tea with the wonderful benefit of yerba mate . Like other posters , I really do n't enjoy the taste of the plain yerba mate and usually blend it with a spicy tea . This is the only tea that can compete with my love of a great rich cup of coffee .
4 #### Really , I was expecting a matte slap in the face , so I was pleasantly surprised . While mate still is n't my top flavor pick , it melded nicely in this blend . I took a sip straight to get a baseline flavor and was greeted with a mild sweetness , a relatively mellow tea , and the faintest hint of cocoa and spices . Following the instructions , I added a bit of almond milk ( which I discovered can curdle a bit ) , but opted to skip the extra sweetener . While still good , I actually liked it better without milk added . Though I am not a latte drinker , and have had some less than stellar experiences with mate , this tea gets the thumbs up . I marked just one star down , as the price is quite exorbant for a relatively inexpensive tea .
5 #### Very good ! I have this in place of coffee sometimes or for an afternoon pick - me - up . I use 2 tea bags with 10 oz of hot water .
5 #### One of my most favorite night time teas . When I feel like snacking , I make this instead with a little Stevia .
4 #### Tastes good , but it is weak by my expectations , which means it needs more tea bags for richer flavor . I like the taste and like how it is good for our health .
5 #### Love all there tea . Do n't know why they quit making the best flavor ( Orange spice ) ? This is second favorite flavor .
4 #### I bought CK 's crystal sugar , sanding sugar and jimmies to try to decorate a cake . This crystal sugar was a little too large to use with a cake - decorating stencil ; it was too big to fill in the lettering properly , while the sanding sugar worked perfectly . However , if you are using the crystal sugar to add color by simply sprinkling on , this will decorate cakes and cookies nicely . The color was a true black and it tasted ok -- there was no strange flavor because of the coloring -- but it turned my fingers black when I used it , so I deducted 1 star . For comparison , I have included a picture of these crystals ( in black , at the top ) , along with the sanding sugar ( purple , in the middle ) , and jimmies ( in purple , at the bottom ) . I struggled about what size to purchase for my project , and as it turns out , these were n't the right size . However , hopefully this will help you better decide if this size is appropriate for your needs .
2 #### I taste nothing but cloves when I drink this tea .... It does n't taste very different from chai . Ca n't see why anyone is in love with this particular flavor as the chocolate note is totally absent from detection . Although it 's just " okay " , it 's not all that exciting to my taste buds . I 'll finish the package but wo n't purchase again .
1 #### I love the original yerba mate tea and wanted to try this chocolate flavor as a little treat . The first sip you are hit with this strange smell , then the taste , very artificial , like their is stevia or some type of artificial sweetener in it . I smelled it again and just took a few sniffs to really try and understand what it smells like , throw up , it smells like vomit . I dumped my whole mug into the sink and i 'm throwing away the entire box . Disgusting .
5 #### I love this tea hot or cold . My favorite combination is to mix it with my cup of coffee in the afternoon , the flavor is mild yet rich ... Have never been much of a tea drinker but then again I did n't know about this tea :)
2 #### In the picture they were shown in a bottle , and they came in a plaits bag . In the picture they also looked even sized , about 4 mm when in fact they were not even sized and not 4 mm ( yes , i know sounds anal , but I had a very specific used intended for them and went able to use them )
5 #### This is a beautiful orange color Sanding Sugar . So many colors to choose from ! Great purchase !
5 #### This tea has a great flavor . It 's less bitter than plain yerba mate and may be a better substitute for coffee drinkers .
2 #### I have tried other flavors and they worked out great but this one made my stomach hurt every time I drank it .
5 #### This was on sale at Sprouts for 5.29 a box , so I splurged . I 've had chocolate teas before and have been pleased by some and not so pleased with others . But this stuff .... this is like dropping the bomb . I was in love with this stuff before I hit the end of the first cup , and dreading the end of the box . I 've flogged around since the end of that box and tried Stash 's salted caramel mate ' . Nope , not even in the same class . This stuff has the slight hint of real chocolate ( not artificial ) and that lovely buttery taste of mate ' . If you 're enough of a chocohaulic to buy chocolate tea , then I recommend hunting up a box of this stuff from somewhere . I doubt you 'll go back to those other chocolate teas , even if it 's significantly more . Me , I 'm hunting around for an online deal where I can push the price down as far as possible .
4 #### I purchased this because I had a cake order that required black sprinkles of course by the person that requested the cake . Nothing different than all other sprinkles , since I did n't have black I needed to order it . Its tasteful if you like sprinkles , which I do n't , but customers sometimes want it
4 #### The taste is very good . Some jimmies that are colored black can have a slight off taste , but these taste very good . The color is black . I have had other black jimmies which were more on the dark grey side or worse a brownish black .
4 #### I ordered these cupcake toppers for my mother 's 80th birthday cupcakes , they worked very nicely . Lots of variety in colors . I would order them again .
5 #### I love this flavor . Its not really chocolate but has a lovely soothing flavor to it . It is just the right pick me up any time of day and NO worries about not sleeping or jitters . I can not find it in our local SC grocery stores so I was glad to find it here . I find that I do not drink as many soft drinks as I used to since I found my Yerba Mate Chocolate . I do n't like plain water ....... so this is perfect AND delicious cold or hot . If I do n't drink it hot quickly enough and it cools off , I think its just as good cold . Also I usually get at least two cups from one bag .
4 #### THIS TEA IS GOOD , BUT IN MY OPINION I LIKE THE PLAIN YERBA MATE TEA BETTER . WILL NOT ORDER AGAIN .
4 #### A pleasant , mellow yet full taste and aroma , not much chocolate flavor . A hint of spice . Could be especially nice in cool weather to sip this .
5 #### I love chocolate and tea so I thought this would be perfect for my taste . This tea has organic ingredients ( yerba mate leaf , cocoa seed , nutmeg seed , cinnamon bark , stevia leaf , clove seed ) that sum up to a lovely and healthy chocolate tea . Each time I drink it , it reminds me of one of my favorite books , Chocolat . If you 're a sweet tooth , I advise you try adding a tsp of light / golden brown sugar - I 've tried it with honey and it did n't taste right . It is a bit pricey , so if you can find it at a lower cost in your local market or grocery store , I 'd suggest purchasing it there . I do n't have this product locally , but each time I 've bought it from Amazon or its sellers , I have n't had any problems .
4 #### My husband loves this tea and says it tastes like chocolate . I disagree . I think it tastes like black licorice which is not good . Since I bought it for my husband , I will rate it accordingly .
4 #### Great tea . Delicious chocolate fix in the morning , and helps greatly with mental clarity in place of coffee . Brews a little weak , so if your mug is big , let steep a little longer or use two bags . Water needs to be hot , but just short of boiling . It does n't steep well in boiling water .
4 #### I really love this tea . I should start out and say that I , like most , kind of secretly expected this tea to taste like maybe hot chocolate or to have a real chocolate taste . It does not . It tastes like tea with some spices is all . It has maybe a hint of cocoa , but it 's not the full on chocolate taste people are going to expect . So keep this in mind before sipping , or you 'll get a little disappointed . It 's a really mild tea , no bitterness at all , and it has a great scent and flavor . It even wakes me up and gives me a bit of energy in the morning . I took off one star because of the price , I wish it were a little cheaper . Overall I recommend anyone try this .
5 #### I had ordered this product some time ago but had n't used it as I still had a little of the " Just Whites " product left . I tried it the first time this week and was very pleased at the results . It blended with the water much better that the other product I had been using , and looked and whipped up just as a fresh egg white would . The only negative I could add is that there was no directions for using for a small batch of whites . I used the proportions from the " Just Whites " can and it worked perfectly with this .
5 #### I have recently begun drinking yerba mate teas . I was surprised that they really do help me in the mornings without the nervous effects that can come with the caffeine of coffee . I have always loved chocolate and have been limited because of diabetes so this is a good way for me to sip and enjoy my chocolate . I have to use this one very sparingly because of its expense but it is a treat for me . I add a little half - n - half ( or fat free half - n - half ) and some Stevia and I enjoy every moment of drinking this tea . This particular blend includes several other spices , I would guess maybe it is chai , and when I open the box I am almost positive that I smell black pepper . I wish they made this in a loose tea form . When I am going to have it I do tear open the tea bag and pour the leaves into my steeper to get the full effect . Do n't expect this to taste like chocolate milk , you will be disappointed . The flavor is unique as is the consistency . Without the sweetener it 's not as flavorful for me . I have stashed some of this at the top of the cupboard to keep as my comfort drink on a day when I just need an emotional lift .
5 #### Never had mate before but am usually a big fan of spiced chai . This is christmas in a cup . I love the hints of cocoa , cinnamon , cardamom and warm spices , with just a touch of sweetness . It smells heavenly . Just what I needed to wean myself off coffee .
3 #### I love , love , love good chocolate tea . My favorites are Yogi Tea 's Mayan Cocoa Spice and Republic of Tea 's Chocolate Mate . When I read the really good reviews of this product I ordered it . And , it 's okay . It does n't have the deep chocolate taste I look for in a tea . Maybe there are too many spices with the chocolate . I 'll stick to my previous favorites .
2 #### If you like chai , than you 'll probably like this ... I do n't . I do however like unsweetened Yerba Mate , and would n't mind if it came with a more complex flavors . In the past I 've mixed it with herbal mint or berry teas with good results and I was hoping this would be one bag solution to a chocolaty version . I knew it had other ingredients other than Mate and Cocoa , but were hoping they were milder background notes than they turned out to be . After I bought this I found ( < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/The - Republic - of - Tea - Double - Dark - Chocolate - Mate-36 - Count / dp / B003SO7FWG / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">The Republic of Tea , Double Dark Chocolate Mate , 36 - Count</a > ) and it 's exactly what I was looking for , earthy and aromatic but not sweet cocoa flavors . It 's a little pricey , but I feel it 's worth it . I 'm still happy with Guayaki 's plain mate , but I 'm going to have to pass on this one . PROS : + Nice quality Chai style Mate CONS : - Tastes like Chai and Stevia ( neither of which I particularly care for )
4 #### I am already a fan of&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Organic - Yerba - Mate - Tea-25 - Bags / dp / B00028QDMY / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Organic Yerba Mate Tea 25 Bags</a>&nbsp;and a fan of chocolate . This mix is the best of yerba mate with just a hint of chocolate . If you are looking for a more milk - chocolate flavor , try it with a little sweetener and milk . The hint of chocolate gives this yerba mate a more bitter flavor closer to coffee than the plain yerba matte but without the coffee acid and reduced caffeine . Yerba mate is a good flavor in itself and not just as a coffee substitute . The chocolate gives us yerba mate fans some variety in flavors .
4 #### I love the Guayaki brand and had seen the chocolatte flavor online but never in stores until my last trip to Mother 's Market ( where it was on sale for 4.19 , regularly 6.49 . ) I 'm glad I picked it up , it 's a great tea , great flavor , no sweetener needed but it tastes closer to chai to me than it does chocolate . I add a tablespoon of organic cacao powder and some organic vanilla almond milk to make it a " dessert tea . "
3 #### I hardly caught the chocolate hint in this tea . It is more of a spicy tea with a teeny tiny hint of chocolate . It 's good if that 's what you 're looking for , but I was hoping for more chocolate . I tried it with an almond / coconut milk and without anything added and preferred the tea with the milk .
2 #### This takes nothing like chocolate at all . It has a strong cinnamin / nutmeg flavor that reminds me of pumpkin pie . I tried one and do n't think I 'll be drinking any more . As far as energy goes , I do think it works - but I ca n't enjoy the drink enough to continue .
5 #### THIS IS THE BEST TEA EVER ! IT IS ALSO PERFECT TO USE WITH THE HCG DIET ! ! ! I LOVE THIS STUFF ! ! !
4 #### This drink is delicious ! But beware - it 's overpriced on Amazon . I found the exact same product at my local Whole Foods for $ 6.79 .
5 #### The flavor and scent of this is wonderful ! It 's smooth , yet has a cinnamon spice to it . I feel so great after a cup , it 's a great pick me up in the afternoon .
1 #### They keep jacking up the price . It has gone up several times since I originally ordered it at $ 11.00 a bag . The price they are charging is way out of line . It would be cheaper if I bought a couple of chickens and kept them in my back yard and I could get fresh egg whites then .
5 #### Perfect for me ! I read a lot before using this the first time . It is a great item to have on hand . Is just as advertised and I use it whenever I run out of eggs or my liquid egg whites .
5 #### I really like these . Pure and simple , I use 2 tablespoons in my smoothie every morning .
5 #### Easy way to add protein to gluten free baking . I mix it in with the dry ingredients and add the water to the wet ingredients . Egg whites help with the rising of yeast breads without changing the flavor !
4 #### i order this all the time , use it for royal icing , egg washes , stabilize frosting , i would give it 5 stars if it came in a resealable bag
4 #### I would recommend this product , it worked well . The only reason I did n't give the 5 stars is that you have to mix a little extra for blending purposes . Will order again .
5 #### I was hooked from the first time tasting Ting . It 's a light grapefruit taste with a lot of " bite " to it . Tastes wonderful . Will give Coca - Cola a run for it 's money . Coke and Ting are the two best tasting drinks in my book . Of course both are horrible for your health / body . But enjoy either once in a while . I just saw there 's a Pink Ting ! Would love to try that .
4 #### I use this for a weekly facial to nourish and my skin . I like that you can control exactly how much you make . I bought a whisk so that I could mix the powder and water thoroughly . I use warm water to better mix the powder and this works great on my skin .
5 #### I like to use this powder in my smoothies . It adds a thick and creamy texture to my smoothies without the grit that whey does .
4 #### I got this as a substitute for fresh eggs or liquid egg white because I do n't use those fast enough . It takes some practice to make actual egg - on - the - plate dishes , but as a dry ingredient , it 's great ! I made a portable pancake mix for my son to take camping , and it was a hit . I amended the ratio to 2 TBLS to make a full egg in volume ( although not fat ) .
5 #### Ca n't find this is your average grocery store . Has so many uses , not only in baking , but in facials , and any use where you do n't want the usual components of egg yolks . It has no shelf life limit and no additives . It is a really superior product .
5 #### High quality ; the powder is extremely fine and was stored / packaged properly ; there was no caking or clumping . Barry Farm provides an excellent product at a fair price .
5 #### The Egg White Powder , 8 oz . arrived ahead of schedule , was packaged well , and is as was described . I have been busy with the holidays and will report on my attempts at making meringue from egg white powder and Atkins Oopsie bread shortly .
5 #### Love this product made all our holiday cookies sparkle .. will buy again .. shipped fast ... awesome product . large bag have enough left over for other holidays and baby / wedding showers !
5 #### I am thrilled to find this source for edible decorations , the sugar is gold not yellow and is fabulous , they combine shipping and at this price you can really deck out your holiday baking
4 #### My husband and I first discovered Ting on our honeymoon in Jamaica nine years ago . Since then , we 've tried to find it locally , but are unable to . I bought this pack for my husband for our anniversary , and he loved it ! I do have to say that the price is expensive , but if you are just buying once for a special occasion , I can excuse it .
5 #### I love the truly unique flavor of Pickapeppa . Its relatively mild , perhaps 5/10 , but it more than makes up for it with outstanding flavor . The unique flavor comes from the mangoes , but the combination of other spices is exquisite . It 's similar to A1 in thickness but VASTLY tastier . I 'm a fan and I buy this by the gallon thru Pickapeppa 's website . As for their other sauces , give 'em a pass . All are too sweet for my taste , particularly their " hot " sauce .
5 #### I use a lot of red sanding sugar , I use it on the cherry pies , it makes it easy to tell the pies apart after baking . I bake an average of three pies a week .
5 #### Will definitely be buying this product again . It 's pretty and just the right grain for a sprinkle on cakes .
5 #### I recently went to a Jamaican restaurant with my sister and fell in love with ginger beer all over again . They only served D&G. I have tried other brands and they do n't have the spicy bite of D&G. It 's the top brand in authentic ginger beer .
4 #### Ginger beer is a popular drink in Jamaica . As far as what you get when you buy this product ? Triple filtered carbonated water , high fructose corn syrup , Jamaican ginger extract , natural and artificial flavors , citric acid , sodium benzoate ( a preservative ) and brominated vegetable oil . Manufactured by Desnoes & Geddes Ltd. , Kingston , Jamaica and distributed by Reggae Imports Ltd. , Brooklyn , NY .
2 #### D&G Ginger beer has been the worst of the many Ginger beers I have tasted . It is way too sweet , it is just like a mouth full of sugar . The Ginger flavor is faint , and there is a slight spice as the sweetness faids . Standard super market Ginger Ale is light years better than this , and I do n't consider super market ginger ale to be included in my top 10 Ginger beers . This would not fall anywhere in my top 10 , but it made it into the Ginger beer pocket guide . That 's when I discovered how useless the pocket guide actually was . One of my favorites is Fentimanes . I describe Fentimans as a tiny bit dry , a bit sweet , and a nice spicy bite that wo n't choke you , but will make your mouth tingle . It is very refeshing , and a great mixer for Dark and Stormy 's .
5 #### Pickapeppa Bloody Marys ! ! That 's all that needs to be said
5 #### Really fine grain of sanding sugar and it 's a very yellow shade of gold , rather than antique gold or something . This is a pretty big bag so it 'll last quite a while . I used this to cover the outside of a cake and I still had more than half leftover . In the picture , I covered the whole bottom tier and cake board in this sanding sugar . I was expecting more of a deep gold tone but it came out more yellow . It was still really sparkly and pretty though .
3 #### Its kind of yelowish not the gold tone i was expecting
5 #### I was first introduced to this sauce at an Old Chicago restaurant some 20 years ago . It 's remained a favorite of mine throughout all that time . It 's not spicy , exactly - it 's more of a fruit kind of flavor . Another reviewer compared it to A1 sauce , and that 's pretty apt at least in terms of viscosity and color . However , Pickapeppa has a LOT more flavor notes to it . It 's outstanding on grilled chicken or pork . I got so addicted to it that I started using it on French fries . Another idea is a kind of ersatz dip ... take a block of cream cheese and smother it in Pickapeppa , then use it as a spread on Ritz crackers . OK , now I 'm hungry . It 's a good versatile sauce . I like it a lot .
5 #### I first brought this product back from Jamaica . Then I found it often the stores . Then I could not find it . Finally checked Amazon and there it was . Well , duh . Of course it was . It 's my favorite . Nice and tangy but not too hot . A nice complement to eggs , casseroles or almost everything except cakes , pies , cookies , well you get the idea .
5 #### Best steak sauce EVER ..... don't even bother with all the other junk out there .... this is the good stuff .
5 #### This is Good stuff , I used it for years but could n't find it after a move . I was Very happy to find it on Amazon . I use it any kind of meat , Great to add to many sauces , especially hot sauce for wings & such .
5 #### I could n't count the number of bottles of Pickapeppa original I 've been though over the past dozen years -- it 's that good . It 's one part of day that is never boring , one part of a dish that is always delicious . Flavourful without overwhelming everything else , spicy without being relying too much on the peppers that are part of the recipe .
5 #### Nice purple color . Worked very well . Mixed a small amount of red in to this for a nice effect .
5 #### Nice red color . Worked very well . Not the orange color shown in the picture .
5 #### Love this color . Shine is good . The bag it came in sucks however .
5 #### I always use CK sugars for my Easter baking . The colors are vibrant and they make my cookies look elegant .
5 #### Did a great job putting gold sugar in my cookies . Very impressive --everyone loved the look and taste of my sugar cookies
5 #### I use a log of gold sanding sugar for cake pops . This is an economical way to purchase a lot . Exactly like the same product in the small bottles . I mixed some ( bottle and bag ) and it was exactly the same shade of gold .
5 #### Color is actually red , not this orangish color shown on the photo .
4 #### I was hoping for more of a metallic gold but it is a very nice color and the quality of product is great .
5 #### The color is perfect to the color my computer screen displayed . And you can never have to much of anything purple .
5 #### I wanted red sugar and although the picture shows orange they did show up read . Nice texture for riming glasses or sprinkling on cakes .
5 #### The color on the red sanding sugar was a good , true red , with no sliding to the pink side . I used these to make ruby slipper cookies and it worked great . As a bonus , the sugar did n't have any off flavor from the coloring . There is a slight undertone of gold to the sparkles that I loved . I 'll definitely use this brand again when I need other colors .
5 #### I was in charge of making deserts for a baby shower for a friend . She is not a fan of pink , and I wanted a fun way to add some " girly " coloring to the cookies and cake .
5 #### I ordered this for my Marti Gras cupcakes . Good quality sugar in all the colors I have purchased . I like having it in bulk because when I make cupcakes ... I make them by the 100 's .
4 #### I like to bake and this adds a fun sparkle to my cookies . Easy to use of course and cheaper than those little bottles of sugar you get in the grocery store . The size is right to make them sparkle and not fade into the dough when baked . If you like to bake and want to make your sugar cookies look special I suggest this as an addition to your embelishments . Makes and everyday cookie look like a special treat .
5 #### After buying this and 2 other pounds of sugar for decorating , I 'm set for a long while . If I were n't though , I would absolutely purchase this a million times over . The color is deep and intense . It dyed my fingers a lovely bruise color when I was decorating , but that washed off easily . Unlike many black frostings and sprinkles , this did not stain mouths ( at least at the quantity I used ) .
5 #### My mom turned 50 years old recently , and I had to bake 75 cupcakes for her surprise party . Because her favorite color is green , I browsed green , silver , and black sugars . This green was absolutely gorgeous . It is almost a white / silver , but has just a teeny hint of green . It is sanding sugar , so the granules are small . I 'd say I 'd buy it again , but I still have about 3/4 of a pound , so I do n't know that I 'll need to . If I somehow use 12 oz of colored sugar , I would absolutely purchase this a second time . I also purchased the green and black sanding sugars . They have really intense colors , and they blended very nicely with this .
5 #### Purchased for some " Breaking Bad " themed cookies and it worked out great ! Tasted good with no food coloring flavor . Very pretty and priced right !
1 #### The sugar crystals are indeed considerably largeer than regular sugar , but still much finer than I expected . I wanted much larger crystals for cake , pie and other dessert decorating uses . I really do n't know if this is any better than just plain sugar . It may be great for others , but not for me .
1 #### i love carob chips and the store near me does n't carry bulk items so i decided to try these . big mistake . i ended up throwing them out they were so dry and yucky . i went back to the store and bought the sunspire brand . so much better and worth the higher price .
3 #### This sanding sugar looked good on all of my treats but it left everything in its path SUPER black ! Everyone at my parties mouth was stained black , my hands were stained black when I touched it and I just feel like it is way too much of a mess to be worth using again . I know its black and its bound to fade but I do n't think people loved having black tongues and teeth for the remainder of the party ...
4 #### perfect for coating pie crusts etc . , before the oven .
3 #### I bought this on other reviews saying it does n't stain like other black sugar products . This stained everything ! Was n't as gross coloring the mouth as it was clothes and my fingers the second I touched it . Worked fine for a cake and cupcakes .
4 #### Nice and orange for the fruit slice cookies I made .
1 #### Not to mention the questionable ingredients associated with the product , yet the disclaimer is enough for me not to buy it " We will not be responsible for melted product due to heat during shipping . "
1 #### These are great for baking . I put them in gluten free almond flour muffins . ETA : I Looked at the reverse side of the package ( which they conveniently do n't show here ) . THESE CHIPS HAVE SOY IN THEM ! ! ! ! ! BLECH ! Some people are allergic to soy and others like me who have had breast cancer avoid it like the plague that it is . This si something that should be disclosed to buyers .
1 #### If there was a negative rating , I 'd give it . I am sorry to say that this is one of the worst things I have ever consumed . The taste is wretched and my stomach ached for two hours after eating an ounce . I usually order Hoosier Farm sweetened chips , which are very good . I tried to break the sugar habit a little more and decided to try these - big mistake . I tried to request a refund that they were so bad , but they do n't allow it , which is a joke . Avoid these things at all costs , they are flat - out disgusting . Keep in mind , I do not feel comfortable giving negative reviews , but I do n't want anyone else to have to deal with this junk .
1 #### LARKS Cake & Candy sold me " yellow " which they stated was the only color yellow they sell . This is CK Sanding Sugar they now have listed . I have CK yellow and it 's very nice , beautiful yellow color . Be very careful , however when purchasing from this company . If it is their * own * as it was when I made my purchase , and was unaware ..... It will come in a Baggie with a twist tie and it 's very much a yellow / ORANGE color . Certainly not this bright yellow that you see pictured here . Would not purchase any Sanding sugar from LARKS Cake & Candy . I 'll stick with my tried and true .
5 #### When I bought this , it was the first time using sanding sugar . I bought this for cake pops and they were amazing ! I loved this sanding sugar it was great and easy to use . The price was pretty great and the seller was amazing to sending this asap to me for my baking order . In the end , the Cake pops looked amazing with this on them !
5 #### I ca n't have chocolate and have many other allergies as well . No sugar , soy or dairy . This product was exactly what I needed !
4 #### for those of us who do not care for chocolate all that much these fit the bill . they are good in cookies but I recommend letting the cookies sit overnight before consuming as this softens the carob chips up a bit and they are not as hard and crunchy .
1 #### These chips contain Partially Hydrogenated oils . If you are looking to eat these for health benefits , you 're better off with chocolate . Otherwise , find a brand with no hydro .
5 #### Great price for these . They taste great in all my cookies and breads . Would definately buy again and suggest to a friend to buy .
4 #### I purchased these as we try to avoid white sugar . I do n't know if I would purchase again due to the cost and after more research it does n't seem the small amount we use is significant in our overall eating .
1 #### The chips have palm oil , containing a lot of saturated fat . This was not mentioned in the website . More information should have been provided .
5 #### My son is allergic to chocolate and I found these . He says they are very good and he loves having " chocolate chips " again . I am allergic to carob so I can not taste them and give my review . I am going off of what he says :) He gives them 5 stars . ( He is 14 )
5 #### I 've been buying these carob chips for years . No other chips compare . These are just the right amount of sweetness & mimic chocolate ! They 're great for baking in place of choc chips but also good to at by themselves , out of the bag ! Also , the customer service is great , the folks at Barry Farms are awesome !
5 #### I love the taste of these . I bought more at a local market and they do not taste as good . I have to wait until it is cooler to order more of these carob chips , because they did arrive with a few melted . This is noted in the sellers details .
5 #### After trying this cocoa , I just ordered 5 pounds . It is very tasty , easy to work with , and well prepared . I compared it to two other varieties of cocoa for color , flavor , and consistency , and this cocoa was the best , especially for the price . To my knowledge , this is the best way to get your cocoa . Regards , proclus [ ... ]
5 #### I love cocoa powder and I use it in many baking items . I love the flavor of this product and will highly recommend this for all of your baking needs .
5 #### Love this stuff ! ! Found it in Whole Foods , but not with this variety . These sauces are hot , spicy , tangy and great to mix with a variety of things . Use them by themselves on burgers , all kinds of meat or use them as base or addition if you like to create your own sauces . Make BBQ sauce , mix with beans for an extra tang ( I mix it on my black beans with some ketchup and other ingredients ) . I 'm constantly finding new ways to use them .
5 #### Love the mango flavored sauce . Used it almost like ketchup .
4 #### Initaly delivered with one broken one , even though the packing should have protected it . The seller sent a replacement . Overall this is a very nice sauce without overpowering vinegar flavor . Moderately hot . Definately one of the better ones I have had . Four stars because it does not rise head and shoulders above others .
5 #### Nutritional yeast flakes are so good for the diet ! They are full of the vitamin B 's and other good stuff . I dump about a tablespoon full on my salad and I like the flavor . I 've noticed that my little dog likes to lick out the empty salad bowl after I 've added the yeast flakes , but she does n't like to lick the bowl if I have n't put the flakes on the salad . I like the flavor too .
5 #### I love making vegan macaroni and cheese with this product ! It 's also good sprinkled over spaghetti in place of parmesan cheese and sprinkled over fresh popcorn ! Of course it does n't ACTUALLY taste like cheese , it 's more of an alternative to cheese . It might even take you awhile to get used to the flavor , but when you do , you 'll love it ! Tastes just as good as Bragg 's . Actually , I ca n't even tell the difference .
3 #### If you are looking for something different , this would be it . However , it does n't taste like cheese like some described ... at least not to me . It was worth the money to find out that it was n't for me .
4 #### I love to sprinkle nutritional yeast on hot air popped popcorn . This yeast is very tasty but expensive . I can get double or triple the quantity at Whole Foods market in the bulk section for the same price .
5 #### Fresh and delicious quality . I bought this to sprinkle on meals instead of cheese , and love the taste . It is easy to add to all kinds of dishes to boost nutrition and taste .
5 #### Amazon seems to really have a problem with open items in their grocery department . This is the 3rd time I have gotten an open package in the last 4 months . HOWEVER , I give 5 stars because it is NOT the company 's fault , and their product is good . Has a nice cheesy type smell . Perfect for those of us trying to stay away from cheese .
5 #### I converted to a plant based diet almost a year ago . I was searching for spices , meals , etc on line , where I found a tofu scramble , with nuturtional yeast , I ordered this and have prepared this tofu scramble each morning since : 2 egg whites , tofu , soft is better , kale or spinach , goat cheese , tumeric , nutritional yeast , gound pepper , red or green peppers , onions , can add anything else , mushrooms etc . I prepare a meat free saugage , and wha la , I am one happy camper . I would never go back to fast food or meats . My blood work shocks my physician , all my critical heart health numbers are superb . And I really believe the tumeric has helped me become joint pain free . I will be 65 this year , and have never felt better since my 20 's and 30 's .
4 #### It 's great on my popcorn but unfortunately it does n't stick well . It has nice cheesy taste . Not sure what else I can use it for .
5 #### I just got this today . I am trying to greatly increase my nutrition due to heath problems , and gave up meat because of the cruelty , which I simply can not participate in . Put some in my drink and it tasted fine . Has a mild smell and taste . I also read that cats like it so put some out in a bowl ; they loved it ! I will order this again and continue to use it for the health benefits ; may also sneak some into my husband and son 's food , do n't tell them !
5 #### Loved it on popcorn . It 's good too balance out the arginine / lysine level for those who have any of the herpes categories like shingles , cold sores , etc . ; i.e. , too much arginine causes outbreaks . Popcorn is high in arginine , so the lysine in nutritional yeast balances that out . Everyone is different . I also put it on other things . Another reviewer or commenter said their child had stomach problems . Children generally eat candy . Fruit around the same time will cause pain in the lower digestive system . A vegetarian friend of mine said that when I mentioned I told her I got nutritional yeast . I 'm glad I learned that as I had terrible pain in the lower digestive . Problem solved . I told her I had it with spaghetti , so she tried it and loved it too .
3 #### This is a good product . I 've used it in several different recipes to increase the flavor and nutritional value . I could n't find this where I live so glad to be able to order it .
5 #### We purchase these quite often as they are perfect in out Carob Chip Cookies .
2 #### After decades of suffering migraines from chocolate - yeah , I know , stop eating it , right ? I rarely do , but when I do I pay for it for days - I thought well , why not carob ? Looked around on amazon , found several products I thought I 'd try , this one included . Not sure I 'll ever eat it . I 've had carob before , and another one to compare I ordered at the same time . It 's like night and day , these being night . Like I said , grainy , gritty , thick aftertaste / texture like eating carob - flavored crayons . Other than that , they 're not bad , and I think they might work in cookies . YMMV .
2 #### Not much of a carob taste and have too many oils in them . Also I was not aware that soy lecithin was an ingredient as I am intolerant to soy . They are sweet but I ca n't eat them often .
4 #### These are pretty yummy . I have been using carob since I was a kid . The carob chips are harder to find . I like these they are a tad waxy but they are tasty !
5 #### These are SO GOOD and have such a sweet and good taste that I can not control myself with them . If you have a sweet tooth and love chocolate . This is a good replacement . I sort of like this taste as well as chocolate ? Better for you ? Really really good to eat . Always seem to need more . Sort of a malted milk taste . Love them !
4 #### I did n't give it five stars because the chips are a little too sweet . Next time I am getting the unsweetened chips . I would recommend them to everyone though .
1 #### These taste like pure sugar and fat . It 's literally crystallized sugar whipped up with some palm oil . Does not even taste remotely like carob or chocolate . So disgusting .
5 #### Great chocolate alternative . It does not taste exactly like chocolate , but it 's close . My body loves carob and this product is good .
4 #### This is very good buy . The bag is huge , the flavor comes in various roasts , can be used as an alternative to chocolate .
3 #### I used to enjoy carob covered candy bars that I got in a health food store , so I wanted to try carob powder . I mixed it with milk . This carob powder is gritty tasting and not really sweet . I have read that carob is very healthy and it is a natural anti - oxidant . Healthy is great , but I would not call this carob powder yummy . It has a very strong taste that you have to get used to . Many use carob as a chocolate substitute . Chocolate contains stimulants that some people are allergic to or sensitive to . But carob does not contain those stimulants . Chocolate is also toxic to pets . But apparently carob is not -- at least not to dogs . Carob is found in hundreds of dog treats , cookies for dogs , and cake mixes for dogs that you can find here on Amazon . I was surprised to learn that . But I still prefer the taste of cocoa or chocolate to carob powder . .
4 #### Although this was a good price and the taste was just how I expect Carob to taste like , I just ca n't get pass the mess it can make if you just leave it in the bag and close it with a clip . The bag was packed to its max , so when I cut it open I did get carob on me and the counter . I 've tried numerous carob brands and the taste of this , is just as good , but a pain . Yes I could put it into a container , but why , when I can spend the same price or less , for another brand and get an organic brand to boot that is less messy .
4 #### This makes reasonable carob cocoa , and good brownies ( as long as you do n't try to fool anyone that they 're real chocolate ) . This is quite sweet , so you may want to reduce the sugar you use in recipes , but this is a product I will definitely buy again . I 've recently been adding a scant teaspoon to oatmeal made with Coconut Dream , and this makes a tasty breakfast .
5 #### The taste is very similar to cocoa powder without the cafeine .
5 #### Delicious though sugar - free . Carob , known otherwise as " Saint John 's Bread " from Biblical legend , is indeed a trustworthy treat for young and old alike . It 's an excellent non - addictive , non - fattening alternative to Chocolate . Fair price , speedy delivery . This is my second purchase of this top - notch product ; I missed it considerably when sudden obligations forced a reallocation of funds away from a prompt re - order . Highly recommended at bedtime , suspended in warm milk plus a tiny touch of pure Stevia Powder ( available from the " Mood&Mind " product line through Amazon ) as sweetener . I 'm so glad to have Carob back in my own sweet sugar - free steampunk - styled kitchen at last ! Please excuse me while I warm the milk ... Bedtime now . ( Yum ! ) And that is all . 0{;-)o [
4 #### I add it to my smoothies . It does not have caffeine so it 's a good choice other than cacao . Would buy again .
4 #### Well packaged , fast shipping . This item was something I wanted a small amount on hand for those times my recipes call for carob . Am thinking about ordering another one .
5 #### Used this to create a birthday cake for my Black mouth cur :) ! We love her very much and wanted something special for her birthday . We used this for chocolate flavor and it is great ! I used it in brownies to try it for myself . It is very good and healthier !
4 #### I use carob powder in every recipe that calls for cocoa . I especially love it in my morning protein shake that I make with hempseeds , hemp protein , chia seeds and almond milk . I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does n't taste any different to me than carob that is dark roasted . I thought it would have a less " carob " flavor , but that 's not the case . But it is good tasting . I do prefer raw carob , although it is too expensive , so I will continue to buy the light roast .
5 #### I mistakenly ordered this instead of cocoa powder . But I 'm so glad I did ! ! I 'd forgotten how much I love carob . I 'm on a Candida / Paleo diet which means no added sugar(s ) . I wanted some kind of comfort / dessert , so I 'd been trying to make cocoa with added sugar . Well , cocoa powder is a bit bitter without sugar . But I found the carob taste great without it ! ! ! It also mixes in with the milk substitute I use better than cocoa powder does . The quality of the product is great and it arrived in a plastic container , not a bag as pictured .
5 #### I use this carob to flavor my ground sesame seeds that I roast in coconut oil and sweeten with a small amount of honey . The carob is full of vitamins and has not caffeine like cocoa . The taste is very similar to cocoa . I also use it in my Paleo candy ; 1/4 cup carob powder , 1 T honey , 3 T coconut oil , 1/3 C coconut and 1 cup various chopped seeds and nuts . Cool in the frig and delicious !
5 #### This stuff is amazing . It only we can get it in our local grocers as it is pricey to ship soda but this is worth it .
5 #### Have you ever wanted to know how professional bakers could afford to bake bread and rolls and give them away with the price of yeast as high as it is ? Here 's the secret : SAF - Instant Yeast ! A 16 - ounce will last for all the home baking most people will do for months , or perhaps years . It is supposed to last one year , but it can easily last 5 - 10 years , according to a number of sources . It is to be stored in a cool dry place . SAF Instant Yeast is a powerful and fast - acting yeast . It can be added to dry ingredients directly . It is twice as active as regular compressed yeast .
5 #### I was just making pizza dough and noticed that I am down to about a 1/4 cup of this yeast . Then it occured to me that I have been using this same package for TEN YEARS . It is still vital , having been kept in doulbe ziplock freezer bags all this time . It has even survived a move . Is it a good thing to keep it around this long?- I do n't know . I can only tell you that it still works ! Keeping it dry and in the freezer must be the trick . I go though phases of baking a lot , then not at all , but there 's tons of yeast for your dollar , here . It 's a very consistent product , too . It seems to have a much broader tolerance for temperature ranges , so that I do n't need to be overly concerned with the exact temperature of the liquids I add it to , nor the temperature of the place I let my dough rise . Really a great value .
5 #### I 'm on a low carb diet but I use this in dough sometimes for flavor .
5 #### Great yeast , have been using for 8 years Use to make bread in my breakmaker
5 #### This is the best yeast on the market . I was having so much trouble with the well known store brands ..... then my sister gave me a bag of this yeast . Wow ... huge difference with making my mom 's homemade bread .
5 #### Wow , this has greatly improved all of my recipes . I have n't had one substandard loaf of bread using this yeast . I 'll never go back to the little packets at the store .
1 #### Awful , nothing coming up , tried different methods , going back to store . So sad , whole pound going in the garbage , will post later pics . Not recommend at all , garbage
3 #### I m giving this yeast 3 stars . I normally buy a pound at a time at Sams club , but I was n't able to make it there . The yeast was comparable in price for the 6 - pack , so I thought I would stock up a little . When the yeast came , I realized I would have less than 4 months to use the 6 packs . I like to make bread , but there s no way I could use that much . I contacted the seller and asked if there was any way I could get some that had an expiration date that was farther out . The response I got was that since I had gotten such a great deal , I should share it . I have no problems sharing and did give 4 of the 6 bags away- However , I could ve gotten 6 bags that were two years out similarly in price . Also , the other brand I normally get gives me much faster results . I do n't know if that s because this yeast is almost expired or what . An example would be that I waited two hours for my first rise instead of my normal 1 hour .
3 #### Unless you plan on using all of the yeast in a week , the package is too large for standard baking . Yeast culture is less than active
5 #### No problem with any of the 3 yeast products , so far ...
5 #### I 'm no professional but I can tell you that this stuff is awesome . Much better than those expired little packets always hanging out at the back of the pantry , conspiring to spoil whatever recipe you have on hand . In fact , it works so well that I swear this stuff is a growing fungus in your cupboard , biding its time in adorable red and white packaging to take over whatever bread or pizza dough or rolls you knead .
5 #### I have used up my first pound and reordered , meaning , this stuff is great . Primarily , I bake my own bread : 1 . I do n't have to run to the store 2 . I know what 's in the bread 3 . get rewarded with freshly baked bread that tastes great . Since I started to use this yeast , all my projects turned out to be as good , if not better , than the recipe promised . I used it for regular white bread , german rye ( which reminds me , to make a sourdough starter ) , made a raisin bread , baguettes and more . I have n't bought bread from the store for a while , only if time does n't allow me ( very hungry ) and coincidentally I am in the store , have I bought bread . Sometimes , I regret to have done this .... I am a German and Germans eat bread , hi , hi .
5 #### Excellent yeast , very active and fresh . Has a very pleasant fresh smell and taste , more similar to Red Star than Fleischmans but a good bit better than either one . Dissolves very quickly and could n't really be any better in my opinion . Good price too !
5 #### I make the eff out of some bread now . From pizza dough to deserts I saves the monies with this and some flour !
5 #### my bread is coming out super nice . I like this product .
5 #### all ways use i ve used it a year out of date still works great keep in ref .
5 #### This is da bomb ! You add it to flour instead of water and sugar . Repeat buyer .
5 #### Love it . It 's a huge pack so I put it in an airtight container and keep it in the freezer . It works great every time I use it !
5 #### I use this in my bread machine in a whole wheat bread recipe . It works well to raise the size of the bread .
5 #### Make bread every other day and this is my go to yeast . I use it in traditional yeast breads and in a bread machine . Every time works as it should . Will be buying more soon .
5 #### Best deal for the money ! Works wonderfully in my bread maker for express bread . I keep it in the freezer so it lasts longer
5 #### that 's a lot of yeast ! works great and I 'll have some to use for years
5 #### Got this to keep in my freezer for when I need yeast and have run out of what I keep on hand - it is vacuumed sealed and does n't take up much space . I like knowing it 's there - because I will need it ! Other reviews speak to how well it works - they were enough for me to buy it !
5 #### I am happy to choose this , quality and price are perfect .
5 #### Used it in my bread machine . I make mostly whole wheat bread so the yeast has to be good . And I used an extra half teaspoon of yeast and since I use black - strap molasses instead of sugar , the extra " rise " made for a lighter bread . It was a welcome addition to my bread machine bakery .
1 #### So disappointed . Even though the expiration date eas fine , it did n't " work " at all . I thought my breadmaker was failing , so I bought a new one . Yup , same results . Ran to my local grocery store and purchased my old standby and perfect results .
5 #### Only yeast to use in my bread machine works great .
4 #### This is a good quality yeast that gives very nice results with various bread recipes . Made in Mexico . * * * Update , I used to buy these here for years but found out recently I could get this at my local membership physical store for a third of the price . I wish this was carried by Amazon itself at closer to normal market prices .
5 #### Economical if you bake bread , which I do at least 3 - 4 times a week . Yeast in those little pouches is very wasteful . This product is far more efficient to use , as little or as much as needed . Will definitely purchase again .
5 #### I 've been baking bread in a bread machine for many , many years . Somewhere in my bread cook books I read that this was the best yeast . Sometimes I bake the bread mixes ( there are many good mixes out there ) but I 've discovered the bread rises better if you use your own yeast , not the packet that comes with the mix ( I also add 2 Tbsp of vital gluten , it aids the rising , too ) . When I looked up this brand of yeast the reviews were certainly good . Some reviews state you can store it for up to a year in the freezer - - - others have used it longer . I purchased the 16 oz size 05/2015 . I pour about 3 ozs into an empty Red Star jar & store it in the freezer . The remaining is vacuum sealed & stored in the freezer . I must say , I was leery of buying such a large quantity because in the past , when I bought the 4 oz jars , the yeast died before the end of the jar . Much to my surprise I am still using the same 16 oz bag for more than 2 years ! I think it helps keeping the original bag vacuum packed in the freezer . I must say that after 2 years it 's still going strong . I read another review where the person was using the same bag for 5 years ! Amazing ! I will never buy another brand after this .
5 #### This is my favorite yeast for raising loaves of bread or rolls : I have used it for years . The dry granules dissolve well ( not ' instantly ) when stirred into water or water and flour . I always get a uniform rise from the dough and the yeasty flavor that carries through after baking is very much to my taste .
5 #### Has worked great and we have made a lot of bread and pizza .
5 #### Simply the best , especially if you bake bread all the time .
5 #### I bought , if I remember , 3 of these 1 pounders , all were sealed but one . I mean the air was " in " one of them . They are suppose to be air sealed .
5 #### These yeast works very well and all of my baked goods are coming out amazing .
5 #### I make bread about every day and like this yeast .
5 #### Just received this and immediately made a loaf of bread . This yeast is ACTIVE . I could not be more satisfied . If I had anything to complain about it would be the packaging . It would be nice if it came in a sealable bag . I put an elastic band around it , put that in a Ziplock bag and into the freezer .
4 #### I used it and it worked : I am not an experienced baker so would n't know how to evaluate , really . The package is way too large for my purposes , but I do n't think it comes in a smaller size .
1 #### Have used in past , but made a loaf of bread with this and loaf did n't rise . Tested the yeast after by proofing and yeast would n't activate . Must be a dead batch . In fairness do n't know how old it was or what transport was like . In past this worked well for me .
5 #### This was so great ! I loved it . Everyone said my sweetbread and my cinnamon buns were better than ever ! I will use this product from now on every time I do baking !
5 #### great glory , * * * * Pizza - pah - looza**** ... stored well in airtight jar in the frig !
5 #### Better than sugar for me . Some taste metal but I do n't .
1 #### Although each person 's set of taste buds seem to respond differently to each brand of Stevia , here 's my impression . Stevia Supreme by Stevita was the most bitter , a truly unpleasant and long lasting after taste . I threw it away . Sweet Leaf had a strong chemical taste , as well as being quite bitter . It immediately joined Stevita in the trash bin .. Now 's Stevia was not bitter , and not bad tasting , although it had an odd flavor overtone , perhaps a bit nut - like ? It would take a wine connoisseur to properly describe this flavor . I did keep it .
5 #### I carry this with me everywhere . Stevita is stevia without the strange aftertaste . This is the only brand like it .
5 #### No after taste . Love it ! Best of all I 've tried .
5 #### I 've had other brands of Stevia and this is the best . No after - taste , at least for me . Just reordered third box .
5 #### I have only tried this in iced tea and it is the best stevia I had tried . I do not get an aftertaste and it really taste like it was sweetened with sugar .
5 #### I 've been using this product now for years and years . I love it . No more having to proof my yeast . I just put this in with my other dry ingredients and mix away . It has never failed me , I was able to buy it here instead of from my favorite kitchen catalog , for a good price and free shipping . What 's not to love about this product ? . I buy it again and again . Thank you saf and Amazon .
5 #### Foolproof . Would n't make anythiing requring yeast without it . Used to get it at my kitchen supply store untl they went out of business
5 #### This is the only kind of artificial sweetener I use . I like the packets and the price was great . I 'll keep ordering this . Ca n't find this brand in the stores and I really like the taste .
5 #### I bought this brand of Stevia based on Hayley Pomroy 's recommendations ( author of " Fast Metabolism Diet " ) . She is a nutritionist and researches the source of products she recommends with her diet which is to repair the metabolism . This Stevia has Xylitol as a flowing agent ( as many do ) but it is hard wood ( birch ) based . Not corn based . It is very sweet and tastes natural to me . No after taste .
5 #### I use this yeast time and time again and never have problems . It 's my go - to favorite over that grocery store nonsense . Please head the directions re yeast to water ratio for your recipe .
5 #### I was hesitant at first to buy this product , however the quick rise yeasts are scarce on the market shelves anymore , leaving the choice of regular yeast , yeast bars , bread machine yeasts and instant yeasts . This product works as well , producing successful rises each time I bake . I 'm hooked , and will continue to use this product . I like the fact that it is sold in a large quantity , thus , keeping return trips to the store to the minimum . I 'll be ordering this from now on through Amazon .
4 #### this had a bit more powder included in each package , so more sweet . the 50 packets is nice amount
3 #### Great taste and no aftertaste in my opinion . All other sugar alternatives cause me bad side effects . This is a great product . Update : Something has changed and it was n't just the box . It takes more packets to sweeten your drink now . When you have to add more it changes the taste of the drink ... So , I 've changed the rating to 3 stars ...
5 #### I bought this for price and the fact I use Stevia . I actually like this although my husband found this to be a little sweet so he uses only a half of a package . I will definately buy this again !
5 #### I am insulin dependent but love a little sweet in my tea and on my morning cereal and this is the way to go
5 #### Saf instant yeast is an incredible deal . Keep in mind that this is a TON of yeast , however , so this is not for the occasional baker .
5 #### So glad finally got some great yeast . The initial and final rise on my bread was so much better . The crumb came out great !
5 #### This is very good Yeast , perfect for my bread machine . No need to keep it in the refrigerator . Bought it because of positive reviews here . The price is so much better than the little bottles or packages from the grocery store .
5 #### This is one of the best yeasts one can buy . I like a good supply in my freezer so I am ready to bake bread whenever I get the whim . It stores beautifully and is very easy to use . It does the job beautifully , and better than some other yeasts available . I recommend it to bakers and I recommend the sellers . Great service .
5 #### I use this in my septic system once a month . I have a bathtub I must disinfect every month , and the bleach upsets the bacteria balance in the system . First , I neutralize the bleach water with baking soda , then , during the final rinse , I add about a quarter cup of yeast .
5 #### This is a quality baking yeast and great for homemade bread
2 #### I did not like it , I used it to sweeten Coffee and Tea , Lemonade , it did not work , it appeared to separate from the liquids , meaning you taste the stevia first and the liquids kicked in . It just did not blend like other sweeteners I tried .
5 #### The flavor and convenience of the packets make this one a keeper and a basic to stock in the cupboard .
4 #### I ve tried them allllllllll and the verdict is still out but so far I would rate this the best . What I mean by best is that its not sugar but its as close as I ve managed to get in coffee . I do n't have a problem using anything while baking but in my coffee .... urgh . Nothing beats the taste of sugar . This comes close and I ve bought the Stevia drops in chocolate , toffee and vanilla . I guess Toffee was the best of the worst but my kids love it in Milk so its a treat for them ! As I run around the house chasing 3 kids , my coffee gets cold and that is the ultimate test , is it drinkable after its cold . I m drinking it now and I can do this ! Weight loss here I come ! I can honestly say , I will order this again and I can drink it and almost really enjoy it .
5 #### The best yeast ever ! It beats buying those tiny little packages . I just pour this into an air tight container and store it in the refrigerator . Recommended by Alexandra Stafford in her new bread book !
5 #### Great value if you do a lot of baking . I vacuum packed portions for later use . It 's a good quality yeast that rises well .
5 #### Great price- beautiful breads ! Works great in my bread machine or without - much cheaper to buy like this than in the packets
5 #### It does leave a little licorice aftertaste but I do n't mind that at all . I love Licorice ! I love that its a natural ingredient and not a mix of a bunch of chemistry
5 #### This is the best stevia on the market . You need so little and it does not have an after taste like artificial sweetners do . It is also NOT made in a lab .
5 #### Great for making daily bread . Also good for making sourdough bread . The sourdough starter with this yeast lasts a long time in good quality .
5 #### I wanted to have some extra yeast for making my homemade raisin bread . I have a jar that is very old and figured it is time to invest in some new stuff . I used this on two loaves of bread . It came out perfect . I will be doing more with this over the next few weeks . The amount that is in this bag should last me a good amount of time . I need to purchase a jar to place the rest into . I always keep mine in the freezer . I have never had this brand , but will purchase this again . It is great for the price and the amount you get . I also use this for the septic tank at my house , one tablespoon in the toilet once a month . I got my bag when delivered and had a hole in it , so I dumped it down the toilet ( it was more than my normal amount but figured not to waste it ) .
5 #### Item arrived in timely manner . Great for spinkling on cereal , and sweetening tea . Of course if you 're using it for making jelly it is just like using most other sugar alternatives the texture will be different . I will definately buy stevia again !
5 #### This stuff is yummy ! It mixes instantly even in cold liquids . Tastes especially good in Lemonade ! No funky after taste . ;-)
5 #### Great product . Will buy again . Bread rises well and yeast lasts a long time in the fridge .
4 #### Not sure if it is or is n't more healthy than Splenda . It 's more expensive , even at this price . But I buy it in hopes it 's better for me than Splenda . Maybe it is , maybe it is n't . It 's not as sweet as Splenda , but I still like it .
5 #### I have been buying this product for almost 2 years . It 's the best price I 've ever found for packets of stevia . Use this every morning in my coffee ... no bitter aftertaste and dissolves easily . I always have it on hand for when I travel or hit up Starbucks as well !
5 #### All I use and I bake all our bread and rolls .
5 #### I was amazed how fast product helped my head rise . Easy to use and great size for price . Happy !
2 #### The packets I received show some form of stevia as the primary ingredient , but the box shows xylitol first . I would much prefer having more stevia , as xylitol upsets my stomach after a while . The taste of these is okay , but I feel cheated by the change in formulation , the conflicting labels , and the company 's lack of response when I called them last week for clarification .
4 #### After trying NuNaturals NuStevia , this one tastes almost like real sugar ! It is actually the closest to the real thing among the ones I 've tried . I will buy this brand again but of course will try other brands to see if I like it better than this . If I have to rate the sugar taste similarity ( 10 being exactly the same as sugar ) , I would say : NuNaturals - 5 Stevita Supreme - 7.5 Also , the other thing I like about this brand , it is not like powder powder . It is kinda crystallized like sugar .
5 #### I find this product to be very pleasantly sweet without any aftertaste . I will use less than with similar stevia packet products ( just one instead of two packets . ) Sure with this was a subscribe and save .
5 #### I really like this product . I like the size , first of all . I would blow thru the bottle of bread machine yeast by other popular suppliers . This is a lot for the money . It takes less to get results too . I use 75 % of what an active yeast recipe calls for . I use 100 % for what an instant yeast recipe calls for .
5 #### I make bread every week , so it makes sense to buy in bulk . This was a great price and my breads rise beautifully .
5 #### I tried this in coffee and tea ( hot ) , and did n't care for the taste , but for sweetening fruit smoothies or chia puddings , I ca n't do without it !
1 #### I had a good rise the first two times I used this for bread . 2 months later I could n't even get it to proof . I had saved it in the fridge in a mason jar . I wo n't buy this again .
5 #### Everybody on baking shows brag about this , so I will too . Made my bread rise really nice . Will buy again .
5 #### Have been using this brand for years . .I only bake Bread in a bread machine and no matter what recipe I use it turns out ( not an expensive machine ) I keep it in the refrigerator in a tightly sealed glass container lasts for months and months ... quality ingredients make a difference especially the yeast you use
5 #### This is a great sweetner to use instead of the other products which are harmful to your health . I use it for everything . Great in coffee , too !
5 #### I bought this for around 2.50 shipped with amazon prime . This was a great price to buy 50 packets of stevita supreme . I use one packet in my tea and 2 in my coffee . it 's perfect for use in sweetening iced tea or coffee , hot or cold i 've not noticed any fake aftertaste . Does n't give me a headache like sweet and low or equal will . Stevia has 0 calories and comes from a natural plant . stevita is the best brand I 've tried . I will order this again .
5 #### Keep it in the freezer and it lasts forever !
5 #### Tastes sweet , no aftertaste or ingesting creepy chemicals ( I 'm talking to you Splenda , Sweet n ' Low & Equal ) . Not sticky sicky icky sweet either . Just GOOD ( and cheap ) .
5 #### Fortunately , I 've been able to try several Stevia products a packet at a time due to some really nice Health Food stores that have sold it that way to try . Every one left a funny aftertaste I did n't like . I tried Truvia , but found it also contained other " natural ingredients " that are not listed and it 's distributed by Coco - cola Co , so who knows what 's really in it . Based on the reviews here I bought a box and love it . I use it in coffee and iced tea without any of the aftertaste . I have given packets out to friends and they like it too . Really great product .
5 #### This is the best stevia blend I 've found so far . It 's especially great for iced tea - it dissolves fairly quickly , not to mention the flavor is good . I use , at most , half a pack for iced tea . For coffee , I use most of the packet . I carry these everywhere I go .
4 #### This is an alternative to sugar and artificial sweeteners , however , it is an acquired taste . I can not stress this enough . It has its distinctive taste , and you may or may not adjust to it . Over time , I have adjusted to the taste . But in terms of pure taste , I still prefer sugar - by a long shot ! However , sugar has lots of sugary calories , so , hello Stevia ! I mostly use this to sweeten coffee . I have also tried this brand ( Sun Crystals All - Natural Sweetener , Amazon product code B0028GWGF6 ) , and from what I recall , the taste is more or less similar . This one may be slightly more subdued . The Stevita box you see in the picture is very thin , the flap at the top got torn sideways while trying to open it . No big deal , but treat it gingerly when opening for the first time . Inside the box you find 50 individual packets . I can not stress this enough , this is an acquired taste type of a product ! Do n't expect to try it once or twice and fall in love with it .
5 #### I 'm trying a few other brands of Stevia , but I will stick with these when I reorder . I like my stuff sweet and this is the stuff ! ! ! I used to drink coffee / tea with a lot of sugar in it , but I wanted to get away from that . I do n't like those yellow , blue & pink packs of sweetner , but I was using them anyway until I could n't stand it any longer . Real sugar would try and sneak it 's way back in . I think I was hooked on sugar ? ? ! ! I was glad to find this product . It 's great and sugar does n't call my name anymore . Try it , you 'll like it ! ! ! ! Stop eating all that sugar ! ! ! ! ! !
3 #### OK ... bought this because it was recommended in a bread recipe and had not used it before ... ok ... not better than brands I have tried form USA
5 #### I have been eating Atkins life style for a yr now and was using splenda and pink packet sweetners until I realized I was forgetting almost everything of normal routine stuff , and having extreme headaches daily , I thought I was going insane . I decided to try stevita after reading some reveiws about stevia , I gradually started putting in half stevita and half pink packet , I do n't ever recommend doing that , I ended up with a horrible reaction , the headaches went from pain to a numb tingly feeling to flu like symtoms then my urine became a floresent yellow that smelled 10 ft away like a chemical , never try that again . I have been using stevita now for 7mnths and love it , I put a packet in a cup of warm coconut milk with malt , that s my cheat treat from eating Atkins once a wk , lovely stuff and low carb .
5 #### Stevia is the perfect replacement for sugar . It 's been recommended to me by Naturopaths as being safer than other natural sweeteners , including agave which does have some negatives . One packet does an excellent job of sweetening my morning whey shakes .
5 #### I bought these for two something a box on sale . The packets are convienent plus the price is right and they taste great !
5 #### I like the flavor of this stevia , and the individual packs are very convenient . You ca n't beat this price !
5 #### This was my first time ever in my life that I purchased Yeast because I grew up tired of paying $ 4 for a loaf of bread . I learned how to bake bread and I love it ! Call me cheap ! ! ! But I love it . I never thought the package to be so airtight , and I have yeast for probably the entire year ! ! ! !
5 #### Love this yeast ! Works great with my gluten free baking . I keep it in the freezer for freshness .
5 #### Update 8//10/13 - just happen to mention this ( noxious cloud from emptying the packets ) to the doctor when we were in for a checkup this spring . She suggested Trader Joe 's Organic Stevia Extract ( powder , granules ? ) . Sure enough , no cloud . Super small measuring device included ; some people might not like dealing with it . We like it . We make ice tea in the Mr. Coffee ice tea maker ( old style ) four or five times a week and it only takes four packets to suite my wife 's taste for 64 ounces . I was thrown off by the 1.8 ounce packet , but apparently they have added a heavy carrying agent that does n't make the stuff so noxious when you empty it into the pitcher . Good deal !
1 #### I have had other stevia products before and liked them . This stuff , however , is incredibly nasty . It tastes chemically and toxic . Twice I tried to get myself to drink it and both times I opted to throw out my coffee rather than tolerate the horrid taste . Awful product .
5 #### Let 's face it -- it takes effort to get used to stevia . There is a learning curve for your taste buds to get used to it because it just is n't sugar ! For this reason I 've never gotten to the point that I could tolerate stevia -- that is , until trying Stevita . I 'd say that by far this product is the best stevia product I 've had . It has the least aftertaste and best overall sweetness . Once I got used to stevia ( with Stevita ) I went back and tried some of the other brands and found that I still did n't like them . As of now I 've used about 500 packets , mostly in tea without milk . I find it a perfect replacement for Splenda in tea , but still it took me a few weeks to get to this point . Even though Stevita is a pretty good stevia product , I still had to get my taste buds to the point that they were happy to have it . I did this by starting out with half Stevita and half Splenda in my tea . Then after a week or so I switched to full - on Stevita and have n't looked back since . I 'm still not crazy about Stevita in coffee , but I think that it 's just a matter of time before I like it as well . Well at least I hope so .
4 #### This product has a nice taste and is a good value for the price . I would have given it 5 stars , but in addition to stevia , the product contains xylitol , another natural sweetener . I tend to have digestive reactions to xylitol , but not to this product . Also , the package says that each packet has the sweetness of 3 packets of sugar . For my taste , it 's more like 2 packets . I 'll be ordering more boxes .
5 #### Good yeast . Very active . Proofs up quickly for great bread .
4 #### A bit messy after a few uses , but then again is n't dried yeast always ?
3 #### This is the best Stevia product I 've tried so far ( much superior to the Sun Crystals , which had a much more bitter aftertaste , in my opinion ) . I really , really want to like Stevia . There are apparently no health risks , it 's much sweeter than sugar , all natural ( just Stevia and xylitol from the birch tree ) and in the case of Stevita Supreme , it 's much cheaper than Splenda or Equal ( at least on Amazon ) . The problem is that , with some beverages , the bitter stevia aftertaste still comes through . I ca n't really taste it when I 'm using it to sweeten punch or sprinkle it on fruit , but in coffee and tea it 's definitely there . It 's not so bad that it makes in undrinkable , but it 's certainly something that you should be aware of before purchasing it . Then again , all artificial sweeteners seem to have an aftertaste , and I prefer Stevia 's herbal bitterness ( when detectable ) to aspartame 's artificial tang . For the price , Stevita Supreme is worth a shot . It might not be your cup of tea , but this is a worthwhile sweetener and the best Stevia product that I 've used to date .
3 #### I purchased the 1000 quantity for $ 60 as I had previously purchased just a few boxes . I like the product and think it tastes great . My problem is many of the packets are empty or nearly empty . I do not believe I got the best bang for my buck .
4 #### This is a mix of Stevia , Xylitol , and something called Rebaudiana extract . I have n't tried other Stevia products but this does have a slightly bitter aftertaste when taken straight . Also , it does clump in the packet . On the plus side I have n't had the , er , alimentary issues I 've had with straight Xylitol . I 'm glad I tried this , but I 'm not planning to keep using it . I do n't think it 's significantly different from using honey as a sweetener - but that 's not what I want for coffee !
5 #### Love this product ! Shipped very fast and was packaged well . This stevia is blended with xylotol and has a wonderful sweet taste . Bought it on sale so the price was great too ! Will definitely purchase again !
5 #### Jar some in the fridge for current use , zip lock the rest and freeze ( suck air out with a straw ) . 2 yr expiration date . Red label for breads , GOLD is for your sugar - containing cake recipes . Very pleased .
4 #### Works very well for baking bread ! I have little experience with yeast , but it works very well rising the bread . The bread does have a slightly yeasty after flavor .
5 #### This thing can be a weapon ! I loved how it arrived compressed as a brick , it was fun to open . Bread tasted great .
5 #### I tried the Sweet Leaf stevia a few years ago and found it had an aftertaste that turned me off to stevia as a regular sugar substitute in my diet . I am GLAD I paid attention to the other folks who bought this brand of Stevia ! ! It 's wonderful ! Has absolutely NO aftertaste even straight out of the packet on your finger ! Now I will use stevia since I can handle a good tasting stevia any day ! ! Highly recommend this product if you do n't like an aftertaste in your stevia .
5 #### This is a great tasting brand of Stevia . Price is excellent too . Try it very good in tea and decaf coffee .
3 #### Made two recipes with this and it is not cutting it for me .
5 #### This is a great yeast for all sorts of baking ... especially bread . So much better than the stuff you usually find in the grocery store !
5 #### This is reliable . I generally use sourdough starter but for a quicker loaf this does the job well .
3 #### Pau darco tea , pau d'arco , stevia extract , rooibos and Ojibway tea , premium quality tree root is pretty darn plain . Tasted almost like menthol or something . But not bad if you like the tree bark effect .
5 #### A bargain and a good product . I 'll be ordering again if the price remains low .
5 #### No off taste , works well , after years of sugar in my tea I am converted and great price ! ! ! ! !
4 #### I really like this sweetener for it 's taste and less than two bucks a box . For me , many of the artificial sweeteners have an after taste and trigger a headache which makes them unusable . I have n't had those problems with Stevia OR Stevita . However I have noticed using half a Stevita packet sweetens enough without the grassy flavor I detect when I use an entire packet . This is definitely a WIN !
5 #### One lb . vacuum packed instant yeast which works more conveniently than the kind needing proofing , this purchase says " made in 2016 . " The label says " good until 2018 , " but it can be put into an airtight container in the freezer and it will last even longer . Although Amazon does not have the best price , this is often an economical buy , especially helpful for busy bakers . This is considered a quality yeast . Recommended .
5 #### Simply great yeast , and so economical ! ! ! If you bake lots of yeast bread like we do , skip the little brown jars and grab this . You 'll save a bucket of money .
5 #### The right stuff . Way cheaper than smaller packets and superior product .
3 #### It 's a fine , if not the best yeast for homemakers . Instant yeast is probably the most reliable and stable yeast you could want especially if you store it in the freezer , then it remains stable forever . I love Amazon for virtually everything and buy virtually everything from Amazon , but in this particular instance , pricewise , Sam 's Club has me spoiled rotten . We use a load of instant yeast as we bake quite frequently . Fleischmans , the top brand is offered at $ .4.97 for 2 one pound packs . Been buying it for years there . No one else comes even close .
5 #### I finally stopped buying those little pouches . This yeast seems to work even better , and I can measure exactly what I need . I keep some in the fridge in a 4 - ounce jar , and the rest in the freezer . Love the money I 'm saving !
5 #### Love this yeast ! It blows the competition away ! Love the taste ! Great product !
4 #### Yes , I like this in my hot tea . No , I do not like it in my coffee .
1 #### I just received my package of Stevita Supreme stevia " sweetener " . It is the most repulsive tasting sweetener I have ever used . I 'm sure saccharine is better tasting than this stuff ! I did a side my side comparison of Stevita , aspartame and Splenda . The aspartame and Splenda are both decent tasting , and the Stevita is HORRIBLE ! Bitter , and tasting of some sort of chemical . Thank - god it was only [ ... ] bucks with free delivery because it 's probably going in the trash or to a soup kitchen - though the homeless certainly deserve better than this stuff .
5 #### This is an updated review for the third shipment as I purchase more than 10boxes for each order . I enjoy Stevita Supreme very much but there seems to be some inconsistency in the sweetness . The first box which I 've opened are n't sweetness ( and I 'm already using the 12th sachet in this particular box ) while the previous 2 shipments were all right . Can Stevita Stevia please explain on the inconsistency of sweetness and currently , I 've to use 1.5 sachet to get the sweetness while I use only one sachet for the 1st 2 shipments ? I still have 12 more boxes and I 'm wonderfing if I should continue using Stevia .
4 #### If you opened up a packet and tasted the powder on your tongue , you might find it rather gross as I did . BUT - and I am not sure why - if you use it in something like Tea or Coffee , it does n't take a lot to make a nice sweet taste without any of the bitterness or aftertaste when it is tasted by itself . This is great in Tea and a great alternative to Splenda and other sweeteners . Also , the price of this item is unbelievable at the $ 1.99 for 50 packets as it was when I purchased .
2 #### Rather bummed . Definitely got a bad batch . Yeast did not rise and basically there went the Thanksgiving bread . :( I think I 'm going back to packets .
5 #### This is the same yeast I used to get years ago !
5 #### I 've tried several brands of stevia and they all taste a little different . I think this is the best tasting stevia . It has a clean sweet taste . And I only need a little bit , one packet will last 3 - 4 drinks for me . If you 've shopped much for stevia , you know the price on this one is great , too .
5 #### I was suspicious at first because having used Truvia before , I noticed the packets were much lighter than the Truvia packets . The Truvia packets are 3.5gms each but the Stevita are only 1gm each . However , they sweeten just as well . Be careful not to over do it with Stevia sweeteners as this will give you a bitter taste . Both brands dissolve much better in hot beverages verses cold ones .
5 #### I only speak for myself when I say I really like the taste . I think it has to do with your tastebuds more than the product itself . I use it in my coffee everyday and I will keep buying this as long as I can .
5 #### These little votives are awesome ! Really bright and more white than others I 've bought . Realistic flicker too . I just bought more !
4 #### I like to have a large supply of baking items to make whatever i want without running to the store . This keep great sealed in a vaccuum sealed bag until i need it and also stores well in the fridge .
4 #### One of the biggest markups in home baking is for those little individual packets of yeast . This package will last the casual home baker for a loooong time ! You can freeze half , and keep the other half in a mason jar in the fridge . :) Each packet of the individual yeast contains 2 1/4 teaspoons of yeast , so all you do is scoop out that much when you 're making a recipe that calls for a packet . I 've had zero complaints or issues with my bread or pizza dough rising . Give it a try !
5 #### I used to have a small baking business . I still bake a fair amount of bread , all with my own personal recipes . I use only quality ingredients , and raw honey for the sweetener . Saf is the best yeast , better than the other two major companies . This is granulated yeast , and you measure it by the teaspoonful . I keep mine in the freezer in a tight plastic container , and use it directly from the freezer , putting the container right back in . I used to buy this yeast from the big famous baking catalog , but I 'm so happy that it 's available on Amazon . I buy everything from Amazon ! At this point in my life , I just use the Zo bread machines to bake my bread . They tell you to put the dry yeast granules on the top of all the other ingredients , but I do n't follow those directions . I always " proof " my yeast , which gives it a head start , by letting it sit for 10 minutes or so in the warm liquid with a little bit of honey , before adding the other ingredients . If you 're going to go to the trouble of making homemade bread , please use good yeast . NOTE : It seems that people reading this did NOT find my review helpful . I want you to know this is the best yeast there it . Keep it in the freezer , and it lasts for at least a year . Amazon ships really fast . Hope this helps . :)
5 #### Love this yeast and the price can not be beat . I bake a lot of artesan bread and this yeast is very reliable .
5 #### SAF makes great yeast ! Have been using SAF since it was introduced back in the early 80s .
5 #### Hands down the best yeast . No refrigeration required . Huge 1 pound pouch . And an affordable price .
5 #### I am new to baking breads and am excited about the prospect of being a good one . This is will use probably at least weekly , Good price for a nice product .
5 #### SAF is the best yeast around . You would n't think that a brand of yeast would matter , but believe me , it does . I have read enough food blogs to know . I also do recipe developing for a living . SAF is awesome !
5 #### Great yeast , works well and predictably , this is what most professional bakeries use for their yeast breads . Instant yeast has replaced " active dry " and does not require a sponge to proof , because it is very high viability and always works . You can mix it straight into the dry ingredients for your dough or starter , something you can not do with active dry . I 'm a natural levain/ sourdough bread baker , but I do make quick breads , brioche etc from time to time and this yeast works perfectly . If you 're making croissants or other Viennese/ Danish pastry from scratch , this is the yeast you want . Assuming that temperature and hydration ( etc ) are the same from batch to batch , you can set your watch by this yeast . SAF makes a gold label yeast that is more tolerant to high sugar content in the dough , but I 've had good success with this in sweet breads as well . You can use this to make decent French bread too , if you make a levain and let it slowly ferment in the refrigerator to build flavor and enzymes .
5 #### This brand is less expensive than the small grocery store jar . It 's also better . A scant tablespoon = one envelope . It 's vacuum packed , I believe , so I was delighted I had an extra wide - mouth Mason jar handy .
5 #### This is a very reliable yeast - works every time and is easy to use . I also like the large 16 oz . bag vs. packets as I make bread frequently . It is a little overpriced on Amazon . It 's probably more convenient for most to order here but as an FYI - you can find the 16 oz . bag of this at Walmart for only $ 3.50 .
1 #### Died only a couple of months after ordering it . Kept in a sealed , refrigerated container . I use yeast fast ( this was about 3/4 gone ) but there 's no excuse for it dying so quickly .
5 #### best yeast use at least 3 times a week . Makes the best dough and batter in the world . Much better that others .
5 #### SOO MUCH yeast . But I have gotten into bread making and you simply have to have it . I keep mine stored in the freezer . Keep some on the shelf it works fantastic . I also use mason jars to store most of my yeast in the freezer once I open the packaging . I keep a few tablespoons at time on the shelf in a little mason jar . Not sure it needs to be room temp when making bread but that s what I do . This makes wonderful bread . I 'm super pleased with this . I do a lot of the No - knead bread . It lasts and lasts .
5 #### We make lots of bread around here , and this is our go - to yeast . Love it - stays fresh a long time when stored properly
5 #### My husband has made 1000 's of loaves of bread . He like this yeast .
5 #### Love the Saf Instant yeast , compared to other yeasts on the market , it is far superior . Much better rise and yield from average loaf of white bread . So happy I could order this through Amazon , as I can not find it in my local grocery stores ! Great product , highly recommend ! !
2 #### one of the saf instant yeast was n't sealed do n't know if is safe to use !
5 #### Being able to buy this instant yeast in a large quantity is a money saver . This is one of the finest on the market . I freeze it ( in a freezer bag ) to maintain freshness . Even if I do n't use the whole amount before it loses its efficacy , it is still less expensive than buying it in envelopes .
5 #### Worked great today . I 've never used yeast but this worked fine . Bread looks great , rose great . I also think this is a good buy .
5 #### Works well as described and the price is right . * * * * * stars
5 #### This yeast works so well ... I do n't have to bother with other brands of yeast any longer . Yay , SAF !
5 #### It 's been working like a charm for my bread - maker , and I will continue to buy again .
5 #### This is the most convenient form of yeast , does n't have to be put in water first , just add directly to the flour . I keep it tightly sealed in a freezer container . I keep a 1/4 cup container in the frig and refill from the freezer stock as it gets low . I make bread several times monthly and have for years . It has never failed me .
5 #### Nice value , I put it into jars in the freezer . Used more than half . Performs well .
5 #### ONLY STUFF I USE ... I WONT USE ANYTHING ELSE .. I BAKE ALOT OF BREADS AND NO OTHER WILL DO IT FOR ME BUT THIS
4 #### Okay ........... I've got to come back and redo this review . I 've been making bread regularly ( from scratch ) and thought this would be a good investment . The first 2 times using this yeast , my bread turned into a big solid lump .. no rise . Tried twice and same result . I 've read through the comments to see if there was any advice to help the dough to rise . I 'm definitely not new to making bread ( regular loaf of bread ) . Soooo ......... I tried something . I kept the water only lukewarm , whipped in my 2 eggs ( I like to add eggs to my bread ) , and started adding my flour . I DID NOT work the dough very much . I mean , I punched it down and kneaded it for less than 2 minutes . Maybe even for just 1 minute . I stuck in in my oiled loaf pan and put it in the oven at 200 degrees for 30 minutes to rise . Then , I turned up the heat to 350 and cooked it for 35 minutes . Turned out great ! I 've done this twice now and this is what finally worked for me .
1 #### It is so much cheaper than buying it in the small packages . I store it in sealed container and made it super easy to use by writing 1 packet = 2 1/4 teaspoon right on the lid . This makes converting recipes that call for packets super easy to convert . I made several different recipes with this yeast . 2 separate times I made French bread and one cinnamon roll recipe . None of them turned out . I am very disappointed .
5 #### Best yeast I have purchased on the internet . I use them for bread and pizza dough . Works great with and without bread machine . It is very active . The dough is even active in refrigerator . The bread and pizza taste great . The price is right . After open the package , I left them in the same package then keep them in plastic bag inside the refrigerator . Will definitely purchase again and again !
5 #### Fresh and works great with my gluten free flour . I store it in the refrigerator to keep it fresh .
5 #### This is the best yeast ever . I could n't believe the difference it made in everything , including bread machine bread . And you use about half the amount called for in the recipe . I store it in an air tight container in the freezer . I would n't be without it now . It is in some of the local markets too . This is worth trying and see the difference for yourself . I was stunned at the excellent results from my bread maker , which I had given up on and relegated to the very back of a deep cabinet . Now we use it all the time with excellent results .
5 #### Good value , great product ! I use a lot of this .
5 #### I used this yeast today for the first time and am extremely impressed ! ! ! I made both whole wheat pizza dough and cinnamon roll dough , and both came out of the bread machine perfectly ! ! The dough 's were soft and fluffy , and they cooked beautifully in the oven . In the past , I 've only ever used Fleischmann 's brand yeast because that is all I could ever find in my local grocery stores ( which worked " fine " - I did n't really know any better ) , but this yeast made such an incredible difference in the rise of the dough during baking , as well as overall texture ( softer and " fluffier " tasting ) . I also could n't believe how great the price of this yeast was ! The Fleischmann 's jar of yeast I used to purchase was 4 oz and ran about $ 5 - 6 per jar . After seeing ( and tasting ) the difference , I will only buy this Saf yeast from now on ! ! Excellent product ! ! ! For reference -- the dough recipes I used have measurements for 3 difference types of yeast depending on which one you plan on using ( Active Dry , Quick Rise , and Bread Machine ) . I followed the measurements for " Active Dry " yeast when I used this Saf - Instant yeast .
5 #### My go - to instant yeast for sure ! It has lasted me a long time . I should probably check the date . lol I 'll buy this again once I run out or the date is expired .... whichever comes first . :)
5 #### This is my favorite yeast for baking our daily bread . The price is amazing and i have ( with many years of use ) never gotten a bad batch !
5 #### Very fast shipping . Our favorite for all our yeast breads . We use for hand made as well as machine made doughs with excellent results .
5 #### saf - instant yeast is a staple in my pantry . It 's been a great yeast I 've used for decades and the quality is always excellent .
5 #### I have not as yet tried to use this product . Yet , from all of the fantastic reviews , I am sure I am going to love it ! Thank You , Joseph
5 #### Great yeast . I will have to order some more soon since mine is almost out . Great for breads , rolls , etc . I keep mine in the freezer so it stays fresh and it works great when I put it in my bread recipes .
5 #### Use this instead of the store bought yeast as it mixes in without activating it is water first . Have made breads , pizza 's etc with great results . Keep in freezer to store inside plastic bag as it will take me awhile to use it all . No need to thaw and can use room temp water / milk once all dry ingredients are mixed together .
5 #### My go to yeast . Always dependable . Easy to use .
5 #### this is good yeast , I use it as a booster for my sourdough bread . I would definetly recommend to others to buy this product . I keep the bulk amount in the freezer in a jar and a small amount in my refrigerator for immediate use , truthfully I have found I bake a lot so I do n't have to worry about it even being in the freezer . I will purchase this again .
5 #### Great yeast ! Have made countless breads with it . Store in the freezer .
5 #### I never used Yeast before , but my bread came out awesome , so I guess it did its job . The only thing I did n't really like was that it was n't a resealable container .
2 #### Not impressed with this . I purchased as I love to bake bread and cinnamon rolls . I 've found it does not rise as well as others . I 've tried many different methods all with results less than expected . Not sure if I got a bad batch as the other reviews were great which is why I purchased it .
5 #### Great value . I use this for pizza dough and it turns out every time .
3 #### Does n't work as well as other yeast we 've tried .
5 #### Best breads I 've baked , I baked with Saf . No more packets in the pantry . Just a big bin of Saf in the fridge . I swear by the stuff and I bake with less anxiety knowing my yeast will always be potent and kicking
5 #### Excellent yeast ! Makes my baking turn out like magic !
1 #### I was making a fermented bread ( rustic ) which ferments and grows overnight , by this morning it did n't grow one bit . I had to throw it all away . I looked at the package and could n't find the date at first ... then I unfolded little folds at the bottom and there it was , COV 2011 . Shame on these people . Do not buy this yeast . Waste of money and your time .
5 #### I have to say , this puts other yeast to shame ! ! ! ! I do n't know when bread companies stopped the yeast smell I remember as a child , but I guess some people do n't like that smell . I will tell you that this makes some beautiful bread and it 's worth the extra price you pay ! Have n't had an ugly bread yet . Keep in Freezer to last longer :)
5 #### My go to favorite yeast for daily bread making . Always works well without issue .
5 #### Awesome yeast . Love it . ,have some in freezer and fridge . Dependable and a good quantity . I was always running out of the small Fleushman 's and packets .
5 #### This really made a difference ! I made two " no knead " breads , both with 1/4 tsp of yeast . One using my usual grocery store " fast acting " yeast and one with this . I left the bowls on the counter all day as usual . The SAF yeast bread rose almost 1/3 higher compared to the regular yeast , and did so faster too . This is the yeast of choice for all professional bakeries . I keep it in the refrigerator for best results . I will be buying it again for sure
5 #### Love this stuff ! Very pleased to find it at such a great price here on Amazon . I 've yet to have any type of failure with this yeast and I bake A LOT . I can go through one of these in 3 - 4 months . It 's great to be able to take it out of the freezer and throw it right in with the other ingredients without have to do the warm water and sugar thing to activate it . Highly recommended !
5 #### This yeast keeps perfectly in the freezer ; no worries about buying a one pound container . We have an unusual situation - two members of my family are allergic to regular yeast , especially the type found in commercial french bread . This has nothing to do with gluten , it is the yeast itself . I make bread almost every day using Saf Instant with zero problems . Highly recommended .
5 #### I love this yeast ! Perfect for all my baking !
5 #### Yeast in tiny packets ( one per loaf ) is horribly expensive ( about $ 1 per packet ) , and may exceed the cost of the flour . The little jars are better that way , but still not cheap ( $ 3 - 4 , I think ) . What IS cheap is these 1 - pound packages . The last one that I bought cost about $ 8 , and it lasted me for three years ( despite making two 3 - pound loaves per week . Once the foil package is opened , there is a risk that the moisture in the air will cause the yeast to go bad faster . So I open the pack only to fill the jars , and then close - pin it shut and keep it in a cool dry place . It might last even longer in the fridge or freezer , but even in a cabinet . it seemed just as active after three years as when I first opened it .
5 #### This is the best yeast I 've ever used ... and I am an avid baker . I 'll go through , at least , a few pounds of instant yeast in a year . Yeast is consistent and develops a great flavor profile during extended fermentations . I 'll always have one in the freezer and one in the fridge so I never run out ... not easy to find in the store , so this is one of my regular purchases on Amazon .
5 #### I use it in my breadmaker at least once a week . i keep in the fridge and it is lasting a good while .
2 #### my bread are n't rising like when I use Red Star . I know I have this brand before but I 'm totally disappointed .
5 #### I bake bread often , and I 'm constantly buying those little jars or packages of yeast at the grocery store . Now I 've found this great yeast which comes in a one pound package for practically the same price as the little 4 ounce jar . Much more convenient too . I emptied the package into an air - tight glass jar so it will stay fresh - it 's also easy to measure this way . It IS a lot of yeast , but even if it loses its potency before I use it all up ( which I doubt ) , it will still be a bargain .
5 #### Le Saffre 's Instant yeast is as effective as any I 've tried , and this one - pound brick is much more economically priced than options available at my local grocery stores ( including the little jars of store - brand " bread machine " yeast ) . I bake bread just about every day , so both of those considerations are important . Breads made with Saf - Instant rise fast and high , and there 's no need to proof the yeast ( though it wo n't hurt anything if you do ) . Even if you do n't bake fresh bread every day , this yeast will keep for a very long time in the fridge ( or , as many have pointed out , in the freezer ) . Pour it into a clean , wide - mouthed jar ( a mid - sized canning jar or a leftover pasta sauce jar , throughly washed , will do nicely ) for ease of use .
5 #### I find I love to use this when I want quicker results . Handles higher heat than regular dry yeast so you can start with hotter water and get a quicker rise . Great flavor . You need to play around when subbing for regular yeast though often need less . Expect more air bubbles too . If you want sandwich looking bread with uniform holes I would use regular yeast for that . This is great for pizza dough and breadsticks !
5 #### Arrived on time in good shape as advertised . Great book .
5 #### One of the best yeasts . One you can depend on as long as you keep it in the freezer until to need it .
5 #### I use a lot of yeasts and this is by far the best , the most reliable .
5 #### Pure and simple . Never use ANYTHING else . Always fresh , just toss into the freezer and before I started baking like mad I 've used this yeast after it was in my freezer for a couple Years and it performed perfectly . Love that you just add directly to the flour and no blooming in water . I make artisan breads and would n't dream of using anything but SAF instant yeast . Has NEVER failed me
5 #### With a new bread machine , I 've started making a lot of bread and other yeast risen doughs . This stuff is very reliable and consistent . I have not had a failure yet .
5 #### I bake all our breads and rolls . I 've been using this brand for at least five years now with consistent excellent results .
5 #### I like this form of yeast . I bake a lot , so I have no trouble using it all up . It was pretty warm when it was delivered , but I suppose that 's just the consequence of long distance shipping .
5 #### Has made a big difference in my bread making
5 #### LOVE IT ! I have been experimenting with making palatable gluten free bread and this yeast has helped me in that so much . I would highly recommend this to anyone frustrated with dry , yucky - taste and texture gluten free products . What a difference ! I have even masgtered a lovely pumpernickel loaf and buns ! YAY ! ! !
5 #### Best Dry Yeast I have ever used . It is always active , and really does not need proofing . I keep the bag in my freezer and it 's always ready to go when I need it ,
5 #### This is the only yeast I use . Because of the large content , I keep it in my freezer .
5 #### Hoisin sauce is yummy . I mix it with several other ingredients to make peanut sauce , or we eat it plain with rice or rice noodles . I have tried other brands , but I really like this one . The flavor is just right and it 's sweet enough , but not too sweet . It is a little thicker than some others , similar to the thickness of oyster sauce .
4 #### Why make it yourself at this price ? Well packaged and it arrived quickly . I will buy it again when the time comes .
5 #### I use this stuff like it was ketchup , honestly . It goes with everything . Hoisin is awesome on chinese food , thai food , vietnamese food , its good with hamburgers , fries , and even with steak instead of steak sauce . Hoisin is sweet , and salty and has this certain kick to it that makes it unique amoung condiments . The first time i ever saw it used was when i was watching PBS Yan Can Cook , and he busted out the Lee Kum Kee bottle and i was mesmerized with its rich brown color , and Yan Can do no wrong with me ! ! ! !
5 #### " Works well " is an understatement . I could probably use less of this stuff than the recipe calls for and still come out ahead . Packaging is super air tight and can be stored in freezer bags in fridge or freezer . Any air tight container should do . Really happy with the results and the cost . Way cheaper and better than anything from the store .
3 #### Not sure . Made some sprouted grain bread that called for instant yeast and the bread did not rise . I am trying again and I 'll use a little more than the recipe calls for next time . Could have been the recipe but I was able to get the bread to rise fine in the past by increasing actives dry yeast so I really can not compare . I had been told by several bread bakers that instant is best so I will give it another shot .
3 #### this sauce is so so . its really thick so it doenst stick well to the meat . i actually prefer the powdered char siu to this sauce . if you do use this sauce , make sure to save the left over marinade to baste the meat while cooking .
5 #### It takes ages to finish a bag .... and somehow I am on my second ! This is an excellent product . Reliable , consistent and effective every time . I store it in the refrigerator . I use it all the time . I have even used it past its expiration date and the yeast just springs to life like crazy . It lifts even whole grain flours into beautifully risen breads . This is a work - horse in your baking arsenal !
5 #### I used it to soak steak in a few hours prior to cooking . Great flavor !
5 #### Wow great amount for the price ... have it stored in the freezer to keep it good until use ... thank you !
5 #### YUMMY add in for homemade PHO . I travelled to Seattle last year and experience real authentic Pho for the first time . Needless to say I fell in love with the yummy rich savory soup . I have started trying to recreate the experience at home since Alabama is not a place to find this soup . This particular sauce is one of many that I have purchased and this one is the only one that comes close to the condiment we used in Seattle .
5 #### Best moderately price hoisin sauce I 've found . Recommend it .
5 #### Love this sauce , use it for all types of cooking !
5 #### I have tried all yeasts and this is the best ... yes will last for a long time in freezer but i reorder after 1 yr as starts to lose it action ... still works but slows a bit ...
5 #### We love the 1 pound pouch of Saf Instant Yeast . It makes great bread . Have n't been disappointed yet and the price beats the individual packets at the market . Will definitely buy again ! !
5 #### No problems with this stuff . It works and works very well .
5 #### Love this brand Hoisin Sauce . Will pay again . Great flavor and increases the taste of all the foods I use it on . VERY GOOD PRODUCT
4 #### This is a tasty Hoisin sauce . Its better that what you can normally buy in a regular grocery store .
5 #### My dad owned a donut shop for years and this is the only yeast he would use . Now that I have found it on Amazon , I wo n't be buying the little brown bottles in the grocery store anymore . We made bread this past weekend and the yeast did its thing . I am using the empty little brown glass jar , from my last grocery store purchase of yeast , to store this yeast in the refrigerator . The rest is in the freezer . I love the fact that I can use it right out of the freezer , just in case I mess up and run out of my refrigerator stash .
3 #### What can I say that is not something anyone does now know already about this yeast . It 's just yeast people . you 'll need it to make your bread products .
5 #### I received this a few weeks ago and immediately made a loaf of focaccia bread in a large loaf pan to have with dinner and again for sandwiches while we were blizzard - bound . Next , tried some semolina pizza dough . Easy to use without having to proof it , just added to all the other ingredients at once . Am thinking I could probably use a bit less than recipes call for , since the rise is quite voluminous , and in less time than expected . My pizza dough continued to grow in the fridge and I had to punch iit down to keep it at bay . The crust was beautifully chewy . Have also made sesame semolina loaves , challah , olive - rosemary bread , and caraway rye . I keep the whole batch of yeast double wrapped in the freezer in two zipolc baggies , and just reach in for two tsp whenever a recipe calls for " a packet of yeast " . Two tsp weighs exactly 1/4 ounce on my kitchen scale . Will never buy any other brand of yeast again - this stuff is the bomb !
5 #### I have had really good results with this yeast , will purchase again .
5 #### I use this for all my baking now , and the results are excellent . One thing to remember , this is INSTANT yeast , not your typical red - and - yellow active - dry yeast from the grocery store . You need significantly less of this than active - dry . According to the conversion charts I 've seen , 1 1/2 tsp of this is equivalent to one package of the red - and - yellow stuff . I use this all the time for making French and Italian breads , not a single failure . As an advantage , you do n't have to proof this yeast , just put it right in . OTOH , I do proof , just because that 's what I 'm used to doing . I did try one non - proof bread batch , worked perfectly . I took this rather amazingly large amount of yeast and split it up into 2 oz packages and froze the ones I 'm not using . This will last me for years .
5 #### Love this Hoisin . I purposefully buy from Amazon because I ca n't find anything as good in the stores here .
5 #### Great stuff for stir frying ! You ca n't go wrong with hoisin sauce .
3 #### Inexpensive , but a little sour . Koon Chun Hoisin Sauce hoisin sauce is more expensive , but tastes better .
5 #### Great product ... store in your freezer for very long shelf life .
5 #### Works really well for the express setting when using a break maker . I do n't always have the patience to wait 3 hours to make bread , so this is nice .
5 #### This yeast always works ! In fact , I had some in the freezer for over a year and it still provided a nice rise to the bread ! So do n't worry about buying a large pouch if you are an occasional baker because you can just store it in the freezer .
5 #### Just started cooking Asian and Korean food and find this in many of my recipes .
3 #### Tastes amazing but the label was ripped off when i got it .
1 #### This is my fault for not checking the ingredients before buying . There is no food in this ! I will not buy this gross brand of products again .
5 #### I have had alot of different Hoisin sauces and this one is the best . A little goes a long way
5 #### This yeast is the best I have ever used in 50 years of baking . Thank You !
4 #### Its great ! The price is great , the taste is great and it works wonderfully in all my recipes .
5 #### This is the only yeast I use . I make our own bread products . Saf - instant works great in the bread maker and also in the conventional way kneading by hand for other items . I store in the freezer until I open the package . After opening I put in a glass jar and keep it in the refrigerator . I do prefer it over other brands in the stores .
5 #### WOW- My awesome husband BBQ on stakes ... ohh yummy melted in your mouth watering . Once a tangy glaze and more BBQ flavoring just is out of this world . For get you Panda Express sauces . This is the best we 've found so far . The bottle was wrapped well , however the cap that snaps on was broken . Over all I ca n't wait to find more ways to cook with this .
2 #### One 2 tablespoons serving spoon of this sauces has 44 % of daily intake of sodium . I am horrified . Tried searching Amazon for low sodium Hoisin Sauce found none . But I did find a very simple recipe to make your own Hoisin Sauce using wholesome ingredients in small batches . Homemade Hoisin Sauce in Food.com by Alskann
4 #### I 've used this to season stir - fried veggies . Also used it to season a grilled pork chop the other evening . I like it . Next challenge is to use it when I try my hand at fixing barbecued Chinese spare ribs .
5 #### Great Taste ! This is now my go to Hoisin
5 #### I like that you can keep it in the freezer , and no need for proofing ! Works as expected .
5 #### I never had luck baking bread until I found this yeast .
5 #### nice yeast . gone thru about 20 % of it in 2 months with excellent results . I have found a local source for this yeast for the same price .
5 #### A must have for rolls and bread ! Better than the store bought jar stuff .
5 #### First time I ever purchased Hoisin Sauce , wo n't be the last . great in meatloaf , just hamburgers , on ramen noodles , steamed veggies , etc .
4 #### Pretty good . Not as flavorful as some I have had .
4 #### This is the perfect hoisin sauce . A little too salty for my taste but everyone at my house liked it . My only negative is that the bottle goes fast !
5 #### I could n't find anything except small packets at the store . This is a huge amount of yeast and such a convenience . Mostly I use it in my bread maker and to make pizza dough weekly .
5 #### This yeast has been working great . I was always using RED STAR but this is just as good if not better . I 've mainly used it with wet doughs and have noticed that my rising time when throwing some boules or loafs can be easily shortened , even though the weather has been cool and cold . I took mine from the bag and put it in mason jars as I always have . I did n't see any clumps - it was well stored , and looked and has acted very fresh .
5 #### Excellent addition to my Asian pantry . Do n't add it to any pan on the range , though . It will burn and make a sticky mess . Rather , take stir fried protein , like sliced pork or chicken , and add the sauce immediately after you take the dish off the heat .
5 #### Excellent product . Ca n't be without it in making my Asian sauces that call for this flavor . Have tried other brands , but this seems to be my favorite .
5 #### Good hoisin flavor , just the right consistency . Actually cheaper than the name brand at my local supermarket and better taste
5 #### Great flavor . Actually , tastes like chicken . I use it with everything that requires broth . Highly recommend .
5 #### The best out there , Good Chicken flavor and not salty
3 #### So - so chicken flavor . Tons of product for little cost .
5 #### This yeast is awesome ! The best I 've ever used . A must have for bread bakers .
5 #### Great hoisin sauce . This stuff is delicious . I love this brand .
1 #### People said this was good for dipping . This is horrible . I sure was n't treating my tastebuds when I bought this . However I have found a recipe to put this with other things , like soy sauce , sesame oil , and make a shrimp , broccoli pour over , . I bought two bottles , big mistake . This may be the best of the Hoisin sauce , but then I hate Hoisin sauce . If you have no idea what Hoisin sauce is , do n't try to find out . Nasty stuff .
5 #### It 's Hoisin sauce . You should know why you 're buying it and what it tastes like . ( If not , go to your local Asian restaurant down the street and have them suggest a dish that goes best with some Hoisin . )
5 #### Love using this product for many dishes from gravies to stir fry to soups ..... anything you cook . I 've added it to the water in making rice and noodles . Gives it a nice flavor .
5 #### This bouillon is really delicious . I 've tried many different brands and this is the top , no doubt . I made a great simple soup using this as a base and added some chopped cabbage , julienne carrots and celery , a dash of soy sauce and sesame oil and then some frozen dumplings that I had . Really great stuff , looking forward to cooking with it more .
4 #### Used to use chicken cubes . Switched to powder , b - coz it melts better . I felt it not as salty as well .
5 #### I 've so far used this in a basic bread recipe and for pizza dough and it has been so easy ! I 'm not the best dough - maker , so I was thankful to have this simple solution . This yeast combined with my Kitchen Aid mixer has made break making so simple .
5 #### When they say " instant " that 's exactly what they mean . Really fast acting yeast . I 'm using it to make a sourdough batter and so far , I 'm very pleased at how well it 's working .
5 #### Preferred by Pro Bakers . Easy to use , long shelf life if refrigerated .
5 #### We bake a lot of bread and this yeast has never let us down .
3 #### The sauce is hoisin sauce . The taste is fine . There are no complaints on that . The bottle , however , could 've been packed better AND could 've been delivered undamaged . Not only is the bottle dented , which is n't a bit deal , but part of the top is missing . The flip part broke off at some point in time . Now , if I 'd found it in the box , I would 've given this 4 - 5 stars and pouted for second . But the top was n't in the box , at all , which means it was damaged in the warehouse and sent to me anyway . That 's unacceptable . Plus , the place where it snapped off is now jagged and dangerous . Unfortunately I do n't have a top to replace it with .
5 #### This is my favorite Hoisin sauce , and I 've tried many brands .
5 #### Tasty plum sauce for your asian cooking needs . It has the correct texture , consistency , and flavor . I would recommend to anyone who needs Hoisin Sauce
5 #### Wonderful stuff . I have made my own stock over the years and that is good , but it does take time . I have also purchased a number of paste bouillon versions ( double the quantity - trust me ) . But this one is exceptionally flavorful ( and I double the amount suggested ) and in my opinion a more than acceptable substitute for stock , homemade that is . In my opinion , over 90 % of the commercial stock as is is junk . If you have to use it or prefer to use it , at least do what Julia Childs recommends , i.e. , doctor it up with some vegetables and herbs .
5 #### Good product , but have discovered I can get the same thing at a better price at Costco .
3 #### This is an okay sauce . Rather bland and non descript , but it can be a good addition to your table . I bought this as a dipping sauce for Chinese dumplings , and it works okay . Not sure why , but it feels like it is missing something .
4 #### It has a great taste and is vegetarian too ! Because I 'm not a meat eater , finding good tasting items that pack flavor is difficult to do . This especially holds true for Chinese Food . Often my Chinese food take out , has offered to put Oyster Sauce in my dishes , and I have had to say no , please do n't . But now I can make home dishes that actually taste like they came out of the Take Out place ! ! ! I just sautee up my veggies and add LoMein noodles with this lovely Hoisin sauce , and I 'm loving the dish ! When it comes in at a fraction of the cost of take out , well , I 'm loving that even more !
4 #### Essential for mastering Chinese cooking , Hoisin sauce is a must have for those who would learn to cook Chinese food . It has a subtle flavor and blends well with other seasonings to add taste without overhwhelming or standing out .
5 #### I love Hoisin Sauce , and this brand is very tasty , no complaints .
5 #### I am using this for my gluten free bread and it is nice not to have to worry about running out of yeast all the time .
5 #### Add this to your stir fry dish for a quick WOW taste ! I fell in love with this stuff at one of my favorite restaurants . The effect is just as good at home , and it 's much easier to order on Amazon than it is to find it in the grocery .
5 #### hoisin sauce is a staple in my house ... i cook a lot with it all the time ...
5 #### Better than anything at the Grocery Store and lower in sodium .
3 #### too sweet and does n't taste like mongolian beef sauce
5 #### It 's scary how much I love hoisin sauce . My local grocer does n't carry this brand , and their brand is not nearly as good . I use this on everything from chicken , to noodles , to home - made beef jerky . I find the below to be a great marinade : 1/2 cup hoisin 1/2 cup soy sauce 2 tsp garlic 1 tbs five spice 1 tbs onion powder Mix thoroughly and marinade 6 - 8 hours . works great on pretty much anything .
5 #### Great sauce I mix it with the Lee Kum Kee Char Siu Chinese Barbecue Sauce over ribs . Does not get any better
5 #### The absolute best yeast you will ever use unless your using fresh . What a noticeable difference while using this compared to store bought active dry yeast in those little packages . I 'm hooked for life , awesome yeast .
5 #### I usually buy tons of stuff here on Amazon , but when I started looking for Hoisin I just trodded through the grocery stores . All they had was some no name brand in a jar . I do n't know about you but when I am eating chinese or vietnamese food I am for the most part using chop sticks and just want to hose something on it and pop it in my mouth . The only kind I ever saw in restaurants was this kind with the squirty bottle and got used to it . The jar just looked stupid , then you would need a spoon , then a bowl , then cleanup ahhhh . Had a brain flash and said " look on Amazon and there it was . Same brand as the good food places I frequent . Life is now complete .
3 #### Description sed a little sweet and mild spicey . I did nit find it sweet at a all but more like soy sauce thickened up . JMO .
5 #### I learned how to roll summer rolls . Hoisin sauce is great for the filling . If you like Asian foods , this is a necessary .
5 #### Taste . Goes well with Asian foods but can be used for just about anything . This product has good taste and quality .
4 #### this is something you need for chinese cooking and you 'll start finding other uses for it as you get more adventuring in your cooking
5 #### I needed Hoisin sauce for some of my recipes and never remember to buy it , so I ordered this . It is very tasty and definitely adds to the dishes I cook . Definitely will order this again .
5 #### I use a small quantity of this yeast on top of the dry ingredients in my Zojirushi bread machine ... and get perfect results every time .
5 #### I am very satisfied with the Saf - Instant Yeast product . I use it with my gluten free bread which is baked in a bread machine . The bread comes out great . Will repurchase this item again .
5 #### This is the best yeast ever ! ! Perfect results every time .
4 #### my family must have gluten - free products and I am so glad that I was able to get this sauce . It is very good ! I use it often in my cooking Asian foods .
4 #### I think I need to try other hoisin brands , the taste is good but I do n't have enough experience to tell if I like this one as much as I might like another . It 's like ketchups , I love Heinz but hate the rest . I will update once I try some other hoisin as to which is my favorite kind .
5 #### I ca n't ever find this brand or an equivalent size in my area , I love the flavor of this on our stir fry dishes
5 #### This is my first time using this ingredient in my fried rice ; I find that it perks up the taste .
3 #### Packaging keeps product dry , taste is fine , unfortunately the lid is too cheap and hinge broke on my first use , then the side of the cap split on a second use .
5 #### Be Very Clear before you order this product , it is MSG . Aji - no - Moto is in this case meant to perk up the flavor of rice and whatever seasoning you put on it . This is a Japanese product but it can be found through out most of Asia . If your going to eat plain white rice may as well perk it up a bit , use only a little .
5 #### i bake alot . this is a necessity . awwesome product .
5 #### I have used this yeast for YEARS and it is the only kind I will ever use again ! LOVE IT and expect extra rising !
5 #### I bought a new bread machine & was having issues with bread rising . My Fleishman 's yeast was not expired ( even tried going out & buying fresh ) and have used their yeast for many other items done by hand without issue , but did not work well in my new bread machine . So I am not knocking Fleishman 's yeast , it is a good product for many baking uses . This Saf yeast was recommended by the bread machine company when I called them to discuss the issue I was having of bread not rising well or rising & falling at the end of the baking cycle , is an issue no longer with the Saf yeast . Maybe it tolerates higher temperatures , not sure but I highly recommend this yeast for anyone using a bread machine although I am sure it would work great if you were baking items by hand as well .
5 #### This yeast is perfect for no kneed artisan bread ( see picture of artisan bread made in 5 qt lodge cast iron pot ) . This yeast is made to add to dry ingredients . This yeast does NOT need to first proof in warm liquid . Recommend you not add it to liquid . Add it to your dry ingredients or add it to your autolyzed flour / water . After opening I placed half in the freezer in a zip lock bag and half in an air tight container in the refrigerator . Update : 06/26/2016 I have been using this instant yeast almost weekly for several years now . This yeast does a wonderful job of raising dough and making no knead bread . I use it for no knead bread , pizza dough , cinnamon rolls , dinner roles , kaiser rolls , fougasse , ciabatta , bagels , babka , rye bread , sourdough bread , raisin bread , etc . I have taught about 12 friends and neighbors in my kitchen how to bake no knead bread and always give them some SAF yeast in a container to get them started when they go home . Highly recommend .
5 #### This is the best yeast I have found for all bread making . SAF makes a " Gold " version that is supposed to be for sweet dough , but this works very well for sweet dough as well as not sweet . I keep mine in a bale - lid canister in the freezer , and it lasts forever and keeps fresh . No need to proof it in water before adding to the flour , so very easy to use .
5 #### I keep part of it in the fridge and the rest in a jar in the freezer . I looked at several websites and they stated this method works well . I bought it here on Amazon but you can buy it from your local Costco or other big retailer cheaper but too late .
5 #### It is very active . It made the best bread I have made in a long time , on my first try . I use a bread machine to mix the dough , then bake it in a large , covered glass mixing bowl .
5 #### In the past , I 've always just used Fleischmann 's active dry . That works really well , no question about it . Here 's why this I 'd say this is better : 1 ) Cost - WAY cheaper than anything you can buy in the store . You have to use a decent amount of yeast to use this much ( It 's a LOT ) , but if you do , it 's a very good deal . This is probably 1/5 the cost anything you can buy in the stores . 2 ) In my opinion , the flavor is slightly better than other yeast brands . I ca n't say it was vastly better , but subtly better . It will probably take me a few years to use this much yeast . To save it - I 've used a Ball jar . Do n't open the vacuum packed package until you need it , but when you do , empty the remaining yeast into your ball jar . Close it tight . Freeze it . Yeast will keep for several years in the freezer ( worked just fine in the past ) .
4 #### What can I say , it 's yeast . I hate those little square packs you get at the store . This I can measure out easy when a recipe calls for more or less then the little packages .
5 #### I have baked with yeast for years so I have some experience with the various brands and types of yeast available . Saf - instant yeast rises better than anything I have used , without making the bread full of holes , like some will if it 's allowed to rise too fast . At the price , it 's a wonderful bargain , too ! A whole pound costs less than half the price of those little 4 ounce jars of two other brands I know of . I definitely recommend it .
5 #### First use I put the remaining yeast into 2 jars and put into the refrigerator . Using almost weekly for bread baking and its working great , much more economical and less aggravating than those little packets of yeast .
5 #### used this when I got it to make homemade bread in bread machine on dough cycle ... dough rose wonderfully compared to the active dry yeast I had been using ( which is still within expiration timeframe) ... went online and found out I can freeze this ... so I keep it in an airtight lock and lock container ... still works very well direct from freezer ... it arrives in vacuum packed foil type pouch
5 #### I keep mine in the freezer and have perfect rising every time . This is so good I gave it as a gift with the pizza 5 min . a day book .
4 #### If someone is baking a lot with yeast it is worth buying this large size . The yeAst is effective , makes the dough rise well , and it is economical . I freeze large amount , keep handy small portion in refrigerate for daily use . It can keep a long time is such a way .
5 #### It showed up right on schedule and works a lot better than the grocery store stuff . I especially like how you can just mix it in the flour dry and it works fine that way , no proofing the yeast .
5 #### It 's yeast so I do n't know what else to say . It works well and got here quick . I will be ordering more .
5 #### Great price and product overall . I wish there was a better way to seal and store package after opening it .
5 #### I bake all of my own homemade bread ( ca n't stand the store stuff ) and this yeast has a shelf life of 2 years in an airtight container in the fridge . I highly recommend it !
5 #### This yeast is slightly stronger than the average rapid yeast . If your recipie calls for MORE than 1 1/2 tsp of yeast , you can subtract 1/4 tsp to get similar results compared to most rapid yeasts . I split up the package into one large sealed BPA free Rubbermaid 4 up container ... and one 4 ounce everyday container for daily use . The big one goes in the freezer and the little one goes into the reefer . You save a lot over getting the small packets !
5 #### I keep it in an airtight container in the freezer and have used the same batch for several years . Works consistently with great results . I wo n't use any other in my baking , whether by hand or in a bread machine . Love it ...
5 #### I have used this yeast for making bread in my bread machine and also for making home made artisan bread and pizza . I have achieved good and consistent results across the board . 16 ounces is a lot of yeast but I still use it quickly enough . I keep it in the brown glass yeast jars from previous yeast purchases and/or vacuum seal bags in the freezer until I am ready to use more .
5 #### I love this yeast . Learned about it when taking a bread making class in Phoenix . What other yeast lets you make whole wheat bread with one rising ? There have been a couple of times I let the dough set too long and I just kneaded again and gave it a second rise . . popped it in the oven when ready . You can freeze it in a freezer ziplock bag and never worry about it expiring - I have used it well past the date given and never had a problem ! Fabulous for those morning rolls you need to make quickly as you make the dough , roll it out , let it rise ONE TIME and BAM , " Bob 's your uncle ! " .
5 #### I have always used Saf so this is a prejudiced review . I keep it in an airtight , moisture proof container in the refrigerator . It has been in my fridge for over a year at times and less than 6 months for most of the time . There are currently only 2 people in this household , unlike the 8 before , when I 'd use it up much faster . I love baking all kinds of breads with this . Challah once a week , sandwich bread , rolls , french bread , etc ... I should say that I grind my own wheat and it is a great yeast for that heavier flour .
4 #### I make bread every week and i go through a lot of yeast . This yeast seems to work much better than those jars from the store . I leave mine in the fridge and it takes maybe six months to use the whole package . In that time , i do n't see any less activity from the same amount of yeast . I roll the pouch down and secure it with a rubber band to limit air . Rises great , lasts long , great value . Ca n't go wrong there .
5 #### It works well in my bread recipes .. I will be ordering again ... It also worked well in my sisters bread machine ..
5 #### If you are one who bakes as much as I so , this is the product for you . I keep it in the freezer and measure out just the amount I want . I have never had a failure with this yeast . My breads rise very well and it has not discernible taste .
5 #### I 'm a repeat customer when buying this brand of instant yeast . I 've used this brand for years and am very satisfied . When purchasing through amazon.com , I was able to bundle it w/ other amazon items for no shipping costs . And I 've found that this offer via amazon is cheaper than other vendors for the same item . BTW , I keep this yeast in an air - lock container in the freezer . It keeps very well in that manner . Excellent quality . And I 'd buy it again from amazon if the price remain cheapest found .
5 #### Do n't know why , and it has n't kept me from baking bread , but yeast has never been my friend . Thought the problem was the " mainstream brands , " but I bought a case of Bob 's Red Mill and did n't get ONE RISE out of it ( their customer service department never responded to my questions and complaint , either ; I poured every package into the compost ) . Today is the first day it wo n't be too hot to bake , so I opened the saf and started some bread . At first I thought I had another dud on my hands because after twenty minutes there were NO bubbles . But I could hear it crackling ! So I added the flour , kneaded the dough for a few minutes , and put it in the oven to rise . OMG THIS YEAST IS FANTABULOUS ! ! ! Checked on the first rise a few minutes ago and my jaw dropped . I have NEVER had bread rise this high before . This loaf is flour , alone ; ca n't wait to see what happens when I add flax , herbs , etc . , but would expect equally excellent results . SO happy to have saf in my arsenal and cupboard now , especially since Santa is bringing me a turbo convection oven which will allow me to bake bread all year long ( standard ovens and the tropics are not a good year-'round pairing ) . No question but that I 'll be buying more ( and in larger quantities since it can be kept well in the freezer for years ) .
5 #### This is just the best yeast ! I always get a perfect rise out of it and my kids love the taste it adds to breads , etc . I keep a pouch in my fridge and store one in my freezer for all my bread and baking needs .
5 #### It 's all I use , love this stuff ! I always have a spare pound in the freezer then I need it , I take it out , put it in a jar and then keep it handy in the refrigerator for months . Never have had a problem always works perfectly .
5 #### As someone that bakes a LOT , for my own family and others , Saf has been a dependable yeast . If you use yeast , it is absolutely throwing money out of the window to buy the small packets . I 've used yeast that has been frozen for over 3 years , and it is still active . I portion it into glass jars and always have a few in the freezer and one in the fridge . It lasts far beyond the expiration date when frozen . For each packet of yeast called for in a recipe , use 2 1/4 teaspoons .
4 #### Now that I have been using the SAF Gold yeast I ca n't really give the Red 5 star ratings anymore . The SAF Red works fine ... but if you are using Home Milled Whole Wheat flour I highly recommend using the Gold .
5 #### I make all of my own bread , so I go through a lot of yeast ! I just laugh at the tiny packets and jars supermarkets tend to stock . This one - pound bag lasts a good long while . I keep some in a jar in the fridge , and the rest sealed in a bag in the freezer to replenish the jar as needed . It seems like really good yeast -- it does n't have to be proofed but can go straight into baked goods ' dry ingredients . And the results with SAF are consistent , unlike with other yeasts . I used to have trouble with bread not rising sometimes when it seemed like I 'd done everything right . With SAF , if you follow the same steps , you will get the same results . And that matters a lot to me .
4 #### i ve baked a good 5 loaves with this including some brioche . turns out great everytime . would order again , except its going to take me forever to get through this purchase .
4 #### I did research and read that SAF is about the best yeast in the world . Well ... I have found it works better with some recipes and not as well with others . ( Whole Wheat vs White , Home Milled Flour vs Store Bought ) . This is also a large amount of yeast . I am not sure if it is to be refrigerated or not ... but I have chosen to vacuum seal it in a Mason Jar and store in fridge to try and keep it fresh for as long as possible . In the future , I will stick with the other smaller jars I can get at the grocery store .
5 #### This is a fantastic price for a fantastic price . Even if you do n't bake a lot , it is the same price as three of those little tiny packages you get at the grocery store . I keep mine in the freezer and it works as good as the first day I bought it after 3 years !
4 #### I have been bread baking for a couple of years , always buying my yeast at the local supermarket , where the amount is small and the price outrageously high . well , that has changed . I saw this yeast type for sale on other web sites as well , KAF for one . The price here was better by a little , and I was ordering other things so I added this in . Glad I did , the yeast really works , and you get a big bag ... do not fear , you can easily freeze a good chunk of it for later and it will be fine . I am using this yeast now and the results are excellent . Do not let the low price point scare you off , this is a good product , and amazon simple to order ...
5 #### You ca n't beat the price . Even if you 're used to buying the small 4 oz . jars of Fleischmann 's for less than $ 5 , this is a whole Lb . for just $ 7.25 ! It does require proofing , so it 's not a substitute for recipes that require " Rapid Rise " yeast , but it 's fresh ( I got a batch produced in 04/13 in 08/13 ) and it 's got a two year shelf - life . I 've used quite a bit of it so far and I have n't noticed any delay in rising time , or any difference in flavor from what I was using before . It 's worth trying for sure .
4 #### I keep it in the freezer in an airtight container . I no longer have to remember if I have any yeast packs around . The bread rises as I expect . I bought because I read the King Arthur Flour bakers use this yeast , but I 'll continue to buy because it works .
4 #### It 's yeast . Not sure what else one can say . I do keep it in the fridge in an airtight container , and take out what I need and let it come to room temp . Works great .
5 #### One pound of this in the freezer lasts for about one year in my household . It is more convenient to use a spoon rather than an envelope that has to be torn open . It is almost flawless in making the bread rise the same every time .
5 #### I have used Saf Instant yeast for years & I love it . I keep it in a lock n seal container in the freezer & have had it last for years . It has never failed to give the perfect rise to my baked goods . It is also comparatively much less expensive than the strips with 3 packages of yeast .
5 #### I love this yeast . It has transformed the bread I make into the bread I have always longed to make . Light and airy loaves even with whole grain flours . As long as I have access to this product I will never go back to any other yeast . Not that I will be needing any yeast for a long time . This is extremely cost effective and a great value for the money with its price and the large size . I keep it in the freezer to extend its use by date since it will take me a long time to use this amount of yeast .
1 #### This is a first in my experience with any " fulfilled by Amazon " food product . I typically buy this same brand yeast from King Arthur and it arrives vacuum sealed . This order was " soft " , i.e. no vacuum and there are no dates in the use by and no info for the date of production or production lot . It is not eligible for return . It has been trashed and re - ordered from King Arthur . Not an expensive item and unusal in my Amazon experience .
5 #### If you hate proofing your yeast , this is for you ! You can skip that nasty little step and get on with your baking ! You might want to invest in a " yeast measuring spoon " to just reach in and get the exact amount of a dry package if you do n't like precision measurements ( since I believe a package is about 2 1/4 tsps ) .
5 #### I have used&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Red - Star / dp / B000173IHE / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Red Star</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Fleischmann - s - Yeast / dp / B004M42GJI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Fleischmann 's Yeast</a>&nbsp;and both good , but I 've come to really prefer the LeSaffre yeast . I ' discovered ' LeSaffre yeast while reading through bread recipes at the King Arthur website and the positive reviews there motivated me to get out of my rut and try something new . Since I had begun to bake all of my family 's bread , I was okay with ordering a pound of yeast . Given the price of the little packets , and even the little jars , it made sense to make the purchase because even if I ended up throwing some away , it would still be much cheaper to buy the yeast this way . The reason I like the LeSaffre yeast is that it gives me a better and more consistent rise-- and I use whole wheat flour . Definitely recommend .
5 #### I do n't know about you , but I have found most types of dried yeast to be temperamental . Sometimes , it just wo n't work ( even though it has n't expired and it 's been stored properly and all that ) . This yeast , however , is as dependable as an old workhorse . Never needs proofing , just works !
4 #### I was n't sure about ordering yeast online , but the products does what it is supposed to do . I keep in in the freezer and the package lasts about a year . I make a lot of bread .
5 #### I use instant yeast to make home made DIY CO2 for several of my planted aquariums . In the past the mixture I made usually lasted about a week . It is now 19 days into the first batch of DIY CO2 that I made with SAF instant yeast , and the CO2 bubbles are still going strong . If the CO2 bubbles last another two days at this rate the CO2 production using SAF will have lasted three times longer than the last instant yeast that I used . This yeast is amazing . If it 's nearly as good at making bread as it is for making DIY CO2 I will be even more pleased . Highly recommended !
5 #### Did some research , almost all said this is the one . Works well for me . Actually cheap compared to the packets .
5 #### This is the best yeast I 've found . Keeps for months in the freezer . Doughs rise consistently when using this yeast . Do n't hesitate to purchase .
5 #### This yeast works great for baking bread and making homemade pizza crust . I typically keep a cup or so in the fridge and the rest sealed in the freezer .
5 #### I ordered flour on amazon and saw this as a suggested item . It works great and the price is even better . I will never buy the tiny packets of yeast again .
5 #### I have used instant yeast for bread baking for years . I see no difference in results from active dry yeast and I like not having to dissolve and proof it . This is a huge quantity and a bargain at $ 10 . I keep it in the freezer and expect it to last for years . The only negative is the packaging . The vac pack is about impossible to open . I had to cut it and transfer to another container . But that 's minor .
5 #### This yeast saves me a lot of time and my bread comes out as good or better than when I used yeast that needed proofing . I made bread for 60 years and wish I had tried this product a lot sooner !
5 #### This is the best yeast I 've found . Works great every time - even in the bread machine . I keep it in the freezer and it lasts forever . Just let it get to room temp and it works just as good as if it 's fresh from the day I opened the package .
5 #### I never once had a problem with bread not rising since switching to Saf - Yeast . There is a Saf " Gold " specifically for bread with high sugar content but in my experience , the " Red " works just fine . It has a 3 + years shelf life if stored in an air - tight container in the freezer . Great product !
5 #### SAF is my favorite yeast . I can always depend on great results for breads and rolls . I keep this in the freezer to extend its life . I 've been baking for 60 years and stay with reliable products like this .
5 #### If you make either by hand or in a bread machine Saf is the yeast to use for bread making . sistema has a container with a klip it lid the same size as the 16 oz Saf yeast . the yeast in this container will keep in the refridgerator many weeks .
5 #### Great yeast in a great quantity for a great price . If you are into baking , this is pretty good stuff and you ca n't beat the price .
1 #### I have tried nearly a dozen times to make rolls , bread , etc . , with this yeast . I have adjusted method and recipe , STILL , the end result is VERY DISAPPOINTING . Tossed 3 loaves of bread yesterday - one pan of rolls today . Can not afford the loss !
5 #### I discovered this yeast nearly 20 years ago and have used it ever since . Of all the yeasts tested at King Arthur Flour test kitchens , this is the one THEY recommend and that 's good enough for me . This yeast will keep well beyond the expiration date if sealed in a freezer bag and placed in the freezer . I keep a small jar of it in my fridge for daily baking and the rest in my freezer with the purchase date marked on the front , then simply refill my jar as needed . I 've never once had a failure with this yeast . To use , simply omit the " proofing " stage . Most recipes use measured yeast but older recipes call for packages . Two teaspoons of SAF Instant is equivalent to one package . Many assume Instant Yeast and Rapid Rise yeast are the same . . .however , they are not . Instant Yeast merely omits the proofing stage and is recipe ready as is . Rapid rise causes the dough to rise more rapidly , but what 's gained in time is lost in flavor as the fermenting stage is decreased .
5 #### I was very satisfied with this yeast , after I shared it with a couple other bread makers I had to order more .
5 #### You can keep this in the freezer , so it stays fresh a long time , and is much cheaper than the little packets from the grocery . I use it without thawing . I do n't know if that would work with traditional bread recipes , might need a slightly longer first rise . But I use a recipe for " no knead " bread that requires a 20 - 24 hour rise after the initial mixing of dough and before baking . I mix my dough after dinner one night and cook it for dinner the second night . With that long a rise , I ca n't tell the difference between starting with frozen yeast versus fresh yeast . So this is very handy for me since I just measure out the frozen yeast and at a significant savings over individual packets from the grocery .
5 #### One of my old college roommates introduced me to instant yeast and I will never go back to the stuff in the packets . This is great for all my bread - baking needs ! Make sure to keep any unused portion in the fridge or freezer .
1 #### I bought Saf - Yeast Instant Yeast to be pets because I wanted to replace my daughter 's hamster that had unfortunately passed away last Christmas when it crawled into the nativity scene and got stuck between the folds of a wiseman 's tunic . Yeah . Holy Night indeed . Try calming down a seven year - old when her older brother mistook the hamster for a camel and started a play - fight between the " camel " and one of the sheep . Anyways , I misread the brand as Safe when it 's Saf - Yeast . I thought the yeast would live longer than those annoying Sea Monkeys . Not . As another reviewer noted , my batch , too , tested DEAD ! My daughter went into another tailspin while her brother mocked the baker on the package by pretending he was the baker killing the yeast as he put them in the mixing bowl . It took promising my little girl a bearded dragon for her birthday and grounding my son for a week before she finally quit crying . If you want household chaos and bread that wo n't rise , you 'll take your chances on this yeast .
5 #### We made 5 loaves of white bread the first week it arrived using a recipe from Julia Child . It was the most wonderful bread ever . However , I noticed that this yeast worked better than any of the yeast we bought in stores . It started bubbling in minutes . It doubled the loaf size in 45 minutes on the first rise and an hour on the second . We stored it in the fridge with paper around the outside of the jar . We used it again about a week later . Again the yeast bubbled in minutes . However , it did n't rise as much because we used a different recipe that called for 1/4 of the original . It still rose in an hour . We are going back to the Julian Child recipe . You ca n't get a better bargain for yeast that work twice as hard to make your bread for you .
5 #### I discovered this brand of yeast a few years back when troubleshooting issues with my first bread machine ; I found that not only did it solve the problems of less than perfect results from the machine but it improved the results with my hand kneaded loaves as well . I bake in smaller quantities for a single person and only a few times a week so this size was more than I could use but still more economical than the smaller packages . I store it in the coldest part of my refrigerator in an airtight container . At the two year mark it was still " active " and producing good loaves , but I 'd rather not discover the hard way when it is truly past its peak so I 've purchased it again . Excellent results every time !
1 #### I have no doubt that it 's very good . But I bought the same package at GFS Foods for three bucks !
5 #### When using King Arthur unbleached flour , this is the yeast their recipies are designed around . If used correctly and according to the KA bread recipies , this is a no fail product . The only yeast I use .
5 #### I used it for the first time this morning . Great rise . Great texture . I 've been unhappy with grocery store yeast but NOW I KNOW I can bake . I 've got it stuck in the freezer and looking at what to bake next .
5 #### why buy packets ? ? when you can save a truckload of money buying bulk ! when i found this , saf instant yeast , i was amazed . baking has become much cheaper for me . i actually got a pound from a friend who ordered from another spot . brick comes sealed , when cracked you hear the release of air . i put a nice portion in an airtight container , and slapped it in my fridge . that 's the one i 'll mainly use . the rest i have in an airtight container which resides in my freezer for when the main stash in the fridge runs out . one pound of this saf yeast , is almost equal in price of 3 packets of another brand yeast in my local supermarket . WHAT A GREAT DEAL ! if you bake and buy packet yeast , you need to get yourself one of these , saf yeast pounder =) great quality , great price ! happy baking =) !
5 #### It 's very hard to get good , fresh ginger where I live , and this minced ginger is a HUGE help to me . Unlike the jarred garlic that is also available , this minced ginger is almost ( at least to my taste ) indistinguishable from fresh ginger that I mince myself . Highly recommended !
1 #### I am picky about my spices , and I know when they are good . This product is not good . And it is NOT a substitute for fresh ginger . It has a weird , offputting chemical aroma and flavor , and packs none of the ginger punch it should . I used it once , then dumped the remainder down the drain in distaste . You 're much better off with the Ginger People brand . ( See this product:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Ginger - People - Organic - Minced - Ginger-6 - 7 - oz / dp / B0001YR06M / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Ginger People Organic Minced Ginger -- 6.7 oz</a>&nbsp ;) That one is so good , it can actually substitute for fresh ginger . It can even be used in chai ! Amazon used to sell it by the case ; hopefully they will get their act back together soon . In the meantime , I am buying it from Abe 's .
5 #### Peeling and grating ginger is a labor intensive and time consuming process . This product eliminates all that extra time and work . I use it to put in the basket with my loose leaf teas to get a nice ginger tang to my tea and for any other recipe or sauce or salsa or anything else I make that needs a ginger tang . Even great for quick breads and cookies and does n't have the sugar of candied ginger which many recipes call for . You can replace the sugar with artificial sweeteners if you need the sweetness .
5 #### I 've been trying different pre - prepared grated ginger products lately . This is good enough for me ; MUCH easier than trying to keep fresh ginger around ( mine always goes bad since I rarely finish it up ) . If a recipe needs ginger , this is a great substitute to have in the fridge .
4 #### This is as good as fresh ginger , but .. for a $ 3.99 jar they charged me $ 8.99 shipping and handling . I will not order this again from this merchant again !
4 #### My second order of this . It 's great to have it already minced and ready for incorporating into any dish .
5 #### Very fresh I use this in most of my vegetables and on occasions with meat ; ginger is good in tea also
5 #### Not over processed , still has some of the natural texture of the ginger but is a fresh and readily available substitute for fresh ginger anytime .
5 #### If you 've ever had sushi - this is exactly the flavor or the pickled ginger you get with sushi ( minus the artificial red color ) . It is mild enough to be used liberally , and blends in nicely with dips and sauces . Remember this stuff is good for you !
5 #### Nice sized . Will be able to get many uses out of it and it does not require me to make sure I buy fresh when I go shopping . Taste almost as good as fresh and much better then powdered .
5 #### Been using this in place of freshly minced ginger and it works great . It does n't have quite the same taste , but it 's so close that I do n't really notice it much .
2 #### Does n't taste like ginger . Thought it would save me having to grate ginger - but is disappointingly flat in flavor . In fact , it has a kind off flavor . Would n't buy it again .
4 #### I feel I paid to much for this at Amazon but not always having somebody around to run the store to get fresh ginger for me or not wanting to inconvient somebody makes having this around a big help when I want good ginger flavor in my recipe , no this is not a perfect replacement for the real thing but works real well with great ginger flavor . Just make sure you look around before buying like I did since there is better prices out there but to be fair Amazon provides great service and two day delivery which most do not and if they do provide two day service it costs a small fortune .
4 #### This winter I 've really enjoyed ginger tea , but got tired of just using tea bags . I tried pressing ginger root to juice it , but that 's a hassle , although it works . Bought this because it might be simpler . It is but the taste is not so pure in that context . However , it 's handy to have minced ginger for everything else , like stir fry .
4 #### I 'm fortunate to have a local store that sells great pickled ginger made fresh , but getting minced ginger is a chore . I went through several different brands and types before I found this one . A bit sweet , a bit spicy and easy to mix into most anything , I like this ginger because it 's a simple addition to Asian dishes . No mincing to do on your own , the ginger itself is moist with a nice consistency and everything about it seemed fresh . I 'm about to buy another jar of it .
5 #### Absolutely wonderful soy sauce . Use to add some depth and umami to any meal , or add an extra dimension to a simple bowl of rice and veggies .
4 #### good stuff , lots of sodium of course . Use half this and half reg soy sauce for great stir fry .
5 #### Got this for my nephew who loves to cook . He emailed me that he loves it and puts it on everything ! He 's knowledgeable and particular so I 'm getting some for myself .
5 #### A little bit goes a very long way ! A must for certain recipes !
5 #### Dark , exotic , wonderful soy sauce which is NOT salty as it would seem to be . Great in hamburgers , fried rice ...
5 #### Great For Cooking . Rich sweet / salty / earthy Flavor . We love it for making Chinese BBQ Pork ( Char Sui ) . A bottle lasts a long time for regular home cooking because most recipes do n't call for much . You 've probably only had Chinese BBQ Pork as an appetizer at your local Chinese restaurant , but when cooked at home and eaten fresh and warm from the oven , it is fantastic as an entree . Or to build BBQ pork sandwiches . Being retired on a fixed income , we need to stretch our food dollars . This Char Sui dish allows use of the least expensive cuts of pork ( pork butt ) which we can often buy on sale for $ 1 per pound , or can buy every day for about $ 1.50 a pound . Simple to fix in the oven - this is gourmet dining on a small budget . This dark soy sauce is in important flavor ingredient for this dish . It will earn you the admiration of your family .
5 #### Very good product . IT really enhances flavor of home cooked asian food .
1 #### BUYER BEWARE ! Read for yourself how Pearl River Bridge Superior Dark Soy Sauce is made !
5 #### The flavor is VERY intense , so I only use it for cooking ( I use the Pearl River Bridge light soy sauce for garnishing ) . The flavor is nice and robust and does n't get lost in the other flavors as I 'm cooking .
5 #### this is much better than regular soy sauce for cooking . it gives your dish great color and flavor and you only have to use a little bit . it does n't make your dish as salty as when you use regular soy sauce .
5 #### This is the perfect soy for making stir fry ; pepper steak and for marinades . Dark soy is heavier than the stuff you get at the grocery store . If you have never used dark soy to cook , I would highly recommend it - has a fuller bodied flavor and makes a huge difference when making the brown sauce ( like in pepper steak or beef with asparagus , etc . ) If you are like me , once you have used dark soy for cooking , you will never again use the thin watery soy sauce .
5 #### Lee Kum Kee Preimum Dark Soy adds that little extra punch of soy sauce flavor that is sometimes needed beyond using Tamari - my go to soy sauce . Like it and will continue to experiment using it .
5 #### This has a great taste . Improves every one of my asian recipes . Expensive compared to other choices but well worth it .
4 #### As someone who grew up on Kikoman , exploring the world of ' other ' soy sauces has been an eye - opening experience . I 'm not going to pretend to be an authority but Lee Kum has become my new go - to soy sauce , a flavor packed gem .
5 #### This is a great soy sauce with deep , rich , nutty flavor . I did n't find it as salty as more cheaply made products . I used some of this product the first day that I received it to make stir fried beef and broccoli . It was delicious . This soy sauce would also be a great base for potstickers dips . I find this product to be far superior to anything that I 've bought previously in the states . I will buy this again in the future .
5 #### I have been looking for a " better " soy sauce and tried this one out because of the overwhelming great reviews . Verdict ....... This is to soy sauce as aged 18 year balsamic is to vinegar . It stands apart in a league all its own . It has a rich , deep and more complex flavor than the grocery store brands . I did a side by side taste test with my bottle of Kikkoman 's , and immediately pitched the Kikkoman 's . I can never go back after tasting this . Also I do not think that this is a bad price for the size of bottle and the quality of product .
5 #### I keep this in my refrigerator in a squeeze bottle . Mostly I use this for special asian sauce recipes . It has a very smooth flavor unlike the harsher soy sauces . But Kikoman is still a good go - to for most applications .
5 #### What can I say ..... The best like everyone else stated .
5 #### Best cooking soy I 've ever had - will not be without !
5 #### How did I not know about this years ago ? ? ? ? If you are n't using it in some of your chinese dishes , you are missing out !
5 #### Was a little skeptical but ordered anyway . Well , it 's got flavor you can sink your teeth into . I was really surprised . I would recommend trying a bottle . If you do , you 'll be back for more .
4 #### Just tried this and I ca n't believe the added flavor . Used it with black vinegar in my Hot and Sour soup and it knocked it off the charts . Ca n't wait to try in stir fry and other dishes .
4 #### It it good soy sauce .... doesn't seem too too salty .
5 #### WOW ! Soy sauce is integral to Asian cooking , and this is the best there is . It is dark , thick , intense , but soothe and balanced , and not too salty ; Run - of - the - mill sauces simply do not compare . This product is so good , how do the watery sauces sell ? " Consumer ignorance . " One of my favorite dishes is Sichuann hot - and - sour soup , and I thought I made a tasty one , but using this instead of soy water makes a world of difference . Cheap at any price , you owe it to yourself to try this .
5 #### This brand has been around since my childhood . Same quality and taste . This is must buy for authentic Chinese cooking .
5 #### In Chinese cooking both light and dark soy sauce are called for . This is a large bottle and should last a long time .
5 #### excellent soy sauce , you will never use Kikkoman ever again
4 #### My first attempt to prepare Chinese Soy Sauce Chicken using this product was a success . I used the resultant sauce to steep hard oiled eggs . Delicious ! This sauce is very rich and flavorful .
5 #### I bought this because I did n't like the soy sauce my wife always got from the local store . It never had that good flavor I 'd get when I went to a good sushi place . I bought this and now we order our sushi to go and bring it home just to use this with it . It has so much flavor and does n't just taste like salt . We use this as often as we can . Goes great with some sesame oil .
5 #### I love to use this Soy Sauce for everything that I cook in my wok ! It is well worth the money . I love to use different Soy Sauces for different dishes and this soy sauce is one of my favorites . I also mix this sauce with other sauces , to get different tastes . I highly recommend .
5 #### I really like the depth of flavor with this sauce . I found that many recipes prefer this exact sauce to use .
5 #### This soy is very tasty and definitely my favorite . Tastes great in all my cooking and for dipping my homemade egg rolls in as well . I will purchase this again .
5 #### This was a pleasant surprise -- it is a heavier soy sauce and that actually makes it more flexible in using it -- you can fix it to get the flavor without using to much -- and it acts like a reduced more intense flavor -- fun to play with . The taste is more flavorful and less salty than some soy sauces and I like that .
4 #### As dark soy sauce goes , I like this one but have to say that the dark Kimlan is better . Buy a bottle of each and try both .
5 #### Douwe Egberts makes some of the most delicious European coffee . When the Senseo Single Serve Coffee Maker was created , these single use , disposable coffee ' pods ' fit together like hand in glove . 5,000,000 European coffee lovers can not be wrong ... Senseo Douwe Egberts is outstanding , fresh tasting coffee , and each imported 4 pack , ( 72 Single - Serve pods ) , comes attractively packaged in a resealable pouch . Medium roast is apt to be a particular favorite for American coffee tastes . It has a rich , full - bodied flavor , neither bitter nor astringent . The Senseo coffee machine can make 1 4 oz cup , 2 4 oz cups , or a single 8 oz cup at a time . The self - contained pods use a tea bag filter - type paper and are approximately 2 " in diameter . Right now , the price averages 25 cents per 4 ounce cup . The Senseo makes it with a bit of frothe on the top , and this medium roast coffee is fine straight up , or try it with a little sweetner and a dollop of Hazelnut creamer as I do . I do envision the price point coming down a bit , as the Senseo system becomes the US equivalent of the European sensation . Douwe Egberts recommends using your pods within 2 weeks , however , I 've had good luck storing the extras in the freezer section of my refrigerator with no dicernable flavor change .
3 #### The coffee pods are very good , have been buying them thru Amazon for several years ( inasmuch as no longer sold in grocery stores because , I assume , the original Senseo coffeemaker no longer being manufactured / sold ) but this order had broken pods in two separate bags , which means ground coffee all over unbroken pods , and at least three / four pods lost ! First time this has ever happened , hope its not a trend due to bad packaging at manufacturer . Next time will request replacement bag .
4 #### I have bought these for several years . Flavor is strong and the pods are always intact . Other brands I have purchase have often leaking pods in the bag . That has never happened with my Senseo purchases .
4 #### This coffee is really good . If it was so expensive for the little bit that you get , I would have given it a 5 . My only complaint is the price . Lucky for me , my pot can use the pods or ground coffee . I 'm going with the ground coffee to save money . Besides , it 's just as good .
1 #### This is not French Vanilla - it taste and smells like Hazelnut - product is undrinkable
5 #### An awesome tasting , smooth and balanced cup of coffee with breakfast .
5 #### got these for keurig to use with adapter , different coffee taste than a pod .. like instant
3 #### This has a very weak taste to me . If you like weak coffee , go for it . I have a bunch left that I do n't know what to do with .
5 #### Great coffee pods to use in my Hamilton Beach coffee maker
4 #### I really like these . I have been getting them for years
1 #### Little tea baggies , that is what these are . Glorified instant coffee . Tastes like water . I do not recommend
5 #### High quality coffee pods at great prices . Where else can anyone find them ?
5 #### I love this coffee to me there 's nothing better .
5 #### These are hard to find . I love them . Using a Cuisinart one cup coffee pot . Can not find these locally .
5 #### I have been using these pods in my Keurig , works fine , cheaper .
5 #### Senseo lost favor in the USA but .... it still has better flavor / taste than the current market king . And these pods are more Eco - friendly ! ! !
5 #### best coffee in the world ! ! Love the taste . u can adjust the strength by selecting 1 cup or 2 . 1 cup makes a sensationally delicious gourmet drink . I am ordering more of these ! !
4 #### Great coffee ! I 've ordered this twice now ... But ... Unfortunately about 3 of them were exploded inside the package and were all over the packages ( maybe they did n't seal right ? ) So that 's like $ 1.50 down the tube , plus a little mess to clean up . I tried finding contact support on their website , but it was a * * * convoluted process . * * * I wo n't be ordering this again any time soon , because I hate throwing money in the trashcan ( I'M NOT RICH , COFFEE IS A LUXURY ! ) .
2 #### Something has changed in this product . Either coffee quality or processing . The Sumatra blend used to have a deep , rich and almost creamy flavor . Just opening the bag and taking that first smell was a pleasure . All this is gone . I would now compare the last 2 shipments I received to " in - room " hotel coffee . I simply can not endure another case of this coffee . It is a shame . I have been drinking the Sumatra blend for the last 12 years .
5 #### Yummy coffee and works perfectly in my 10 year old Juan Valdez pod machine . I will keep on buying this blend . Just use it up quickly since it does not foil pack individual pods . No problem for me .
5 #### My old Senseo machine still makes great coffee with these simple pods .
2 #### Even with two pods , it 's too weak . I have to put the brewed pods into my cup , like a tea bag .
2 #### It sometimes brews ok , sometimes weak , have n't had this issue with other coffee pods of the same type , so I do n't think it 's the machine :(
3 #### Not sure if it 's my coffee maker or the concentration of these pods but my coffee is pretty bland . I need 2 of these pods to get the same concentration of taste as keurig . Flavor is great once I use 2 pods : )
5 #### I have been using Senseo for a few years now . It 's important to realize that this is a better coffee than any other if you follow some important things : 1 : Only use filtered water . I use Brita pitcher . 2 : Keep the water reservoir clean . It can grow mold . 3 : Before inserting pods , put them on a flat surface and gently tap them on top to flatten . You want the coffee distributed evenly so that the water has to go through coffee , instead of finding a less path of resistance . The dark roast is better than all the others . Sometimes you may find one broken inside . Oh well , nothing is perfect . People come to my house just to get this coffee . Lucky me .
5 #### great flavor coffee and a nice easy to use pod for my espresso machine to use .
2 #### Unless I 'm doing it wrong , the Kona blend is much too weak , and I do n't like strong coffee . I have to use two pods , and it still does n't taste right .
5 #### DE coffee you ca n't get better . Definitely going to try other blends
2 #### This is not good coffee . 10 % Kona ? what 's the other 90 % ? ? compared to the dark roast version of the same make for Senseo , this is very acidic and anemic . 10 % kona makes very little addition to the taste which I experienced with higher percentage blends of Kona coffee . I strongly suggest saving your money and buying the dark roast , which you get 18 a pack instead of 16 . Hopefully , with the Senseo machine back in the USA again , the choices and prices will also improve . Happy drinking
5 #### Always good . So glad that I can get them for my Senseo machine which is the best coffee maker out there .
3 #### Medium is very a very smooth blend and if you use a Senseo machine , you get latte like foam at the top . The big problem is a lot of the medium pods arrive torn . This has been the case in the last of the 4 ( six bag count ) medium boxes I ordered from Amazon . I switched in my last order and ordered the Dark Roast and there was no problem . I just prefer the Medium so I will likely start ordering it directly from Senseo and see if they are ok . The problem continues . Order the Kenya which tastes almost the same . So far so good . I called Senseo and told them but I do not see a change or improvement after reading the new reviews . 2 weeks later- The same problem is concurring with the Medium blend .
5 #### The dark blend deserves 5 stars but I prefer the medium . If you use the Senseo machine , it is latte like with foam . The reason I have stopped ordering the medium blend is the pods arrive torn and not usable .
4 #### Love it . Wish it had 18 pods per pack .
4 #### Much better than the coffee at Starbucks and with the Senseo machine I get something very close to cafe Americano which I can not get at Starbucks where they add hot water to an espresso and pretend it is an Americano .
5 #### This is probably the billionth time I have ordered Senseo coffee .......... Its the best coffee period !
5 #### I have been using the SENSEO coffee for a few years and it has always been the best .
5 #### Love this coffee . The makers are hard to find .. Thank goodness for ebay . It 's smooth with a nice top of creamy foam . If it was n't 11 pm I 'd have some more now ..
4 #### Great to be drinking this coffee again . Always enjoyed it . Nice body with no bitterness . Good crema !
5 #### Love Senseo ! Been using their products for years . So much better than having to have liquids in little containers . This and their coffee maker is perfect for our RV excursions .
5 #### I hate that this coffee can not be found in stores anymore . Darn Sara Lee for stopping distributorship . Thank God for Amazon . Dark roast with a bit of sweetness . Love it .
5 #### I find the medium roast to be just the right blend for every day brew .
2 #### Normally this is a good purchase , but this time in both cases there were a few pods that were not sealed properly so dry coffee was everywhere .
5 #### Our favorite coffee and we love this one so much we are on permanent subscribe and save
3 #### Bought these to use with a new Hamilton Beach dual - pod coffee brewer . My wife only drinks decaf and these were the only pods I could find . Turns out they are not very robust . My wife has to use two pods just to brew a normal cup of coffee . She says one pod is too weak .
5 #### Senseo is my favorite brand of Coffee . The medium roast and dark roast are my favorites . I alternate between the two . I highly recommend Senseo .
5 #### The best coffee pods I 've found to date . Although labeled as a medium roast the flavor is bolder that most similar roasts but without a hint of bitterness . I 'm taking a lot fewer walks from my workplace to Starbucks since I discovered these pods .
5 #### Now that Kenyan is no longer available from Senseo , this is my favorite flavor of coffee pods .
5 #### We like this coffee much better than what comes out of a K - Cup product . This takes like real coffee not flavored water
5 #### Perfect cup of coffee . Rich and flavorful . I only needed one bag for a 4 oz cup .
5 #### PROS : Skip ahead three paragraphs . You 've stayed in hotels enough times to enjoy , loathe , or grow to accept in - room coffee . This is that coffee . If you 've stayed for one or two nights , you 've either liked the coffee or made it too strong ( not enough water ) or too weak ( too much water ) . After a few days you adjust the water level to your preferences and start looking forward to your morning coffee and wish your boyfriend understood you so well . Sometimes it does n't take much to make me happy -- this is one of those times . PRO : This coffee goes in the compost when it 's done ! My Tassimo and Keurig pods do n't ( yes I own both ) . These look like slightly oversized round tea bags . They cost less than 25 cents each which is far less expensive ( less than half ) the other plastic and foil and coffee pods . After one month it was less expensive for me to buy a new coffee maker ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003GW873G/ref=sr_ph?ie=UTF8&qid=1435192385&sr=1&keywords=49970 ) and this coffee . Note that it will take you a few tries to figure out how much water to add . If you have a Keurig or Tassimo , think for a moment how much space 30 pods takes . Now think of how much space 30 tea bags take ( a jam jar ) . Buy this coffee , buy a coffee maker that uses it , and save counter space , save landfill , save money .
3 #### Gift for grandma , the only person in our town that still owns a senseo . Bought her a Keurig later .
5 #### Love the stronger espresso taste than just regular coffee . Love the convenience of the pods ! ! I 've been using them for a year now and have n't brought the big coffee pot back out since .
2 #### Was n't great , I even tried 2 pods and was n't happy . Of course that 's probably good , at the price ! We went back to the Baronette Kenya . The Senseo Esspresso makes me happy but husband prefers stronger blends .
5 #### I love this coffee ! We have had Keurig and Keurig - type coffee makers , which were ridiculously expensive for both the equipment and the coffee itself , and the coffee brewed from these Senseo pods tastes FAR better , in my opinion . I use them in my office with the Hamilton Beach 49970 Personal Cup One Cup Pod Brewer , a $ 21 machine purchased here on Amazon in 2010 and still going strong . Both Keurigs we 've purchased since have died . The coffee it produces using just one pod is absolutely delicious and actually motivates me to get to my office in the morning ! All of the flavors I 've tried have been good , but I 've settled on the Kona as my absolute favorite , and that is the only one I buy now . So happy to be able to get it here on Amazon . I hope Senseo will continue to make this coffee for a long time . It 's the best bargain out there .
5 #### Love it , but in the future I would choose a stronger blend . This one is a bit too mild for my taste .
4 #### Delicious coffee but only 16 pods in a pack , which is why I gave it 4 stars . Still , since it 's so hard to find these , it 's a good price for a tasty coffee .
5 #### Senseo coffee is always good . I wish it was available in stores .
4 #### Senseo makes a very good product . These pods are easy to use , convenient and produce a great - tasting cup of java .
4 #### Good product with a good taste but nothing special . I do n't even use the pods anymore , my wife and I prefer regular coffee brews . While this is a decent product , there are better ones out there .
5 #### My Mom has a Pod - style Hamilton Beach coffee pot . This is her favorite Decaf coffee for this coffee - maker . She loves that she can make herself one cup at a time .
5 #### According to my husband these are really good . Not bitter at all ....
5 #### I 've been buying these for a while now . They fit my espresso maker and my coffee maker . Neat and tidy !
3 #### It is the only decaffeinated coffee for the Senseo coffee maker . Wish there were MORE ! ! !
3 #### I re - purchased this coffee as I was running out of Senseo coffee pods which I usually buy in the Netherlands . I received a fresh batch but was disappointed once again to find that the pod do not have the Senseo label at all ( which is definitely on every pod sold in Europe ) - which makes one wonder if it 's generic coffee pads packaged in a nice Senseo outside bag . BTW the price is considerably more than double what you pay for the real product in the Netherlands .
4 #### Good taste and strength . On of the best Senseo blends .
5 #### Was a great price and arrived swiftly , Thank You !
5 #### I like my coffee with foam on top -
4 #### One of my two favorite brands of pod coffees ( no unknown plastic particles getting into my drink ) that are worth the price . I do not see a big difference in taste with the Kona 10 % but the spouse likes it .
5 #### I love these coffee pods for my one cup coffee maker and I will continue getting them as long as I drink coffee . They have different blends to chose from but my preference is the Breakfast Blend . The product is on my front porch no later than 3 days after I placed my order !
5 #### This is strong coffee and took some time to get used to after they were out of the other pods . I used it in my Senseo on the two cup setting . Like most of the other customers stated , nothing beats a Senseo cup of coffee ! Great crme .
5 #### surprisingly good flavor in a prepared coffee disc . I had expected poor quality and was pleasantly delighted . I have ordered more .
4 #### Good . I 'd buy that again . Nice strong coffee . Composts okay . Yay .
5 #### Having traveled extensively in Europe , I have found that Senseo produces the only coffee maker and the only coffee pods that taste remotely like European coffees in the US .
4 #### The coffee is good but not great . However , I really like my little coffee maker for one cup at a time and these are now the only pods for it I can find .
5 #### GREAT TASTE . I like it a lot . It 's probably my favorite Senseo and I like all the pods of this type that I 've tried . They 're ALL good , this one I 'm a little more partial too , so it could be a matter of personal taste , I do n't know ; I like this one especially though . I feel it 's priced pretty reasonably ( circa 2013/2014 ) Nicely packaged , impress your friends , and I just REALLY like the taste of this one .
5 #### The best decaf pods ! Price is getting to be a factor though . Hope Senseo keeps selling pods !
5 #### Love Senseo Sumatra blend . The price keeps going up , so not sure how much longer we can afford it . K - cups are taking over !
3 #### unfortunately , sara lee which owns brand is not supporting it , no sense of customer service
3 #### Pods themselves are fine but Sara Lee which owns brand clearly does not care about brand and has no sense of customer service .
5 #### Senseo is a great product . I also have a K - cup coffee maker . Senseo coffee pods are cheaper and just as good . Too bad they are so hard to find . Even the machine I have is no longer available .
3 #### I did not want this item . It was sent as I think I still had a automatic send listed . I had tried to stop it and do not want this . I will send it back . So frustrating .
5 #### Better than I expected from a pod ... I 'll order again .
4 #### This is pretty good coffee , I ca n't explain why it 's not a 5 star to me , it 's just lacking in some way .
4 #### I like the flavor , but I have to use a 4 ounce setting to get a strength I find acceptable .
5 #### I love Senseo products , but I am not crazy about this one because the coffee " taste " is not all that great .......
5 #### Best coffee ever . On my third Senseo coffee pot over numerous years . We used the other two to death . :)
5 #### I really love the many types of coffee I can get at Senseo . This is also one of many favorites .
5 #### I have tried several different brand of coffee for my sense coffee maker . Only the Senseo brand ( really fits . This dark roast really suits me , as long as I use to two pods for a big mug .
4 #### The taste of this roast is nice , but I like a big cup of coffee ( 12 oz ) and it definitely is necessary to brew two 6 oz cups using these pods . The smell is fantastic , btw , even my non - coffee - drinking co - workers have commented on how good these smell .
5 #### It 's coffee . It tastes like coffee . They pads do n't break and allow coffee grains through , so it works as it should . Not really much else to say for it . I 'll continue to purchase as needed .
3 #### this is the most horrible tasting coffee in my opinion . I will not be buying any more of it . it is too weak . but .... I wo n't totally blame the coffee as it could be the coffeemaker .
4 #### Love my Senseo coffee maker and ordering from Amazon is the only way I can now buy the pods for my morning coffee . So grateful for this opportunity to continue to use this coffee .
4 #### When I bought my Senseo coffee machine it was easy to get the pods all over the place . Now I can only find them online . If the prices go higher I will stop buying it but so far Amazon has these for a fair price . Hope they do n't disappear altogether !
3 #### It 's not the tastiest Decaf I 've ever had . I always need to put either a Dark Roast or Espresso with it . I 'd like it much better if it were richer and stronger so that I could just have a completely de - caf cup when I want it .
5 #### I really like this coffee for my Senseo . I believe it is the strongest coffee you can get for this machine . It has a great flavor plus a good strength . Highly recommended .
5 #### We LOVE our Senseo machine and truly love this decaf coffee . It foams in the cup and is WONDERFUL ! ! ! I stopped buying lattes at Starbucks or Dunkin ' Donuts . I look forward to a cup of coffee at home when I go out to dinner because NOTHING ( to me ) compares to this . Phillips stopped making this manufacturing the Senseo machine which makes us very sadso we PRAY they keep making the pods for those of us who have the machines !
3 #### Its okay okay still a little weak as I have tried several Of The Senseo coffee pods and others . Prefer my coffee a little stronger will keep trying to get the perfect fit and taste .
4 #### Price is better than markets . Fewer markets are carrying this system , so selection is diminishing . However , the cost - per - cup is a fraction of the more prevalent coffee systems , and the coffee is great . So both the vendor and the product is recommended .
3 #### We wish coffee tasted as good as it smells but have never found any that does . This smells delicious and is ok but a lot weaker than we 're used to . Since the little cup - pod type single cup makers coffee is way too strong for all of us this was a more sensible alternative . We 'll keep trying to figure a way of making it stronger without being too strong . Two discs did n't work . All in all , it 's a better coffee than we get trying to make one cup in a 12 - cup coffee maker . ;)
3 #### I was looking for k - cup and got these , so they are ok for the right system , not mine . I had to open them up to use the coffee in mine so it did n't go to waste .
4 #### Clean and easy to use in my mini Mr. Coffee , great taste ! Hope I can keep getting these as I can not find them in stores .
5 #### I bought just one bag the first time but liked it so much that I came back for a 4 pack . I do n't like strong coffee so I make 2 cups from 1 pod . It works great in my automatic drip coffeemaker too , so no need to buy a special coffeemaker to use it .
3 #### I have been decaffeinated for over 30 years and tried numerous brands attempting to find real coffee flavor . This one was just OK but Senseo sells one in a 48 pack that is from Europe that is in a blue package and also available from Amazon that had a bolder real coffee flavor . Another favorite is Baronet French Roast decafe from Amazon .
4 #### My wife drinks flavored coffee 's . Me , I prefer what is as close to Birch Bark as you can find . She enjoyed this but found the Vanilla flavoring to be a little to strong for her taste and has settled on Wolfgang Puck French Vanilla , also available from Amazon . So ' stronger vanilla ' this is for you , a taste of vanilla try the Wolfgang blend .
4 #### Medium roast flavor , love the flavor . The ease of using the senseo pot is awesome , may try to ' make my own ' but the price / value on this product makes me wonder if it would be worth the mess of ' DIY "
4 #### I 'm 71 . Have lost about all my taste buds because of a stroke . Tasty anyway as all Senseo flavors are .
4 #### Many of my friends find this very satisfying . I prefer a medium dark roast and this is truly DARK . To be fair , it did say DARK , but I found it darker than what I am used to .
5 #### These are just great for me . I use a bigger mug and find the flavor to be mild . The coffee maker we have has a pod area that just fits these .
4 #### These pods are very easy to use . They are a little strong for me , but they are just right for my husband .
4 #### What can I say ? It is easy , it is good , especially for an almost " instant " cup of coffee . Every time I serve it to people they want to know what it is .
3 #### If you have to drink decaf , as I do , then this is quick , dirty and a reasonable substitute for the real thing . However , it is NOT as good as a cup of the real thing !
3 #### Been a long time user of the Senseo pods , and while they were not available for a year or so , i switched to Melitta . I was so eager when I saw Senseo pods were again available .... but the flavor is n't as full as I remembered . > Next order I will try another variety ...
4 #### A bit on the expensive side but I have the extra coin since I no longer buy the premium elite foreign named sizes from the place that has no seating because of all the tables that have laptops with an empty small size cup next to them . Senseo , whether regular or decaf , has a very acceptable taste and the pods are reliable . I find the Baronet brand a bit richer so that is why I gave 4 instead of 5 stars .
5 #### These pods are amazing . So flavorful & they have different tastes for each individual . It 's a shame that I can no longer purchase these in stores though .
5 #### I have a small coffee maker in my office . It has a filter in it that you can put grounds in it . But with these , the filter is already there . No mess and I love the flavor .
4 #### I have ordered and used this brand before in my coffee maker . It is a nice blend and is not harsh or bitter to the taste . We do n't use pods a lot , but after the first pot of the day is gone , and you need an afternoon cup , these fill the bill nicely .
3 #### I ca n't honestly give a review , because the coffee pods are on the shelf . I have a backlog of pods . This is , however , my second time buying Kona Blend , and it was very good , the last batch I bought .
5 #### I ordered this either for my wife and I or as a gift if you look at the rating we gave it that will tell you if we liked it or not , if it is special we will add a little comment same if it is bad . But telling me how many word I need to use is STUPID ! !

5 #### Senseo has many good varieties of coffee . Ths one is very flavorful , and creamy like a Cappucino . Love this medium roast from Senseo .
3 #### Its barely OK . The coffee comes out rather on the weak side but since we have a Senso Coffee maker that requires the soft pods , we do not have much choice . I think that sometime in the near future we will go to another way to make morning coffee .
3 #### Its barely OK . The coffee comes out rather on the weak side but since we have a Senso Coffee maker we do not have much choice . I think that sometime in the near future we will go to another way to make morning coffee .
4 #### Always concerned about how old the coffee is that I get already ground and packaged . Have gone back to grinding and brewing fresh .
5 #### Love this product ; I was having trouble finding decaf for my Senseo , so was happy to find this . Great product , and the dealer did a great job . Will not hesitate to recommend them , and to use them again . ! Very happy with it ; I think I 'll have a cup now !
5 #### Love my Senseo coffee maker and ordering from Amazon is the only way I can now buy the pods for my morning coffee . So grateful for this opportunity to continue to use this coffee .
5 #### My husband will only drink Senseo . It is so good . Tastes like European coffee , but has no bitter after taste .

5 #### My husband will only drink Senseo . It is so good . Tastes like European coffee , but has no bitter after taste .
5 #### A GOOD cup of coffee for the one cup pot , especially at the price . I suggest you try this one !
5 #### We have had two Senseo coffee brewer systems & the pods are never available anywhere except Amazon . These have a great coffee flavor , not too weak & not too strong - just perfect for a great cup of coffee !
2 #### I have tried these Senseo pods multiple times and have found that too many pouches have torn pods inside leaving a huge mess . Try dusting off loose coffee grounds to make a cup of coffee , nah , and no thanks . The Wolfgang Puck pods offer a better cup of coffee and more consistency . Sorry Senseo , I really tried to like you ... !
5 #### Purchased this for my Nephew for Christmas , he is a bachlor and always on the run . The pods make a great quick cup of coffee .
4 #### I ordered this coffee once before and probably will order it again , this time I ordered a different flavor . Relatively good coffee .
5 #### VERY GOOD SMELL SURROUNDS THE KITCHEN , AND THE TASTE IS GREAT . This is when you need a pick me up with a unique taste
5 #### MILD AND TASTE BREW . GREAT FOR A CHANGE of pace . The smooth taste give you the motivation to have another cup . Close your eyes and your in Maui . Enjoy ! !
5 #### Very famlier with Senseo and love them I just ca n't always get the flavor I want at the store . Good
5 #### Senseo coffee pods are no longer available in stores here . I 'm really glad Amazon.com still carries them . In the evening when I want a good cup of decaf quickly , that does n't interfere with my sleep , this is what I want .
5 #### Senseo coffee pods are no longer available in stores here . I 'm so pleased that Amazon.com still caries them . The Senseo Paris French Vanilla Is a treat to my senses . Smells great , tastes great as well .
4 #### I like this coffee . It is inexpensive and goes the job for me . The pods are easy to use in my coffee maker .
5 #### I have a client who screams ' I LOVE THIS COFFEE ' whenever she drinks this , and we stress when it is unavailable ! Have been drinking it and various other blends from Senseo for more than 5 years . We love it .
5 #### This is what the lady of the house specifies , this is what we buy . It is good and reasonably priced .
3 #### My expectations were wrong . I thought that I would be able to use these pods with a Keurig . that did n't work . I am going to try to just run the hot water over them and see if they are better .
3 #### I am a bit disappointed with my last shipping because some of the pods paper wrapping were torn open , seems the quality used to be better before ? But they are still OK .
4 #### Unlike the Mild Breakfast Blend , this coffee is not from Brazil as far as I know . I use two pods for around 12 oz of coffee , but I use 1 of these , the medium roast , and 1 of the mild . To me , that 's the best coffee I have and I have a LOT of coffee in my house , all kinds . The combination I just mentioned is my personal favorite .
3 #### I am now ordering directly from Senseo as the prices through Amazon went up significantly after my initial order . I love the product and have a Senseo machine ...... the best and most economical coffee ever . Keurig ca n't hold a candle to Senseo and they are more expensive .
5 #### But I have a Senseo machine and I get the intended results ( creama on top of the coffee ) but I doubt the standard pod coffee makers will give you the same results . I also have a Keurig which has more options for coffee . Cost per cup with pods is lower but I 've never tried these with any of the other machines that use pods .
5 #### Nice strong flavor , one of my favorites of the Senseo brand . We always have this on hand . Good price too .
5 #### I have been enjoying this coffee maker for a while and every flavor has been spectacular . I order a package every month and can not imagine myself without this . Thanks a lot .
4 #### I still enjoy a real cup of coffee even though I have been moved to decaf . Kona was one of my favorite blends when I was a coffee addict . This blend will satisfy a Kona craving but is not as full bodied as a ground Kona brewed in a drip coffee maker .
4 #### Sadly 10 years ago I was moved to a decaf coffee drinker and have ordered from numerous sources and tried just about every brand in existence . The cost / quality varies widely . This coffee for price and taste falls in the middle . The lowest priced Decaf brand on Amazon will be Melitta , which is weak and you will need to set the machine on a lower setting , then the taste is ' still ' less than bold . The very best I have found n Amazon is Baronet 100 % Colombian decaf , it is the most expensive but actually tastes the same as a full blend . Many times I mix the pods using one Senseo and one Baronet .
4 #### I do like Kona coffee and this filled my craving . However , it is not near the Kona aroma and full body flavor you receive from a Kona fresh ground blend in drip coffee pot . But is Ok and does demonstrate some Kona flavor
5 #### I bought these as a bad weather emergency in case I ca n't get out and get my coffee . Use two pods ( recommended anyway ) but they work great .
5 #### My husband likes bold coffee so this is right up his alley . Deep flavor without the bitterness of some other blends
5 #### These are really good and make great coffee . We use a French press now too . What else can I say
3 #### This Senseo espresso is not of the same quality as it 's predecessor , but since the ECE pods are getting harder to find on the market , I buy it fairly often . The Senseo system is a winner which is , oddly enough , losing to the slower - brewed , crema - free Keurig phenomena which is nearly ubiquitous and very adequate , even okay . Go with the Senseo-- it 's cheaper , better , and a no - brainer . This espresso is a little rough around the edges , and the darker roast fries out some of the subtleties that a better grade of coffee enhances . It 's good enough on its own , better for mixed coffee drinks . If you 're not a connoisseur , this will more than meet your needs .
5 #### Some of the Senseo pods lack character and are , frankly , quite bland . However , the Sumatra Blend has a lot of character and tastes very good . It has a smokey , dark flavor to it , reminicent of darker chocolates . I 've enjoyed drinking this coffee black , with cream and sweetener , and with flavored creamers . All of them tasted good and the undertones of the coffee even stood out with the flavored creamer , a characterist often lacking in the Senseo Pods . Bottom Line : this coffee tastes great ! ! !
1 #### Love it when i could get the pods easily then all of of sudden they 're gone . Switched to kuerig and i use and eco cup with that . No more hassle .
5 #### Kona is delicious with just a hint of chocolate flavoring . Not too strong , not too weak . This is great tasting coffee , " real coffee " in its own filter , so it 's always a pleasure .
5 #### Purchase the Medium Roast for my Mom ( she will be 99 this month ) . She loves the Senseo Machine , gold taste of the coffee and a the freshness of each cup !
5 #### Bold , great tasting . Love the single up concept for coffee . Senseo Coffee Machine makes great coffee and it is so simple !
5 #### Coffee at our house is only made in the Senseo Machine . Coffee is reach in flavor and never fails to taste great !
5 #### Love the Senseo Coffee Machine and love the coffee . We prefer the Dark Roast . Mom loves the Medium Roast . Single , hopt cup of coffee . Could n't get any better than this .
5 #### Non acidic and mild with nice smooth flavor , this makes a nice change from the deep roast I usually prefer .
5 #### Full bodied coffee pods are so great for my 1 cup Bunn coffee maker . I enjoy the flavor - rich , full bodied , not too acidic . Coffee house coffee with at home convenience .
5 #### A standard at our house . Love the Senseo brand . I buy continually . I am not a dark roast coffee drinker , but I have become quite fond of this flavor .
5 #### Upon opening the package containing the pods , I got a blast of aroma that was VERY satisfying . I saw one reviewer griping over the total cost for a bag of these pods . ( NOTE : the cost is 30 cents per cup . ) 30 cents for a GREAT cup of coffee that tops even 7 - 11 as far as I 'm concerned and I LOVE their coffee ( > $ 1.39 / cup or so ) The Senseo is a pretty good deal if you ask me . I 'll be back for more when I 'm running low . ( This stuff smells GREAT . Wait till you first open the bag , I think you 'll enjoy that breath of air you take in at that instant . )
5 #### I like this one cup coffee brand pods . It is smooth and not harsh . I like the taste . If you like really strong coffee then this may not be for you . Senseo is a good brand and not easy to find at a good price . ( I believe that they
5 #### Very good taste to this coffee , I love it , it has a rich aromatic flavor I do n't think you would be disappointed if you like Senseo coffees . give it a try . Only thing do n't buy for the price they show on this review , go to the Senseo web site , it 's a lot cheaper there .

5 #### Although the Keurig seems to be the single - cup coffee maker of choice , I prefer the Senseo ( I have both in my office ) . The coffee seems richer and each cup has a layer of crema ( as in Espresso coffee ) that I really enjoy . if you have a Senseo machine , this is the only choice -- and not as flexible as Keurigs , since K - cups seem to come in generic forms as well -- but Senseo has a variety of coffee options in any event .
5 #### Still a great cup of coffee , We love the flavor of this coffee , it 's expensive compared to canned coffee but well worth it , we take it with us when we travel along with our Senseo coffee maker , So we always have a great cup of coffee in the hotel room ...

5 #### This coffee blend smells and tastes like chocolate . I 'm not a coffee connoisseur , but this blend , in wine terms , has a good nose .
5 #### Senseo has a wide variety of coffee types , and this Sumatra Blend is among the tastiest . I 'm certainly not a coffee connoisseur , but I think this blend has a good nose ( I am a bit more knowledgeable about wines , so pardon the phrase " nose " ) . To me , it smells and tastes a bit like chocolate .
4 #### Tried in my Hamilton Beach coffee & espresso machine which uses pods or grounds . With little extra care packing , smooth flavor , less mess .
5 #### This is the best coffee ever . I am from Germany and love good coffee and most do n't measure up . This one sure does . I keep reordering it . Very rich and rounded . A great cup of coffee to wake up to .
5 #### I really like this for travel when matched with with the packable Hamilton Beach A70 . I would use one pod for me , then My wife would add a second to the holder to make hers a little stronger .
4 #### Although this Senseo Colombian blend is quite good , it is a bit too strong for my tastes . It leaves a lingering taste in the mouth and I would not care for a second cup . One cup of any coffee is enoughfor me unless I particularly like it . This is in contrast to the Senseo Brand Medium Roast , which I have also purchased previously . That brew is milder and smoother and it is likely that I wold have a second cup of it .
5 #### Here 's the thing : the one - cup Senseo coffeemakers for which this pod is designed have proved unreliable . I would n't buy any more of them . But these pods are fabulous . I got these nearly two years ago for my Senseo pod coffeemaker that lasted for all of 30 uses . Junk , crap . But these pods have proved the opposite . They have outstanding flavor , even when they ought to be stale . Usually I have brewed coffee but when I run out and it does n't make sense to make another pot , I put fresh water in a cup , add one of these and heat it in the microwave . Presto ! A cup of java to which I add my 1 % milk and enjoy . I am simply amazed that I can get such a good cuppa from a non - refrigerated , long - opened package , coffee pod !
4 #### Purchased these pad to use in a non - Senseo coffee maker . The coffee flavor and strength were very good but not perfect .
5 #### Great coffee , great price . Love the auto delivery Hope my SENSEO machine keeps on working as it has now for some time . My kids all have Kurig 's , but I love this one .
4 #### Very good coffee . Gave Sumatra Blend only 4 stars as we like our coffee much stronger , like the Dark Roast ones from Senseo . If the latter is not available this is a favorable replacement for once
5 #### The dark roast pods have the best flavor in a variety of different coffee makers that accept pods . Very satisfied !
5 #### My pods arrived in good condition . Somewhat surprised they were shipped in the original packaging but seems to work out fine . This coffee is strong compared to most pods but I like stronger coffee . I do leave my pod in the maker and when I have drank about half my cup of coffee I go back and refresh it using the same pod . I add about 3 to 4 ozs and it taste great and reheats the coffee up a bit . I had no problem with broken pods so far and the expiration date is on each pack but due to the colors its almost impossible to see or read anything on the package . The date is clearly stated on the outside of the box the six packs come in though . Overall I am pleased with this coffee .
3 #### Coffee is a good , nondescript flavor . Nothing to write home about , but not bad either . The price is a bit high in my opinion , but all these pod coffees are insane compared to a bag of ground coffee .
5 #### Senseo Dark Roast Coffee Pods , 18 - Count Pods ( Pack of 4 ) We have had a subscription for a couple of years for this coffee and are completely satisfied .
5 #### I am an absolute fan of drinking Senseo coffee and my first chore , before even feeding the dogs , is making myself my cup of Senseo , which is quickly followed by a 2nd one . Wish they were as easy to find as they are in Europe and ofcourse not so expensive , but since I need my Senseo fix I will continue to buy the coffee pods .
5 #### I enjoy the vanilla of the Senseo coffee pods . It is just the right amount and the coffee is nice and rich .
5 #### I am now a coffee drinker , I love the ease of these pods and the taste is quality- if you want it stronger just add two pods , will order again when I run ot
5 #### This is flat out excellent coffee . Smooth , tasty , no aftertaste . Love this . Nothing else to add but need these words to meet the minimum !
5 #### Senseo is the best single cup coffee maker . I hope it will always be available . I need to buy a second pot for work .
5 #### I THINK THE HEADLINE OF THIS RATING SAYS IT ALL .... NO COMPARISON TO ANY OTHER COFFEE POD - ITS AS TONY THE TIGER SAYS ITS GRRRREEEEAAAATTTTTTT
3 #### I find that Community Coffee make a less bitter coffee , but , this was okay . Pods are very easy to use .
4 #### I love this fruity smooth rich coffee . The pods are very convenient to serve and environment friendly what is very important to me .
5 #### What can I say . We always bought a big can of coffee and made 4 to 6 cups in the morning . Since we have the SENSEO coffee maker , we do not waste any coffee at all . Awesome deal . Better then Kurig because it does not use plastic . I am on a delivery schedule so I wo n't run out . Highly recommend . PS E.S.L. so do n't worry about the spelling ....
5 #### Hard to find , but a great cup of coffee . Much better than the k - cup technology . Too bad most grocers do n't sell it any more .
5 #### so much easier than a pound of messy coffee put the pod in and you have quality coffee at a much lower cost than going to those expensive coffee shops I buy the dark and every cups comes out perfect , I stopped making coffee because it came out so bad , nasty tasting , now I feel like a coffee pro
5 #### What can I say ? It is great , the only coffee I use . Also only place I can buy coffee " pods "
5 #### Senseo coffee or any pod is very hard to find these days . With all the new makers and cups this is still the best coffee . My company always comments on my coffee . I think we would buy greater quantities if it were a bit cheaper . Buy it , you wo n't be sorry .
5 #### I have a Hamilton Beach On the Go one cup brewer . These pods are perfect for it . I like the coffee . It is not as bold as I had expected , but I do like it . I went from needing cream and sugar in coffee ( because I never measured properly and ended up with either too strong or weak coffee ) to being able to drink these black . Wish there was more consistency in the price . I have to watch it all the time to see whether or not it will be going back to a reasonable price ( ~$25 ) .
5 #### This is the best breakfast ( or any time ) coffee . I always bought the Dark Roast but that is hard to find . I tried the Breakfast blend and I look forward to my first cup of coffee every morning . Will recommend it to anyone who asked for my opinion .
5 #### Great tasting coffee . I only have decafinated coffee later in the day but when I do drink it , it tastes good and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who drinks decafinated .
4 #### I do love the flavor of the medium roast Senseo coffee pods . Just wish the pricing was a little better .
5 #### My go - to coffee ! I drink this every morning and love it ... nothing compares to my Senseo ... there is always a nice crema on top of my coffee ( use the Senseo machine ) .
5 #### Love Senseo coffee pods . The flavor of each pod is just like the last one , very consistant . The packs have always been super fresh , and I just think it is the best coffee ever ...
5 #### Great coffee flavor , good price fast shipping large selection of flavors and levels of " roast " . I will be buying more a case of this item this time its so good
5 #### I 'm Thankful Senseo brought these Sumatran coffee pods back . They have a rich flavor and are my favorite of the Senseo coffees .
5 #### I previously tried Senseo 's Kona Blend back in 2011 and was very disappointed . I did n't think I would ever try it again . After shopping for what was currently available , I decided to give this another try and I 'm very glad I did so . This latest order received July 2013 is a great blend . The freshness date on my packages is 05 - 03 - 14 . I highly recommend this , and the price through Amazon is excellent - especially considering that you really can not find this in stores ! I usually go with stronger / darker coffee , but since Senseo has been more difficult to find I had settled on a Melitta dark roast that really did not give me a satisfying flavor profile . It was just blah . This Senseo offering is very satisfying and compared to a cup of freshly ground beans I would favor the Kona Blend pod .
4 #### This product has good flavor for a decaf coffee . I was using S&S to keep stocked , but it was canceled . The only downside to the product is that I had to transfer the pods to a airtight container after opening the bag . The bag would n't open cleanly , and you could n't get it to close tightly .
5 #### I bought these to go with my single pod coffee maker and really like the coffee . It has a very nice flavor with no bitterness associated with it .
3 #### I have to use these Senseo Pods for now or as long as this type of pod is still available . And all the other brands I tried are about the same . The coffee is ok but the coffee products made with the new cup system machines is superior to the coffee this makes . The price seems to be going up too . They are not the value the once were . At some point in the not too distant future I will be buying the other coffee system , it 's just better than these old pod type machines .
5 #### Love this assortment of full flavor coffees to meet any mood or taste . Works well with Bunn 1 cup coffee maker .
5 #### The espresso senseo pods are the best tasting in my humble opinion . They are strong but not bitter and do n't leave a funky aftertaste in your mouth . Buying in a pack of 6 makes it a little cheaper than the pack of 2 or 4 . I just wish I could find these in the stores but , as I understand it , senseo products are not being stocked in stores in the U.S. anymore . I might be wrong , but I think I read that somewhere . Anyway , I digress . The espresso pods are tasty and cost effective . I recommend them for any senseo user .
5 #### Best coffee for the money . We have not used anything else since we tried this and even if it is more expensive then buying coffee in a can , it saves money when you make only what you need .
5 #### I love the Sensco coffee pods for my little single coffee pot at work that requires pods . Very hard to find the pods outside of Amazon . One of my favorite coffees
5 #### Senseo coffee system came way back before the multiple brands of pod type coffeemakers came on the scene . However I have to say if you are not in need to brew a whole pot in order to function ..... and it is just the two of you , and you love rich gourmet coffee ; and reasonably priced ....... you will love it !
5 #### Love Senseo coffee pods . Best coffee ever , only problem , the pods are getting a little hard to find . Do n't know why ?
5 #### This is a great blend of decaf and I love the Senseo system . The convenience is unparalled and less wasteful than the k cup systems . Service and delivery as promised .
5 #### the price is right it is strong enough but , not bitter my wife uses it also and is very fond of it
5 #### I bought the cheaper alternative coffee " cup " Hamilton Beach single cup brewing system over a year ago and Senseo seems to be the only brand of pod that is n't prohibitively expensive . The flavor is good , but I wish Gevalia would make pods , but I guess the Keurig cup system won .
5 #### Has anyone been to Starbucks lately ? They charge four bucks for a nice cup of coffee . But this Senseo coffee costs about 33 cents a cup , and it 's just as good as Starbucks , if not better . 108 tea pods for a little over 35 bucks . This might put Starbucks out of business . [ ... ]
4 #### We like the pods more than the wasteful kcup brewers . The Senseo medium roast makes a good cup of coffee . It 's not harsh , weak or bitter . It 's hard to find coffee pods these days but I like our Bunn brewer and will keep buying these Senseo pods .
5 #### I loved this coffee but the senseo pods got so hard to find and were so pricey , that I Bought a Keurig maker and now use that .
5 #### this coffee is really good . And if you have the new Hamilton beach coffee maker w / the single serv / carafe , these are the pods you need
5 #### I have been using the Dark Roast since I obtained a Senseo Machine . It is very flavorful and foams up great .
3 #### Senseo left the US market , and for months we could n't get Senseo pods anywhere . Now this company bought the rights to the name , but the product is n't nearly as good as it used to be .
5 #### I have found this so much easier to use with my Hamilton Coffee maker . My coffee is perfect every time . Takes the guess work out of whether you have added enought coffee of not enough . Great sale also .
5 #### FANTASTIC COFFEE PODS FOR THE SENSEO COFFEE MAKER I ONLY WISH YOU COULD STILL GET THEM LOCAL(VA BEACH ) AT THE TARGET STORES
4 #### Use of the Senseo coffee machine has fallen off in favor of different format brewers . Thus the Senseo pods have become expensive and difficult to find locally .
4 #### Senseo pods have become difficult to find locally , particularly the more expensive decaf ones . We use our Senseo brewer on a daily basis , and enjoy the coffee it makes .
4 #### Other formats of coffee machines have pretty much taken over the market , and Senseo pods are difficult and expensive to purchase locally . We use our Senseo machine on a daily basis , and still enjoy the coffee it makes .
4 #### Need to use 2 pods to get any flavor indtead of one at a time . I ca n't think of anything more ! !
5 #### Love this coffee . What else can I say . Great coffee but expensive . Had two coffee pod makes , one at home and one at work because I love the coffee and foam . The expense has put me off . Down to one coffee maker using pods .
4 #### This is a basic " good " coffee ( never bitter ) . Not quite as strong as I prefer but good none the less . I 'll probably buy the dark roast next time .
5 #### I LOVE this coffee in small pods for my one cup coffee maker . Have one at home , one in Kansas , and one in California when I go see my mom . MUCH easier to use this coffee than my ground which I do use at home mostly . I use 2 to a cup . Wish this was back in the supermarkets !
5 #### This blend tastes great and really does the trick during tax season . Do you like Starbucks .. this is sililat to it .
1 #### Taste is weak like dishwater ... don , t ever buy this one you will be sorry and your wallet will be lighter like your head
5 #### I thought I had ordered the Dark Roast but I received the Breakfast blend . Turned out it was great and I like it as much as the dark roast .
4 #### Add frothed milk and you have a cappuccino or a latte . It 's almost like Starbucks , but a lot cheaper and easier .
2 #### I bought this thinking that the coffee was a blend of Sumatran coffee beans . It is n't . It is ( it says ) at least 50 % Sumatran blended with other coffees . They do n't mention what other coffees . Could be coffee grown in New Jersey for all one knows . It does have a good flavor but I think the label should clearly state 50 % Sumatran Coffee Blend and not put it in small print on the side . I think it is kind of sneaky , but I am sure legal , to label it just Sumatra Blend . One has to wonder what the flavor would be like if it were all Sumatran coffee . update : I wind up using two pods in my Bunn MyCafe machine which says two things . First off , they are the only pods thin enough to place two into my Bunn so there is less coffee in them and secondly , that using only one pod makes for a weak cup of coffee . After I got these , I got Java One Sumatra pods and Wolfgang Puck Sumatra pods . Both are superior and only requires one pod to make a good cup of coffee . I do like the Puck pods the best .
5 #### As usual , Senseo product is good with exception of availability . Taste is good and packaging has always been good . better than some other brand product .
5 #### On a scale of 1 - 10 , I 'd give Senseo Medium Roast pods about an eighteen . It suits my taste fine . We call it my " Ah ! " Coffee . My wife pointed out that I always say"Ah ! ' after my first sip . Good stuff , Maynard !
4 #### I received a one - cup coffee maker as a gift along with a sample package of Senseo pods . Although I was told that I could find the pods almost anywhere , I could n't and so ordered them . I ordered medium roast and it is what as labeled - medium . Because I like a full - bodied coffee , I will order a darker roast next time . If you like a medium roast , this is right on . If you like darker , this may be too mild . It 's easy , however , to pop two pods in the coffee machine and get the desired taste . I would like a richer flavor from the pods . This works but lacks the depth I had hoped for .
5 #### Good value and Great Morning Coffee ! A real shot in the arm in the mornings when a good cup of coffee is oh so good .
5 #### So glad to be able to get this coffee online . It is no longer available locally , but the best tasting choice for my Senseo maker .
5 #### We went through the first order of Senseo Kona blend pretty fast . Everyone liked it very much . Ordered another load and it was shipped promptly and at a good price .
4 #### And I do n't mean that in a bad way . This is a medium roast so the flavor wo n't be too strong or too bitter . Although we normally only drink coffee in the morning , we occasionally enjoy a cup of decaf after dinner .
5 #### I love the flavor of the coffee . It is a great way to have a single cup of coffee in the morning .
4 #### We love our Senseo Coffee pot . We enjoy the coffee - it has great flavor . It is a good way to have a single cup in the morning .
5 #### Our household has two different coffee makers that use this kind of coffee pod : the original Senseo coffee maker and the Hamilton Beach Stay or Go Personal Cup Pod Coffeemaker 49990Z. The Kona Blend has a rich yet smooth taste . Kona coffee is grown in Hawaii , the only place in the US where coffee grows . So support US coffee growers and have a great cup of coffee at the same time .
5 #### Good flavored decaffeinated coffee . Senseo is easy to brew and the hazelnut flavor is very good . I recommend it to people that like flavored coffee .
5 #### I Love it and will order again , order came very fast . This is great coffee I love the tast and with the pods so easy to make
5 #### This is a superb cup of coffee and no mess to clean up . We used to use a Melitta cone with filter and grind the coffee fresh each time now with these pods coffee making is a pleasure
4 #### I have been using these pods for well over a year . They make good coffty , you can get a variety of flavors if you like . Again , Amazon was cheaper than the Sensco.com website ?
5 #### These coffee pods are much easier to use than the minature cups and they cost about 30 % less . They make a good cup of coffee and store well too .
1 #### The brand of Senseo that came with my little coffee pod machine was stronger than I liked so I tried a four pack of Columbia coffee and the first pod was so strong that it upset my stomach . The next two were terrible and I dumped both cups . Since then I have tried diluting each pod with some water but the rotten taste persists . I bought a large coffee at a popular drive in and it was really strong and would have been refused back in the WWII era . NEEDLESS TO SAY , NEVER ANOTHER SENSEO COFFEE POD IN MY HOUSE , EVER AGAIN ! I do n't blame Amazon for my mistakes but it really irks me to throw out twenty some dollars worth of worthless SENSEO coffee pods . Will keep the pod machine to heat water for tea . My suggestion is for people to buy coffee and filters from your local stores , at least most of it is drinkable and so much cheaper !
5 #### Excellent coffee flavor . I will definitely buy this again . One of my favorites . Easy to use and no mess cleanup .
1 #### The Senseo pods are no longer a cost effective way of getting a quality cup of coffee . Looking through my order history , " Back in the day " a couple of years back this six pack of 18 pods used to hover around eighteen bucks ; now it is double that . So I got curious and I cut a pod and compared it against the content of a K Cup - the Senseo pod contains about half the coffee of a regular KCup . This means one has to use two Senseo pods to match the strength of a KCup for the same size brew . This translates to Senseo being more expensive than an average K Cup bought in quantity here at Amazon . Maybe I got used to the coffee , but the Senseo pods no longer produce the bold aroma and taste that got me hooked a few years back ; I defected to Keurig where I found a much richer variety and I do n't regret it for a second . On the contrary , I stopped having this nagging feeling of being ripped off by the constantly increasing price of these pods .
3 #### I think this item is overpriced at $ 5 per package for 18 cups of coffee . It was gone in no time , so I decided to purchase the replacement filters and made my own pods , which works great .
5 #### This is also the best brand to use in the Senseo or other pod coffee makers in my opinion . Excellent coffee
4 #### My wife loves this coffee so we order as needed . Guests seem to like it so it is a good coffee to have handy even if not a big coffee drinker .
5 #### Love Senseo coffee , am drinking a cup right now as I write this review . Love , love , love Senseo Coffee pods .
5 #### I have been using Senseo pods for several years , and for a while the pods were scarce . Thanks for keeping them in stock for me .
5 #### Very tasty coffee ! The formulation is perfect for a great cup ! I am partial to Douwe Eberts ' coffee . Use one pod with 6 oz of water & it is perfect !
4 #### This is good tasting coffee for your Senseo machine . It is not bitter and is very palatable to the taste . The coffee does not turn out watery but is also not very full bodied . Much cheaper price than buying single packs at the grocery store .
4 #### Great coffee , very convenient to make , great price . Love them and will order again . Much better than K cups in my opinion and the coffee maker is about twenty bucks .
5 #### Douwe Egberts is a Dutch coffee which we drank at my family home in Wassenaar NL , since I was a child of 12 years old . Great aroma and taste as in the old days .
2 #### Ok , I had hopes for this as I really like Columbian coffee . I was very disappointed . It is nasty . Really off taste . i would much prefer Nescafe Classico instant !
2 #### This is a senseo coffee product , but the Colombia Blend does not reflect the coffee perfection attained by the Dutch DOUWE EGBERTS company . While this flavor carries the DOUWE EGBERTS logo , it does not produce the flavor I have come to expect . Weaker flavor . Maybe a " blend " means less arrabbica bean content .
4 #### I really like Senseo brand coffee pods . I used the purchase them in th grocery store but I can no longer find them . It is a good way to purchase them .
5 #### I love this particular brand and blend of coffee , but do n't seem to be able to buy it anymore . Shipped quickly .
3 #### While these do taste quite good for darker chocolate , they do n't quite compare to the typical 72 % option . And the maltitol causes serious digestive issues to say the least . Why ca n't they use sucralose or stevia as the sweetener ? I would be much more tempted to buy these again if they did .
4 #### A friend bought us some Amber Lyn chocolate since she knew my hubby loves chocolate yet is a diabetic -- WOW were we impressed with the taste ! I also love chocolate but HATE the normal sugar free variety as the synthetic sweetener always upsets my digestion , plus they have a non - smooth consistancy -- this chocolate does NOT upset my delicate system , and is very good and GUILT FREE ! Update : I have removed 1 star from my rating -- The variety pack includes a bar with " chocolate bits " - this one crumbles like other sugar free chocolates and is not pleasant to eat - reminds me of Monica on Friends trying to make " mokolate " taste good in recipes ....
5 #### A W E S O M E ! and guiltless to boot ! I 'm ordering more this season .
5 #### I bought these after buying a coffeemaker that came with it ! These pods work well and provide a nice cup of coffee . Word of advice , when using these bunch them into a ball , and then brew your coffee . If you just set them inside the coffee holder , you will not get a strong cup .
4 #### Flavor is strong , but not full . Senseo 's extra strong is better , in my opinion . I 'd buy the extra strong over the dark roast .
4 #### Nice change from regular coffee , but I wish the coffee flavor was stronger . I 'd buy this again as I 'd prefer this to adding creamer .
4 #### Short of buying whole beans and grinding them yourself , this is very good decaf . Fairly rich and smooth . I 'll continue to buy it .
4 #### I have tried pods that are n't made for the Senseo machine and have often had steam blown out and boiling water leaks . I 'm addicted to the frothy cup that the Senseo machine makes and would n't switch to a Kcup brewer.(the pods are also more ecologic than plastic Kcups and can be preserved well in any jar with a tight fitting lid ) This Kona is rich and flavorful , but not strong enough for my taste . I supplement it with about a quarter tsp of instant coffee -- sometimes decaf and sometimes espresso .
5 #### The best coffee and the easiest and most compact coffee maker out there . Nothing beats Senseo . Started buying online after my store stopped carrying it .
3 #### This coffee is n't as full bodied as I like . Seems a little weak compared to other brands . The pod is like a filter with no plastic at all and a little hard to put in the holder .
2 #### If you are looking for a Kona blend that actually tastes like a Kona blend , pass this one by . Maybe it sat next to a bag of Kona in the warehouse , but that 's about as close as it comes . Kona is smooth , and never bitter . This stuff just tastes like an ordinary slightly bitter medium roast coffee . Wo n't be buying this again ...
5 #### When I moved into my apartment , this coffee came with my single cup brewer . Imagine my shock when it was n't ANYWHERE in stores ! I found the perfect solution here , and order it as needed ! This coffee is so smooth , lasts long , and is delivered fast !
2 #### I a using these pods in my single cup coffee maker and if I could use 2 and not cause the water to overflow I would . This coffee is very weak .
5 #### Very good coffee for the Senseo but it cost too much . I drink a lot of cups of coffee a day and ca n't afford it anymore !
4 #### Easy to use , that 's what I like first thing ( 5:00a.m . ) in the morning ! Good coffee flavor , that 's most important . Just what you want , especially in that first cup in the moring .
5 #### Best source for these coffee pods and best price . Coffee made by this method is never wasted . It is always the same , no guesswork . My friends love having coffee at my house !
5 #### being diabetic these are so fantastic , I had to put them in my locked car . If I left them in the house I would hear them ( mentally of coarse ) calling to me " Eat Me " and I would then polish off the entire box .
5 #### This is my favorite of the Senseo pods I have tried . It is only 10 % Kona so I did n't expect it to taste as good as the 100 % Kona or Kona peaberry I 'd bought from coffee growers in Hawaii . I was surprised , though , because it was fuller and richer than I had expected . It 's my new go - to pod coffee . :)
5 #### Excellent sugar - free option for diabetics . It does contain fat , so use in moderation
5 #### Bought these to make truffles but I could n't get my husband to stop eating them :) !
2 #### Maybe I am spoiled but Trader Joe 's sugar free chocolate is my standard . Much better than this . I bought the box and I ate it all , but was not happy . I hope they steal TJ 's recipe and try again .
5 #### Excellent alternative for those of us who love quality dark chocolate , but can'[t seem to find that quality in the grocery store . We tasted a sample at Costco , but did n't buy nearly enough . So glad we were able to find it on Amazon
5 #### Ha ! I can have 2 packs of these without calling for the flight attendant !
5 #### Really really nice chocolates . Full rich flavor , sweet enough but not overwhelmingly so . As you probably know , dark chocolates have some special health benefits , so they make for a nice occasional treat . And being sugar free means I can enjoy them as a diabetic . I gave these to a couple of friends and they really enjoyed them as well and wanted to know where to get them .
3 #### If you ca n't have candy with real sugar then these are passable , but not much better , if at all , than say a Hershey sugar - free dark chocolate . Dark chocolate is usually more dense ( so not soft , right ? ) and not as sweet as milk chocolate . These need a firm bite and the overall taste is just ok ( but at least there is no chemical after taste as with some sugar free stuff ) , but they served the purpose . Main gripe is , at least with this seller , you have to order enough candy bars to supply a neighborhood of diabetes patients ( like me ) . So , still searching , but in the meantime munching away at second of 24 bars !
5 #### I was served this on a plane and now I order direct .
5 #### Yay ! Senseo has returned ! At least the medium roast is available now . We ordered next day service and paid the extra fee just to get our Senseo . I had called DE and talked to them and they were having problems getting the Senseo to the US . Thankfully , my Dutch friend had no problems getting Senseo in Holland and so shipped us some in the meantime . Geez , I could open my own Senseo store ! LOL Anyway , our Walmart had Melitta for the immediate need , but nothing is as good as DE 's Senseo . Ca n't wait for breakfast blend and sumatra to return . Alley Grand Prairie , TX , USA
5 #### Low in carbs and sugar free , this is the best - tasting sugar - free chocolate I have ever had . No weird aftertaste , and definitely a cut above " American " chocolate . Though I am not usually a candy eater because it hurts my teeth , this definitely does n't bother me . I wo n't say it is guilt - free at 170 calories , but dark bar with hazelnuts and almonds was intensely satisfying . One a day will do me . I found these at a Costco roadshow and will buy them again at Amazon .
5 #### Great with coffee every morning . I like these larger ones better than the small ones . I wish they were offered in the Amazon monthly Subscription orders . But I agree with other reviews that Amazon does not pack them good enough . Very few were unbroken .
2 #### Love the taste . I love to dunk them in tea . It makes them even better . PROBLEM , you can not dunk crumbs . There were maybe three cookies that were not broken and most of them were half crumbs with a few bigger pieces . So disappointed .
2 #### Other reviews noted that their cookies arrived unbroken . So I figured mine would as well . The box was not dented , but those delicious cookies sure were in crumbs . It was like someone just took their hands and pushed the cookies down . Shame shame shame
5 #### Good stuff here . I am disappointed that so many folks have gone to the K - Cup coffee route that other " formats " are dying .
5 #### I buy this on the subscribe & save program , which seems to be discontinued at this time . I have had about 4 shipments of 6 bags each . My sister and I enjoy this coffee everyday ! I alternate a shipment to her and then to me . Perfect for moments when you are the only one drinking it , and do n't want to waste coffee or time to fill up a regular coffeemaker . I use it at work , because I 'm the only one who drinks decaff .
4 #### This is a must for those who love chocolate and hazelnut . Hazelnuts are not nearly as popular in the USA as they are in Europe . When I visited my family in Europe , I really loved all the chocolate and hazelnut desserts there and was sad to discover it 's hard to find such things in the USA . This spread is delicious but after you have eaten a real chocolate hazelnut torte ( a cake - like , layered brownie type thing I had ) nothing is quite the same . Either way , this is great on crepes , cake , waffles and as one other reviewer mentioned , graham crackers ! Another interesting treat is to have it on fruit or make a peanut butter and chocolate sandwich .
5 #### I know the description talks more about nuts , etc . , but this stuff is actually seriously CHOCOLATE ! It 's a creamy fudgy chocolate spread with a hazelnut flavor ( think fudge spiked with hazelnut liqueur ) . It 's incredibly rich -- a little really goes a long way . I usually just spread it on graham crackers for a wonderful indulgent treat . I 'm hooked -- this will be in my pantry from now on . ( No refrigeration necessary -- how convenient is that ? )
5 #### I 've had 2 Senseo machines - I thoroughly enjoy the coffee pods and was so sorry recently to be told by Amazon that they are no longer available as a Subscribe & Save product through them . After all these years ( 6 + at least ) of drinking Senseo coffee - and it 's getting impossible to find at any of my local grocery stores - I had come to completely rely on Amazon as the one place where I could always find Senseo coffee pods . I realize this is likely not Amazon 's choice , it may be as sad for Amazon as it is for me . I have to echo the sentiment I read in another 's comment on the site ... "what do I do with my Senseo coffee maker now , plant flowers in it ? "
5 #### This is the one I continue to buy time after time after time .... ! It 's just that good , smooth and delicious and I never get tired of it ! The only problem I have ever had concerning this coffee , is that it sometimes is out of stock ........ even on Amazon ! Then I run out and have to wait ! ! Just like it is now .... out of stock ! So waiting I am .......... guess everyone else likes it too ! !
5 #### The perfect marriage , chocolate and Hazel nut butter . This stuff is addictive , love it .
5 #### my wife and i find senseo always consistent in flavor and taste .. we have traveled all over the world and we feel the best is in a cup of senseo dark roast coffee ... long may senseo be available
5 #### This is delicious . I would be more , but I am too hooked on it , and would eat it all at once .. Maybe will get some more at a later date ..
5 #### Used in my recipe and the cookies were delicious
5 #### Can you go wrong with Nutella ? NO ! :) So good ! Great price ! Fast shipping !
5 #### Dear Nutella , Roses are red , Violets are blue , You taste super awesome , I 'm going to eat the crap out of you . I do n't know much about flowers But I have always loved Nutella Reminds me of the Rihanna Classic Not Rude Boy , but Umbrella , ella , ella ... I eat you in the morning I eat you for lunch But I ai n't no chick So there will be no brunch Like all good things This love poem must conclude so , thank you Nutella , You 're my favorite food . p.s . no matter what Mrs. Philyodaddy says , Nutella is super healthy and makes you skinny and sexy . Get ready for bikini season ladies ! Philyodaddy 's aside : I tried to set this to a Taylor Swift song , but " Love Story " did n't really work and there is no way I could set it to " We are never ever getting back together " - that would be a lie .
5 #### as an Italian ... my favorite ! as the ad says , che mondo sarebbe senza Nutella ? ( what kind of world would be without Nutella ? )
5 #### I was a skeptic at first . A cocoa spread ? My husband bought one of these and filled strawberries as dessert for one of our meals . I loved it more than chocolate covered strawberries . I also like the wonderful cuddly hazelnut flavor . If you love Ferrero Rocher candies you will love this . I really enjoy eating it with fresh fruits and veggies . It makes indulging that much healthier right ? It is very sweet , so eat in moderation . However it is a great cocoa spread - it is more chocolate than hazelnut just to prepare you . Texture is similar to peanut butter , a bit thicker . Spreads easily and the jars are perfect to save and refill with buttons and things !
5 #### This stuff is addictive ! And thankfully a little goes a long way . The calorie count is a bit high , but it does n't take much to make anything taste good . A nice marriage of chocolate and hazelnut that has the consistency of frosting , but is n't over the top in tasting cloyingly sweet . Good for an occasional treat , but hard to resist !
5 #### It 's heaven in a jar . Nutella needs to get on the ball and make a hot cocoa that tastes like this .
5 #### Used this to get free shipping . A little expensive but got Nutella in the house without too much guilt . Now if we could just not polish it off in one sitting !
4 #### We love our Senseo coffee maker and love that Amazon.com makes it so easy to order the pods for our coffee maker . We use several different types and enjoy Breakfast Blend for a light , but delightful cup of coffee in the morning . Actually , you can use this coffee pod anytime during the day and we do !
5 #### It 's nutella ! What more could you ask for . Tastes great . Product came just as described . I like the smaller jars because there is less chance of the nutella separating ( I do n't use it that often ) .
4 #### Been eating this for years . It keeps well and requires no refrigeration . My purchase as Amazon was for price and shipping convenience . I finished this jar and will be looking for more
5 #### Who even reviews this stuff anymore ? It 's chocolate hazelnut spread , and it 's good on everything . Just do n't kid yourself into believing that it 's healthy because it 's made with skim milk .
5 #### All those university students ca nt be wrong , remember one the the universities students we running through like 2500 dollars of the stuff a week . I have tried many other brands and some are close but nothing is as delicious as Nutella . Pay the little extra well worth it , and amazon has a very good price on it .
5 #### I bought this uber - large jar of Nutella as a gag gift for my friend who is gaga about this stuff ! Got great laughs and then we all got to snack on it !
4 #### i 'm 68 years old and had never tasted nutella but i got this jar the other day and wow . it tastes like a big giant melted cadbury chocolate bar . i have physically restrained myself . i do n't know how to use . putting chocolate on bread does not appeal to me . maybe i 'll make cupcakes with nutella filling . this stuff is great . wish there was low calorie or low fat nutella
5 #### Outstanding coffee in one cup biodegradable pods , this product is excellent . Much easier to use than any other coffee machine . I have been using this system for years since it first came out and have no reason to change
5 #### I like the rich flavor of this dark roast single cup brew , and because it is often discounted , it is a good value . I chose the pod - type brewing because I do not like to put little plastic cups in the landfills with every cup I drink ; just ground coffee and a little filter paper which biodegrade .
3 #### I just tried this today . It is not bad . It tasted a lot better once I started to get used to it . At first it tasted like the inside of a toosie pop than kind of like fudge . I just thought it would be more of a balance between the coco and nut . But all I can taste is the coco . It 's just a little too sweet for plain bread . I 'm going to mix it with some peanut butter for my sandwiches . I think it would be great on top of a brownie .
5 #### This is my favorite Senseo ! I still like the regular one but this is now my go too and the price is good ! I do wish that Senseo would make a 100 % Kona for an ocassional treat . I know it would be pricey but it would be SO worth it :)
5 #### A FANTASTIC DELICATE COFFEE ! NOT A NORMAL COFFEE CONSUMER BUT PURCHASED THIS FOR FAMILY / GUESTS . THIS IS SO DELICATE AND EASY TO PREPARE = HAVE IT ON AUTO DELIVERY AND YES I REALLY LIKE IT .
5 #### Heaven . In a jar . Really . What else is there to say ? Nutella tastes good on EVERYTHING . I can eat this stuff all by itself , too !
5 #### I am in love with this hazelnut spread made with skim milk and cocoa . Grownups and kids both enjoy and it 's a nice way to get picky eaters to consume whole grain breads . Do n't let the healthy breakfast commercials fool you , there is a ton of sugar in the recommended serving size . My answer to that is that I do n't indulge in the recommended serving size of two tablespoons . You can get by with less and it 's still a tasty way to start the day . I am hooked on this stuff and my local market does n't always have it in stock . I went to two stores that did n't have it and resolved to buy it here on Amazon . Big jar , twice the size of the tiny ones at my local stores . It should last me a while but next time I 'm ordering double jar package !
3 #### This product is made in Canada . The ingredients listed on the label are : " Sugar , palm oil , hazelnuts , cocoa , skim milk , reduced minerals whey ( milk ) , lecithin as emulsifier ( soy ) , vanillin , an artificial flavor . " The label also states : " Made with over 50 hazelnuts per jar . Contains no artificial colors . Contains no artificial preservatives . Do not refrigerate or microwave . " It contains the same calories as peanut butter , 100 calories per tablespoon . It has 5.5 g. fat , 11 g carbs , and 1.5 g protein per tablespoon . Though this product tastes good , it is not a health food , and it is quite expensive . A 13 oz . jar sells for around $ 4.00 in a supermarket . In addition , if you are interested in buying sustainable products , palm oil is associated with the slashing and burning of pristine rainforest . Virtually all of the palm oil used in the world is produced in nonsustainable ways in Indonesia and Malaysia .
5 #### I could eat a jar of this stuff . It 's hard to believe it 's good for me because it tastes like candy . I think it 's cheaper in the grocery store . I am happy I purchased it to bring my order up to the free - shipping level in order to acquaint myself with this yummy product .
5 #### Having never had Nutella , the scandal over its advertising made me curious , so I went ahead and bought a sample size . It has a unique taste and it is very good . I 'm going to now buy a full size and put it on my morning wheat toast . So take that you haters !
5 #### I had seen Nutella in the States growing up but did n't really become a heavy user until I lived in Europe for a year . This stuff is amazing - it 's super chocolatey with a hint of hazelnut that gives it a really full - bodied , mature flavor . I usually put it on bagels or English muffins as a quick , satisfying dessert . It 's also great for baking ( Nutella brownies are awesome ! ) In terms of nutrition , the calories per tablespoon of Nutella is pretty close to the American sandwich staple , peanut butter . Nutella does n't have quite as much protein as peanut butter but it also does n't have as much fat or sodium , so there 's a trade off . All in all I LOVE this spread and I always have a big jar in my pantry .
1 #### Had to get a refund from Amazon . Received the item with no outer seal on container , and the inner seal was loose and not intact on the jar as required by safety regulations . Not safe to eat for me as potentially exposed to contaminents or tampering with .
5 #### ... not something you want to eat every day unless you have a robust metabolism ( low - cal this stuff is NOT ! ) but if you allow yourself an occasional splurge this is just AWESOME . I ca n't believe I never tried it until now .
5 #### I bought this to send to my boyfriend , who loves Nutella , and will eat it with pretty much anything , including garlic bread , no joke . He claims that it is good . Apparently , this is a monstrous size . I 'm sure he 's almost done with it by now .
5 #### Breakfast blend is hands - down the best Senseo blend . And Amazon offers them at a great price . I would highly recommend . Not as intense as dark blend , but still very bold tasting . Sometimes the darker blends , even medium , have a bit of an acidic taste or a sharp , tongue - piercing taste . The Breakfast Blend is a perfect balance of strength , taste , aroma , and intensity .
5 #### This stuff is literally the reason I am overweight ! It is so incredibly delicious I can not even begin to describe it . Try it , you will not regret it !
4 #### From time to time my wife brings home a jar of Nutella . I like it , but only on rare occasion . The flavor is just too overpowering for me and I tire of it quickly . My wife loves the stuff on bread ( toast ) or crackers and she eats it with her afternoon or evening tea . She raves about the chocolatey - nutty flavor and ca n't understand why I do n't see things the same way . Such is life . In any case , if it pleases her , I 'm happy with it . Oh , I might add that the baby seems to like it too . That 's two out of three . Gary Peterson
5 #### My son survives on this stuff . It 's very chocolaty . I agree it is very sweet . I like the hint of hazelnut and I like it as a spread on crackers or toast . My son will eat it with peanut butter in a sandwich . It 's good , especially for chocolate lovers . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ UPDATE : My son brought this to his childcare center and he was prevented from eating it because they are a peanut - free facility . When I told them it was hazelnut spread , they said it smelled like peanut and it was processed in a factory that may have processed peanuts and it 's a nut . So , for those moms whose children go to schools where they are paranoid about nuts ( not just peanuts but everything nuts and stuff processed at facilities which may have processed nuts ) , Nutella may not be acceptable .
5 #### When I was a young boy growing up in Italy , I would grab a spoon and eat this hazelnut spread right out of the bottle . Of course that 's not the correct way to eat it and my mother would scold me for it . Today , I eat it occasionally , spread on a slice of bread and of course one teaspoon straight out of the jar now and then ca n't hurt since I do n't eat much sugar . For anyone like me , having a jar of this in the refrigerator and being able to make a sandwich dessert I highly recommend it , if you have not already done so .
5 #### I love this chocolate hazelnut spread . I 've loved this stuff since I was a child . I use it on bread , toast , banana 's , strawberries and cakes . Even though it says not to microwave it , I always do , especially for cakes . If you found this review helpful , please click yes . Thanks !
5 #### I grew up eating Nutella and when I came to the US I was surprised that almost nobody knew it . It should be mandatory to eat Nutella that 's how good it is ! :) OK OK , so I am a Nutella fanatic and maybe not mandatory to eat it , but to try it LOL Ferrero never lets us down .
5 #### I could eat it with a spoon , it 's so good . Being partial to hazel nut chocolates . I love this delicious spread on toast . I put it on a bun and it 's just like a pastry and a more natural one , free of chemicals . Highly recommended , you 'll love it if you have n't tied it yet .
5 #### It 's amazing how many wonderful things can go on a simple piece of bread . Peanut butter , hazlenut butter , almond butter ... Then do n't forget the wonderful Marmite , a yeast extract . Sigh ... But Marmite , Marmite is for eating toast while reading " Moby [ ... ] " , or perhaps " Barnaby Rudge " . A bit hearty . Nutella is for eating toast while reading " Remebrance Of Things Past " or " Dracula " . Rather luscious . Like Marmite , Nutella goes a lot farther than the prescribed serving size . Spread thinly . Now , my children , go out and turn your whole wheat toast into a chocolate doughnut . Marcel Proust would want you to .
5 #### I so look forward to my cup of coffee each morning . I like to put a little milk or cream in the cup before running the Senseo machine - heat it first in the microwave for 20 seconds - turns out like a latte with foam on top . Ordering the coffee pods through Amazon is also a plus . You get a good price and you do not have to worry about looking for the coffee at the store ( which is hard to find ) .
5 #### The coffe is a real european blend it only takes a minute to make and it cost only half or less then the other coffe 's like krups that cost twice as much . My wife and I love it .
5 #### We have one of the Senseo coffeemakers that requires coffee pods rather than the newer ( and much more expensive)cups for single serve . I do n't drink a lot of coffee , but my husband does and loves the Senseo coffees . Sumatra is his second favorite ( he prefers Columbian , which we also order from Amazon in the Senseo brand ) flavor of coffee , and he vows that the Senseo pods are as good as Sumatra brewed from freshly ground beans . It is certainly convenient to be able to brew a cup as needed , because it is always fresh , rather than stale from a day of sitting on a warmer . For anyone who likes coffee and does n't drink a whole pot in a couple of hours , the pods are ideal , and for those who like a strong and rich flavor , Sumatra pods are a good choice .
3 #### Not quite what I expected . Is not nearly as robust or flavorful as the dark roast . I was not expecting such a large gap between dark and medium roast . I will stick to the dark roast blends from now on as the medium is just an okay cup of coffee , not much flavor .
5 #### Okay ... so I am new to Senseo and ALL of its varieties of coffees . The machine came with a sample of Dark Roast . It 's not that the roast itself was bad , it just tasted " flat " - none of the overtones of the nectar of the gods - and I was sorely disappointed . However , I was on a mission to make 1 cup at a time , having reviewed all the other 1 cup machines out there I was sure that Senseo was not just the best deal , but the best machine - and then ... when all hope seemed lost ... a light at the end of the tunnel was seen and at its core was Medium Roast . This stuff is good coffee people ! You can taste the nuances and hints of floral , chocolately , nutty , and all those other words that go with describing good coffee ... so I highly recommend these pods . They taste wonderful and will have you returning to the Senseo for another cup before work begins ... FIVE STARS ! ! !
5 #### These coffee pods are very , very weak . I started with one pod , no flavor . 2 pods , a bit better but still weak and watery . 3 pods was all I get into my little Hamilton Beach but there was still no Hazelnut taste . I finally used 2 pods for just a half a cup and though it was somewhat stronger , there was still no taste . Very disappointed in this selection , looking around for some other brands . March 24 , 20012 I like to update this review and give it 5 stars because I think I was a bit hasty the first time around . I only tried it in a cheap little 1 - cup pot and I think that was the problem . I now use the pods in a 4 - cup Mr. Coffee and it comes out absolutely delicious . I love the smell when it perks and enjoy the of it taste every morning . In fact , I 'm ready to send in my next oder !
5 #### When I bought the senseo machine , I decided to order the Dark Roast and Expresso coffee bags in the same time . First off , both taste quite similar . Also , as I did discover with the Expresso , I can get at least one large coffee out of one bag and even squeeze a third small coffee out of it . Am I satisfied ? Yes I am !
5 #### I am using this indeed with a Senseo machine . On the directions , it is indicated that one should use one bag for a small coffee size and two for the large size . Although I like my coffee strong , I found out that one bag will easily provide for a large coffee size and one may even squeeze out a third small coffee out of it . Taste wise , I find little difference between the expresso and the French roast ( dark ) .
5 #### I bought this for my son , It 's his favorite flavor and amazon is the only place I can get it . The price is right and I 'll be buying it again
5 #### This coffee is great and I have had my Senseo for years . I am unable to find the pods locally anymore , so on subscribe and save through Amazon . Love the foam on top of the coffee , I do n't even want regular coffee anymore since I found Senseo years ago .
5 #### I 've tried several Senseo pods and this one , the Kona Blend , is my favorite . It 's very smooth ... not too strong .. not bitter at all . I do enjoy some of the others , as well , but this is the one that I order on a regular basis . I do n't think you 'll be disappointed ! By the way , I use this in the Bunn single serve coffee maker and I have it set to brew extra strong . If you can not set yours to brew extra strong , you may want to choose a stronger blend if you prefer strong coffees .
5 #### I still think Senseo coffee is as close to Starbucks as I can get . I might even like it better ! Kona is strong yet gentle and does not upset my stomach with too much acid .
5 #### The Sumatra blend are my favorite coffee pods , but unfortunately the price on Amazon is almost full retail price lately . Note : You are supposed to use 2 pods for a regular sized cup of coffee , that 's still a good price for the convenience . The 1 pod setting is for smaller cups only , but if you like weak watered - down coffee you could use this for a regular sized cup .
5 #### Senseo coffee pods make the best cup of coffee I have ever had . No more starbucks , you loose your shoes and purse there so expensive . Dunkin Donuts forget it have 3 medium size coffees a day and you figure the math . This you make at home . Need to take with you grab a coffee travel mug at the dollar store , or discount store and you just saved your self a bundle of money each and every day , no matter how many cups of coffee a day you drink you are saving all around . The senseo coffee maker is so simple to use , quick and easy . In this economy this is one way to save some of your hard earned money and us the overage you save and have lunch . After a few months you will find you saved a ton of Money
1 #### Well , the reviews were really good for this coffee , so I decided to buy in bulk . Big mistake . Maybe my taste is just different , but this tasted like the taste in my mouth after a night of whiskey and cigarettes . Will never buy this again .
5 #### I love Senseo decaf , its a great coffee with strong flavor ! Always happy with senseo coffee 's from Amazon , ships very fast and always fresh !
5 #### Senseo Paris French is one of my favorite senseo coffee 's always a great cup of coffee . Great price from Amazon !
5 #### Want a great cup of coffee at a fair price ? Try Senseo with a wide selection of flavors . We prefer Breakfast blend or Medium blend for breakfast . Skip the $ 3.00 or $ 4.00 dollars a cup , and put it in your piggy blank ! !
5 #### Some may find it a bit pricey if you calculate the cost by the pound but the quality and convenience is there . Senseo offers a variety of flavors and one standard decaf . They are packaged well and easy to use . For ease of use and taste I would stick with these . Also , they can be used in any single serve coffee maker that accepts pods .
5 #### As many now know Sara Lee has sold their beverage business and ceased making this fine product .... such a shame We been drinking the dark roast Senseo Coffee for several years and it never disappoints . The flavor , aroma and wonderful crema of this coffee easily compares to those coffees from coffee shops . It is easy to use and Amazon makes it easy to buy ... with subscribe and save we get the six pack for less than 25 cnets a cup ( actully 21 cents ) . That 's good coffee and good value . We recommend this coffee without reservation . Update February 1 , 2012 After corporate buyouts , manufacturer sourcing changes and packaging updates it seems that this great product is once again available on a regular basis ... albeit at a 50 % increase in price over previous shipments . The 6 count box of 18 pod packages used to sell for around 19 - 25 dollars depending on if you opted for auto - delivery and quarterly specials . Now at 36 per carton of 6 that breaks down to about 33 cents per cup a 45 to 50 percent increase in price ... still a bargain over the plastic packaged K - cups and in my opinion a more flavorful cup of coffee .
5 #### Enjoying the yummy coffee . Do n't need my Hazlenut cream . This is much healther way to have flavor and no Palm oils(bad ) . Now , I use Organic no fat cream :-) Makes me feel better that I 'm not putting all of the sugars and oils in my body :-)
5 #### I purchased the Senseo Dark Roast coffee pods for two important reasons . First , the ease of use and second I REALLY enjoy the flavor of a freshly brewed cup every time I want one .
5 #### Excellent product . In my opinion , the best of the Senso coffee blends . I will continue to purchase this product as long as it 's available .
4 #### I love using the Senseo pods , but recently I purchased these on Amazon and there are coffee grinds on the bottom of the package . This causes an issue because I have to wipe them off before using them . It 's not a huge ordeal , but I would much rather not have to fuss with something before I can use it . That being said , I do love the product normally .
5 #### These are standard Coffee Pods and are good tasting for the individual size . A single pod is fairly weak for a full - sized cup of coffee , but that is how it is intended .
5 #### These are standard Coffee Pods and are good tasting for the individual size . A single pod is fairly weak for a full - sized cup of coffee , but that is how it is intended .
3 #### This is the only Senseo product I have found that makes an almost strong enough mug of coffee . All others require 2 pods for a 12 oz . mug and that gets rather pricy and wasteful .
1 #### I guess I was expecting too much for a large company like Sara Lee ... how could they just have 1 decaf coffee variety for pod machines!!! ... this coffee is weak and insipid for an 8 oz measure ... maybe the only way to make this good is to use 2 pods and keep my fingers crossed ... for strong coffee lovers , this is NOT the one for you ! ! ! !
5 #### My husband and I have been using the Senseo coffee pods for many years now and the Breakfast Blend is one of our favorites to begin our day with . I subscribe to the monthly delivery program as our local stores are frequently out of stock or when they do have the pods , the price is much higher than Amazon 's .
5 #### We have a Senseo single cup coffee maker . It 's been difficult finding the pods that go with this unit so we looked on Amazon , and there they were ! Even though our local grocery store now carries them , Amazon 's price is still the best deal . We are on a 6 - week automatic plan and it works out perfectly for us ! When I think of all the money we spent prior to finding these pods on Amazon , I am even more determined to check Amazon FIRST before buying anything at a store . You just ca n't beat Amazon 's prices ! < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Senseo - Breakfast - Blend - Coffee-18 - Count - Pods - Pack - of-4 / dp / B0019SM0R8 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Senseo Breakfast Blend Coffee , 18 - Count Pods ( Pack of 4)</a >
4 #### This coffee is pretty tasty . Not too strong of a vanilla flavor , more of a " hint " of vanilla . Better with a bit of milk and sugar . A nice occasional change from the Sumarta ( now that 's a good cup of senseo joe ! )
4 #### My husband is the big coffee drinker in our household , and he loves the Senseo coffee pod system and the coffee that the pods make . We have the Senseo coffee maker , and he brews the Expresso coffee using the 8 oz setting , because the 4 oz setting that he uses for his Columbian and Sumatra is too strong for the Expresso brew . He loves the flavor occasionally but it 's not his favorite -- the Columbian ranks first and the Sumatra second . The great thing about the pod system is that he can brew different flavors and have a cup of each without having to brew a whole pot of any one flavor . The Expresso is very rich and very strong , and a nice change occasionally when he is in the mood for a real coffee " high " . If someone added sweetener and creamer , it would probably work to brew the 4 oz cup , but my husband drinks his Expresso blend black , so the 8 oz setting is better for his taste .
5 #### I do n't drink much coffee , so it does n't make sense to brew a full pot for my husband to have a couple of cups in the morning . We began using the pod coffee system years ago when the Home Cafe systems were introduced ( before the current K - cup models ) . The pod coffee system is perfect for our household , and Senseo is just about the only manufacturer still offering the pods . My husband rotates the Columbian with Sumatra and Expresso pods , but the Columbian is his favorite , and he says that it is a very rich and flavorful blend . The aroma when the coffee is brewing is wonderful , and for anyone who only drinks a few cups , this system is probably as cost effective as brewing a pot of coffee and throwing out half the pot ; plus , with this system , every cup is fresh , not stale or left - over . The Columbian is a rich and dark blend and perfect for coffee drinkers who want a traditional flavor of coffee .
5 #### This hubby 's favorite brand of coffee as it 's rich tasting and easy to use . He was delighted to find this at Amazon as this type of coffee filter / pod seems to have disappeared from local grocery shelves . Things he likes best : 1 . Rich coffee flavor 2 . Easy to use in the morning and it saves time . Good for when you are sleepy too and need a little extra help . :-) 3 . Great for taking on vacation as this pod works in most hotel / motel coffee pots . Recommend .
5 #### This is a decent coffee . I ca n't find a replacement machine for my old single cup machine . They all now seen to be drip instead of pressure / pump models . For drip coffee , these are OK .
4 #### Good for what it is , a quick cup of coffee with a slightly different flavor . The 10 % blend is n't quite enough to really make a huge impact on the taste .
2 #### I was really happy to see this coffee for such a great price . I even got a better price using the additional Senseo coupon code . As soon as I got the pods I brewed my first cup of . . . " the weakest coffee ever except for when I forgot to add the coffee to the coffee maker . " I was really disappointed . After reading the package I discovered I could use two pods to improve the flavor . Of course this also doubled the price making the deal not so good after all . Using two pods was a little too strong for my taste . Senseo rates the coffee as between mild and med . It was VERY , VERY mild ! In all fairness to this product , I purchased these pods to use with my EZ - Cup in my Keurig . So perhaps they would make better tasting coffee in the Senseo pod coffee maker .
5 #### This coffee is so good . Amazon has the best price and Senseo coffee is hard to find in stores . Amazon has all the varitys at the best price . I 've bought Senseo coffee here before and I will again .
5 #### This is some great tastings coffee and I ca n't tell the difference between it and a good medium roast . Its a fine quality and tastes as good as another great decaff,&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Eight - O - Clock - Coffee-100 - Colombian - Decaf - Whole - Bean-12 - Ounce - Bags - Pack - of-4 / dp / B001EQ55LI / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Eight O'Clock Coffee , 100 % Colombian Decaf Whole Bean , 12 - Ounce Bags ( Pack of 4)</a > . Caffeine is linked to an increased risk in diabetes so its just another of those little things to try and do to stay healthy .
5 #### The Hazelnut flavored coffee is my favorite so far next to Dark Roast and Kenyon . Taste is such a personal thing that I can only say what I like . Ordering is predictable and as promised . No worries there .
5 #### I am a coffee lover . I like my coffee a bit stronger than my husband but without a bitter bite . The Kona by Senseo gives me a great cup of joe . By using two pods I can get a 12 ounce cup that is smooth and delicious with out bitterness . I can say enough how much I have enjoyed my Senseo Coffee Maker and now my husband is a convert too ! ! !
5 #### This is my favorite coffee .... so much so that I 've been on auto shipment for quite some time . If you enjoy a full , rich coffee taste , this is for you !
4 #### " Someone gave me a Senseo machine , so I bought this coffee . I 'm very disappointed with the taste ! It 's bland and dull tasting . Too bad , as I have 4 bags now ! " This was my previous review . Since then , I gave away the Senseo machine , but I kept the coffee and use it in a cup of hot water I do in the microwave . The coffee is actually good . I guess somehow the machine flavored it . Maybe it 's because the water does n't sit in the coffee for long enough . Using my microwave method , I let the coffee bag brew awhile before pressing it and removing it -- very good taste . Go figure ! Anyway , I 'd recommend this coffee as microwavable bags .
4 #### I ca n't tell you how happy I am to have found this program and my coffee . It is getting harder and harder to find my coffee for the Senseo machine . It seems to be being pushed out . My machine is perfect and I have a second for backup . I need my coffee . It comes once a month and the cost is actually a few cents less than buying it in the supermarket . Also there is the entire selection to choose from . I hope this stays around for some time , I love Senseo coffee . It is rich without being bitter .
5 #### I never have a bad cup of Senseo , which I consider our backup to the Keurig machine and cups . It 's simpler and cheaper -- and good .
5 #### If you are looking for a really dark , intense Starbucks like brew , this is not that strong . It suits me perfectly .
5 #### We go through a lot of this flavor . Love the Senseo machine and their customer service . Love the ability to use different flavors of coffee and tea . Everyone can have their favorite in seconds . We just use a lot of the French Vanilla .
4 #### It is only 10 % Kona , so if you are expecting a true Kona taste you may be disappointed . However , as a general blend , this is far smoother and has a more full flavored ( but not full bodied ) , not burnt taste than most of the Senseo Coffee Blends . I would n't have minded if the coffee was a bit stronger or full bodied , but still , as it is , it is my go to blend for my Senseo .
5 #### These are delicious but after eating about two in a row my tongue feels numb ! :)
5 #### Have never had these candies before , and was seeking a hard candy . These are fresh and do help with my dry mouth . However , they melt pretty quickly . Cost makes reordering these unlikely although I do like them .
5 #### These candies are not cheaply sweet . They have just the right amount of sweetness and flavor . My Cousin complimented these so I bought her some more .
5 #### Senseo offers many strengths of coffee , this one is the very best . It is a dark strong coffe that will wake up the dead ! Great when doing tax returns .
5 #### Imagine having a freshly - brewed cup of coffee every time you want a cup ? No more icky , old , disgusting coffee that has been sitting on the warmer for an hour - and you feel you ought to drink it because after all , you made it . Well , this is your answer . These are a nice balance between the old standby can of coffee , and the ( very ) expensive ( for me , anyway ) Keurig coffee pods . I only drink one big cup of coffee in the morning anyway , so these are so perfect for me . If I really crave a half cup more , just slip in one pod and make a half cup . It is a little more expensive for me because I use two pods at a time to make my coffee really zing . No more wasted coffee ! And a fresh cup every time . I do n't think it gets any better than that . Unless you can afford to go to Starbucks every morning - and up here in cold , snowy Michigan , who wants to do that ? ? ? ? I love this coffee !
4 #### A very rich taste especially with the foam at the top . I almost became addicted to this coffee . I was drinking way too much caffeine . But the flavor is fabulous with lots of body . I have now just talked myself into having a cup . EW
1 #### This is an update to my previous review , written a few years ago . I saw these were back on the market after a long absence ( I assumed it was to improve the obvious decline in quality ) . I used the Melitta brand in the meantime . I just received my box of 6 bags , and tore open the bag . AGAIN I was discouraged to take out a very thin pod , and yes , it made a dishwater - weak cup of coffee . Over $ 30 wasted . Stick with the Melitta pods , at least they taste like coffee ! ! ! Utterly dreadful . PREVIOUS REVIEW : I 've been buying these pods for years , and have a " Subscribe & Save " program for them through Amazon . I like strong coffee , and these are the strongest I 've found . However , today I opened up the first bag of my latest shipment and noticed the pods were very thin ; had much less coffee in them . Sure enough , they made a VERY weak cup of coffee . Unfortunately , I 'd upped my order recently to three months at a time , so I now have another 107 weak cups of coffee to look forward to . But I 'll be shopping for a new brand .
3 #### As the popularity of the Senseo pod system wanes and that of the Keurig system grows , there is diminished availability of pods that fit the Senseo . The Senseo brand pods are available on Amazon at a decent price . Unfortunately , the Senseo pods are not as good as competing brands formerly available on Amazon such as Fratello , Halo , Millstone , etc . Of the Senseo pods , the French Roast has a richer flavor than most of the others . It is often on sale and is a bargain when that happens . I suspect that the Keurig system makes good coffee , but I can not imagine paying so much for a Keurig pod ( thimble ) .
4 #### Good taste , a little on the weak side especially since I mix it with half soy milk after it 's brewed . Delicious nonetheless .
4 #### breakfast blend coffee is very good , tasty coffee . I would have given five stars if the coffee pods came in better packaging that would keep the coffee fresher . That is the only improvement that this coffee needs , hope someone is listening ...
4 #### I previously had purchased this as part of a pack with 4 flavors . I enjoy this one and the Kona blend the most . Though the Kona blend is my favorite , this is a good runner - up . It 's a solid blend , not too strong , not too weak . It does n't really have any subtle nuances or anything , but it is a good starter coffee for your day .
5 #### I previously purchased this as a set with 3 other different kinds of pods . This and the breakfast blend I enjoyed the most . The Kona Blend has a little bit of sweetness to it , with bold flavor . It has quickly become my favorite flavor .
5 #### My wife and I brew and drink a cup of Senseo Medium Roast coffee everyday -- have done so for years . We almost always buy it from Amazon.com and find the price to be best there .
3 #### There seem to be fewer options for coffee pods that fit the Senseo . This probably is the result of the declining popularity of the Senseo and the increasing popularity of the Keurig . There are much better decaf coffee pods for the Senseo , but they are no longer available through Amazon .
5 #### This is by far our favorite coffee to use in the Senseo . We discovered it in a variety pack we often ordered , and decided that we liked it so much that we needed to start ordering it by itself in bulk . It 's awesome that both my husband and I like it so much , because he leans toward bold coffees while I tend to go a little bit mild . I think this one would qualify as being on the more bold side of the spectrum , but not extremely so . It also has a slightly chocolaty flavor to it somehow ... Just barely .
4 #### No , it 's not Starbucks or Dunkin ' Donuts . It 's not even a good home brewed cup . But for a single serving cup of coffee it is n't bad . I know that 's condemning with faint praise but I will say compared to other single serving flavors it is , to me , the closest to a very decent cup of coffee .
5 #### Amazon gave me the Best Senseo coffee deal , ever ! ! ! The delivery was sooner than I could ever have thought . My package of Senseo arrived perfectly . No bumps , no package breakage . Overall , a great experience .
5 #### This is delicious coffee , and extremely quick and convenient to prepare . In less than a minute , you have a brew that 's fresh , aromatic , and rich in flavor .
1 #### The particular packages had an off taste . However , the seller gave me a complete refund and did n't even make me send them back . I have ordered this item before and they were fine .
5 #### I like this product very much , and living in an area where I am unable to purchase it locally , I appreciate being to get it through Amazon . However , I 'm disappointed that the Cappuchino is no longer available .
4 #### hard to find coffee pods in stores , lucky that Amazon has them . Have tried different brands , and Senseo is very good , but Wolfgang puck is even better , but pricier
4 #### hard to find coffee pods in stores , lucky that Amazon has them . Have tried different brands , and Senseo is very good , but Wolfgang Puck is even better , but pricier .
5 #### I use the senseo pods in my Hamilton One Cup Brewer , the brewer cost only $ 19.00 and it makes the best tasting coffee no matter what type you buy , I like the coffee mix with 10 % Kona and my husband likes the decaffinated . Taste like European coffee
5 #### my favorite brand for my senseo , kinda bummed philips is no longer making the senseo . the other man make the pots too large and expensive . I am able to recycle pods . Update on this , No longer made in Florida , now made in Texas . after YEARS of using this brand I just could n't stand how BAD it is . I went with the Melita breakfast blend and a much better cup o coffee . Then I went to splurge and tried the Good as Gold Vienna blend Now we have the great cup I was used too but the price reflects that also . https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JK1VR2/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_12
4 #### I really love the convenience of having automatic shipments ; and signing up for this service enabled me to get a great price as well . It is terribly hard to find coffee pods in any of the grocery stores anymore and decaf is next to impossible to find . Thank you Amazon.com for providing the product I 've been looking for .
5 #### I love my Senseo coffee , have two machines . One in the camper and one at home . Have used them while living in various parts of the world . They come in different strength depending what you are in the mood for .
4 #### My husband loves this rich , robust dark roast coffee . We agree it is much better than Starbucks and we love the pricing . It is not as strong or leaves a chicory aftertaste like Starbucks . I am a fan too , but prefer the medium roast . Either way you can not lose . Santa brought us a Senseo coffee machine with the Dark and Medium Roast Pods . Of course , Santa would chose the perfect strength for each of us !
5 #### This Medium Roast offers a rich , full bodied flavor that is not watery . It is my pick for breakfast coffee . The pods are easy to use , priced reasonably and are available for automatic delivery delightfully spoiling us . I intend to branch out and try other flavors / types in the Senseo brand . Enjoy !
4 #### My husband and I have been buying Senseo coffe pods for about 3 years . Recently , I placed 2 orders a few days apart for a total of 24 packages of this coffee . We love the coffee , but the quality of some of the pods is disappointing . So far , we have opened 5 packages of the first order . Inside 2 of the packages were pods that were not fully sealed , and the loose coffee had fallen out in the packages . If we find more unsealed pods , all of the remaining packages are going back to Amazon .
5 #### I love this coffee system but finding the pods is becoming more difficult now . The price is right , the delivery is fast and you can order a case so I always have coffee when I need it .
4 #### Our pod coffeemaker is by Krups and uses pods rather than the newer K - cups . Senseo is one of the few manufacturers still offering the pods , and while the Columbian by Senseo are good , they are n't as " rich " in flavor as the previously available Millstone Columbian Supremo pods . That said , these are the best we 've found and we just hope that Senseo continues to offer these pods to fit our wonderful little coffeemaker .
4 #### Thanks so much for the fast delivery ! These pods were just what I wanted and just what was advertised .
5 #### Excellent decaf that can go toe - to - toe with some caffeinated coffees . Rich tasting with no bitterness . A must purchase if you have a Senseo and want to go decaf . I just wish they would offer more options for decaf , such as some different flavored coffees ( hazelnut in particular ) . As it stands , this is the one and only decaf offering from Senseo . I have to make my own pods if I want something different ( not hard to do , and cheaper , but I do like the convenience of the pre - made pods ) .
1 #### My wife and I have been drinking Senseo pods for years . We have always used the medium roast . On our last shipment we noticed the coffee tastes stale and old . Very nasty . The old pods have the sense logo on the pods themselves and these new pods do not so I do n't know what that means but that seems to be the way to identify the bad tasting pods . These are so bad we ca n't even drink them . I 'm going to try one more order and if that tastes the same we may actually quit sense and move to Keurig . VERY disappointed in the new medium roast and I would not recommend as it tastes like coffee that is a week old .
4 #### The dark roast is good coffee . Never liked the other flavors . Well , the decaf is OK . Super Saver Subscription brings price down to about $ 0.22 per cup of coffee . And Senseo means it 's always fresh . Occasionally one pod in a pack will have ripped open ( in transit , or from manufacturer ) . This makes a mess of the other pods and will result in the occasional extra gritty bits in your coffee . Call Senseo if this happens , and they 'll send you a coupon for another bag .
5 #### Hawaii and Jamaica produce the world 's best coffee . Are n't we lucky that Senseo offers the Kona blend . It 's heavenly !
5 #### We got a Senseo machine 5 years ago as a gift from a friend and would never go back to regular drip coffee . This is full , rich , and has a wonderful little foam on top .
2 #### Went for economy in latest order and got the 6 pack as I could not recall what Dark Roast tasted like . Counted on all the positive reviews , but we all have different palates , do n't we ? I prefer Senseo 's Kenya or Sumatra as a more reliably flavorful brew with Sumatra probably my favorite . Just opened my first of six bags , so I have a ways to go before I get to the end of my " bargain " purchase of a brew that is weak and one - dimensional . I guess I will have to play with the amount of water and pods as other reviewers suggest to try to get something strong enough to satisfy . Just ca n't throw it all out !
5 #### I do n't have an espresso machine , and these pods are the next - best thing . Love 'em !
5 #### Very fast shipping , this is one of my favorite Senseo coffees . Just the perfect bold flavor . I also like that it was a pack of 6 and not 4 .
2 #### The only taste you will get from these pods are faint vanilla . You need two pods to make a cup of coffee and even with the two pods it does not taste like coffee . It tastes like watered down coffee with a fake vanilla flavoring .
4 #### This is one of the most delicious Senseo pod flavors out there . It 's a great Kona blend with subtle , nutty flavor .
5 #### I 'm very pleased with this decaf -- very flavorful but not bitter . Just the right balance in terms of strength -- not so strong that it feels like it dissolving your teeth , but not dishwater either . Just right ! Of course , with all pod coffee systems you 're paying for the convenience , so the price is higher than conventional blends in a bag . But the subscribe and save program knocks a few bucks off , so I find it to be a decent value for the benefits gained .
5 #### My husband only drinks decaf coffee and I occasionally enjoy a cup of decaf in the evening . The Senseo Decaffeinated Coffee Pod gives a full - bodied coffee taste and surprise it 's decaf ! The cup has a nice layer of froth on top when it has finished brewing . Recommend it highly .
5 #### Senseo is an easy way to make a great cu of coffee . I love the taste of medium roast . Sometime I mix the medium roast with a french vanilla flavored pod " Paris " for a very special taste and treat
5 #### I love this coffee and think it is the best ! ! Amazon offers the best deals on it ! !
5 #### Sumatra is my fave flavor of all the Senseo flavors . It 's smooth and silky . Love it !
5 #### Great coffee . We mix it with Godiva chocolate coffee or regular medium roast . What a treat
4 #### Senseo Dark Roast pods provide a strong , vibrant flavor that seems to me to be similar to the Starbucks regular brand , I limit myself to two cups per day and really prefer this more robust variety of coffee . I am not disappointed by the brew and find it saisfying . Using Amazon 's Subscribe and Save Plan helps my budget and is completely convenient .
5 #### It is a pleasure to order a six - pack of Senseo coffee pods from Amazon ! We have owned a couple of Phillips coffee makers and have used Senseo pods for years . So many times when I try to buy them at our local grocery stores , they are out of stock or the price is just too high . So , Amazon is to the rescue again ... in quantity , price , and fast delivery !
2 #### Althouh I love Senseo coffees for the most part , I did n't care for this one at all . It has a smokey , burnt flavor to me that tastes like coffee that 's been sitting out for hours . Plus I had the same problems others mentioned with torn pods that contaminated the rest of the bag and what a mess that was ! I wo n't be buying this kind again .
2 #### I find most of the Senseo coffee products to be tasteless , maybe watered down , but not full - bodied or delicious . I have tried several different Senseo varieties , but none are noteworthy and I would n't recommend any of them . I am going to try other pod brands .
5 #### I just replaced my old Flavia SB100 with the commercial Grindmaster opod . This medium blend is the first pod coffee I 've tried . It was a very good cup of coffee ; hands - down better than all of the Flavia 's I 've tried . Part of the difference may just be the machine . I love the Grindmaster 's hotter water . I intend to try other coffees that were recommended to me , but I could easily just buy the medium blend all the time and really enjoy it .
3 #### I just got my Grindmaster and ordered some Senseo coffees . I 've only tried the medium blend and the decaf . I absolutely loved the medium blend . The decaf was sort of ok . I wish there were more variety of decaf to choose from .
5 #### I have two Phillips coffee pod makers and prefer to order my Senseo pods from Amazon rather than buy from the local markets because of the no shipping charges and great prices on the sets of coffee pods Amazon offers .
1 #### Okay , people . I just do n't get it ! How can this stuff be getting five stars from so many people ? Do they know what coffee is SUPPOSED to taste like ? Yuck , yuck , and double YUCK ! This is akin to drinking dirty water ! I 've even doubled the pods to try to get a richer cup ... to no avail . What taste it has is horrible ... not that there is much taste at all ! I will struggle through this case and never buy it again ! All I wanted was a cup of decaf in the afternoon or evening ... a GOOD cup of decaf ! Is that too much to ask ? Apparently so ! I would n't recommend this stuff to my worst enemy ! Again , I say YUCK ! Also , my tummy 's reaction is such that I suspect there is gluten in the packaging of the pods ... perhaps in the glue ? I contacted Senseo to ask about it and they would n't give me an answer to my question unless I filled out a questionaire that would give them tons of information about ME ! Forget it ! That made me even more suspect ! I ca n't say for sure that there is gluten hiding somewhere . It is only a suspicion created by an all too familiar IBS reaction . Buy this stuff at your own risk , or , if you enjoy drinking weak coffee that looks and tastes like dirty water .
5 #### I love Espresso . So what is better than a $ 10,000 commercial machine ? ? PODS ! This Espresso is really good , even though it is from a Pod . It does n't give the Crema like an expensive Espresso machine does , of course , but it tastes great !
5 #### I use this regularly . It has a great flavor and when ordered through Amazon , it is usually less expensive than purchasing in a grocery store . A good bargain with great taste .
3 #### The Senseo pods are very convenient and an easier way to purchase in bulk from Amazon than search in brick and mortar stores . HOWEVER , as a single user , I would wish for a more varied packaging option , such as one regular cofee , one decaf and two flavored ones , such as Hazelnut and Godiva . This would be convenient and more reasonable for one living on a fixed income . Please forward this suggestion to the manufacturer .
5 #### This is my second Senseo coffee maker in almost 10 years and just love this new blend . It was a great day in my house when I discovered it on the subscription service through Amazon , ensuring the supply never runs out plus the price can not be beat ! As for flavor , it 's very smooth , not acidic , just perfect . Just the way a good cup of coffee should be . I 'm no coffee expert , but know what I like . Senseo Dark Roast is too bitter , the Medium Roast is a tad too light , but this is just right . Highly recommend it to anyone looking for a full - bodied , consistently flavorful cup of joe .
5 #### I love shopping Amazon for my Senseo coffee pods . You always have a great selection , the price is right , and it is delivered to my door ! ! This was the first time I tried the Kona coffee and it is delicious . Thanks for the great service , as usual ! !
5 #### What a great way to get your coffee ... When I travel and return the first thing I want when I walk in the door is my cup of dark roast senseo coffee .
5 #### Out of the five coffee 's I use in the morning , I like this one the best . I also use the dark , espresso , the world mix and I 've tried the coffee duck ( it makes a mess ) . The breakfast blend is always reliable .
4 #### Coffee pods are not the cheapest way to make coffee and they are increasingly hard to find and can be expensive . We like them because we can make one or two cups at a time . These Senseo pods are the best decafe coffee pods we have tried but still not as good a regular brewed cup of restaurant decafe coffee . We buy and use the Senseo pods but have a Home Cafe double cup coffee machine . We do n't have the Senseo machine . The Home Cafe pods are next to imposable to find and more expensive . The Senseo pods work fine , and as stated here make a decent cup of coffee . In addition Amazon is the best place to buy these pods . We checked a lot of on - line sources and no one we found beats their price . Plus they frequently offer free shipping when you buy them in the case quantity . The other types of Senseo pods we tried , the regular and flavored coffees are good as well . We recommend that you try the Senseo brand pods , and purchase them from Amazon .
5 #### If you like a stong cup of coffee , then this is n't your Senseo pod . However , I love a medium roast with a little bit of a bite to it and Breakfast Blend is just that . I enjoy this cup of coffee each morning with a splash of a flavored coffee creamer . The best !
5 #### If you have a senseo pod coffee maker , this product is a must . It is delcious , fast and no waste .
5 #### I love these Coffee Pods ! If you 're into Heavy Cream , Heavy Sugar , Heavy Coco & foam in your coffee , you may not care . Smells wonderful , tastes even better . With the Senso Coffee Maker you can have a Cup of this great tasting coffee in about 1 Min . If you 're into the above mentioned Fu Fu additives any coffee will do . After this item being unavailable for a very long time , I assumed they had stopped making it . I was overjoyed to receive a notice from Amazon.com that it was again available , so I immediately placed my order . I was dissappointed to learn that I wo n't be receiving my order for a month . Oh well it 's the Very Best , so if I must wait a month I WILL .
5 #### This is my favorite coffee . It has a great flavor and when bought through Amazon.com , it is cheaper than in the grocery store ! Great taste , great price --- excellent combination .
5 #### I have tried numerous coffees , pods , and K - cups . Amongst all the coffee pods for the Senseo machine , the Kona blend is by far the richest , tastiest and most complex coffee I have tried . It is simply wonderful . Highly recommended .
5 #### The Paris Bistro is my 2nd favorite flavor for Senseo . It 's a nice , mild flavor that does well for a late afternoon pickemup . I 've enjoyed Senseo in Europe for years on my visits there and waited till finally , it was available here . I get my regular Douwe Egberts coffee at a local European Deli , only one in the Dallas / Ft . Worth metroplex that carries it ( Henks ) . I think Americans expect stronger flavors in their coffee than the Europeans . This is mildly flavored , just the right touch .
5 #### This is the best coffee I have ever had . I love Senseo pods . My seller was excellent from packaging to mailing . 5 Star ! !
5 #### This coffee is the best I have ever had . My seller sent it perfectly packaged and very promptly . 5 Star treatment ! !
3 #### The Senseo coffee maker produces excellent coffee provided one uses third party pods rather than Senseo pods . I strongly prefer Fratello , Millstone or Halo pods which seem to have richer , more robust flavors . The Senseo pods generally produce weak coffee , in part because they do not contain enough coffee . The above brands all fit in the Senseo maker despite containing more coffee in each pod . The Senseo Espresso pods are only ok , better than some Senseo pods .
5 #### We were among the first owners of a free Senseo coffeemaker way back like 10 or more years ago . We have a white machine in our laundryroom & then bought my husband a black one for work . Soooooooo I guess you could say we looooooove this coffee / method of making it , & medium roast is the best . I recently saw Douwe Egberts non - pod coffee @ a local gourmet shop & it was like $ 9 something for 12 oz ! Good to know one can get the coffee to use in a regular drip pot as well , however , @ that price , I guess we will just continue to have this as " treat coffee " via our machine . All this being said , I would like to say that @ both Target & Walmart here in Buffalo , NY area stores , I can get the pods for $ 4.24 each . However , when Target in particular , wants to rotate stock , they mark it down to the wonderful price of $ 4 ! ! ! ! ! Needless to say , I buy them out , go to another store & do the same . That 's almost $ 4 less for 6 bags than Amazon sells it for ! ! ! ! I encourage all of you Senseoholics to do the same & check out the above mentioned stores . I wish Amazon would stop reminding me it 's so cheap , when they do n't mark it down to Target 's level .
5 #### The dark roast is my favorite Senseo coffee ! The price has gone up in the local grocery stores , so buying it online from Amazon has actually been cheaper . You just ca n't beat that .
3 #### Senseo Espresso pads make a decent cup of coffee but I would n't call it espresso . I appreciate the fact the pods are strong enough to make a decent cup of regular coffee and I admit I did not expect the pods to make the thick , rich cup of espresso I 'm used to making with an old stove top maker . This is fine for what it is , but it 's not espresso .
5 #### Genuinely the SWEETEST tomatoes for sauce . I like it even more than the discontinued Progresso brand that I used for 30 years . So fresh and bright . Truly delicious . All San Marzano Tomatoes are NOT equal ! Trust me ! I bought this brand from an Italian market and spent quite some time afterwards trying to remember which store I had found it at and ended up hunting La Bella down online . It is not in local supermarkets . You wo n't be disappointed .
4 #### The flavor is very good , but the tomatoes are very , very soft and fall apart with just a gentle touch . This is OK , I suppose , when you 're making sauce , which is why I buy Italian tomatoes anyway . For sauce making , I also like the fact that Italian tomatoes are packed in puree for shipment to the U.S.A. ( I understand that this is done to reduce or avoid tariffs . ) The resulting sauces are thick , rich , bright red and scrumptious . For soups , I prefer tomatoes packed in juice . I 've used 5 of the 12 cans that I bought , and I have n't found a basil leaf yet . Not a big deal , really . I 'm still going to try other brands before settling on a favorite .
5 #### Good product . The tomatoes are not sour very sweet to the taste , as they should be . It makes a very good gravy .
5 #### Good price , good quality . Will buy again . A staple in my pantry . Love these sweet San Marzano Tomatoes !
4 #### Shipping the only negative to ALL the SAN MARZANO tomatoes for sale , flavor very good want to try to grow them and can . If not will be shopping for more .
3 #### Package arrived almost devastated . Cans were dented . Not true San Marco toms , but not validated from that region . I worked with them , but they were n't the real thing . Rather bitter .
5 #### Why buy coffee in a store ? What 's the point . You can get it here so much cheaper , pay not shipping , never run out .... I 'm in coffee heaven .
5 #### The other reviewer made an error . He loved the stuff and gave it one star . Duh ! It 's wonderful coffee . The flavor is great . I love the delivery service - it 's cheaper than buying it in the store . You ca n't use double coupons any more , so why pay retail ? I love the senseo coffee blends . Breakfast blend is my fave !
5 #### I use one ' Espresso ' on top of one ' Dark Roast ' for a great cup of coffee .
5 #### if the house catches fire , I will grab my husband , amnimals and senseo . I love the french vanilla coffee pods . I use one pod and select the 2 cup option as I do n't like strong coffee . You will instantly fall in love with the foam that is on top of the coffee . Use fat free/ carb free vanilla creamer and you have a mighty tasty cup of coffee ! ! ! !
5 #### We drink Senseo Douwe Egberts coffee in my house every day . I usually use one pod for my morning coffee , and a " double " on the weekend . While I like all the varieties , medium roast is my favorite . We buy it by the 4 - pack case in my house . The coffee has good body and is not bitter . I take mine with cream and sugar , but it is so easy to drink I could even go without and it still tastes great to me . The pod system is so clean and easy too . I love the fact that there is no cleanup . I think it would work especially well for someone who does nt normally drink coffee but would like to have something nice when guests come over . Because the pods come in small lined bags , it stays fresh longer .

5 #### We have totally enjoyed our Senseo Coffee Maker . It is quick and very tasty ! While my husband enjoys the Decaf Pods , I am in love with the Sumatra Pods . The flavor is robust and full . A true cup of coffee . Maybe not be as strong as Starbuck 's , but you will receive a very good cup of coffee using the Sumatra Pod .
3 #### This is only okay . I prefer other pod coffees , but I usually buy coffee beans and grind my own coffee and use the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/CoffeeDuck - the - Refillable - Filter - Senseo - Pod - Coffee - Machines / dp / B0012G86W0 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">CoffeeDuck , the Refillable Filter Senseo Pod Coffee Machines</a>&nbsp;with my Senseo . It 's a lot cheaper . But , if you like the froth on top of your coffee the CoffeeDuck does n't give you any . And the cleanup is a little messier .
5 #### Great product at reasonable price ; hope to find it again at an evern better price .
5 #### I 've owned a Senseo machine for three or four years , and I generally like most of their coffees . This breakfast blend is particularly good . Though I do n't much like the pretentious phrasing one sees in reviews by experts , I can say that the breakfast blend is just a bit more robust than the ordinary medium roast , but a bit less than the dark roast . It 's a great coffee to have with a breakfast roll while you 're reading the paper . I learned by experimenting that one breakfast blend pod and one decaf medium roast pod make a very good cup of " half - caf " for those who are prone to the caffeine jitters if they drink regular coffee . In summary , the breakfast blend pods combine the convenience of the Senseo system with a very good morning coffee . One bit of advice : If you use Amazon 's " subscribe and save " system , you can save a considerable amount of money on Senseo pods . You get 15 % off of the regular price and free shipping ; the net savings on a 4 - bag box of the breakfast blend is about $ [ ... ] .
5 #### First time I tried Sumatra in a large order from Amazon and I was not disappointed . I read the reviews before selection and was encouraged to try this blend . When I grind Sumatra beans for a drip coffee maker it is stronger . This Pod - style Sumatra blend is not too strong and should please most coffee drinkers . Very satisfactory - will probably stick with this selection for future purchases . The quick and easy brewing using Senseo is so great for people on the run - or too sleepy to grind and brew . Tastes great from first sip to bottom of cup !
5 #### Senseo is the best home made coffee ever , thank god I found this machine and these coffee pods absolutely the best cup of coffee you will ever have I have been using the senseo machine and pods for the last three years and would n't be without the machine or this particular coffee try it you will be amazed at the great taste
5 #### We got our Senseo coffee maker through a promotion . I had always wanted to try it out . I purchased a variety of coffee pods and my husband and I tried them out . We have yet to be disappointed . We love it so much , we have told several people about the Senseo and they have gotten them as well . This is a wonderful product and we waste a lot less coffee using the pods instead of making a pot of coffee . In fact , I think we drink a lot more coffee we want to try all the varieties of the Senseo coffee pods . Pair the pods with The Barista Blend flavor packs , sit back and enjoy .
5 #### I 'm a heavy coffee drinker , so this 6 - bag box is ideal for a month 's usage for me ( I even supplement ) . The Senseo Hazelnut is the best coffee I 've tried , dollar for dollar , and I hope it continues to be produced !
3 #### I like the Senseo coffee machine and believe that it can make very good coffee . However , I have been disappointed with the Senseo coffee pods that are made in Belgium by Douwe Egberts . The pods are not individually wrapped and the coffee often does not taste fresh . The pods also contain too little coffee which results in a weak , watery brew . The flavored Senseo French Vanilla Caramel Bistro Coffee Pods seem to me to be better than most Senseo blends that I have tried . In general , I prefer to buy pods from Timothy 's World Coffee . The Timothy pods contain almost twice as much coffee as the Senseo pods and the resulting coffee is superior , in my view . I have found that the Timothy pods will work well in the Senseo machine if the pod is moistened and smoothed before latching the lid . I use the single pod holder and make a 4 ounce cup . If you must use the Senseo pods made by Douwe Egberts , try this blend .
5 #### We love it for 3 o'clock coffee like we make in the Senseo now ( we prefer Lipton green tea in the AM as less letdown , see my review for&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Lipton - Green - Tea - Mandarin - Orange - Premium - Pyramid - Tea - Bags-20 - Count - Boxes - Pack - of-6 / dp / B000EM6PS0 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Lipton Green Tea , Mandarin Orange , Premium Pyramid Tea Bags , 20 - Count Boxes ( Pack of 6)</a>&nbsp;for a nice recipe for a pot ) .

5 #### We purchased a Senseo coffee machine shortly after my son " borrowed " my Bunn coffee maker in March with the promise to get his own as he strolled out the door . Since I was the only person in the household drinking coffee regularly anymore instead of buying another Bunn and wasting half a pot of coffee every time I made a fresh pot of coffee , I thought I should at least look at the single cup coffee makers . I then promptly set off on a mission to find the coffee that " rocked my boat " given the fact that I was a sworn dunkin donut coffee drinker for years . I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees in general although they are nice to have on occassion , so I tried all of the Senseo coffees and eventually found that the Kenya Blend was the best of the lot given my individual taste for coffees . And then they came out with the breakfast blend . This makes a superb cup of coffee and it has effectively ended my murmurings for Dunkin Donut to get on board with Senseo and make a pod coffee just for the Senseo . Well ... maybe that is a slight exaggeration . I would still like Dunkin Donuts to team with Senseo and make a pod coffee but that only because I would like to have two superb coffee pods to chose from with one being the Senseo Breakfast Blend .
5 #### November 1st , 2013 edited I really wish that the Subscribe & Save will be re - introduced for this product . So many time it was unavailable and one had to order in the last minute another brand . PLEASE AMAZON , bring back a RELIABLE S&S system to your loyal customers . Thanks so much !
4 #### I love the convenience of Senseo pods -- pop 'em in , fill the water tank , and press the start button . The dark roast is my favorite , but I wish Senseo would come out with a French roast and other darker , richer varieties . I know there 's a Senseo espresso now , but it requries purchasing an espresso pod holder , so I have n't tried it yet . Perhaps it would work in my regular two - pod holder if I used one espresso pod and one dark roast pod ... haven't tried it yet . That works with other pod brands that I sometimes use with the Senseo pods -- one of each in the two - pod holder . I tried Senseo Sumatra , but did n't go back ; less satisfying than the dark roast . We go through six to eight Senseo pods daily at my house , so I take advantage of the handy automatic order process through Amazon . I love serving Senseo dark roast coffee to guests . They 're always impressed by the foamy head and fresh - made taste and aroma . It 's good coffee , but I sure would like more darker , stronger varieties .
5 #### Love the smell and the non - bitter taste of these richly satifying pods . Much prefer over traditional coffee but only makes two cups , which is okay ; just need to know !
4 #### My wife and I each have one cup of coffee each morning before we leave for work . We 've had a Senseo maker now for about 4 years . We have found that the Dark Roast coffee makes a very rich , flavorful cup of coffee . Much better than any drip maker . We both use two pods and make a double cup for both of us . It 's a great help to getting us going in the morning . It is n't cheap but we feel it 's worth it . We buy the coffee from Amazon or Target ( when they have any ) .
5 #### I use this for a gorgonzola pear champagne vinegar dressing and it taste amazing ! Would buy this product again as not in stock typically at typical supermarket
4 #### its a little pricy but definitely worth the price.i made a chive blossom mix with it and had a hard time trying to find it but as usual amazon had it and delivered in 2 days .
5 #### Great taste I made dill pickles with it fantastic ; would purchase again . Many thanks , I could not find in stores around me at all ...
5 #### We tried all the flavors of pods and like these the best . These are full flavored and rich .
5 #### This is the way I like my coffee . Dark , strong with a good flavor and aroma . This is the only pod that I buy for my Senseo and Bunn . Perfect for me .
5 #### I get more for my money with this Dark blend . I use it as a single and a half , its great ! ! I use the pod and then open the top turn the pod over after the single cup is done lock the top and press the single button again for a few more ounces , then press stop ! I get 6 ounces for a GREAT TASTE !
4 #### This produces a decent cup of java . Nothing spectacular , but worth drinking . It 's a mild flavor but the vanilla is most prominent in the scent , not the taste .
5 #### In Hilo Hawaii , the choice is maybe three vinegars at best . Thanks for delicious salads one again
5 #### Love this product and could n't seem to find it at the grocery store . Of course , Amazon to the rescue . Use this for fresh salad dressing with a little light oil . Yum .
2 #### I 'd been using a more expensive citrus champagne vinegar but decided to give this brand a try . Although it was well packed and arrived quickly , to me it tastes like any white wine vinegar and is more acidic than I expected . Would not buy again .
1 #### If this was called " Medium Roast " , I would give it 4 stars . It 's a good coffee . But this is called French Vanilla Caramel , and this review is based on the product 's name . Let me say that vanilla and caramel are perhaps my favorite flavors ... coffee , ice cream , candy , you name it ... if it 's vanilla or caramel , I love it . With the exception of this . Where 's the vanilla ? Where 's the caramel ? And do n't get me wrong : I 'm not trying to say that the flavors are too mild . I 'm saying that they are NON - EXISTENT . And therefore , based on the name , this coffee gets 1 star .
5 #### I 've tried most of the Senseo pods ... if you like a really rich , bold flavor and aroma , Sumatra is far and away the best ! In fact , you can make a much better version of French Vanilla by flavoring this blend yourself than by buying the French Vanilla flavor , which really lacks much vanilla flavor at all . And this is the ONLY one in which I can make 6 oz per pod and still end up with decent coffee . ( Still better to stick to 4oz / pod IMHO . )
5 #### I ca n't say Senseo is equal to starbucks , but , I love my morning Dark Roast and some of the flavors in the afternoon with a snack or dessert . A quality porduct .
5 #### I ca n't say Senseo is equal to starbucks , but , I love my morning Dark Roast and some of the flavors in the afternoon with a snack or dessert . A quality porduct .
5 #### Since I have had my Senseo coffee maker , I would rather go without than drink anything else .
4 #### When freshly brewed , this is my favorite coffee . However , it does repeatedly get an after - taste when it cools or sits .
5 #### My husband 's favorite coffee ! If you like a dark , french roast- you 'll like this one , plus it has the terrific Senseo creamy foam on top ! A nice way to start the morning or finish off a great evening meal .
4 #### The Senseo coffee is a great easy alternative to the regular american coffee , virtually no clean - up or maintenance . Do n't give it a 5 because it is far from a perfect espresso and a little pricey .
5 #### Love this coffee ... a nice , smooth , robust cup of coffee with no bitterness . And signing up for Amazon 's subscription / automatic shipping program is one of the smartest things I 've ever done . It 's not only convenient , but it saves me money and time ... I get 4 bags sent to my door for what 3 bags would cost in the supermarket , and I do n't have to go there and back for them either . Works for me !
5 #### I 'm not going to talk about the quality of the coffee ; after all , that 's an entirely subjective opinion that 's impossible to form from reading reviews . ( For the record , I like Senseo coffee , including this medium roast decaf variety . ) However , if you decide to buy this , you should definitely consider signing up for the subscription service . Here 's why : First , the price is discounted 15 % from the regular Amazon price , and the shipping is free , even if the order does n't meet the normal $ 25 threshold . In my area , I almost never see Senseo pods in stores for less than $ 4.50 , even on sale , so the subscription - discounted Amazon price represents a significant saving . Second , you can adjust ( or cancel ) your subscription at any time-- even after only one shipment . When you sign up , you 'll get an e - mail explaining where to look on your account page for the subscription options . So , at an interval of your choosing , a package of coffee pods will arrive , discounted 15 % than the normal Amazon price in effect at that time and shipped for free . Your credit card wo n't be charged until each shipment date , and you can cancel at any time . Life is good .
4 #### The entire Senseo line has proven to be of consistent quality - and you ca n't beat the convenience of being able to brew a demi - tasse or full cup of joe fresh on demand in under three minutes ! Our office is hooked .
4 #### Good but Folgers version is significantly better tastewise and so far amazon does n't carry it . Good price though , and I like the free shipping -- which I 'm not certain will last . Having a huge supply of these on hand makes it 's hard to make coffee any other way though ! ! This is just sooo easy !
5 #### Great prices for this very special product ! I purchased the Senseo coffeemaker / large water container & refillable pods from Amazon last year and we have been very pleased ! The ease of ordering the coffee pods , along with the good prices , will keep us customers of Amazon.com ! ! !

5 #### I recently sent for a Senseo Coffee Pod maker on a very good deal , & was looking here to get the pods . I read a lot of the reviews , & was looking foward to getting them here , plus this brand sounds like it would be to my taste . However , they apparently do n't ship to Alaska ! At least it said they do n't ship to my location , & since I have gotten other items from Amazon , I assume it 's the Alaska location . How disappointing , after reading so many great reviews . Just had to vent a bit . I enjoyed the reviews , though , they really are a help , good & not - so - good .
5 #### Recently tried the Senseo hazelnut coffee pods . What a treat . My friends really enjoy having a cup of this coffee . With a dab of of whipped cream on the top , it is perfect .
3 #### You need to use distilled water w/ these . The flavor is not the best if you use tap water . Even w/ purified and distilled water , NOT the best flavor . However , super quick to make in the morning for a single cup . Do not toss out your high end coffee maker and bean grinder . For the morning , or for the one person at a get togeather who wants coffee , yes , not bad .
5 #### Hands down the best coffee on the market . Better than any $ 4 coffee beverage from Starbucks . The Senseo machine even makes foam on the top automatically ! If you are a coffee afficiando , do n't waste time grinding beans and making whole fresh pots of coffee constantly , just get one of these machines and buy these coffee pods !
4 #### In a word , no Senseo coffees are great but Columbia and Sumatra ( after many tries ) are my two favorites and are recommended .
5 #### I 've had a Senseo for several months . I have tried several coffee blends , and find that I enjoy the dark roast the most .
5 #### I love this dark roast coffee ! I am not the type of person who buys coffee at coffee shops and such , I just like one cup every morning . This coffee has a nice aroma and rich with a slightly bitter flavor ( which is what I like ) .
4 #### i like to mix this with sumatra blend , makes nice with international coffee creamer , hazelnut .
5 #### I 've been buying Senseo since I first had it in a casino about two years ago . It has a nice smooth flavor -- not like some of those popular overroasted " burnt " tasting products . I 'm buying this on Amazon 's subscription plan and will continue for awhile . My first order was offered at a wonderful price ( a teaser ? ) , but the last two orders have been comparable to what I would pay at the supermarket . I do like the convenience , however , of having it delivered to my door because it is not always in stock at the supermarket and I hate having to hunt down my favorite products .
4 #### I am very impressed with the Senseo coffee system . I have tried several of the coffees available and all are good , especially the Vienna . Its not as rich as the Bold roasts of Starbucks but its still an awesome cup of Brew . The Dark roast is quite rich and aromatic . Try it , you 'll like it .
5 #### I love this coffee and the Senseo Coffee Machine . The machine brews fast and the pods are delicious , easy , and clean . Dark or medium roast for the morning is a must have eye opener , and capuccino is a great afternoon treat .
2 #### I wanted to try a flavored coffee pod for my Senseo machine . I purchased hazelnut and was disappointed that I could n't taste any hazelnut flavor at all ! It does n't taste bad , but it tastes just like regular coffee with no hint of hazelnut . What 's with that ?
5 #### My husband loves this hazelnut senseo .... he uses it absolutely every day , so buying it in quantity from Amazon is great . I would say the french vanilla tops this one , but just by a hair.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Senseo - Paris - French - Vanilla - Bistro - Coffee - Pods-16 - Count - Packages - Pack - of-4 / dp / B0007NOWMM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Senseo Paris French Vanilla Bistro Coffee Pods , 16 - Count Packages ( Pack of 4)</a><a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Senseo - Vienna - Hazelnut - Waltz - Coffee - Pods-16 - Count - Packages - Pack - of-4 / dp / B0007NOWMW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Senseo Vienna Hazelnut Waltz Coffee Pods , 16 - Count Packages ( Pack of 4)</a >
5 #### Senseo Paris French Vanilla Coffee pods are easy to use and easy to clean up . The pods brew a very flavorful cup of coffee . French Vanilla is one of my favorites .
5 #### The Senseo pods are easy to use and brew a strong but very pleasant cup of coffee . Hazelnut Waltz is one of my favorites .
5 #### We normally brew a full pot of coffee in our home each morning as there are enough coffee drinkers to make it worthwhile . But in the afternoon , sometimes one of us wants a cup and it is not worthwhile to brew another pot or grind up the beans to make a smaller pot . That 's what we have our Senseo for . We keep a couple different kinds of pods around to suit various tastes , and this one suits mine . These are a little stronger , and more full - bodied than the basic medium roast Senseo pods , yet the flavor is not quite as acidic as their dark roast pods . I use one pod for a " double " serving ( the button with the 2 cups ) , which is ( I know ) not the recommended way , but I still seem to get good results . If I happen to be making one first thing in the morning and need a little more strength , I will use 2 pods and press the double first , and then the single to get a slightly larger and stronger cup .
5 #### I wanted something a little stronger than the Dark Roast Pods and found that the Senseo Sumatra Blend Coffee Pods fill the bill ! It is a wonderfully strong coffee flavor that is very smooth . I recommend it if you are looking for a deeper coffee flavor .
4 #### Senseo pods always have an amount of coffee close to the minimum acceptable . These are no exception . That being said , this is the finest coffee that Douve Egberts have ever put into Senseo pods . I 'll be using these almost exclusively from now on .
5 #### This is much better than trying to find the pods at the grocery store ! And cost is less , too ! We have really enjoyed our Senseo ( also purchased from Amazon ! )
5 #### Of all the senseo products this is the best i 've tasted , so far i use 2 at a time and crem - brule coffee mate . this is very good .
5 #### My husband said this is the best coffee he 's ever tasted , and he should know , first thing in the morning ..... coffee , during the day .... coffee , and before bed ....... yep , coffee ...... it is a good coffee i think for myself .
1 #### I tried these with my JV / Melita Pod unit and they produced bland , unexceptional coffee . Considering they cost the equivalent of about $ 20 a pound , you might expect more , but it is just ordinary java .
4 #### I love this coffee ! It brews very well in the Senseo coffee maker . The reason I can not give this 5 stars is the high price .
4 #### Also this coffee can be purchased at Target for $ 3.99
5 #### I bought this coffee pot because I go to work very early and to make a whole pot would be a waste . Now we are spoiled and only drink Senseo coffee . We like the dark roast , we use one pod and make two cups . I was having a very hard time finding the pods in the supermaket and was happy to find it at Amazon - the price is great and its shipped directly to my home .
4 #### Senseo Douwe Egbert Coffee , including regular , decaffeinated , and flavored , is delicious ! A bit on the strong side , but rich in flavor . The foam on top adds to its enjoyment . Just wish that the coffee required only one pod and would brew a large mug .
5 #### This is the BEST coffee for those who like flavored coffee . I was hooked on the first cup . But to my disappointed Amazon is out of stock now . So when will they get it back in stock ? I ordered direct from Senseo but with shipping and their price it was not a savings . I will be first in line when Amazon decides to sell it again .
4 #### All right , we today became beneficiaries of a free coffee maker from Senseo , thanks to a generous tip from a favorite of my Amazon friends . But this brand of coffee packets that came with the machine is nothing to write home about . At retail , the packs cost about 23 cents , if we order enough to avoid shipping charges . The smell of this fresh - brewed coffee is fantastic . The taste is less than I had hoped for . I think I 'll try Target 's Archer Farms , as suggested by another reviewer .
2 #### Recently I ended up trying out the Senseo system , and I tried it with the Douwe Egberts medium roast pods . Normally I drink cold - brewed Toddy coffee , and even though I 'm sensitive to bitterness and acid levels in coffee , I can drink that with just dairy , no sugar . I immediately needed quite a bit of sugar for this coffee -- and then I had to start drinking half my usual amount of coffee . It was so bitter I almost could n't drink it . It was so acidic it made my stomach hurt . And it was so caffeinated I got the shakes that first time . The problem was , I had no idea if this was a result of the Senseo process ( the Toddy 's cold - brew method does result in a less bitter , less acidic , less caffeinated coffee than normal ) or the coffee brand . So , I ordered the EcoPad refillable pods ( 2 to a pack , very inexpensive ) and tried it with the same coffee I use with the Toddy . It tasted slightly weak , oddly ; however , it was enough for me to realize that the main problem was the Douwe Egberts coffee . If you really love the harsher Starbucks types of coffees , which I do n't , I think you 'll enjoy it . But if you have acid stomach problems or just do n't like bitter coffee , I do not recommend using DE medium roast coffee pods with your Senseo .
4 #### If you like your Senseo coffee strong , then you have one choice , as all other styles and flavors seem to brew up kinda weak . Many of my friends like a combo of one dark and one flavored .
5 #### If you like your coffee dark and flavorful , strong and smooth without bitterness , this is the right choice for the Senseo Coffeemaker . I have tried a number of substitutes and all have been disappointing .
5 #### My husband enjoys this full flavor of coffee , especially in the morning .
5 #### I really enjoy this flavor so much that I have to hide it from my husband when I am running low .
4 #### My husband actually did not like this flavor , but he is n't that big into Vanilla . However , my in - laws raved ! They may actually buy a Senseo based on trying ours . They did n't want to drink all of our coffee , but we said go ahead since my husband did n't like it . They must have had 3 cups each of this coffee , it was like they could n't get enough . I suggest that you actually try any Senseo flavor by buying one pack at the store first to see if you like the flavor . If you do , come back to Amazon and order in bulk to save you money . $ 3.84 at Walmart for a package of 10 pods = .38 each . Here it is only .25 a cup of coffee at the current price .
5 #### We got our first Senseo during their Drop the Drip online promotion in December . My husband loved the coffee , especially the Medium Roast . We ended up buying another Senseo for him to use at work . I do n't drink coffee , so this was the perfect solution . No more making a pot and tossing the rest . He can get a cup of joe or make two if he wants . The pods were a little pricey though ... at Walmart they average around $ 3.84 for 10 or .38 each . Buying bulk like this , it makes them .25 each at the current price of $ 17.96 . They come each in their own bag of 18 , so no worries about freshness . My Dad also got a Senseo via Drop the Drip and we just sent him some Medium Roast because he loves it too . It is a great gift for Senseo lovers . He lives in a small town and never thought to look to Amazon for his Senseo coffee needs ! I think when he runs out , he will be on Amazon looking to buy the multi - pack .
5 #### Really flavourful and tasty without being overpowering , or too strong . Faintly sweet too . Love it .
5 #### This is definitely a nice treat in the morning . Not too strong , slightly sweet undertones . I definitely recommend it !
4 #### I like this one a bit more than the medium roast . More robust , not great but good enough .
3 #### I like this coffee , it 's good but not the best . Ease of use is a big factor in pod based coffees , hopefully one day the better makers get involved . I 've tried Yuban and this equates albeit a little weaker .
5 #### The Vienna Hazelnut Waltz flavor is a delightful change when I 'm looking to put some pizzazz into my day . The flavor is delightful and not too strong .
1 #### Flat coffee taste , artificial vanilla , blah . Of all the pods I 've tried in my Senseo , these are the worst .
5 #### Every so often , the Hazelnut is out of stock , so I have purchased other brands and have been disappointed every time . I 've learned my lesson ; from now on , I 'll wait for the Senseo Hazelnut ! It 's the perfect strength and flavor .
5 #### Why buy your Senseo pods at the grocery store when you can get them from Amazon @ a much lower price and , if you order $ 25 or more , they 're shipped free ! I buy 4 boxes at a time , and because they 're vacuum - sealed , they 're all fresh down to the last one .
5 #### This coffee is the best we ever found in the USA . Of course we have also the Philips - Senseo coffe - maker . WE LOVE IT !
5 #### I switch between the dark roast and medium roast . I think that both make a great cup of coffee . This is definately the easiest system to use and really makes cleanup a snap .
5 #### What more can be said ? Good , clean , full bodied ... it sounds like a commercial . It 's so good that , I 'm sorry to say , even my kids like it .
5 #### After spending 2 weeks in the Netherlands last year , I was hooked on Douwe Egberts coffee and found one place in all of Dallas / Ft . Worth that sold it . Finally ! America gets Senseo ! The coffee I woke up to for 2 weeks and loved . The medium and dark roast are my favorites . Douwe Egbert is excellent coffee . Once you 've tasted this high quality Dutch coffee , you 'll never go back to American / Columbian nor that burnt stuff sold in those bookstores . Hopefully prices for the coffee will come down . For now , it 's cheaper for my friend to ship me Senseo coffee from Holland ( package of 18 pads there is less than 2 Euro ) than to buy it here in the States or online . Now I will celebrate SENSEO DAY , the day I received my Senseo machine ( tho it arrived without the free coffee cups ) every year !
5 #### It was exactly what I thought I was ordering . I liked that the ascorbic acid came in a closed container ( bottle ) which had a reclosable lid .
5 #### Barry Farms ascorbic acid is used exclusively around my house for food prep and canning needs . It works great , and I would not have the success I do when prepping apples and potatoes without it . It is essential .
5 #### This has such a delicious nutty flavor with a hint of corn . It tops anything very well . I have a 20 month old daughter and she likes it too . If given to a toddler make sure to accompany it with water . It does tend to stick to teeth and the roof of the mouth as a person enjoys this by the spoonful . It does n't bother me , but with kids it 's different . They might like it but once they ca n't get it down right they 'll spit it out . So putting it in food like cereal or in milk helps . We usually mix applesauce + oatmeal + this wheat germ + rice cereal for her and she eats ok . It 's a bit of a struggle with kids sometimes , but on good days it 's down in 20 minutes every morning . Every kid is different though so please use your own judgement .
5 #### Great and healthy product . I add it to all recipes made from white flour .
4 #### great work treat- mild to medium Espresso for drip- I have ordered it x 2 and share w friends
3 #### Not sure what it is , but the taste of this is n't quite as good as other brands that I use in my Moka pot . It is okay , but it does n't wow me.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Caffe - Kimbo - Espresso - Napoletano - Ground-8 - 8 - oz - can / dp / B0001FQUL2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Caffe Kimbo Espresso Napoletano ( Ground ) - 8.8 oz can</a >
5 #### I admit to being a coffee snob - and this one is incredible ! I was introduced to this coffee by friends from Naples , Italy and since then nothing else comes close !
5 #### Just right , great coffee smell and it is not bitter or burnt tasting . I use it in my espresso pot and in my k cups .
5 #### Great marzipan ! Just full of the Almond paste taste I remember . Thanks for sendind .
5 #### Well priced product . Tastes delicious . It was a real treat at Christmas in our home
5 #### bought for a friend and he like so I guess the product was good and fresh .
4 #### This can not compete with home made authentic European marzipan made in the store where you buy it , but it is above average , for sure .
1 #### I was very disappointed in these candies - very dry and grainy . I suspect they were very old . Pretty to look at , but not so pretty in the mouth .
5 #### We get this every year for my mom for Christmas and it does n't usually last the whole day ! ! She loves them and they are quite pretty candies .
5 #### Biermann marzipan seems to be the most easily available to the masses , and so far it is the best I have had . Just make sure , if you can , that the package is not ancient . Old marzipan is ... well ... bad ...
3 #### I 'm a long time fan of Biermann marzipan candies and when I bought a box the other day , I was disappointed with the taste and wondered if they changed their recipe since last year . While the candies were fresh ( not dried out ) , the almond taste was n't very noticeable and they had a bit of a tang to them . I probably wo n't buy this brand again unless they go back to making it with a strong almond flavor like it had before .
5 #### I love the product but also love 2 different seasoned salt items < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Herbamare - Original-1Kg-2 - 2LB - Brand - Vogel / dp / B0002DU87U / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Herbamare Original ( 1Kg=2.2LB ) Brand : Vogel</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/A - Vogel - Herbamare - Herb - Seasoning - Salt - Organic-35 - 3 - Ounce - Container / dp / B000E3E17Q / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">A. Vogel Herbamare Herb Seasoning Salt , Organic , 35.3 - Ounce Container</a>&nbsp;plus a Sazon and together they 're too salty so I solve that by mixing half of this and half of some Bob 's Red Mill GF flour . Less wheat for the allergic and no salt , that way I get to introduce other spicing to this and do my own flavor . I flour everything with this and yes indeed it flies off the shelves at Netgrocer too so I am so glad Amazon has it and in the bigger box .
5 #### I purchased this flour at the commissary and was a little skeptical since it was pre - seasoned .... I thought it might be too salty , but BOY WAS I WRONG ! ! ! It is the best I 've ever tried on chicken , pork chops , and I even made fried okra with it and it was the best ever ! I 'm glad Amazon stocks this item just in case we ever have to move , I 'll know I can always get it here !
5 #### the aroma , body , and flavors in this sauce make it an extrordinay . Much like a fine wine . And you get that spice .
2 #### Two stars because I ordered it on March 20 , 2016 and the expiration date is MAY 24 , 2016 .
5 #### This hot sauce is delicious in marinades and ramen noodles .
5 #### trying this on a friends recommendation , not readily available in my small town
5 #### did n't buy it here but used it to make chicken fried steak . amazing , delicious , flavorful . wow ! !
3 #### This dredge is OK . I had to add seasonings to it . I do n't think I would buy this again .
5 #### My favorite all purpose hot sauce of all time
5 #### Its funny , maybe 10 years ago I used to buy this all the time . Then the one hot sauce shop I bought it at closed and I more or less forgot about it . Was having a conversation and it came up among the " really hot hot sauces that still have a lot of flavor and taste " so I ordered some from Amazon . Glad I did !
5 #### Tasty but a bit too salty for my taste !
4 #### Excellent flavor for breading chicken and chops -- might want to dilute it with some all - purpose flour though ...
2 #### I did not find this seasoning very tasty , and falls far short of the KFC taste .
2 #### I had to doctor this flour a little to get a decent taste from it . Otherwise , it tastes like confetti fried onto a corncob .
3 #### After reading some Great Reviews I decided to get a Box of the Seasoned Flour , even though it was very Pricey $ 10.05 that 's what I paid for a 10 Ounce Box , ... It better be Good ! ... well , it was n't , I did not care for it , I make much Better Seasoned Flour Mixes than this . Kentucky Kernel Seasoned Flour does n't have much of a taste even though on the Box it says that it has 10 Herbs and Spices , the List of Ingredients : Enriched and Bleached Wheat Flour ( niacin , iron , thiamine , riboflavin folic acid ) Salt , Natural Spices , Extracts and Herbs and Monosodium Glutamate . The Seasoned Flour is very Mild and did not Produced much of a Crispy Coat on my Fried Chicken . I am been very Generous with the Rating! ... Thank You D.D.
5 #### I love chicken , in fact it 's my favorite meat . Usually , I prepare my own coating for chicken , using a variety of seasonings , however I saw many good reviews for this product , and thought I would give it a chance . At first glance , I thought it was a KFC seasoning , or that it would taste similar . It does n't , so do n't expect it to . What it is though , is a fantastic assortment of seasonings blended together so well , that it produces one of the greatest flavors imaginable . The price is high , and after making the initial purchase and deciding to buy more , I scoured Amazon , to see if I could find a better deal . Which I did . I would suggest skipping this purchase , and just buying it in bulk here:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Hodgson - Mill - Seasoned - Flour - Economy - Size-22 - Ounce - Pack - of-4 / dp / B004OCIUDO / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Hodgson Mill Seasoned Flour , Economy Size , 22 - Ounce ( Pack of 4)</a > Over - all , the item is great , and improves not just chicken , but pork chops ! The only downside is , that I used to love my own special blend of spices , and now all I want to use is Kentucky Kernel .
5 #### The first thing I have to ask is , " Who in the world is paying $ 5 for this mix ? " I discovered it today in my local Stop and Shop and it was only $ 1.99 here in New Jersey . That being said , I have pretty much always used just flour , seasoned salt and other seasonings to fry chicken , pork chops and such and that 's worked for years . But I am so glad I found this seasoning . I wanted to duplicate a pork chop recipe I had at a restaurant where the pork chops were fried and then served with sauteed onions and jalapeno peppers . Well , it was just delicious . I repeat , DELICIOUS . If you 're lucky enough to find this mix for less than the $ 5 it 's listed at here , lucky for you . But at any price , it really is a truly marvelous seasoning mix to use for fried foods . And I agree with the others ; it 's not too salty at all . It 's just perfect . Use the pan drippings for a gravy and you 've got a tasty meal in a snap !
4 #### Dry desert lime is a very unusual , yet fascinating tea . The flavor is tart lime -- but a rich powdery lime like an old fashioned lime cordial . Something about the flavor reminds me of tonic and lime . There is also a slightly sulphrous aftertaste that far from being repulsive actually balances the tartness of the lime flavor . For when you want something out of the ordinary but do n't be surprised if you start craving it ! High in vitamin C. Numi gets points for their manufacturing process and packaging . The boxes containing their tea is made from 100 % recycled paperboard from 100 % post - consumer waste -- they assert that by using such packaging materials they save 2,040 trees , reduce landfill by 131,200 , and prevent 184,000 greenhouse emissions . Numi uses only 100 % natural ingredients without added oils or " natural flavorings " .
3 #### Ok . I love lime in savory dishes and in drinks as well . I love so many varieties of herbals and exotic tea blends . I 'm always trying new brands and flavors . But not this one . OMG it is so bitter , Sweetner makes it worse somehow . It smells heavenly but tastes like * * * * . Thrte 's more wrong here than bitter . And I celebrate bitterness as a legit flavor . But this stuff is foul . My husband on the other hand , who never drinks any type of tea and prefers lemon to lime , he loves this stuff ! He says the taste is great and that it works wonders when he is congested . To each his own . I wo n't buy it again . He saved this box from the trash .
5 #### I like to cook and this stuff is good . Do n't use too much and you should be pleased . It does n't seem to deteriorate in the fridge . I bought the chicken and vegetable versions , but have n't used them enough to comment yet .
5 #### This is hands down the best beef stock in the world . I have made my own stocks for many years and I do n't even come close to the flavor of this product . It makes the best soups . I put some in stews . I rub it on roasts . There is n't a single beef dinner that can not be improved by a bit of Minor 's Beef Base .
4 #### Great for making gravy and flavoring your pork for green Chili stew ! I divides it up into smaller containers and froze it for a later time .
5 #### Arguably the best beef base on the market . I was a chef for over 20 years , Minor 's flavor bases were standards of the industry for flavoring soups , stews , and sauces . This is the same Minor 's Beef Base I used when I was cooking professionally . This is a beef flavor base , not a beef bouillon , it tastes just like beef . Use it for soups , sauces , stews , anywhere you want to add beef flavor .
5 #### I searched everywhere for pork broth , but could only find pork gravy . Happy to have found this item .
5 #### Just tried this , and now ca n't live without it . It 's kind of expensive , but ask yourself how much you would pay for several pounds of pork bones , then to have someone roast them all in an oven , then to have someone make broth on a stovetop from the roasted bones . I use it for ramen -- we have a girlfriend who LOVES ramen , and could eat it every day in cold , blustery weather . It took me 3 weeks to learn how to make it ( not particularly being a ramen fan myself ) , but the best ramen has pork broth . I use a rounded tablespoon rather than a mere tablespoon .
5 #### Just delicious . I have used Minors restaurant products ( and this is the real deal ) for over a decade and never been disappointed - this is no exception . I do n't eat much meat , but at times I do want a pork flavor in a soup or a dish I am making - easy example is pork and beans or something like that . I can use this base for the flavor and say , 1/4 of the pork I would have used . A light pork flavor in mashed potatoes helps keep cooking inventive . The flavor is there , just not the meat . Wonderful in a stir fry , or in the water for rice , or quinoa . It 's nice to help jazz things up , and a little goes a long way . It will last for years in the freezer .
1 #### I do n't even want to give this one star .
5 #### Am never without it . Grocery store bouillons , bases , and cubes ca n't compare to the flavor of this .
5 #### Very good quality beef base . I use in place of chicken base in almost all my braises .
5 #### This stuff is so superior to the products you can buy in the grocery stores . I smear a tablespoon on a chuck roast and it makes all the difference in how much my family enjoys the dinner ...
4 #### PORK BASE , NOT HAM BASE , THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE ! TRY SOME OF THIS AND TASTE THE DIFFERENCE ! ! IT 'S WORTH HAVING ! !
5 #### I 've been having a hard time finding this in stores , so I bought it here . Good for any recipe that calls for beef broth , I use it all the time . A little goes a long way .
5 #### ... Very good tasting beef base . I wondered about the positive reviews and had to find out myself . Great for kicking up the flavor of soups , stews and casseroles . Good stuff ...
5 #### Hard to find a good pork base Very nice for sauces with pork based dishes
5 #### I have purchased this product before . It is especially good in pork noodles , on pork roasts & in soups , actually anything you desire pork flavor in .
5 #### What s not to like . Pork base , tastes great and is easy to use . I like this stuff as you put some in your whatever and you get a nice pork taste . All in all a very solid product that I will definitely buy again .
5 #### Arrived right on time . I 've been looking a long time for a good pork stock base to make congee . Made a batch as soon a I got this product . It is excellent '
5 #### great flavor addition to any recipe and no msg .. yeah !
5 #### Rather than frying pork chops or Italian sausage and then deglazing the pan for caramelized drippings(Maillard reaction ) just use this pork base to add meat flavor to your spaghetti sauce . It definitely adds great flavor to pasta e fagioli . As other reviewers have indicated , pork base is ( very ) hard to find . As the caramelization reaction naturally produces some MSG(intense meat flavor ) , criticism on this MSG thing is irrelevant . Just get it . It 's darn good and it 'll save you some money .
5 #### This , along with the Beef Au Jus that Minor 's makes all the difference is moist and succulent barbecue brisket .
5 #### my family 's favorite soup base to keep in fridge for quick noodle soups
5 #### I have used all Minor 's stock as my soup base when I am not cooking chicken or beef for a meal . It is an exceptional flavor base as good as anything that I make from scratch . Beef / Barley soup tastes just like the dripping from my prime rib . Neal
5 #### I 've been using the chicken base for quite a while now and decided to try the beef . Sure am glad I did - it really adds that little extra flavor boost when one does n't have the time to develop it for oneself . It helps a quick lunch soup ( the whatchamagot soup - clean up those leftovers that are still good but wo n't make a meal by themselves ) and adds depth to a stew , for example . As with most of these bases , they are on the salty side ( unless you order low sodium ) , so be careful until you get the salt content to your personal preference . It keeps beautifully in the refrigerator and as long as one always uses a clean spoon , there is no problem with mold or other unpleasantness . Good stuff !
5 #### We use this all the time and we love it ! We use it to make soup , for basting meat and have even used it to make au jus . It is the best beef base I have used with great beef flavor .
5 #### For some reason , none of the places where I have traditionally purchased this item have had it in stock for more than the last 6 months . I mean , this situation was getting to the critical mass stage as I was at the bottom of my last container . Amazon to the rescue ! This product is so very versatile that it has been a part of my culinary repertoire since culinary arts school , back in the 80s . Additionally , Minor 's chicken base and vegetable base are equally indispensable . When a recipe calls for beef broth or stock , this is a much better - tasting alternative when you do n't have the many hours necessary to make your own stock . I disagree that it 's hyper - salty . Used appropriately , reconstituted as indicated on the label , your product will not suffer from excessive saltiness . Certainly far less than bouillon cubes , which taste synthetic . This tastes almost as natural as if you had spent hours making stock yourself . It makes an epic French onion soup . Blend a tablespoon or more into your meatball or meatloaf mixture . Makes a quick and delicious au jus . I always add a bit , say 1 - 2 teaspoons , to even poultry based sauces , soups , and gravies to lend complexity to the flavors and to deepen the color . Rub it on steaks before grilling them . Rub on your prime rib before roasting . No one will know what that extra je - ne - sais - quoi secret is that makes it taste so heavenly .
5 #### This beef base is what I use for all of my beef soups stews and chili . So much better than powdered boullion !
5 #### The best beef base in the business , but ( at $ 16 ) seriously over - priced . The photo is a little deceptive , only 16 ounces ( a scant 2 cups ) .
5 #### Excellent quality , but be sure to use sparingly as it 's not like the other products out on the market ! I make soup every week and am delighted to have found this product .
5 #### I like the flavor of this . It 's a bit pricier than some of the others though . I switch between this and another product . Use them all the time .
5 #### Good stuff for soups and other dished need a boost in flavor .
3 #### ITS OKAY I EXPECTED BETTER . I THINK TONER IS A NICER TASTE LESS TINNY AND SALT
5 #### Love this product , great flavor and so much better than the crap you get in the stores .
5 #### I bought this to inject for brisket and pork butts . The taste is amazing , I will be buying more !
5 #### It 's right there when you need stock . So convenient
5 #### very good . I use to to enhance the flavor of all beef recipes
5 #### I use this all the time fore soup and gravy . My favorite base .
5 #### This is great . I 've tried several brand of beef base , but this one is by far the most flavorfull of all . If you are looking for any beef base , look no further . Go get this one . This will be the only brand of beef base that I am going to buy from now on . I will also try other base from this brand in the future like chicken and vegetables .
2 #### I gave this to my sister who found it extremely salty . She went back to her old standby of boxed broth from the supermarket . Me ? I boil bones and when I do n't have those , I use More - than - Gourmet demi - glace paste .
5 #### It is very tastey and a little goes a very long way .
5 #### These are great . Honest to God . GREAT Value for the money . Thanks Amazon .
2 #### Product description states : 100 % All - Natural , NO artificial ingredients , NO chemical preservatives . Hmmm . On Amazon there are no ingredients listed . But go search the ingredients on the internet , and one finds : disodium inosinate / disodium guanylate , maltodextrin , and modified cornstarch . What are these chemicals ? How about disodium inosinate ? Go search on the internet . Is it because this is a way for Nestle ( yes , the giant food company ) to put the equivalent of MSG w/o having to list MSG in the ingredient ? According to Wikipedia , disodium inosinate is not used independently of glutamic acid ; if disodium guanylate is present in a list of ingredients but MSG does not appear to be , it is likely that glutamic acid is provided as part of another ingredient such as a processed soy / corn protein complex . All natural ? No artificial ? You decide .
4 #### Minor 's lineup of bases are quite good . From seafood , chicken , beef , pork , etc . , they do make a difference in the kitchen . I have used several brands of beef base brands , from the cubes to powders and all in between . Only a very few number rises to the top . Some are way too expensive , and I guess this one after all the extras may qualify as on the high end of prices , but at least I know what to expect from this base . It is not a perfect base by a long shot , but it is better than most , and for all purposes a tasty base if done in right measurements . Some of the sodium may be alarming at first , but that is easy to compensate by not using additional sodium if one desires . Minor 's is at the top of the pack , they make restaurant quality bases that work consistently , time after time . 4 Stars .
2 #### The flavor is good but the product is too salty for most of my uses . Even after being diluted , the salt overpowers the otherwise great flavor and fragrance . If you like lots of salt in your beef , you will love this .
5 #### I love this beef base - I use it to make a killer meatloaf and french onion soup . It 's also great for an au jus or to cook with in a crock pot . It has just the right amount of beef flavor - it 's salty , but not overly salty . I always have some in my fridge !
4 #### This is restaurant quality beef base . While it may appear to be expensive it is well worth the money and every serious cook should have it in his fridge .
5 #### this makes it easy to flavor your coffee ... love it
5 #### One tablet has enough flavor for a standard cup of coffee but if you want a stronger flavor just add one tablet at a time to adjust to your liking . They are easy to carry in your purse or pocket when you are dining at places that do not offer flavored coffees . I bought these in advance for my recent hospitalization for surgery & rehab . I was so glad I did . My local retailer had carried these in the past , but no longer does . Thank you for offering this product via Amazon .
5 #### I have been using Necta Sweet for 40 years since it was invented and started selling . It was worth more than gold back then and every restaurant kept it behind counters . You had to ask for it because any left out was pocketed immediately . ( Yes I speak from experience ) . In Santa Fe I can not find the tablet form and have been buying from NSI for around a decade . They ship fast , pack tight so there is never any broken bottles or spillage . Good sweetener and a really GREAT company selling it . No bs , no excuses . They ship and get it to you quickly . Buy with confidence .
5 #### I am always apprehensive that Necta Sweet will stop making saccharine , because it is not featured on shelves much any more . It is a compact dietetic sweetener that does not clump in its little bag like competitors . It comes in different sizes so that you can get just what you need , no more nor less .
5 #### My family has used saccharin in our iced tea since I was a kid . We 're used to the taste , we like it . But it 's really hard to find now . I was happy to find it on Amazon and will be buying more in the future ! Necta Sweet is a good brand , well packaged so the pills do n't come out all broken or powder .
5 #### Much easier to handle than sacharrine packets , and no empty packets to dispose . I use these every day for morning coffee or tea .
5 #### Always a good purchase . This item is so hard to find these days . Never have any problems when I purchase Necta Sweet .
5 #### Cheaper than sweet n low and tastes the same
5 #### i love it . i 've been using it for a long time . it makes my drinks taste delicious .
5 #### I use this with my coffee and hot tea . Love it !
5 #### I got these for a friend that could n't find this any where else . She really likes these in her iced tea but I think they are a little bitter
5 #### My family has used saccharine for 5 generations . It 's a tried and true . Who knows what the new sweeteners will do to you ? Be aware , though , that saccharine turns bitter when you heat it . I do n't mind that in hot coffee , but still use Splenda in hot tea . If you 're going to cook with it , try to put it in at the end , after item has cooled off a bit .
5 #### This product is a life saver . Good price and convenient amount . Hard to find this strength in stores . Just like granny used in her Southern Sweet tea .
5 #### I bought this because I wanted to keep tomatos in stock , all our summer tomatoes are gone , lycopene and I am boycotting Heinz . 12 tubes of this takes up as much room as one jar of Prego tomato sauce . And Dr. Gourmet says : The USDA and FDA use a test known as the " Howard Mold Count " to determine the amount of mold in products that you purchase . There are regulations about the acceptable levels of mold in certain foods . The minute you open that can of tomato paste any mold that is in the can can grow with the exposure to oxygen . The longer it is in the fridge the more chance of mold growing . Most of the molds are benign and not likely to hurt you , but they will taint the flavor of the tomato paste .
5 #### I bought this for its convenience and " thrift factor " -seldom do I use an entire can of tomato paste and usually end up throwing the remainder out . I was extremely pleased to find that it had a very fresh taste , without the slightly burnt and " tinny " taste of canned tomato paste . I would not pay the around $ 4.00 price for a single tube , but it is an extremely good for the price when bought in bulk in Amazon 's grocery store . It 's great having it shipped to my desk at work , also - saves time that I 'd rather spend on cooking and gas because it 's not available at local stores .
5 #### I wish I could give this 10 . Tried the Cesar salad dressing . We love it . Ca n't wait to make pasta sauce with it . So easy to use and less expensive than the anchovies I was and still will use for certain dishes . Wondering how many tablespoons are equal to one anchovy ? ? ? Great product ! !
4 #### I keep this on hand as an alternative to having to open and usually wasting a can .
5 #### We love this pesto paste for a pasta and it is perfect for a dairy free family . There are no other brands that are this good and do not add cheese !
5 #### Nice pesto flavor , in the convenience of a tube ! I will often put this in a pasta with diced up chicken , a few squirts from this tube , along with a healthy drizzle of EVOO , and you have dinner !
5 #### This stuff is amazing ! My husband and I used it on homemade zuchinni noodles and salmon ; delicious !
5 #### Reminds me of the product I used to buy when living in Germany !
5 #### I am 81 and live alone . cooking for one is so much better and easier with a delicious and versatile product like this one . call me " the lone gourmet " . I ordered 2 more tubes .
5 #### I ve tried different brands and this one is my favorite . I use it in beef stew and spaghetti sauce mostly . When you cook from scratch with quality ingredients , you want everything to be high quality . Cheaper brands are more tart and need to be balanced out with sugar and more salt . Using this product does nt require much doctoring so you taste your fresh ingredients and my sauce turns out delicious . You might say how can you tell ? I cook mostly by estimation and taste so it is noticeable to me when the ingredients are pure and simple . However , the best test would be with your family . We even can my sauce and stew and take them camping because they are family favorites .
5 #### It 's great ! Use it straight or add some olive oil to thin it and instant PESTO sauce . It also tastes great on garlic bread , just a a smear down the center and let if melt in with the butter . Yum !
1 #### After reading all the 5 star reviews think that maybe recipe was changed because got no garlic flavor at all . t tasted like salty oil .. why add two kinds of oil to something that is supposed to be pure garlic ?
5 #### Good for when you need that extra little taste
4 #### I 've heard of tube tomato paste and this was the first time I used it , so I ca n't compare to other brands . This is so easy to keep in the fridge and I can add just a little bit to sauces and bases and I do n't have to use an entire can of paste and overpower the recipe . Just keep the lid on tight and I think it will last forever .
5 #### I 'm biased , I love anchovies , what can I say ... ?
5 #### This is the second time I ordered this . I love how you can just use small portions ( e.g. , 1 Tablespoon , etc . ) , and not worry about the rest going bad .
4 #### Wonderful flavor . Great to add to slow - cooker / braised dishes , gives a nice deep tomato flavor . -1 star for the price / quantity . Otherwise a solid product , definitely recommended !
4 #### Tomato paste in a tube . Great flavor , nice texture , easy to cook with and keeps quite a while .
5 #### My wife discovered Tomato Paste in a tube about a year ago , and it 's been life - changing . Previous purchases of Tomato Paste were in little 3 oz cans , which eventually started growing science experiments in the back of the fridge . A main benefit of having tubed Tomato Paste is that it wo n't be exposed to air ( and bacteria / mold ) , and you can portion out the exact amount needed for a given recipe . My wife and I use this Tomato paste in Soups , Pasta Sauce , Pizza Sauce , and even in Chicken dishes to add a little bit of acid . One thing to note , because this is a concentrated Tomato product , it may be a little sweeter than anticipated . We have purchased this product multiple times at the grocery store , it is priced comparably with our local grocery store , but with the added convenience of being an AmazonFresh product .
4 #### This is a good alternative to fresh . During the winter months , it is just impossible to get good tasty herbs . This gives a nice punch of flavor to anything you would want to use herbs in . I like it in sauces , soups and as a rub to different proteins .
2 #### Love this tomato paste but would n't order from this seller again , most of the tubes had busted open on the bottom and the box and tubes were sticky . Several of them would leak from the bottom of squeezed . Maybe they got too hot during storage / shipping ?
5 #### Very convenient when you just need a little sun - dried tomato flavor in your dishes .
5 #### VERY spicy . You do n't need much to add a kick to your dishes !
5 #### My favorite tomato paste . They seem to be out of this every time I go to the store , so I decided to stock up . Others may be fine for cooking in a sauce , but I use a little of this for body and flavor in my Asian salad dressing . I can really tell a difference with other brands . I 'll make sure I do n't run out again !
4 #### Have only used once but like the convenience of this and the tastel
3 #### I 'm not sure about Pesto . And I have nothing to compare it to . I 've only drizzled a small amount with some pasta . I may need to pour a good amount out so I can stir it in well .
5 #### I have grown accustomed to this brand . I have found it difficult to switch to other brands . Competitively priced too ! Thanks .
5 #### Tomato paste is one of those ingredients that I do n't use all that often , but it 's great to have in my fridge when I need it in a pinch . It 's such a concentrated flavor that I almost always used just a little bit at a time , never a whole can . The problem is , many tomato paste brands are sold in little cans , which are not ideal for storage -- even if I tented them tightly with foil , the paste at the top would turn brown and gummy and sometimes grow mold . Yuck . Amore tomato paste is sold in a tube , which makes it easy to get the little bit I need to give stews and casseroles a richer flavor . This is such a better way of storing it than the little cans . There may be other brands out there with better flavor , but I buy Amore exclusively for the convenient squeezy tube .
5 #### So happy to get a coupon attached to the price . Was able to share with others . Great Quality , love the ability to have these squeeze bottles when only a little quantity is needed ! Just cover and store in fridge ! Very easy to use .
5 #### This turned out to be the best pesto we used to date ( have tried 3 others ) ! it was fresh tasting , well balanced in taste and made our ziti like lasagna taste better than other times . Definitely will not bother trying any other pestos now that i found this .
4 #### The packaging is far more convenient than cans for someone who lives alone , or for recipes that call for only a small amount of tomato paste . A partly used tube seems like it would keep for a very long time in your refrigerator . People who like to cook love being given a tube or two of this high - quality tomato paste . Buy a case and share it with your friends !
5 #### love it I use all the time when cooking pasta
3 #### Great in store bought sauce ( Gravy ) to " kick it up " a little . Not hot mind you , just a little extra flavor that bottle sauce often lacks !
4 #### A great paste . I was looking for tomato paste in a can at the time . There was no canned tomato paste on Amazon , so I tried this one . Very nice ! ! ! A little spendy , but did what I needed .
5 #### No waste with this product . I store in zip bag in frig and use till done . Delicious and intense .
5 #### I always hated how much tomato paste went to waste from Jars & Cans . This is the perfect solution , plus it 's easier to measure .
5 #### This is a staple of mine for making quick tomato - based soups . It truly lasts in the refrigerator even past the expiration date .
5 #### Love this . No metallic canned taste , clean to use and there 's zero waste and no cans to futz with . Best tasting , by far . I 'm never without this .
5 #### Good quality have used the tomato paste for years and tried the chili pepper - lived up to brand .
5 #### I use it often . Saves water and time while cooking .
5 #### Very tasty with a nice little bit of heat . I used this in my tomato soup last night . Loved it . I 'll definitely keep a tube of this on hand .
3 #### Not so great and it was difficult to squeeze out at the end .
5 #### Delicious and cheese - free which is what I was looking for ! One tube is for one pound of pasta for us !
1 #### This is thin , watery & orange . Do n't know what all the good reviews are for . This stuff did absolutely nothing for me .
1 #### I was disappointed with this product . I opened it as directed via the little point in the cap to pierce the foil covering the tube . When I squeezed it , I expected a slow , thick stream of tomato paste to come out . Instead , it splattered all over , in every direction : a watery tomato mess . To make matters worse , it tasted nasty ! I checked the expiration and it was fine . This was not paste " by any stretch of the imagination .
5 #### Good stuff , I like using it with sourdough large buns , an Italian cheese blend , saute'd mushroom , and large old world pepperonis to make a great sandwich or tub . A bit pricey for how much comes in the tub , it 's not much .
5 #### Love the sun dried tomato flavor . I am happy to have the orders come to my door .
5 #### I love this chili pepper paste . Unfortunately I moved and can not find it in my local grocery store . I am happy that Amazon carries it . It lasts a long time , because it is very spicy , so I only use a little bit at a time . Great for sandwiches .
5 #### I have never used Amore Pesto Paste as the basis for pesto sauce . But , that is only because I have come up with so many other ways to use it that it is gone before I have a chance . Among the wonderful uses : apply a coat of the paste to pizza crust with a pastry brush before adding sliced fesh tomato & ripe olives with a blend of Parmesan , provolone & fresh mozzarella , blend in equal parts with butter for the best spread for a veggie sandwich ever , or try a nice dollop in a bowl of homemade tomato soup just as you serve it . Those are some of my most recent uses for this lovely paste . It does n't take much to season you food well using pesto paste .
5 #### Absolutely the bestg tgomato past I have ever used ! !
5 #### my favorite ... I love this stuff . I have 3 ordered in on my subscribe and save monthly
5 #### Wow , this really amps up your meals ! I added some to a stew , and some to pizza sauce , both were the best dishes I 've made ! This will find a permanent spot in my kitchen , it 's so savory and delicious .
5 #### Good product and I would recommend it for anchovy lovers like myself . If we order pizza I always add it to my slices plus shredded Parmesan cheese . Very tasty .
1 #### This was NOT good . It did n't taste like pesto . It tasted like oil that had soured . Maybe it was in the sun too long before delivery ? Just .... really not good .
5 #### I am such a fan of these Pastes in a tube ( tomato , almond , anchovies etc ) You use what you need when you need it and becuase you did n't have to open a whole container you can throw little dabs into stuff you normally would n't be bale to for fear of wasting the whole jar . I find myself squirting this on salad , crackers , flatbreads etc . I love the tomato mozzarella flatbread from panera but it is 5.00 which is nuts in my opinion . I bought a pack of flatbreads for 3.00 , a fresh mozzarella ball for 3.00 and a bag of spinach for 2.00 and this wonderful paste ... I can make 6 flatbreads for the price of two at panera and I can have spinach and not arugula ! Yeah me !
5 #### just not enough of it but its very good , you use it up quickly
5 #### Love the convenience of the tube ... if you only need a tsp or two , you do n't have to open a can , this stores very well in fridge .
5 #### Love the convenience of this tube and the fact that I can use what I need & then just put in the fridge . No m ore wasting !
1 #### Oh so not what I was looking for . I 've had sundried tomato paste from a tube before and it was good . This is salty and the flavor , I do n't know , it 's just not the sun dried tomato I 'm used to from a tube or a jar . Gon na have to pass on this one .
5 #### Perfect to stuff green olives with . Two words ... Love it ! !
5 #### Trying this for 1st time - Rachel Ray uses this all the time
5 #### Love this ! Also bought plain paste which is excellent too .
1 #### Tastes AWFUL . Do NOT buy this product . Tastes nothing like even bad pesto .
4 #### Great shortcut in an emergency or just for myself .
4 #### convenient as opposed to whole can when you do n't need that much .
5 #### I learned about tomato paste in a tube watching cooking shows . I love the ease and flavor of Amore Basil . I use it in any Italian dishes I make . One key thing in using this , is to put the paste in the pan while your browning you meat , or sauting the veggies . It blooms the flavor . Then add you liquid . ( It 's delicious with Red wine ) . Enjoy !
5 #### Very happy with this product . It is really yummy ! Enjoyed using it in all kinds of my dishes . Very versatile .
5 #### good to have on hand , if your like me and forget to keep tomato paste in the pantry ...
4 #### Would give it a 5 , but it is more oil than paste . Tastes good , but when I squeezed the tube to taste it , I got a big squirt of green oil . Even after shaking the tube up , it comes out oil and no paste . Priced way too high , but it did give me the idea that I made it right when I did it fresh .
3 #### Not packed with too much flavor . Kind of disappointing .
3 #### Nowhere as good as freshly made pesto , but then that 's probably to be expected .
5 #### This is very good . I used it in a low carb stuffing for pork chops and it held the chopped mushrooms and onions together very well . Very flavorful .
5 #### I am an Italian - American who loves to cook and still uses most of my grandma 's recipes . This is a really great product and a much better alternative to the old canned pastes which are slightly bitter and I never really liked . I highly recommend this as a much better alternative to canned tomato paste .
4 #### I like the ability to only use a Tablespoon at a time ,
5 #### this has got to be the best thing for cooks since toilet paper . i love this stuff . now you do n't have to buy a can for a recipe that calls for 1 tbsp or anything other than the 6 oz ? the cans are . i cook all the time and would n't ever * not * have this on my shelf .
5 #### The ingredients in this are only tomatoes and garlic . I bought 6 of these , then came back , and bought 8 more . It has a very good flavor . Tonight I made dinner with it ( pictures attached ) . For my sauce is used ... Amore garlic tomato paste fresh tomatillos ( with outer husk removed ) onions mushrooms spices I fried up slices of polenta in my Cuisinart Griddler and added the sauce over and around it . For those that are n't familiar with polenta , it 's basically just cooked grits . They taste very good formed into a patty and fried . I 've also used this in the last week for lentil soup and homemade pizza . There 's a world of difference between this and canned . Would recommend .
3 #### Not as smooth , condensed or as flavourful as canned tomato paste . I thought that as it is sealable that it would be more convenient to keep in the fridge . I would n't buy it again , though .
2 #### the box came crushed and the tube was leaking .
5 #### Love this stuff ! I can use as little or much as I want and put the tube in the refrigerator . Way better than the canned stuff any day !
5 #### Ohhhhh Man ! Thank You God ! I LOVE THIS ! ! ! WILL BE PURCHASING THIS FOR SURE , AGAIN !
5 #### I got this because it was on sale . I do n't normally buy tube pastes . I 'm glad i did . Its great for adding some spice to foods . It will last us a while . You do n't need a ton of it to just lightly spice foods when you are cooking .
5 #### Not too garlicky , and like the tubes for being less wasteful when you only need a spoonsful for a recipe .
5 #### Arrived in tact with no leaks . Used for Italian dishes and very little is needed . Each tube should get 3 - 4 servings from them . I use that in huge pots of sauce and it really does help the flavor . If you are watching your salt intake , you will get more out of each tube or you probably should n't be using this in the first place . With the amount in the bulk pack , it may take a very long time to use for some .
5 #### So nice when you need a small amount of paste .
4 #### Great for use when fresh basil is not available for your pesto recipes . The basil / pine nut mix has a good flavor too .
4 #### I always keep this on hand during the " off - basil " growing season .
5 #### this was good flavor but not much in a tube . Also , there is a bit of oil that comes out with the paste , probably from roasting . I would use again but wish the price was lower for what it is .
1 #### Went bad right away , merchant refused to give me credit ! unacceptable ! I really need the flavor & it to last .... I mean it went bad within a few weeks ? ! !
2 #### Tastes great . However , a LOT of the product is left in the tube because you ca n't get it all out , ca n't flatten the metal fully . Metal tube food is a waste because so much product can not be squeezed out . Need a mini , home use steam roller for the dang thing .
5 #### I got this because I do no use tomato paste very often . After opened I store in fridge . Tastes great and I love garlic in almost everything !
4 #### I suppose home made pesto is always the best tasting . However you ca nt beat the convenience of this pesto in a tube . If you just need a little there is no greasy jar to contend with . Just squeeze some out and then close the cap .
4 #### The taste of the pesto paste was good . It 's not a great value as it costs about the same as a half pint of pesto sauce from my local market . It is convenient to have on hand though .
5 #### Great product and now i wo n't have to open a can and waste half of it . Also no more can taste in my sauce .
5 #### This is my favorite way to buy and use tomato paste . Has a good flavor and the tube is sturdy so no surprise leaks .
5 #### Very convenient to keep in your fridge for those times you need 1tsp/1tbsp of tomato paste .
5 #### Tastes fantastic . Love the ability to use only as much as I need . Much nicer than opening a can and tossing half .
5 #### It 's a better value than it looks because you do n't waste any . How often do you need a whole can of tomato paste ?
5 #### I LOVE that I do n't have to waste half a can of tomato paste when all I need is a few tablespoons . Just squirt out what you need , and throw it in the fridge .
1 #### Tasted rancid ! Simply awful . Thankfully , I just tried a little . If I die , my browser history will show the cause of death .
2 #### very bitter like tea that 's been steeped too long
5 #### Very good product ! I use it almost every day ! It has an excellent flavor ! !
5 #### Tomato paste in a tube is the one of the greatest inventions in food packaging . This tastes great , and no more waste . Highly recommend .
5 #### Very nice pesto paste , only quibble is that the tube is rather small . Not as large as the Amore tomato paste . We use it with olive oil as a pizza base . If the price is not an issue , this is definitely worth it . Better than any jars of pesto we have bought .
5 #### Very nice and convenient way to keep tomato paste available without having to use a whole can or having to deal with the metal aftertaste of a can . Very strong and fresh flavor .
5 #### The tube is more convenient than the can . Plus it tastes very fresh .
2 #### I did n't care for it , but am not sure why . It was a little bitter for my taste .
5 #### I like the paste in a tube because I can use the amount I want and then put the top back on so I do n't waste any . With a can I have to find a small container so the tube is much more practical . And the paste taste good in my sauces .
5 #### I use this product at least once per week - it is a standing product along with the tomato paste by the same company . An entire tube flavors a pound of cooked pasta . I am guessing it would be good in salad dressing too . I dress the pasta with this , a bit more olive oil and cheese . It 's really all you need . I can only guess it would be equally good on cold pasta . However , the pasta never lasts long enough for me to find out !
5 #### Love this product . Always have a tube on hand
5 #### This is a great tasting tomato paste that I love to have on hand when I need just a pinch ! Squeeze it out like toothpaste and keep it in the refrigerator !
5 #### a great way to get a touch of tomato in a recipe . Much better than opening a can and trying not to waste it when you only need a little .
5 #### Excellent product . It keeps in the refrigerator indefinitely . Use just what you need .
4 #### It 's hard for me to find pre - made pesto sauce that I really like . We used to get this years ago then forgot about it and switched to jars . But those changed and we tried this again . I like how it tastes and it 's convenient . It can taste a little bitter when I heat it up , so I add my favorite extra virgin olive oil to it before I use it .
5 #### Very handy to keep around for those times when you want to add a little tomato punch to your cooking . I love being able to squeeze out what I need and not worry about scraping the remainder of the can into another container for storage . It dispenses easily and then stays tightly covered until you are ready to use it the next time . Plus the tube is easy to locate in the fridge , unlike trying to figure out which bowl is the one that has the leftover paste from the can you opened last week !
2 #### Very dissatisfied , not much flavor , just an oily taste
5 #### Such a great way to have tomato sauce on hand . A little squeeze of Amore gives a nice richness to broths , soups , and stews . Very convenient , no waste .
4 #### Love this on sandwiches with turkey / chicken and melted cheese . A little less oil would have earned a five star rating . A little pricey , but quality pesto .
5 #### This is really the best tomato paste I 've ever used . I also love that it comes in a tube - very handy to add to what 's cooking & no waste . Excellent tomato flavor .
5 #### This is the perfect no waste answer to using tomato paste . I cook a lot but the canned tomato paste always gets tossed shortly after opening . The tubes are a little pricey but I 'd rather not have a trash can full of half empty cans of tomato paste .
5 #### My cooking requires having anchovies of some sort always on hand . These tubes makes it easy and the taste is excellent .
5 #### If you are an anchovy lover you will love these .
5 #### I find this very convenient , I do n't have to buy a large jar for something I do n't use often . Cost effective .
5 #### I only use a Tablespoon or so at a time , and would end up throwing away half a can . Now I can keep reusing the same container . :)
5 #### Very convenient when you just need a small amount of tomato paste . Excellent flavor .
5 #### This is good tomato paste . I do like the idea of it being in a tube . Makes storage a lot easier . I recommend it to cooks everywhere .
5 #### This is an outstanding product and is talked about buy others on the net . I tried it based on the reviews and found their views accurate to my taste . Depending on what you are cooking , the 4.5 oz tube may be right up your alley . I like it better than Hunt 's and some of the others I have used . I think it has a " deeper taste . " In the end , it depends on what you want your food to taste like .
5 #### All of the Amore pastes in tubes a great , but I use a lot of this one . Just want to make a small pesto dish for one ? Boil pasta , drain and add this to taste .
5 #### So I was walking on the treadmill one day , watching a cooking show cooking food I should n't be drooling over . I figured if I have to exercise I can at least look watch it on tv . It 's kind of the same reason I watch Colin Farrell movies . It 's a little bit of self torture but that 's what fantasy is , right ? Anyway , so I 'm watching this lady from New England ( my roots which explains why all this salad in California does n't really hit my sweet spot ) and this lady pulls out a tube of garlic tomato paste as if everyone knows about it . Maybe they do but I did n't . I 've always hated tomato paste . All my friends always had that little half used can of tomato paste sitting in their fridge . The top gets googly , they put it in a Tupperware and forget it 's in there , or they eventually throw out the half they never used . This tube is the perfect answer . Kudos to whoever invented it . I wish I had known sooner . Squeeze a little bit to soup , sauce , whatever needs a little kick . It 's not that cheap and if you need a whole can of tomato paste that 's another story but if you just want it for flavor , adding the cost of what you waste from the cans , it probably comes out the same . Include the convenience factor this is probably worth it . It was to me and I like it
2 #### I really did n't need a tube of oil . Ca n't say more yet as after two tries I have n't gotten to the ' meat ' of it yet . Extremely disappointed .
5 #### Tastes great and I use this when recipes call for tspn of paste . Who opens a can for a tspn ? Good stuff !
5 #### This definitely packs a wallop . Nice flavor , color , and undeniable hotness . It mixes well with tomato sauces . It definitely has salt in it so do not add salt to your dish until you have added this and tasted the results . It is pretty much concentrated chili pepper , with a little olive oil and salt , so no apologies are needed . High quality . Jim
5 #### The flavor & bite is great . I prefer to have multiple choices of texture , consistency & heat when it comes to the hot stuff I cook with or add to finished dishes , so this small tube that packs a punch was a good choice because it takes up so little room ( packs great re : camp - outs ) & can easily be used up before getting stale . I 've mixed it w/ avocado oil to coat cooked chickpeas prior to dry - roasting for a crunchy snack ; I 've added it to individual servings of sausage chicken posole that was tempered down spice - wise for the wimps ; I 've scrambled it w/ raw eggs prior to cooking ; I 've tossed it w/ cold , leftover steak slices in a cold Thai salad ~ so far , so good , & I highly recommend giving it a try if you 're needing to pack some heat from time - to - time .
3 #### I keep this stuff around to add to just about everything .. quality product
4 #### Only a small amount is needed compared too ketchup . I like it .
4 #### great product but the tube is pretty small . Adds a lot of flavor to canned sauces .
5 #### This is so convenient and for a small family just the perfect thing to be able to use only what you want
1 #### Not happy with the product or the fact that the the review I wrote about the product quality prior to this one received no reply . It expires at the end of this month and I think that is altogether too short a shelf life for a product of this type to be given . Pitiful . I asked for a refund and was n't even given the courtesy of a reply .
5 #### I 've used this brand for several years with great success . Since my store no longer carried it , I ordered through Amazon . Its easy to use , particularly when all you need is a tbsp or 2 , rather than opening a small can and wasting what s left , toss in the fridge until next time .
5 #### Just right amount of extra . Do not have to waste any . Better flavor than expected .
5 #### I do n't normally buy tube paste , however it is very handy when your recipe only calls for a small amount . For me it 's a convenience thing . Can I tell the difference between tomato pastes after a slow cook . No !
5 #### i always have a tube of this in my refridgerater . it brightens up so many recipies . was pleasently surprised how much i use it for after purchasing it the first time and have continued purchasing it since then and will continue to do so . highly reccommend
3 #### Since this is a tube , you can not shake it to stir up the contents which can settle . This particular tube had settled and on first squeeze of the tube it was liquid . Otherwise , the taste is spot on !
5 #### Very good to use in many recipes I would n't have bothered to make pesto for ! I have not been able to find it in local markets , and it is very versatile .
5 #### This tomato past comes in a squeeze tube . Sort of like toothpaste . I like having it on hand for recipes that only call for a tablespoon or two of tomato paste - but this is " double concentrated " so you only need half as much . It 's easy to measure out just what you need and you can save the remainder in your refrigerator for the next recipe . Seems to last several weeks after opening .
5 #### Amore is the bomb of tomato paste . If you are still using those crappy little cans of hunts paste you probably need an intervention . Amore is not as salty as other brands and since it comes in tube it keeps longer and easy to use in sauces and stews .
5 #### Just right to dispense a little squeeze here or there . I am amassing an assortment of flavors . This basil flavor is nice . Jim
5 #### Numerous pesto recipes say to use up the pesto within two or three days . So my husband and I especially appreciate Amore Pesto Paste . It 's quick and easy to make just the right amount we need , even if that 's just a teaspoon . Also , we love the taste . We have been buying Amore Pesto Paste several years now .
1 #### Disappointed ! ! ! ! Tube squeezed out mostly water first , and product overall was very , very thin ! Did I just get a bad tube ?
4 #### We love that we can just cap the tube and not spoil the rest of the tomato paste . We hated the cans of opened paste we had to throw out . It 's a little pricey . Hope it gets cheaper .
3 #### Good pesto ..... but VERY pricey through Amazon . You can get this way cheaper elsewhere
5 #### Very convenient to have chili paste in a tube so it can be kept easily .
5 #### Great product ... Really like being able to use what I need and not have to worry about not using it all ....
3 #### This is n't so much a " paste " as it is a slightly chunky condensed sauce . I was expecting an actual smooth paste to use in soup , but it would be better suited to use as a topping on bread or crackers .
5 #### I love this - none of our food stores carry this item and I see it used on the Food Network all the time .
5 #### Love this stuff ! Got tired of the metallic taste with canned sauce , & all the space it takes up . I do refrigerate this after opening , but , it fits in the door shelf nicely . I 'll never will go back to canned , no matter how cheap it is .
4 #### So handy to have when you realize you are out of canned paste or sauce . Neat & clean to use . Cans can be so messy and leave a large footprint on our environment . I like Amore Tomato Paste in a tube .
2 #### I ordered this while living overseas to go with some gnocchi I ordered from amazon . The gnocchi was delish but this pesto was not . It got great reviews and I was excited to have pesto that traveled / stored well . I followed the directions but there is something off about the taste . It 's as if something was missing ( whatever makes it creamy --- pine nuts , parm ? ) . It was fine , I finished the tube , but not great pesto .
5 #### I absolutely love this . I learned how to use it --- use a small amount and cook it separately in the pan until it turns a deep red color . It brings out the flavor and stretches the product a long way . Then make your sauce or whatever you are doing and you will notice a much enhanced flavor . I have this on subscribe and save ! ! !
5 #### A nice addition to enhance the favor of a dish . Bought through the Prime Pantry . I recommend it .
5 #### Love having this on hand ! No more opening a can of tomato paste ! Wojs perfect for when you need a small amount !
5 #### This is one of the best tomato paste I have tasted . My mother 's BF is pure Italian and suggested this . What a great product ! The flavor has more depth and sweetness than canned . Family noticed the difference .
5 #### good value , obviously , if you use a lot of anchovy paste , which I do
5 #### Perfect for when you need just a little , though a bit pricey . I purchased with a coupon from Amazon , so it was worth it for us .
5 #### Genuine Italian stuff . It really is different for making Italian food . The difference is noticeable .
2 #### I thought Pesto Paste was ingenious . My two friends liked it . To me it was grassy tasting . I sent my friends home with the Pesto Paste . The tube emptied smoothly . It will last in the fridge much longer than fresh pesto . I intend to try some other item like garlic or sun dried tomatoes .
5 #### Necessary for gourmet cooking or a quick anchovies over spaghetti pasta .
5 #### I love this brand ! Wow ! The taste of the sweet sundries tomatoes is amazing ! The quantity is beautiful ! Makes a wonderful pasta sauce !
5 #### This pesto tases very good and fresh . It is just the thing to add to plain padta to dress it up enough for quick dinner .
4 #### I hate wasting food and I could never seem to use a whole can of paste . While watching TV I saw the host use tomato paste out of a tube . Well after searching our local stores and not finding it I found it here and read the reviews . Now from chilli to pasta to spaghetti I have a way to use tomato paste without the waste !
4 #### I love the option of being in tabe istead of the which I hardly ever use the whole at one time meaning the rest gets wasted . Plus I like that it has a little kick .
5 #### Tomato paste in a tube is convenient and tastes great . These pastes work so simple for recipes that only need 1 tablespoon and you can store it in refrigerator as soon as it has been opened .
5 #### Received them yesterday and had to try it . Used it today in a sauce , and it was beautifully flavored . The best part is that there is no waste , because I wo n't have a half can that turns into a science experiment when I forget about it in my fridge .
5 #### Considering how fast my roommates and I can go through pasta sauce , making a meat sauce can be expensive . Adding a tube of anchovy paste to a large pot of my basil sauce makes a meaty flavor that 's makes the sauce on par with bolognese . Everyone loves my sauce and it 's probably because of this paste . I do n't tell anyone though , if they knew it was fishy they probably would n't eat it .
5 #### I make a lot of pasta dishes and it is so handy just to squeeze . Great for spaghetti . A must for soups !
5 #### These are so convenient to use , instead of opening a can and wasting what you do n't need . The taste is great and the price from Amazon is SO much lower than this brand at my local store .
5 #### This s by far one of the best tomato pastes made and it is do easy to use .. Why do n't all the other tomato sauce companies make this available to their customers .
5 #### How many cans of partially - used tomato pastes have you thrown away ? I much prefer this product because it has great flavor and stores beutifully .
5 #### This is not only spicy but also has great texture and when added to my red sauce I use for my tamales , enchiladas and eggs to mention just a few things it added just the perfect kick.pricey but will last quite a while
5 #### Love the taste o the point were I went right out and bought two more tubes to make sure I always had some around . Do not look at just the price the flavor to me makes up for this .
5 #### Exspensive yes worth the splurge yes . The taste is perfect and the idea that I use only what I need it perfect for me . Give it a try I think you will agree the taste and conviencent makes up for the price .
2 #### I do n't know what keeps blocking the pesto from dispensing smoothly , but it usually takes a lot of work to get a runny little squirt out of the tube . I insert prongs in to try to dislodge whatever keeps blocking the flow , I stir it around ; I 've even massaged the stupid tube to try to mix it wellstill , it spurts and sputters over me and the counter 9 times out of 10 . A mess . The flavor is mild , almost bland . It 's convenient , and tempting to have on hand for recipes that call for small portions of pesto , but for me , it 's too exhausting and I wo n't reorder . ( I 'm going back to freezing small portions of pesto in an ice cube tray which is less trouble than this . )
4 #### The Amore Tomato Paste with Garlic is really tasty , but pricy , thus the 4 stars instead of 5 . While I hate wasting canned tomato paste ( or anything for that matter ) , this is a more costly alternative , given that a can of tomato paste is about 39cents . It is nice to have on hand to stretch the spaghetti sauce or zing up meatloaf , chilli , soups and the like . The flavor is good and rich , but for the price the tube is quite small -- about the size of a " family sized " tube of toothpaste . While it says " double concentrated " it is still only equivalent to about 2 cans of tomato paste . The tube is a thick , foil / metal and the cap is used to poke a hole in the end . It should be refrigerated after opening , so I keep it in the veggie bin .
5 #### Basil is one of my favorite herbs , and for me , it 's pretty tricky to grow this time of year and it 's also super expensive in the grocery store . The Amore Pesto Paste is pretty delicious . I added it to my tomato bisque and it was delicious . The flavor is very concentrated so about a teaspoon was enough for the 48 oz . batch I made . A small squirt in the spaghetti sauce gave it a really fresh taste , too . I am going to keep this on hand throughout the year , so that when basil is in season , I can intensify the flavor of the fresh with this product . The tube is like thick foil / metal and the cap is used to poke a hole in the end . It has a slightly nutty flavor , but for making actual pesto , I would add some fresh pine nuts sprinkled on top just because I really like them . The ingredients include sunflower oil , which is a nice , light oil . A good olive oil and a bit of fresh lemon really brightens the flavor for basil - based dishes or on seafood . The tube I received expires in June of 2015 , which is about 18 months from the date delivered . The directions say " refrigerate after opening " , so I keep it in the vegetable bin . Now if I could just find some good tomatoes this time of year , I 'd make a delicious Caprize .
5 #### It works wonderfully and I love the sun dried taste .... first saw the " Chew " chefs using it Would also want a larger size . And will purchase it again . Have recommended it to relatives and friends .
5 #### I like the deep concentrated flavor of the paste . The convenience of the tube is really appreciated . We used to throw away leftover paste when we were using the small cans . We use about a third of the can and save the rest in little containers for use later . We end up throwing those out because they get moldy before we use them again . These stays fresh in the tube . I can squeeze as little or as much as I need without wasting the whole can .
5 #### After reading about the dangers of BHT linings in canned goods , we started looking for another option and discovered Amore Tomato Past to be the best one . It 's great for making pasta sauces , sloppy joes , your own BBQ sauce , soups , etc .
5 #### I squirt this stuff on everything from pizzas to tossed salads ( in little dabs when I 'm out of tomatoes ) to bland soups to my homemade , from - the - garden spaghetti sauce ( as a thickener before canning ) . The taste is better than anything I 've found in a can , and I love that I 'm able to use just a little at a time and keep the rest for ages in the refrig .
2 #### I really like what this product does to enrich the flavor of soups , stews , pasta dishes , and such . HOWEVER , several of my tubes leaked a bit out of their bottoms ( where the tubes are closed by being tightly folded ) . They had not been mashed or otherwise roughly handled so it looks like just defective or poorly engineered packaging for an oily product . The effect is a lot like leaking batteries . The actual amount of leakage was quite small although -- as in other applications of anchovy paste -- a little bit of paste goes a long way . The problem was evident on the bottoms of several of the little cardboard cartons which which obviously had been damp and had a gritty residue of the paste . Since the price is modest and the supply more than ample for my needs , I just pitched out a few and did not complain to the vendor .
5 #### I tried this with my chili and am a believer . It 's the first time for me using paste . I see why people like it and the little extra kick the peppers give it is perfect . I recommend it .
4 #### I really like the paste . It can be used as a layer of flavor in a sauce and it is quick ( instant ) to use . I am a fan of whole or diced sun dried tomatoes and this is pureed . The flavor is good and a little less concentrated than whole canned / jarred tomatoes that I have used ( also a little salty , so be careful with it ) . But still this is a good ingredient to have in the kitchen . I would recommend this to all amazon shoppers ...
5 #### I would rate this a 10 and a normal can of tomatoe paste a -10 . This product will take your cooking to the next solar system -- not a world of difference but much more . It is hard to put into writing what the difference is . My impression is that the tomato paste is from ripe tomatoes and the technique of putting it into a tube is much better . It is also nice to be able to use only the amount that is needed . Just made a concentrated sauce with italian herbs , garlic , olive oil and white wine . Mixed this with ziti pasta and completely changed my quick sauce " go to " menu . Good luck shopping and enjoy your new ingredient !
5 #### Sun dried tomatoes have a heartier taste and I use tomato paste in a tube all the time , to me it is a real cost saver
5 #### In a small container they got it right for me in flavor . I loved the flavor . Too bad it does n't come in a bigger tube .
5 #### We saw Rachel Ray recommend tomato paste in a tube , it made great sense as we never used it because of the waste when buying in a can . Well , we have purchased this brand before , and really liked it . It was much cheaper to buy the pack of 12 compared to buying just 1 tube . Besides , now we can share we the adult children , that also really like it .
5 #### This stuff is so handy to have around . I add it to all kinds of dishes during cooking and it gives such a nice rich flavor to soups , stews , sauces , etc . It is a great product .
4 #### I like everything about having this tomato paste in tubes except one thing : The tubes tend to crack after a while .
5 #### .I hate these long reviewes just get to the point did it get there and was it as shown works great and ad shown
5 #### I have used this product for years and love it . Unfortunately , my local grocery stopped stocking it for some lame brained reason , so I 'm really happy to find it again . This tube is really great to keep on hand . We are a household of two , and buying even the smallest can of paste would leave a lot to go to waste when using in certain recipes . ( I tried freezing the leftover but it was more hassle than anything . ) . With these tubes , I can squirt out a few dabs , recap it and pop it in the frig for another day . The sauce tastes richer than most other tomato pastes I 've tried . This definitely goes on my list to reorder .
5 #### This was shipped in a timely manner , packaged well . I love this product for all my sauces requiring tomato paste . I could never go back to using " canned " tomato paste again . Plus , this lasts in the fridge after opening when a can does not .
3 #### This is the type of ingredient I rarely use ... and then only need a bit for some subtle flavor . This being packaged in the tube form is very handy for my purposes .
5 #### Really great taste , not only in Italian cooking , but almost anything . So much easier and more reasonabley priced than opening a jar , and not knowing when you may use it again .
4 #### One of his favorite ingredients in his spice cabinet . I see him pull it out a lot when he is making his snacks and meals . He likes certain things I am not allowed to have so he makes them himself , especially Italian based meals . Anything with Garlic I ca n't have so the Amore pastes are a wonderful addition to our kitchen !
5 #### Personally , I a severely allergic to garlic , but my Dearly Beloved LOVES it . This is perfect for him as he can add it to his food without contaminating the cooking utensils . I know it smells the same as real garlic and he says it tastes the same . He really likes it a lot !
5 #### Such a good taste for the Sun Dried Tomato Paste ! Good price to match ... and delivered very quickly ! This product is very hard to find on the shelves in the grocery store !
5 #### Amore Tomato sauce has been a staple in my kitchen for years . I use it in my Beef Burgundy recipe that is an adaptation of a Julia Child recipe . I only need one tablespoon so I do n't like opening a can and then having to freeze the leftovers . I also like the flavor of this tomato paste much better than canned . It says it is double concentrated but I just use the same amount called for in any recipe . What I really like to do with this paste is to add it to some Classico Tomato and Basil pasta sauce to make a pizza sauce . It works really well . So this tomato paste is highly flavorful and very convenient . What is not to love ? ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### The texture of this anchovy paste stays super buttery and smooth even after refrigeration and easily squeezes out of the tube ( the opening in the tube is larger than other tubes too which helps in the ease of use ) . When squeezing this into a hot pot of soup , this instantly melted with a little stirring ! The taste is excellent . The shipping and packaging was also top notch . Great product all the way around ! P.S. The expiration dates give you around a year but no worries . If you keep these in cold storage as soon as you get them , they will last far longer than that ( refrigeration helps keep the oils from going rancid ) .
5 #### This product by Amore is one of the three different flavors I often use in my cooking : The other two flavors are sun - dried tomato paste and pesto paste . In very small amounts only because it is salty I use the anchovy paste in my caesar salad dressing , or on pasta , and on crostinis -- Italian or French bread sliced about 1 - 1/2 inches thick -- or on small , round , homemade pizzas which I make from store - bought pizza dough . For the crostinis and pizza , I first brown each side in my cast iron skillet . After they 've cooled a bit , I rub raw garlic on each side and then I drizzle some extra virgin olive oil on each side . When the oil has seeped down into the lightly browned slices of bread or pizza , I squeeze a VERY THIN ribbon of anchovy paste along with some tomato sauce atop each slice . Meanwhile my oven is heating to 375 degrees F , while I apply other toppings , such as shredded cheeses and smoked paprika and herbs or whatever suits my fancy , atop each slice of crostini or small round of pizza . Then I place them onto a parchment paper - lined baking sheet , and slip it into the oven for five to seven minutes . Along with a fresh , tossed salad this makes a tasty meal and certainly satisfies the taste buds of everyone in my family .
5 #### I was introduced to tubed tomato paste a few years ago and have never looked back . Convenience was the huge selling point : no more opening a whole can to use only a little . Of the tubed paste I 've tried , Amore 's taste the best , so it was great to find it available through Amazon 's " Subscribe and Save . " If you 're trying tubed paste for the first time , note that it is in general more concentrated than canned paste . Amore 's label says it is " double concentrated . " I can really tell the difference in dishes that use just a few tablespoons to provide subtle flavor , as in a good minestrone or stroganoff . At first , I suggest you try just a bit more than half the amount of tomato paste called for in your recipes .
5 #### This is the best alternative to using anchovies ! The rich flavor adds much flavor to Caesar dressings , soups , and anything else you can think of . I first learned of it from the Rachael Ray show and love the ease of squeezing a bit in your pan or vinaigrette ! The price is unbeatable and Amore brand is on of the best !
5 #### I 've tried several brands of anchovy paste over the years , and this is a very good one . I mostly use it for flavoring my pasta sauce , which it does quite well . People rave about my sauce , and ask me what my secret is , and usually act shocked when I tell them that anchovy is a big part of the unique flavor .... since 90 % of the people out there " hate " anchovies , or at least they think they do .
5 #### This is a great product , with a true tomato taste . I use it in all kinds of food , including pasta and rice dishes . It has a truly rich flavor and can be used with or without tomato sauce and will hold up on its own . All home chefs and cooks should use this product .
5 #### I see from my Amazon records that I purchased 12 of these tubes on Jan. 4 of 2010 . I 'm ready to order again ! We thoroughly enjoyed the taste , the ease and the storage provided by the Amore Tomato Paste . I used it in braised short ribs , spaghetti sauce , roast beef sandwich spread , vegetable soup - ca n't live without it now .
5 #### We got really tired of opening little cans of tomato paste , then having most of it go to waste in the fridge because a recipe calls for only a tablespoon , or something like that . Enter tomato paste in a tube . What a great idea ! Now , it does n't go bad if I need only a little at a time . I bought this online because my Whole Foods , which carries this brand , does n't ever seem to have it in stock . I guess it 's just that popular . So , I ordered it online . Also ordered the red pepper paste . Yum .
4 #### I bought this because of the dire reports about how unsafe canned tomato products are - something called BPA on the can interiors is leached into the tomatoes because of their high acidity . After I saw that the tubes were metal I emailed Amore to ask about BPA . I give them much credit for repsonding but it turns out these tubes also have BPA so they are no safer than the cans . I will say this tomato paste tastes better ( but not WAY better ) than what I get in cans but I do n't think it 's worth the extra cost . I get three small cans for a buck at Dollar General and theirs has no added salt which to me makes the DG brand a smarter choice . If the Amore was organic then I 'd say it was worth the cost but it is n't .
5 #### This is a great way to save on the use of tomato paste ! I always end up throwing away about half a can of tomato paste when I need some , but with it in these tubes you just squeeze out what you need , put the cap back on and put it in the refrigerator . Not only is it there for your next use it really saves time as well . I love it ! ! ! !
5 #### Tomato paste in a tube ? Well I would n't buy it any other way ! How many times have you only needed a few tablespoons full and then wondered what to do with the rest of the can ? Here 's the solution . The opened tubes will keep for extended periods of time in the refrigerator . I bought a case and have n't wasted a drop .
5 #### Generations of anchovy - hating pizza customers have it all wrong . Anchovies taste less like fish and more like meat . So , in the trash can at some burger joints you 'll see a five - pound can of ' chovies in the trash , but none on the menu , not even in the caesar salad . What 's going on ? The hamburgers , made with relatively flavorless corn - fed beef are being brushed with a mixture of anchovy paste and butter . The result is that beefy taste that you admire in the restaurant and never seem to get at home . You can apply the same magic to soups and stews - anyplace where a subtle addition of meat flavor would be welcome . Anchovy paste in a tube is a convenient and economical way to do this because the product in the tube lasts for a very long time and there 's no waste .

5 #### Have you ever wasted lots of tomato paste because you only needed a small amount from the can for your recipe ? ( The left - over can go bad very quickly . ) Amore Tomato Paste will end that waste , because you can close - up the tube after taking out the tiny amount that you need . Amore also tastes a lot better than the usual supermarket brands available . This is a great product to try . Once you do , you 'll never go back to the supermarket cans !
5 #### I use this ingredient whenever I make pasta and sometimes in soups . Of the tomato , pesto and anchovy tubes I have purchased , this has turned out to be the best purchase .
5 #### Fresh , tangy taste . Love that I can use what I want and put the tube in the fridge .
5 #### Tomato paste in a tube is the best cooking condiment ever -- it is so expensive here in the states , and in Italy it 's about 50 cents a tube . But then there 's the cost of going to Italy just for tomato paste in a tube . In bulk on Amazon , it 's incredibly affordable , and I have a supply until I can accumulate enough miles to fly to italy again . Yum .
5 #### Great product , good price . I am very satisfied . My thanks !
5 #### Thought I would try this in place of olive oil . There was no after taste and I found that I did n't burn food as easily as I have on occasion .
3 #### its very light , is great for making salad dressings .. too expensive for such a small bottle though.saw this on dr.show , so gave it a try
5 #### One of my doctors recommended I try this oil . It is heart healthy . Also , it does not smoke at high temperatures and adds no flavor to any food you cook . I do not like cooking with olive oil , so I decided to try this oil . It is wonderful . Makes delicious dishes . The flavor of the food comes thru , not the oil . I highly recommend you try the oil .
5 #### If you were to imagine drinking hot chocolate in an ice storm , that might be close to the experience of smooth chocolaty bliss merging with ice crystals slipping through a straw and melting onto your tongue . Ingredients : Sugar , non - fat dry milk , dextrose and cocoas processed with alkali . The blend of cocoa powders is especially rich and smooth . This is a super fast dessert to make because all you do is put milk ( even nonfat milk works ) in a blender , add the packet of cocoa and then blend with a few cups of ice . Within seconds of sharing this with my husband , we both knew we had been drinking this beverage too fast . Brain freeze ! You can drink this much faster than a milkshake . You have been warned . It is tempting and delicious , but may need to be sipped more slowly ... or not . Optional toppings include whipped cream and of course chocolate shavings . Sipping this while wearing Opium perfume is a fun experience . It seems to enhance the experience and add new levels to the chocolate perfection . Oh I think I feel a sugar rush coming on ... My favorite way to drink this : 1 . Turn on heating blanket when the weather turns cold . 2 . Climb into bed wearing something silky . 3 . Sip away while reading poetry . So delicious ! ~The Rebecca Review
5 #### Got this as a gift for my boss and she seemed to like it !
1 #### Disappointed with the quality of this product . Would suggest buying a good hot cocoa mix at your local grocery store .
5 #### Gave this as a gift and the receiver likes it very much . So I heard .
5 #### OMG this is so good . I had to keep it out of sight so it was n't jumping off the shelf everytime I passed thru the kitchen .
5 #### This can be hard to find it specialty stores so it 's great I can buy it on Amazon . It is really really good and easy to make . My kids love to make it for themselves . The taste is very smooth and no preservatives and no aftertaste .
5 #### THE BEST Frrrozen Hot choclate EVER ! A little spendy , but it 's meant for a once in a while treat .. WE LOVE IT !
5 #### Got a can of this stuff on clearance at tjmaxx for $ 2 and wow is this stuff good ! Kinda like a frozen liquid Heath bar , but a better gourmet version . Very rich decadent flavor for a powdered drink Might actually be worth the retail price
3 #### 1 . Do n't get your hopes up - It wo n't be like what you had at Serendipity , cause when you try to emulate foodstuffs at home it 's never quite the same . 2 . It 's still chocolate which is always a resounding " YUM " . 3 . You can prepare " frozen " hot chocolate from any cheap - o HC mix or cocoa powder . 4 . A kitchky gift when you ca n't think of anything else to get someone .
2 #### This stuff is just a powdery waste of money . I wo n't buy it again , ever . You 'd do better with packets of swiss miss ...
3 #### I received the Serendipity Frozen Hot Chocolate Mix today - I was anxcious to try it after reading all the reviews . I followed the directions and I have to say - I was not impressed . It tasted like chocolate milk . Maybe it tastes better at Serendipity in NYC . I wo n't be ordering this again . But at least I can say I tried it . :(
5 #### On a recent trip to NYC , I stopped by Serendipity 3 and could n't help but try their signature frozen hot chocolate . It was so creamy and decadent with such rich choclate flavor . I picked up a few packets of mix before I left ( same packs that are sold on here ... they also sell this canister mix at the store ) . I made one for the first time at home this past weekend and it was so deliciously chocolatey and tasted surprisingly similar to the hot chocolate I got in the restaurant . This does not have a malt choclate flavor , it 's definitely like a frozen version of a rich hot chocolate . I think it 's fabulous and would definitely buy it again ! You can also add a jigger of vodka or kaluha for a bit of added punch . :) Enjoy !
5 #### This is an excellent product , easy to make and true to the shop 's most popular item . I find it very difficult to get true chocolate flavor from almost any manufactured item , it always seems to be missing that deep flavor . I was pleasantly surprised with Serendipity , they nailed it . The cost is a little high but I do n't think you could do any better price - wise at home buying all the different kinds of chocolates used . The best way to describe the flavor is deep cocoa . It 's rich and dark , like hot chocolate . It tastes nothing at all like a milkshake although it 's is cold . The canister is a nice improvement over the pouches , you get to customize the flavor a little easier . Because of the cost , it 's a once in a while treat for us and it is a favorite . Buy with confidence , it 's a delicious product .
1 #### I Ordered this and waited for two weeks -- NEVER recieved it . I Emailed and asked where it was , and said if Not shipping soon , cancel it . They Cancelled it . Obviously Not in stock and this COMPANY does nt care about sales . No attempt to send it to me . I will Find it elsewhere I guess . This was for the cannister .
5 #### WHat a delight to find that Serendipity is selling their Frozen Hot Chocolate and their wonderful serving bowl on line . It brings me back to when I was 18 , almost 50 years ago when I went to Serendipity with my boyfriend . I had this fabulous float and have had it whenever I could get to Serendipity . In New York and then in Westpot Ct . where they were there for a short time . Now living in the midwest , I was thrilled to see I could get the whole package and bring back fond memories as I open the box and make myself that delight that only Serendipity makes .
5 #### I live now in the midwest , however when lived in Connecticut and N.Y. I went to Serendipity whenever I could . This mix brings back fond memories and the best frozen hot choclate ever . Happy they are selling it in the large size . Now I can have it whenever I want it .
5 #### sent to a family who had enjoyed the frozen hot chocolate at serendipity in NYC , and they loved it .
3 #### Maybe if I cold get raw pork here it might be fantastic , but the flavor is n't bold enough when using on pre - cooked pork sausage as a marinade or glaze .
4 #### Very tastly -almost like what we get in Hawaii . I did add a bit of powdered red pepper to it though to give it more of a kick Very easy to make also .
5 #### USE A WHOLE SECTION OF PORK SHOULDER . GRIND IT USE THE SEASONING REGRIND AND COVER , LET SET IN THE REFRIGERATOR OVER NIGHT AT LEAST 12 HOURS AND THEN FORM YOUR OWN PATTIES OR STUFF INTO CASSINGS . YOU CAN FREEZE FOR FUTURE USE . I AM PORTUGUESE AND BELIEVE ME THIS IS RIGHT ON THE MARK . BUT BEING PORTUGUESE ALSO MEANS I HAD MORE GARLIC .. LOL
5 #### I really enjoyed using this seasoning with my chicken . Works great for me . I am planning to have friends over for dinner and will use this product on two chickens . I believe that they will enjoy this product too .
5 #### I have been having a hard time finding red hots . So I thought I would go to my favorite shopping site to pick up a good supply for my apple jelly making process . The red hots make a good cinnamon flavor and also make the jelly nice and red ! This process was easy and the quality was perfect !
5 #### I ordered these to use in candy apple jelly . They are SO GOOD ! Nice hot kick and gave the jelly a great red color . The price was better than any around and the quality top notch .
5 #### It is so nice to be able to purchase these year round . They are always fresh and taste great . Love shopping online .
3 #### Yes , it is only OK . I was disappointed and will not buy it again .. It just not have the orange taste that was expected/
2 #### I suggest choosing another brand of candied orange peel . This brand is sweet but with a very mild almost unidentifiable orange flavor .
5 #### I have used half the shipment so far and am very pleased with the yield . Most of the seeds sprout and there 's very little waste . I would buy these again when I run out .
5 #### What a PRICEY item but it sprouted well . NEVER again will the budget let us do this however ..... What a glitch this was in ordering !
5 #### Great price and quality of seed . healthy alternative to salads and fresher ! Organic and sprouts great Good all round company !
5 #### Reliable store . Alfalfa is a natural mineral and vitamin supplement , and easy to grow . It contains calcium , magnesium , phosphorous and potassium , and many vitamins . It is rich in chlorophyll and is recommended to treat arthritis . It should be taken every day , and can take about 2 months for results to show .
5 #### This product is a great product for cake pops . I have used oil but it separates if not worked in well . This does n't seem to separate as much and makes the candy taste exactly the same .
4 #### Works great . After working with candy melts for over 10 years now and using Crisco this is way better . Made my cake pop dipping experience more pleasurable . Wish I splurged for this years ago . The only negative is the darn price . The price is ridiculously high for the amount you get .
5 #### Boy do I love this stuff ! Works great for thinning out candy melts and making them smoother for my gourmet strawberries !
3 #### I read so many reviews saying this was the best and no matter how much or how little I used , it still did n't make for easy dipping for cake pops . I was pretty dissaponted .
2 #### Not worth price . Too little amount for that price . Cheaper in stores . Also a bit stake for that price .
5 #### I love natural almonds and found these to be great for snacking . Very fresh and tasty . These would be good for making your own almond milk . I will purchase again .
3 #### They look good but not yet opened . Freshness with any nuts is an issue wit me . WE'll see later.what I think .
5 #### wonderful taste , fresh - best I have found would recommend these to anyone who eats nuts for snacks , I carry them in my handbag and have a bag by my bed ... just love them
5 #### This worked phenomenally . It thinned out my candy melts and made it a little easier to dip . I have used vegetable shortening in the past , but it caused the candy melts to take a longer time to harden .
5 #### I 've used shortening and oil to melt candy melts , but paramount crystals worked the best . They did n't compromise the taste of the candy melts either .
5 #### These are great I had been trying to use some White Chocolate melts and it was so thick it was almost impossible to dip Oreo 's in it . After adding some of the crystals it worked much better , it thinned out the chocolate however it still dried hard . Much easier and works so much better than the shortening that was recommended to me .
5 #### If you 're going to be making cake balls or cake pops , you really need to have these on hand ! If your chocolate starts getting hard to work with or starts turning white , you can melt these crystals and add them to the chocolate and it will be as good as new . These add the oil back into the chocolate and make it easier to dip in and will make the finished product come out better . I do n't know what I 'd do without these !
5 #### Before using this product , I was using shortening to thin my chocolate coatings . The Paramount Crystals work much better . It also makes the coatings smoother .
5 #### whenever i make cake pops , it 's difficult when you dip the pop into the chocolate . it 's usually too thick and weighs the cake pop down . i ve used vegetable oil , but the chocolate gets a greasy texture to it . i love the paramount crystals because just a few flakes lightens the chocolate without making it greasy
5 #### This is a delicious black China tea blend presented in a beautiful , tin box .
5 #### This is love in a cup : the strength of black tea ... forbidden spices ... and hints of orange that leave me longing for more .
5 #### This tea must have crack in it . That 's all I have to say on this subject .
5 #### Smells great , sort of taste like earl grey . High quality tea .
5 #### Delightful aroma and taste . Sealed in a plastic bag inside the metal tin to retain freshness . Sensuous , medium bodied , black tea with essences of vanilla , orange , clove and magic . I drink a cup before work when I 'm needing a little motivation to tackle a challenging day , and I brew a pot for my ultimate Saturday morning tea ritual . This is not a caffeine jolt . It 's to please the senses .
5 #### A very satisfying cup of tea morning or afternoon . Prince Vladimir is a refreshing morning picker upper and an afternoon stalwart . Try it soon !
5 #### Our favorite flavor of tea ! But I almost took away one star because this teabag form does n't produce a cup of tea that tastes quite as good as the loose leaf version , so I 'm a little disappointed . I 'm not going to ding them for that though , because that is to be expected and I had a choice . Also , as it turns out , the teabags are proving more convenient .
5 #### This is very tasty tea . I was n't sure I wanted to pay this much for tea- but a friend of mine basically twisted my arm into trying two of these flavors- and darned if she was n't right . These are the most delicious teas i 've ever had . They are floral , without being cloying , and they are n't bitter at all . I get about 3 glasses per tea bag- and the flavor- well it 's fantastic . Hard to describe all the notes- and they change from cup to cup(as you reuse the tea bags new notes emerge ) . I want to try all the Kusmi teas now- and if you like tea , you should at least try them .
2 #### Chalk this up as a lesson to not get roped in by hype . This is not a bad tea , but it 's far from the " amazing ! " taste experience I expected . It 's basically a riff on Earl Grey . The tea * smells * amazing , and from the moment you open the package to while you impatiently wait for it to brew , you have this idea in your head that it 's going to be a creamy , cardamom - y , deep rich Earl Grey unlike you 've ever experienced . But the party I was expecting for my taste buds never materialized . I tried brewing it 3 separate times , with three different infusing methods , and using different amounts of tea each time , but the result was always the same - a subtle , creamy and surprisingly smooth blend with little tannin bitterness ( a common Kusmi trait , so I gather ) , but nothing .... great . I always sweeten tea because sugar brings out flavors and spices . I could appreciate what the blend was trying to accomplish , I just expected more based on the amazing smell that wallops you in the nose when you crack the package open . Be sure to sample before you drop $ 19 on this , just so you know what you 're getting into . If you 're already a fan of Earl Grey , there 's not much more that this offers in terms of taste or body .
5 #### Love this tea , bought it to substitute my afternoon coffee for a little pick - me - up . Bergamot in this tea reminds me of Earl Grey which used to be my favorite black tea until I found this one . Black teas sometimes upset my stomach but not this one , I can comfortably drink it without lemon&sugar . The tin is large and will last for a while .
5 #### Amazing flavor as usual from Kusmi . One of my favorites .
5 #### If you enjoy breakfast tea but want something a little different , I think this is a great choice . I love a strong black tea but am personally not a fan of very spice - heavy teas like chai -- I like to drink those on occasion but not every day . This tea , however , I can drink every day ! It has just the right amount of subtle spice to make it stand out from my favorite English / Irish breakfast tea . Read the other reviews for a more nuanced description ... words fail me . Normally I feel like I ca n't get a worthwhile second cup from a tea bag -- the taste is just too weak -- but this tea goes the extra cup . :) I would definitely buy this again .
5 #### This is one of my favorite flavored teas . Just love it brewed strong with some sweetened condensed milk . This is good hot or cold .
5 #### I 've never used preserved lemons before and since my husband and I like to try new ( for us ) and exotic ( again , for us ) recipes , we found one that used these lemons . They had gotten good reviews and so I ordered this brand . They 're wonderful , intense and yet subtle with that wonderful lemon taste . We made a wonderful duck dish and these absolutely enhanced the food . Very good quality and we plan to keep a jar around as a staple .
5 #### Better than my homemade . Not as strong as I have used but after one use got to know how much to add . Works great in salad dressings without adding a lot of juice that separates from the oils . Nice jar as a bonus . Looks good in the fridge .
5 #### Wonderful firm flavorful lemons , that are easy to slice and do not turn to mush . I use them in sauces and dressings
5 #### Lovely preserved lemons in a pretty little jar . A very nice size as I do n't use preserved lemons all that frequently but I like to have them on hand . I used 4 quarters in a tagine last night and they were delicious . I will definitely reorder these !
5 #### This stuff is SO amazingly good . SO amazingly good . I ran to my Mac to write this review 10 minutes after eating it on a pumpernickel bagel with vegan cream cheese , toasted of course . IT WAS SO INCREDIBLE . I will keep this in my house permanently .
5 #### This stuff is so yummy . I bought a jar in Napa about a year ago . I took it to work and we ate it over cream cheese with crackers . Soooo good ! ! ! I decided to check amazon and could n't believe they had it . I ordered two jars . Yum !
5 #### I only purchased one jar , some time ago , but I must admit that it tasted great . I had purchased several other jars of other jams , to try them out , but this was the winner . I never bought another jar , only because , watching my diet , I am holding off eating jam .
5 #### I love this jam . I use it as a condiment with pork but it would also be great with chicken . I 've also used it over cream cheese as an horderve . It 's got a little " kick " to it but not too spicy . I was thrilled to find it online as the stores in my area do n't seem to carry it .
5 #### I love Damson Plum jams , preserves , all - used to be home made by my grandmother - and could n't find it anywhere . This is wonderful .
5 #### I should check to see if I could buy stock in this Brit business - this is the best Damson Preserve I found since Grandma 's homemade years ago .
5 #### when jar broken in transit , company air mailed a replacement . Excellent quality product .
5 #### This is clearly the best damson plum jam I have been able to find . It is a little sweeter than my taste , but still miles above others I have tried .
4 #### I bought these preserves because my mom made Damson Plum jelly when I was a child and I wanted to relive my childhood . The preserves were good , but not the same as " homemade . " They are too expensive to have on a regular basis , so would only buy again if I needed them for a special occasion .
5 #### Excellent product ! If you like Damson Plums , this is the jam for you . Taste is exquisite . will definitely reorder this product ! .
5 #### The house where I grew up was located on a six acre plot on the edge of a small town . We had a milk cow , two pigs and my Dad grew potatoes and corn . We had a small orchard , and next to it were two small damson trees . My mother would harvest the damsons and make damson preserves . I loved the sweet , tart taste . Now , eighty years later , I discovered this product on Amazon . It brings back wonderful memories from long ago ( I 'm 87 years old ) . The taste of damson preserves is quite unique and I know you will like it .
5 #### This preserves praise and I bestow it . Once again Tiptree blends with grandeur . i do n't know their secrets and I dare n't ask .
5 #### We bought this for my husband , who is a Jelly Belly monster . He has absolutely no portion control when it comes to this candy . We bought it for his Christmas because other reviewers indicated that only 3 - 4 beans come out at a time . PERFECT ! We set it to be used with coins , so he is totally aware of when he is going back for more and he loves the forced self control while enjoying his candy of choice . We highly recommend the mini bean machine .
3 #### Got this as a gift for the office and it does n't take much space . This looks like a very small machine when you get it but it does hold a lot of jelly beans . Having a candy dispenser is more sanitary than having a candy bowl , especially at work when you do n't know ( think about it ! ) . I might be getting it for the home too . Anyways , it does jam every day . The coin operation is not disabled because I read a review that it works better when you do n't disable it but I 'm starting to think otherwise . A penny is the only coin used and it shoots out 3 - 4 jelly beans at a time . Have n't tried any other coin either .
5 #### I gave one of these to each of my grandsons . They loved it .
5 #### My teen boys and their friends love this . I have to get more candy for it .
4 #### i got excellent feedback on this has a gift
5 #### It was a gift for a child . She loves the fact that it can take coins . It 's metal base .
5 #### This is a very cute , vintage style candy machine . Purchased for my 17yo daughter 's room and she loved it . It 's glass and metal , not plastic .
5 #### I love this tea , it is now my favorite , and was sorry to not be able to find it anywhere this winter season . My guess is that it is just that popular . Celestial Seasonings Candycane tea with a bit of carob added to it is also one of their best . Diane
5 #### my favorite tea , ca n't find in stores sometimes , easy to order from amazon.com
5 #### I always look in the stores for this particular tea at Christmas time . Since I did n't find it this last Christmas , I ordered 6 boxes on the internet . Ca n't do without it .
5 #### I love Twinings Earl Grey Tea and I was thrilled that Amazon is carrying it at such a great price . Thanks Amazon
5 #### This tea is the perfect wake - up beverage when I stumble out of bed . It really does give you that much - needed " oomph " to start out with . I recently weaned myself from coffee and a friend suggested Twinings . I bought the sampler package and settled on two favorites ; Irish Breakfast in the mornings and Lady Grey in the afternoon . It is rather strong though , depending on how long you let it steep . I would suggest the minimum the first time just to get an idea of the flavor ; at first I used a little half - and - half and a dallop of honey , but now I prefer it straight - up , just because I do n't have that kind of time .
5 #### I knew this decaf tea by Amazon.com I have to recomended because is the only decaf tea that I know have a tea taste ..... Is delicious ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Twinings have the most delicious tea that I tried ! ! ! ! ! ! ! and the price is so convenient ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Trust me , try this decaf tea .......
4 #### My husband and I have started to drink tea instead of coffee , and we are liking the change . We have English Breakfast in the morning and peppermint or camomile in the afternoon and evening . We really like the peppermint and its especially soothing to the stomach , while still giving us a nice afternoon lift . We appreciate that this tea is Organic and Fair Trade Certified ! I trust Twinings teas and highly recommend them !
5 #### As long as the price makes it reasonable to order through Subscribe & save , I 'll continue to do so .
2 #### Arrived on time , however , in opened package . Will not buy again .
5 #### Twinnings makes a great general and basic Earl Grey . It 's got that hint of floral to it without being overbearing and it smells amazing . It 's always consistant which is great too . The giant box lasts about 2 + months in my house and is a wonderful deal and saves on going out for tea and coffee . If you like Earl Grey you will probably like this tea .
5 #### This tea is DA BOMB ! I first tried it at Epcot earlier this year . I bought it here . My first try at making it was a failure and I did n't think I 'd like it . I found the trick for me is to use more water when I make it . I fill a 20 oz . stainless steel tumbler with ice & water and then pop a tea bag in it for 5 - 10 minutes . I get perfect Peach Iced Tea every time . I 've also popped a tea bag into a cold 16.9 ounce bottled water for 5 - 10 minutes and that worked perfectly too . I love that I do n't have to make a half gallon of tea , but can just make an individual serving whenever I want one . I like my tea without sweeteners or lemon ... just the plain tea and this is tea is perfect for that . I 'm not a pop drinker . This is a great alternative to just plain water .
3 #### Tasty but very expensive they have the same brand cheaper at Kroger in my town
5 #### My boyfriend always drink this tea for his whole life and he smell like this earl grey too !
5 #### Nice , strong minty tea , can re - use bag for a 2nd very large cup .
5 #### If you like your tea strong , this is the tea for you .
4 #### Twinings Lemon & Ginger Herbal Tea has a zesty citrus flavour of lemon . I love drinking this caffeine free tea in the afternoon while sitting on the couch relaxing with my tray next to me with a lit peony candle , reading magazines and of course sipping me Twinings Lemon & Ginger Tea . I love enjoying the comforting herbal tea made of spicy ginger and the tangy flavor of lemon which is the perfect combination for a afternoon tea . I simply boil some water in my kettle and when the kettle whistles I pour it in my mug dip the tea bag and wait for it to cool down a bit and for the tea bag to release the tea flavor . The zesty lemon is my favorite part and taste of the tea because its refreshing . One of my other favorite parts of this herbal tea is that its 100 % natural ! I ve had similar teas but this Twinings tea is by far my favorite and most delicious and with intense flavor . Its great way to perk you up
5 #### Steeped 6 bags in milk to make an earl grey custard . Delicious .
4 #### Great tea . Love mixing it with the Pomegranate , Raspberry flavored green tea
3 #### It did n't taste bad , it just did n't have much flavor .
5 #### Although it is called Irish Breakfast Tea , it is terrific any time of the day . I drink a lot of tea and this is my favorite .
1 #### I love pumpkin - flavored anything . But this stuff smelled fizzy and tasted like rot . I 'm so disappointed .
5 #### The best cold brew ever . I give packs to my family and friends
3 #### Always enjoy Earl Gray . Did miss that this was a weaker version of the tea and if I plan more tha n a small cup usually need two bags so the pricing is not so terrific after all . It was easy to miss that this is a " lighter " version of the traditional tea .
5 #### Love this tea ... I mix and match for different flavors and it 's all good !
3 #### I DID NOT LIKE THE FLAVOR OF THIS TEA . I FOUND IT TO BE BLAND COMPARED TO OTHER TWININGS TEAS
5 #### Another great selection of flavors in black tea to use for our Mother 's Day Tea for 100 plus people . Gives a nice selection of flavors with many choices .
5 #### So smooth , never bitter no matter how long you let the bag sit in the water . Naturally caffeine - free , this makes a great bedtime tea and blends nicely with chamomile or other flavors .
5 #### Great combination of flavors , sweet and citrus calling to one 's taste buds from winter 's doldrums
5 #### My all time favorite black tea . The only complaint I have is the price . I treat myself every few months by rationing it out . Kinda adds to the specialness of english breakfast tea . Worth a box now and then .
5 #### Rich , full flavor , quality tea at a very good price . Prompt shipping . Would purchase again .
5 #### We 've been on an international tea kick lately . We recently bought a Scottish breakfast tea , Teaton 's UK classic tea , then this box of Twinings , not to mention two boxes of tea from China ! Anyway , first about the packaging . The box it comes in is very flimsy and shallow and wide . I wish they had divided the tea into four smaller boxes because if you are n't careful , if you squeeze this box you could spill a bunch of bags . The tea is a rich amber , and very fragrant . Although it 's English tea , we even enjoy a cup at night . A little bit of Splenda and creamer and it is very delicious . We wo n't have to buy this again for a while as we probably have 500 bags of tea ! LOL . But most likely we 'll buy again . A nice cup of coffee and very affordable . Recommended !
5 #### Basic english tea and delicious . I first tried this at the British Museum in London as this is what they use for their cafe . Delicious with cream and sugar if that is how you take your cuppa . Mine was shipped crushed by Amazon , my only complaint .
2 #### Need two tea bags to get a decent taste . Would not purchase again
5 #### I like my tea strong with milk and PG Tips is perfect . It always tastes good even when I buy an enormous package that lasts a long time .
5 #### Add a bit of honey for a tasty bedtime treat
5 #### Mild green tea with just the right amount of flavor . No bitterness . One of our favorite green teas .
5 #### A lovely cup of tea . Great body and great with a little honey .
5 #### I drink this tea a lot and have already ordered more
4 #### Good product --- although I really wanted decaf at the time . Not sure whether I goofed or the company goofed . But its still organic and chai . Very good & very good . I do n't plan to buy decaf in the future and will prioritize organic products . The thing is I used to get dizzy and shaky with cafeeinated teas so I would n't use them . Lately , those symptoms are gone ! Now I can go ahead and use these products I ordered by mistake . One way I found to use strongly caffeinate teas is to add one or two bags to tall glass of spring water I keep in the frig . Slightly flavors the water but does n't give a huge hit of caffeine all at once .
5 #### This is a reorder . My family love EARL GRAY tea in all forms and brands . Got 2 big boxs daughter keep one at home and took one to work with her .
5 #### This was a great deal for PG Tips tea . I love that this tea always tastes fresh and clean with no bitterness . I will definitely buy again .
4 #### Taste is fine , have to work to get enough flavor out of the bag for a anything larger than an average size cup .
5 #### I really enjoy drinking this green mint tea , my daughter - in - law introduced to it and I ordered a case !
5 #### Had this at a local caf and loved it . Not in any local stores so I found it on Amazon . Lovely mild flavor . Makes great iced tea as well .
5 #### My all new favorite tea ! This is good stuff ! More taste than what I usually get . I mean it 's not a HUGE difference but it 's enough to make me switch tea brands . Yummy .....
4 #### FYI ! These " pyramid " bags are still paper tea bags . I can taste the difference between the non paper mesh tea bags and paper bags . I was expecting these to be the mesh bags . They are just your standard paper tea bags that are shaped as pyramids . Rather disappointed with them .
5 #### Fantastic tea - cost a bit more , but is worth the little extra . Tea bag steeps quickly and tea taste great .
3 #### This is not what I would expect for British tea . Rather weak . Stash won our taste test .
5 #### I do n't even like green tea that much , but I love this !
5 #### Two or three of these Twinings cold brewed peach flavored teabags mixed with two or three Luzianne black tea bags makes a fantastic pitcher of peach flavored iced tea .
5 #### First time trying this tea and although it is a stronger tea than what I am used to it has good flavor and I like it . It is the first tea I have ever bought that you actually get two good cups out of one tea bag . Normally the second cup is a little weak but not with this tea . Because the tea is strong I let the first cup seep for 2 minutes . Any longer and there is a bitter after taste . Then on the second cup I let it seep 3 minutes . Both cups come out perfect . If you are a tea drinker I recommend you try this .
5 #### I love the way a pyramid tip sticks up out of the cup to make it easy to fish the bag out without having to chase a string around . Delicious tea !
5 #### Love the flavor of this tea . I ca nt say enough about it . I order from a vendor on Amazon located across the pond so it takes a few weeks to arrive . I plan ahead for that because the savings is worth it .
2 #### I expected much more from an english tea . Not even as much flavor as the normal tea bags I can get at the grocery store .
5 #### This is the absolute best black tea I have had in a long time , and the price was amazing for 80 bags ! Love it !
5 #### Excellent Full bodied Black Tea . Best part is individually packaged bags which is very important for tea if you are into taste and fragrance . It has better than average in caffeine kick and goes well with soya milk ( if you are on non diary diet )
5 #### Read about these in a book - decided to try them and so happy I did .
5 #### The only tea that satisfies my English husband . I love the decaf version . Great flavor . You ca n't go back to weak tea after drinking this !
5 #### Love this tea , & it 's really expensive in the stores , so very happy I found it here . Update 10/2017 - ordered more as ca n't do without it & continue to order .
5 #### This blend is my favorite winter - time blend of tea .
5 #### I live in the US and since black tea is my favorite tea , i started looking into good quality ones , since i was a bit bored with the local US brands . Something in them was missing . I kept coming across PG Tips , read up a bit on the history , and finally gave in and bought it , figuring that if anyone made a good black tea , it 'd be the English . And goodness am i glad i did buy it ! It 's what i 'd always imagined a decent black tea should taste like . It 's nice , very rich , and so so very smooth without any bitterness . With a bit of milk and sugar it goes well with practically every breakfast and sometimes i 'll even have it with my lunch , or after dinner . I really like that the flavor is n't weakened by the milk and i also really enjoy the lack of a caffeine crash , as is experienced sometimes with coffee . Now , i 'll always love coffee , but PG Tips is definitely my new favorite alternative . The listing on here is definitely worth the value as you get your money 's worth and a solid heap of quality tea bags . The English definitely know their tea !
5 #### Best British tea in the world . We drink at least three cups ( with milk and sugar ) every day . Wife is British so hope there is never another Boston Tea Party . Would hate to see all that good tea go to waste .
5 #### Arrived quickly from the UK . Delicious tea and will buy again .
5 #### Delicious . I had tried this and loved it . So glad Amazon had it for sale . My new favorite herbal tea .
5 #### Absolutely love the mixed berries cold brew tea . I wanted a berry tea that was also a black tea and this is exactly what I wanted ! It has a great tea flavor with a hint of berries . Also , since it 's cold brew it makes it convenient to take it to work and make a quick cup of tea !
5 #### Best English Breakfast tea in my opinion . There 's some thing soothing about a hot cup of tea . I enjoy drinking y his tea both hot ( splash of milk ) and cold ( plain over ice ) . Its a delucious tea blend .
5 #### Wife needs her daily morning dose of Tea . Have been buying it for the last 2 years .
5 #### When my local Whole Foods and other grocery stores stopped carrying this , I turned to Amazon . I love it for iced or hot tea .
5 #### Absolutely . I use a large cup and a teabag of black tea - usually Twinings Prince of Wales and 1 - 2 packets of stevia . This makes a perfect cup of tea for me .
5 #### Being a Brit in the U.S of A. I love that I can get some good ol' PG Tips to enjoy and at a fantastic price ! Love good coffee too , but when I want a nice , robust cup o'tea , this is my go to !
5 #### These are the best . Have to have these when my English friend visits .
5 #### Delicious ! I 'm a big Twinings fan . Their teas are always smooth and never acidic like some other brands .
4 #### Very good quality and taste , but I confess that I like plain old Liptons just a little bit more .
5 #### Wife loves the tea ! If she 's happy , I 'm happy .
5 #### There is PG tips and there is everything else . The perfect cuppa .
5 #### PG 's black tea is excellent . No need to look for any other black tea , this is perfectly balanced .
5 #### I reorder frequently . Best sweet tea mix 1 Bag Black Currant Tea 3 Bags Black Tea ( Lipton or other ) Steep 10 minutes and dilute to 1 gallon Sweeten and enjoy ..... Awesome by the cup hot too ....
5 #### I just love this tea . I gave several other teas a chance ( I was trying to go organic and then I was trying to go cheaper . ) But after almost a year of suffering , I 'm back to Twinings .
5 #### I love black tea . I love PG tips . Bold yet smooth .
5 #### Mom loves this tea . Easy to order here and keep her supplied .
5 #### Great herbal tea , I drink this all the time , especially before bed as it 's naturally caffeine free .
5 #### Huge fan of Twinings ! I have tried many different brands for Darjeeling since it 's my favorite Black Tea but Twinings is still the best store brand I could find .
2 #### Item delivered did not match the item shown . The Peppermint Tea shown is organic , the tea I received is not organic .
5 #### My mother - in - law will drink nothing else without a complaint , so I love it . She 's used to british style tea overseas and hates everything else .
5 #### This tea is truly delicious ! It has very nice tea color too .
5 #### I was amazed at the bargain this was ! I expected to find one , but there were four or so and the price was amazing .
5 #### One of the best tasting bagged tea ever ! Brick and Mortars all sold out- Great Service from this vendor . Thank YOU ! Yes Price was a bit cheaper than the brick and mortars .
5 #### I tried this Nightly Calm tea as part of an herbal variety pack and loved it - it has a " spearminty " sort of flavor but is n't overpowering , very soothing pleasant tea for before bed . I love this , the Pomegranate Raspberry and both Earl and Lady Grey teas . I have purchased from Amazon and Twinnings directly and the price really is close enough that a few extra dollars for fast prime shipping is worth it . Excellent tea !
5 #### I love my english tea . However , given that I now live in the US , and still like my english breakfast tea ( with milk and sugar ) , I could not be happier that I now discovered this on Amazon . I can now enjoy my favorite tea at home .
5 #### My absolute favorite brand of tea . No others can compare .
5 #### I certainly have n't tried all the teas I want to try - but this is my current favorite - especially for breakfast . very nice and comforting with milk and sugar .
5 #### Love love love this tea like you just ate a tangerine . Delicous ! ! ! ! !
5 #### This tea has a very robust taste which I love . It is getting hard to find in stores , so getting here was a great find .
5 #### I LOVE THIS TEA ALSO- MY OTHER FAVORITE BRAND
5 #### I love Twinings Tea . Love the individual wrapped tea bags so you always know what you are pulling out of the tea cache .
5 #### The best tea I have found . Makes a nice strong cup .
5 #### 2 bags in a six cup pot is perfect . Great family favorite . If you happen to forget the bags in the pot it takes forever before it gets bitter .
5 #### The best tea does n't need to cost a fortune . Good enough for high tea
5 #### I first had PG Tips on a cruise and have been drinking it ever since . I use one bag in a large mug & it gives me delicious flavorful tea every time .
5 #### I like the no strings or tags . Amazon sells this for much cheaper than what I would have to spend at the grocery store . I use it mostly for sun tea . Usually three " bags " are sufficient for a half gallon jar but I also enjoy the occasional " cuppa " It is pricier than other brands but is closer to the loose tea flavor I experienced while living in England without having to deal with the loose tea leaves .
5 #### PG Tips has been my brand for years . Consistent flavor with every box . I buy the large box for home and this smaller box for work as the little pyramid baggies seem to grow legs and walk off .
5 #### Makes a great cuppa , been hooked for years , not always easy to find .
5 #### Strong ! I only use these in a really big mug because it 's a very strong tea ! Tastes different than I 'm used to but it 's not bad . Would n't want it all the time , though . If I really needed a jolt , I prefer Irish breakfast tea .
5 #### I learned about this African tea when I read The # 1 Ladies Detective Agency series which is is set in Botswana . It is delicious and healthful . Check it out at Dean and Deluka . It costs 10 times as much .
1 #### Regardless of what the picture shows what is shipped is not organic and is not as displayed . It is the same brand and the same type of tea .
5 #### Ooh , baby , if you like strong flavors , and flavors I call odd , this is for you . Woodsy and smoky are two descriptive words that come to mind . I had read about this tea and did n't see it in any local stores , so I took a chance and bought a multi - pack here ( Single pack prices -- if available -- are just too high for me to justify . ) . What an interesting , new discovery !
5 #### My very favorite tea ! Discovered it at English Tea Cup in Denver and have been hooked on it ever since !
5 #### PG Tips is the best tea out there ! This is a staple item in our family and we use it everyday . We love the strong blend that surpasses many of the other weaker brands out there . Highly recommend this item .
5 #### What can you say , it 's everyday English tea , completely unpretentious and great to drink .
5 #### Best UK tea I have found in the states .
5 #### Chai Tea is great and Twinings is the best . What more can I say ? I ordered 4 boxes .
5 #### This tea is awesome ! I like tea that I can have milk and sugar with and this is it !
5 #### If you like black tea then this is the Cat 's Meow .
5 #### Best tea in the world ... OK maybe not the best but damn good tea .
5 #### I have tried so many teas ! Builders , twinings , smith , barry 's , yorkshire , organics , hand - selected full leaf- you name it ! But to my palate , nothing matches pg tips . I love the bold flavor , and its smoothness . Takes milk very nicely . I buy mine at the grocers , so though i am a regular shopper on amazon , so far i have not had to buy my tea here . I wanted to give a shout - out to my favorite brand . I steep mine for 2 minutes , then add whole milk . I look forward to this every morning .
5 #### Solid , strong black tea ! It stands up to milk and sugar . Just be careful of all the little tea dust that leaks out of the box
5 #### Sent as a gift to my Mother . It has become her favorite tea . Not easy to find in local supermarkets so Amazon comes in very handy .
5 #### My go - to everyday cup and a great bag for iced tea . It was my first Brit brand and I have n't looked back at Lipton , Luzianne , nor the dialed back weak spined USA Twinings and Tetley versions . PG Tipps is a good introduction to the real tea the rest of the world drinks . Good tasty basic cuppa !
5 #### This tea is wonderful . I like my tea strong and there is plenty of tea leaves in each bag for a mug of water .
5 #### My ' taste of home ' . I have lived in the USA for over three years now and a nice ' cuppa ' PG is my fave drink . If you are expecting a single blend taste like an Earl Grey , Ceylon etc then this is not for you . Not generally drunk as a ' black ' tea ( no milk ) , PG is what I refer to as a peasant blend . Good old working class tea . My way of drinking it is a bag in a large mug ( 12 oz ) ' brewed ' for 5 minutes , adding a scant teaspoon of sugar and a spot of milk to give me a wonderful , almost amber colour . PG tea IS a quality tea and a refreshing blend . The flavour is quite wonderful and is good either in the freezing Minnesota -20f winter or the baking hot 85F Minnesota summer . So happy that Amazon actually delivers me a box of 40 every month for less than $ 4 . Subscribe And Save is a great service and saves me a 30 mile drive to my nearest WalMart to buy a box for $ 4.50 Re ; my monkey reference in the title . Watch PG adverts on YouTube .
5 #### I love this tea ! I have loved it since the first sip ! I 've tried several other brands but none of them were sufficiently smoky to my taste . I will keep buying this wonderful brand even tho I 'm a ' tightwad ' and it is NOT inexpensive .
5 #### I love this green tea it does not have some of the aftertaste as some of the other brands does , so for a plain green tea this is it .
5 #### Very good tea as are all those which come from England .
5 #### One ca n't beat PG Tips or Typhoo ; much better than American teas .
5 #### This tea is strong without being overpowering or bitter . It is , as the label and description say , black tea . It is a different product than the staple teas at my US supermarket . The largest selling of those is " orange pekoe and pekoe black tea " . As a personal preference , hoping this is helpful to you , I prefer the black tea PG Tips as hot tea and the weaker blended product as iced tea .
4 #### I think the 100 count box is a great value for good basic black tea . The only " complaint " I have is the strength of the tea . I used to use Bigelow tea bags and I was able to get two cups of pretty good tea out of one bag , which is not possible with the Twinings . But , considering the price is so much cheaper it is n't a huge deal .
5 #### Good quality good price . Also I know my teas and have tried a lot of brands . I was honestly a bit surprised at how tasty this tea was for its price point , Twining is exceptionally good quality .
5 #### I like this tea just fine and this is the biggest box I ve found for it . Great .
5 #### This is the best tasting black tea ! It is full bodied with a wonderful true tea aroma . It can be strong , so you will need to play with the brewing times to find your ideal intensity . I 'm a fan of about 3 minutes . I drink it hot with some half and half in the winter , and serve it over ice in the summer . I have tried several " English " black teas and just come back to this one . I purchase this on subscribe and save which makes it quite affordable . These bags are a bit different : maybe a little larger than most bags and they do not have a string . I suggest that you give these a shot , at this price you ca n't miss .
5 #### Do n't get me wrong - this tea is good . However , I do n't think it is leaps - and - bounds better than Red Rose tea ( as was suggested by reviews for this product and for Red Rose ) . I feel they taste very , very similar .
5 #### PG Tips makes a strong cup of tea . I keep this on hand for my relatives who like very strong tea . It is not bitter but very smooth . But for me and my husband , one pyramid makes 2 cups of hot tea . It is very tasty .
4 #### My wife took the box to work after I had 2 or 3 servings . So she definately likes it . This is a Ceylon blend . She said she preferred it to several different teas I had at the house . PG Tips Pyramids are tasty , although you only get 40 tea bags . I think I prefer the flavor of Stash Super Irish Breakfast { so far } over Harney & Sons IB , Barry 's IB , Taylors of Harrogate IB , PG Tips and a few others . Of course Stash Super IB is a blend and not pure Assam . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Stash - Tea - Super - Irish - Breakfast - Black - Tea-100 - Count - Box - of - Tea - Bags - in - Foil / dp / B003D4MXTG / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Stash Tea Super Irish Breakfast Black Tea , 100 Count Box of Tea Bags in Foil</a >
4 #### Pros : The tea itself is awesome . It is very flavorful , bold , and has a wonderful color . I could honestly drink this tea daily . I also like the unique tea - bag design ( triangular ) . Cons : The packaging . It takes a long time to drink 80 cups of coffee . The tea bags are not individually wrapped and are therefore exposed to the air . Over time , the taste of your tea may change .
5 #### I am a tea fan , so I had to try this tea . It comes it paper pyramid bags . The flavor is basic , but very clean . Just a straight up , clean , black tea . I find it very nice and like the basic nature of the tea . It is n't something I would gift , but it is a nice addition to your home tea collection . My husband , admittedly likes it more than I do . It makes a very good cup of tea .
5 #### The best English tea bags one can find in the U.S , in my opinion . PG Tips is quintessentially British , even though it is tea in bags ( not loose tea as true tea aficionados insist upon ) it is very good and excellent for travel , an office pick me up , etc . I always have at least one cuppa PG Tips every day . It 's delicious and satisfying on its own , with lemon , or with sugar and milk .
5 #### This is the only tea I drink . I only add milk and I drink 3 to 4 cups per day . For me , this is the only black tea worth drinking . It is robust and flavorful , you wo n't be disappointed .
2 #### This is not flavored as strongly as I 'd like- it was only OK , but Lapsang Souchong has a strong flavor as I remember it , and this just does not cut it . I 'd probably use 2 teabags / cup to try to get the stronger flavor .
5 #### This is such a flavorful tea ... The citrus undertones are very pleasant ...
5 #### Really tasty for those who want chamomile with a mild twist . Very comforting and worth buying in large amounts . Also makes for great gifts as that is how I came to discover this gem .
5 #### My favorite bagged tea . I 'm completely spoiled and wo n't drink anything else .
5 #### I love PG tea bags . The flavor is great and I take the bags with me and ask for hot water where ever I am so I can have my tea .
4 #### I love this tea . It very strong so I make a 1/2 gal of ' ice tea ' with 3 bags . Does n't get cloudy .
5 #### I have commented on this product elsewhere . All I can say is this is an awesome cup of tea . I have ordered this and will order it again .
4 #### This tea is fine but it did n't wow me . I tried it because I was making a lot of iced tea over the summer and it was getting very expensive . I decided , to try this for a cheaper alternative and it tastes just fine , smells great ! I would n't go out of my way to find it though .
4 #### Pretty good , but missing a few spices to me . I add a little freshly ground black pepper to my cup , for example . I have boght more than once , though .
5 #### My favorite tea from the UK . Have tried many others but I keep coming back to PG Tips as my goto daily tea . Glad I can get it on Amazon .
5 #### My favorite brand of tea . I like a strong tea and this is the best .
5 #### A wonderful , dark black tea , almost slightly reddish , with a round , full flavor . Do n't steep too long , or it gets bitter . If you do steep too long , add a dash of milk - its sweetness counteracts the bitterness . Be cautious not to spill this tea on fabrics ! It 's a wonderfully potent tea which stains exceedingly well :)
5 #### The PG Tips from England arrived in under 2 weeks -- and the tea is very fresh tasting !
5 #### LOVE this tea ! Even my husband , and friends , who do n't like tea love this stuff ! Some honey and cream compliment it greatly . It 's a strong dark brew .
3 #### Do n't understand why the Brits love PG tips . I did n't .
4 #### We love this tea ! ! It is hearty and flavorful !
5 #### PG Tips Black Tea is a lovely tea with a smooth , full flavor . It meets all my expectations of how tea should taste . I highly reccomend it to anyone who really likes good tea .
4 #### This is very different from Lipton tea . Taste is very distinct , and I like it . reasonable price , nice aroma . There was thin plastic film covered when arrived but once you open it , there is no plastic liner , so it could get a little messy from tea leave dusts fall through the box . If you want to try something different , this might be good one to try .
5 #### Lipton will never do again . This is a good strong cup of tea !
1 #### I 've tried many inexpensive teas . No other tea was as bad as this .
5 #### Great tea . Has night flavor . I really like how the bags are tied and not stapled .
1 #### Hate the taste . Great smelling however . Wish I could return it . Maybe I can give it as a gift ? Primary ingredient is some herb I dislike .
5 #### I 've bought boxes and boxes and it 's perfect degree of minty - ness .
5 #### I 've drank PG Tips for years . I still do . It is lower on caffeine than most other teas , and it has the flavour like no other . You will never find another cup of tea in my hand unless you force me to drink it . Simply , the best !
5 #### I had been looking for this tea for a while . I had a cup at a friends house and have been hooked ever since .
2 #### Weak flavor even after steeping for a while . Had to use two bags per cup . Wo n't buy again .
2 #### Ok . Not what I thought . Peppermint is to strong for me U can probably re - use the teabags again a few times . U can re - use these in a DIY project .
5 #### Darjeeling is known as the champagne of teas . I LOVE the flavor and use it for my kombucha . Delicious fruity flavor that is especially nice once it has fermented . I only wish it was organic .
5 #### Very good tea , I 've been making ice tea out of it . Never buy store bought ice tea anymore . Even my husband and daughter said they love it better then store bought ice tea
5 #### I like black tea and this is very good . The strength of this depends on how long you steep so taste is at your discretion .
5 #### This is the ultimate for anyone who loves a black tea . Rich , not acrid , dry and tangy . I wo n't drink any other tea .
3 #### It 's not my favorite black tea , but it is the best for when I need single serving tea bags . For the pot I prefer Barry 's or Bewley 's .
5 #### A friend introduced me to this years ago . I liked it and buy it regularly . It 's a standard in my cupboard .
5 #### Excellent tea ; my favorite ! I have a hard time finding this tea in any supermarket , so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon Prime . Love this tea , and order regularly .... ( Mrs. Carl )
5 #### I love PG Tips ! Generously - sized bags , good quality black tea , and consistent flavor ! I would choose PG Tips every time !
5 #### I am familiar with this brand of tea and have ordered it before through Amazon . It makes an excellent cup of tea that has some body to it . Price point is favorable to the local supermarket . It can not always be found in the local supermarket .
5 #### Great taste brews so easy , sometimes I use steva but nt with this tea its great without it.recommend it if you like tea
5 #### This black tea is really good . We like the quality and the flavor from the tea bag . We will buy this product again in future for sure .
5 #### I 've bought other versions of PG tips from Amazon in the past and they were good , but this one is even better . Therefore I wo n't buy the larger quantity of PG tips and stick with this one instead .
5 #### best , we drink it every day , has nice caramel flavor
5 #### Love peppermint tea , love the price and product . Twinnings tea is always great , especially their earl grey and peppermint .
5 #### Twinings is my go - to brand-- I drink at least 6 cups a day . Prince of Wales is one of my favorite varieties , but my grocery store rarely carries it .
5 #### The box says it is England 's number one tea -- I could n't agree more . Nothing better for a nice cuppa tea nad a sit down .
5 #### I 'm planning on hosting a high tea party in Feb so I started looking around for world teas . This was one of the first a friend recommended as a premier staple in England . Glad I made the purchase . Now I have more shopping to do . I will definitely buy again .
4 #### I like Irish breakfast tea with its full flavor and this is a good product .
5 #### Love this stuff in the winter . Priced high though .
5 #### I love good tea but I ca n't stand the mess of trying to make a decent cup in my office . PGTips is the perfect solution . A good , balanced cup with robust , satisfying flavor . I use their decaf , too , it is by far the best I have encountered .
5 #### I really enjoy this tea . It has a full - bodied flavor but no bitterness or aftertaste . I am fairly picky about my tea and this is exactly what I was hoping to find . I 'm enjoying it and glad that I purchased this brand .
5 #### BEST TEA EVER ! Always makes a perfect cuppa . I love it so so much . You ca n't go wrong with this .
5 #### I Love my PG Tips . Great deal too ! There is nothing like a good cuppa tea to brighten your day .
4 #### I love black tea and have been trying many different brands . This is my favorite so far . The only thing that could be improved ? Fair trade and I would be a drinker for life !
5 #### LOVE mint tea so much since I often get tummy aches . This tea always helps me . I take it hot at night and just drop one in my water bottle for the day . Yup it adds just enough minty taste to my h20 !
5 #### We love Earl Grey tea . We drink quite a bit of it , hence ordering 100 Bags at once . We have had a few different brands of Earl Grey , and there 's a couple things that set Twinings apart from their more affordable competition . Twinings Earl Grey always arrives with the tea bags individually wrapped . While I realize this is n't the best for the environment , it certainly keeps the delicate Bergamot oils fresh and aromatic . It also prevents the tea bags from getting stale over the next month or so ( that 's about how long it will take us to go through this box ) . The Bergamot is not so strong that it is reminiscent of Grandma 's perfume ( Lookin ' at you , Tazo ) , but is so balanced and smooth that its presence is definitely detectable . One important thing to know is that this tea is best steeped for the recommended three minutes . Any longer and the tea will start to taste bitter .
5 #### Fresh item , packaged well , tastes great , a Nice Strong Black Cup of Tea , just what the wife ordered . I have purchased a few of these , and plan on more in the future .
5 #### High quality black tea with a wonderfully subtle black currant flavor .
3 #### This tea is just okay . I like a strong cup of tea but this is a bit harsh - got a bite to it . The thing that really bugs me is all the loose tea in the box . I have a tea box that is always dirty looking because these bags " leak ? " You do get used to the taste - I have auto delivery with no plans of changing that .
5 #### If you want a taste of England , this tea is the way to go . Great with cream , honey , milk , it is very versatile and mellow . Also great iced .
5 #### On a chat line I asked some Brits what the favorite tea in England was . Most said PG Tips so I ordered the smallest amount I could get just in case I did n't agree . The Brits know their tea ! ! . It is the best I have ever had and I 've tried quite a few . I gave one to a friend ( there 's some Scottish blood in me ) and she agreed with me . My next order will be for a much larger box and will try some of the other types they make . It came direct from England and came much sooner than they said . Typical of Amazon and their suppliers . I often get what I ordered ahead of schedule .
5 #### My son loves this tea and it was a great deal !
5 #### I love a rich , dark breakfast tea served with half and half . This has been my fave for over two years now . Glad to buy it from Amazon - better price than local stores .
5 #### Growing up in a half Brit & half Irish home , we drank one thing and one thing only . PG TIPS . There is nothing better , and just because I 'm buying it on Amazon instead of the local grocery , does n't make it any different . It is by far Britain 's # 1 tea & all you Earl Grey lover 's have no idea what you 're missing . If you find it less than desirable , learn how to make a proper cup of tea ! Overall , ALWAYS A PERFECT BUY !
5 #### Good flavor , nice and strong . I love the bags without the strings and tags . The price at Amazon is very reasonable , this stuff is expensive in local stores if you can find it at all .
4 #### Avg . for tea bag . To get the real taste of this tea you must buy from specialty tea shop that confirms that it had been smoked correctly and fresh .
4 #### I like this tea , and have re - ordered it . Downside is that it 's taking a long time to arrive . Perhaps I should re - order when it arrives to lessen the time without .
5 #### I have a British friend , and once she knew I liked to drink tea , she said I had to get the PG Tips ! Now , I could n't find them at any local store when I went shopping . So when I saw these as an add on item , I put in my shopping cart , and waited for my next amazon purchase ( never more than a week goes by , sad to say ) . I got them home , put them in a sealed container , to keep them fresh , and brewed up a cuppa ! Yum !
5 #### If you are searching for a perfect mug , not just a cup , of full bodied yet smooth tasting tea , look no further ! Nothing sold in the States ( and this includes Twinings ) can compare . Say goodbye to needing to use two teabags per mug and still not having it quite right . Add a splash of 2 % milk and a bit of sugar and it 's absolute perfection ! Thank You , Amazon , for offering this product !
5 #### I grew up on a cuppa tea and this is by far the best morning cuppa , afternoon cuppa and yes , even nighttime cuppa . Love that it is available on Amazon ! Thank you .
4 #### Weak tea , had to give it four stars even though the flavor was delicious .
5 #### Makes a nice cup of tea ; I usually brew a pot , using two or three bags . Lasts me all morning . Excellent !
5 #### This tea is terrific . We have bought it for gifts for tea lovers and they always want to know where they can buy it . This tea is England 's best selling tea and England it a tea loving country . Try this tea - you will love it . Will buy over and over again . Highly recommend .
5 #### I understand this is the Queen of England 's favorite tea , but I would drink it in any case because it has a great , strong flavor . For those of us who love our cuppa with cream and sugar , this is the ideal brand . I 've ordered this tea a couple of times from Amazon and have found that it arrives fresh and fragrant - nothing like the slightly fishy smell of Liptons or other American brands . The price is fairly good , and the convenience of having it delivered to my door is essential to my lifestyle . I 'll continue to order this item , as long as it is eligible for Amazon Prime .
5 #### This tea rocks with flavor , no wonder it 's the favorite of the UK . I do n't believe I will go back to lipton 's , this tea is just too good .
5 #### I admit I am a bit of a " tea snob " . This tea was recommend to me and so I tried it . I LOVE LOVE LOVE it . To bad my local grocer does n't carry it and I have to always order it from Amazon but hey .. small " price to pay " for such an amazing tea !
5 #### When I realized that the shipping was slated for almost a month post - order - date , I was disappointed . Oh , well , overseas shipping does take time . However , the package arrived much earlier than expected . I wonder if the company does this to pleasantly surprise people rather than have shipping be longer and have people complaining ? Regardless , it was AWESOME getting it early ! All boxes were in perfect condition . I will say that some reviewers have complained that " tea is on the outside of the package inside the cellophane " as a negative comment in the past , especially if they wanted the tea as a gift . If you 're giving tea to a tea - lover , then why worry ? I buy tea at the store all the time that has this " problem " and some of the packages I got DID look like this . Who cares since if the tea " dust " is inside , it is clearly fresh / sealed and is n't any issue ? PG Tips are strong , flavorful teas and I 've created a number of fans from just one cup as a trial . Others critique this tea as compared to more " pure " teas from various parts of the world . We happen to LOVE the blend in PG Tips , and this will vary person to person , of course .
5 #### delicious , 1 bag in 4 cups thermos with hot water keep my cold at bay !
5 #### I always drink this tea and was happy to find it available on save and subscribe in many quantities . Heartily recommend .
5 #### I am very impressed . I saw the reviews and just had to try some , the reviews for this tea are incredible . The teabags do not have tags or strings , which is a bummer , but the taste of the tea makes you forget about that little detail . It just has this strong , smooth flavor , yet not bitter ... This is some of the best tea I 've tried . I want to get it in decaf too so I can drink it in the evening without the caffeine keeping me awake . Highly recommend .
5 #### I have been drinking PG Tips for several years and never thought about buying it through Amazon . What a surprise to find it at half the price of my grocery store ! There is no brackish taste with PG as there sometimes is with other teas ... and I like to let mine steep for a good 15 + minutes .
5 #### I like strong tea and this one meets my palate - has a wonderful taste . Highly recommend this to those who like strong tea .
5 #### I became hooked on this tea after the first time I tried it . If you make iced tea it will be cloudy . Why do we have flavorless black tea in the states ? Our tea basically makes brown colored water . PG Tips tea is flavorful and packed with caffeine ! I love it in the daytime but I stop consumption of it late in the afternoon , otherwise I toss and turn for hours trying to go to sleep . They do make a caffeine - free tea but I have not tried it yet . All in all - yes , I would recommend this tea to anyone wanting to taste real tea .
4 #### With or without milk , this tea is a fine addition . We use large cups ( about 24 oz ) and in no time this unusual tea bags will turn the water a very deep dark color . Does have its share of caffeine , and that is always a good thing . I prefer a good tea to a good coffee , but I still drink both . The deal was very fair and now I can see why in England this particular brand has so many followers . This is an everyday tea that can be brewed strong , and if on top of everything it has some benefits like antioxidants or whatever , then the merrier . From the picture in the box one can tell that it is a little diluted with milk . In our place we use evaporated milk and it is really tasty that way . During the cold season it requires some kind of pastry , cookies , or panettone to really get the full effect . 4 Stars , for sure !
5 #### I love this tea so much I buy several boxes at a time so I do n't run the risk of not having any . The delivery was prompt and the sale prices made it even better .
5 #### This tea is the best we 've tried . The flavor is full but not bitter or harsh . The pryamid shaped bags are very clever and do work better than the regular flat ones . There are no strings or staples , which I like because I can throw used bags directly into the compost .
5 #### I like that each tea bag is wrapped individually . It holds in the aroma and freshness of the tea . I use the tea bag in a 2 cup mug and it is perfect . The flavor of the chai is not overpowering .
5 #### I like to use this tea to add flavours to other teas . Adding this to a Chai or Lady Gray adds a bit of natural sweetness and a hint of orange . It 's a fresh squeezed essence . No caffeine means I can use it all day and into the evening . Try it as a flavouring to your regular tea .
5 #### These are just as good ( better ? ) as the Keurig version . I love that there 's no spearmint or any other flavoring in them .
5 #### I love this tea ! I used to get it at Walmart , but they appear to have stopped carrying it , so I had to order it . I am so hoping Twinings does n't stop making it . I fear it 's not a good seller since Walmart cut it . Fantastic fruity flavor and smells delicious . This is my favorite tea , and I drink a lot of tea !
5 #### It 's the only tea I truely love . I mean I love PG Tips , I love the aroma while it brews , the consistent flavor ; it never lets me down . Morning , noon and night PG Tips is my tea ! Tried the rest and am sticking with the best !
4 #### The price of 6 boxes and quantity per box fit our expectation . We recommend the product for small family tea lovers .
5 #### Excellent tea ! I was expecting it to be green after making it ! Wondering if it 's really green tea .
5 #### Best tea ever I have one every night for bed .
4 #### I have been drinking the same peppermint tea for years . A friend suggested this brand so I decided to try it . It is good , but I do not find it as flavorful as my usual brand . It is good but I will continue to enjoy my old stand by .
2 #### I 've been a fierce fan of Harrogate 's tea for many years , but I had read so many positive things about PG Tips that I had to give them a try . What a disappointment . Yes , packaging was fine , the product arrived quickly , and I suppose it was well - priced compared to what I might have paid in a fancy shop . But the taste was bleh , at best . I tried it plain , I tried it with milk , and then I gave the rest of the box away .
5 #### I like the flavor of this brand of Peach tea . Some of the others have a fuity taste but the paech taste does n't really come through . Twinings gives the peach taste that I like .
4 #### I 'm very particular about my tea and this is my favorite so I 'm delighted to find it on Amazon.com . Living in the back of beyond it is not available in local stores . If you prefer tea bags with string tags hanging from them you probably wo n't like this . Most Americans make tea with hot , not boiling water and then say they do n't like tea . Another reason , in my opinion , why Americans do n't like tea is they were raised on Lipton tea . If you are on the fence about tea try PG Tips with boiling water .
5 #### The best earl grey tea on the market for this price range . And trust me , I ve tried them all . Stash is overpriced and Bigelow is good , but not as good as Twinnings . And this price is unbeatable !
5 #### Bought for a gift and she likes the taste .
5 #### This tea is amazing ! The flavor is so deep and complex . I also noticed its very soothing to my winter sore throat . I tend to prefer sweetener in my teas but this one does nt need any . Sometimes I take it with cream , sometimes not . The flavor is so lovely I do n't need to add anything .
5 #### The aroma of cinnamon and cloves fills the air as your tea is steeping . This is one of my favs for cold winter days .
5 #### If you 're a hard - core black tea drinker , this is the stuff to get . We got every last package on our Target clearance shelves , and now so glad Amazon also stocks it . The tea is very strong - perfect for drinking with milk , the real British way .
5 #### great tasting tea . Normally I need to add sugar or sweetener to black tea because the commonly sold black tea in the USA is fairly bitter . This tea I can drink brewed to a nice dark brown color for about 5 minutes and no sugar is required . Love the tea and can not wait for another sale to come around to stock up !
5 #### Mom 's loves the taste of Rooibos , plus it 's good for you .
4 #### This tea is the best reasonably priced bagged tea on the market . It is cheap enough to let me drink a good cup of tea in the morning , but it also tastes really good . Better than any other bagged teas in the price range . It is very classic tea , and strong . There is a very slight smokiness , but not very much . Yes , there are better bagged teas ( Yorkshire Gold is one ) , but they 're much more expensive . It gives me a good start to the day for a reasonable cost and with good taste . Need I say more ?
5 #### I never thought I would find the same satisfying taste for my cuppa tea here in the USA , until I saw PG tips advertized on Amazon . Needless to say I ordered this wonderful tea , and will keep doing so , enjoying the perfect cup of tea every time I brew it . AHHHHHHHH such Bliss .
5 #### Very soothing Tea ! Great for general wellness and health !
5 #### I really like the PG tips tea , makes a good smooth but flavorful cup of tea . I use a little milk in my tea and the flavor comes through strong . This is one of the best teas I have had .
5 #### My friends at work tease me because I have an entire desk drawer dedicated to tea . I love my tea . I almost exclusively drink loose leaf tea . I love the taste and the ritual . But sometimes I do n't feel like taking the time to prepare a pot of loose leaf tea , so I " settle " for a tea bag . PG Tips really is n't a compromise for me though . I love PG Tips . It 's a great blend of black teas . The taste is great and the bag is convenient . It 's not completely accurate to call this a " bag " though , because it 's a pyramid . The water flows through the pyramid very nicely . There 's no string to take it out with though . That 's OK . Use a spoon or let it continue to steep while you drink it . Excellent black tea blend !
3 #### Ok , I 've been drinking a variety of hot teas usually with cream & a tad of sugar since the late 1970 's ... before that iced tea ... Amazon did sell this at an excellent price ' IF ' you subscribe & it arrived promptly with a VERY FRESH date ... expiration in 2013 for best flavor ( bought in August 2011 ) . Unfortunately , this tea is too weak & too smooth ... I have to use 3 tea bags per 10 - 11 oz cup of water to get some strength infused into it for 10 minutes ! I recommend Lifeboat Tea ( also from UK ) over this or Scottish Breakfast if you want even more strength & full flavors . If you do n't want strong Full Flavors or Sophistication , then this tea is a buy for smooth & subtle drinking ... good for a tea party ... to eat little cakes & scones with it . Better it be Lifeboat or Scottish Breakfast , imo , for my tea parties . :-) Right now , my ideal blend would be a combination blend of Scottish Breakfast AND Lifeboat ... Lifeboat needs a tiny kick of strength & flavor from the Scottish tea ... that 's my perfect cuppa tea ... If you know a better stronger blend that can top that combo taste , then please comment to this post ... and Thanks ! ! !

5 #### Amazing price for how many you get . Also glad to find this , I could n't find the variety pack in stores anymore .
3 #### I found this tea to be just OK , but not really worth the rave reviews being offered here on Amazon . For what it 's worth , I like my tea with plenty of nutrasweet / aspartame - I put in maybe 5 packets per 10 oz of tea . My favorite tea is Celestial Seasonings Blueberry .
5 #### I like my tea strong and this is it . Great flavour for a morning tea , have a couple of boxes at work and are a great day starter . If the flavour is too strong , you can always add just a little milk o a few drops of lime juice . Not much more to say , it is tea , it is great .
5 #### Definitely waay better tea than anything I 've tried here in the US . The caffeine is n't overpowering like some black teas I 've tried and I am particularly sensitive to caffeine . The item arrived and there was tea ' dust ' inside the plastic , outside the box , which worried me , but once opened there was no problem with the tea bags at all . There is no string attached to the bags , but this really is n't a problem if you use a spoon for sugar or milk anyway . I got this item very quickly even though I live about as far away from England as you can get ... California . Very pleased overall with everything .
5 #### It would suffice to say that I am known as the best tea maker in my family and my only secret is PG Tips . The aroma is amazing and it makes a strong , flavorful tea . I usually drink 2 - 3 cups per day and if I am going out of town , I have to carry these with me in a zip lock bag . I ca nt find them in any store near my house , but who needs it in a store when you can order from Amazon . Amazon usually have 40 % off and that is when I stock up . However , do n't stock up too much as it might not be that fresh when you open the box . Great tea ! Hands down winner over lipton or any popular brand !
5 #### I and my wife love this tea . PG Tips is not easily obtained in many stores in USA , and I was happy to see on Amazon , and for correct price . This tea is really different . We put mint leaves and a tea bag for two small cups , and we also put honey . It smells great . On a evening , after a hard days work , to smell this hot tea , is relaxing . The taste is really great , we love this tea much better compared to other normal ones we see in stores . They claim that they make this tea from the tips of young leaves , and that really does make a difference . Highly recommended tea .
4 #### I actually bought a small box of this tea just to try it out . I used it for a few weeks and thought " That was good , but nothing special . " But after 2 weeks of being back on my old tea , I miss it . So I 'm buying some more . :) My normal US tea is Newmans Organic or Luzianne , so that 's all I have to compare it to . Note : Each PG bag has about 2 times the weight of tea that 1 bag of a US tea bag has . Or put another way , 2 PG bags equal 1 " family " bag of US tea . So while it looks more expensive , in the long run it 's not really . In fact , I can make a full gallon of ice tea with just 8 of these bags . So the price is about the same or better , and the tea tastes better in my opinion .
5 #### This is great tea ! I 'm the only hot tea drinker in my family , so I make PG Tips hot tea in my Bodum Assam 17 oz . tea press . It 's just right using two tea bags per pot .
5 #### There are two black teas that I consider delicious , PG tips and Typhoo . PG tips is a bit milder than Typhoo ... but both are far better than any lipton tea around .
5 #### I wanted a tea I could use to make milk tea and this is the best ... at least when compared to other teas I 've tried . The tea is very concentrated and does not lose the tea flavor when I add milk to it . I usually add some evaporated milk and some honey and it 's delicious . It is my favorite tea now and I will be purchasing some more .
2 #### Not my favorite flavor . I like mint tea , but I do n't like the flavor of this one .
5 #### Wonderful robust flavor . Add a little honey and it 's a dessert !
5 #### This tea tastes wonderful ! I buy it several times a year . It tastes so good that I do n't miss sweeteners .
5 #### This is a wonderfully rich , full flavored tea . It is suitable for every day drinking . This is one of the few teas that can stand up to adding milk . PG Tips is rich , dark , and full of flavor . As an American , once I got used to drinking this fine English blend I can not go back to American blends such as Tetley or Lipton . A fine fine tea , delivered fresh , and quickly .
4 #### Very good tea - the tea is milder than expected . However , the price is right when it is on sale ( ~$12 for a 6 pack of 40 tea bags ) . A single box runs about $ 4 at the grocers . Glad I made the purchase .
5 #### I just purchased this tea because I was looking for a simple , inexpensive , and great tasting black tea . I read the other reviews for PG tips ( which were great ) so I bought some . So the outcome ? It 's excellent . It steeps very quickly and has a nice strong taste . My mother ( at first ) noticed that the teabags did n't have strings and said something to the effect of " yeah usually if the tea is of cheaper quality it does n't have strings ... " or something weird like that . Lets just say she quickly got over that and she now makes this tea constantly . Highly recommended for an inexpensive black tea . Lets just say the brits know their tea !
5 #### It taste good . Not too strong ginger taste with smooth lemon smells . This is good for your neck during winter time also .
5 #### I 've tried many teas over the years but PG TIPS is the best . It goes well with regular sugar , sweetner packets or honey . It does n't leave a nasty after taste in my mouth like Lipton . I guess the British know their teas !
5 #### I love all kinds of tea , especially Earl Grey , but for the basic , everyday tea , for hot tea and iced tea , I preferred Lipton . This PG Tips tea has changed my preference , and it has become my new favorite . I like the crisp , clean taste and I really like the fact that they do n't put paper tags and string on the tea bags . I have used it for hot and iced tea , and it works beautifully . I also like the reach in box of loose tea bags ; so easy to grab . I bought the box of 80 , and I know I will order it again .
5 #### Always looking for hearty , British " lorry lay - by " tea . Lived in Scotland for a year and always enjoyed the strong , warming flavor of a cuppa right from the giant stainless pots . Tetley 's British Blend comes close , but as the reviews suggest , Tips is tops . Quite likely that it WAS the tea I was drinking . Brewed according to the rules - warmed pot taken to the boiling water and steeped for 5 minutes - it is rich and flavorful ( flavourful ? ) without being bitter or harsh . The real deal and my British " madeleine " that brings back the gray sky , dreary weather ; fogged windows ; the smell of wet wool .
5 #### PG Tips is a wonderful tea . Lipton and Tetley tea have nothing on PG Tips . I prefer this tea with a bit of cream and sugar . Wonderful tasting and a perfect afternoon ( or anytime ! ) pick me up . I look forward to drinking it every day .
5 #### It 's really the perfect all - rounder . It 's got a great flavor , it 's incredibly smooth and does n't have the absurd amount of tannins that some other teas to -- Tetley , for example . Currently , this tea is a little over 3 dollars per 40 pack , which is a pretty fair deal as it is an imported item . I 'd say give it a shot , as long as you 're into honest black tea . If you 're into those flavored teas where they add a bunch of natural flavors to cover - up the horrible outhouse quality tea leaves , well ... to each their own , but in the meantime man up and try some PG Tips anyway ! Really though , it 's a very approachable tea , you 'll enjoy it .
5 #### My boss turned me on to this tea - it is so delicious - at the same time more flavorful and less harsh than many teas on the US market .
5 #### This tea is wonderful . Thank you to all of the folks that reviewed it and gave me the information necessary to want to try it . In addition , Amazon is the place where I know I can find great items that are otherwise obscure and unavailable where I live . PG Tips Tea is wonderful . If you like black tea , you will love PG .
4 #### This is a very drinkable blend of Assam , Ceylon , and Kenyan black teas from PG Tips , one of the UK 's most popular brands . Although some California grocery stores ( and Cost Plus World Market ) stock this tea , I had not tried it until reading helpful reviews on Amazon . Each PG Tips bag weighs 38 percent more than the Lipton bag ( that is available in the USA ) . As expected , PG Tips makes a stronger brew . Each PG Tips bag has so much tea that I can easily make a 12 ounce mug with a single bag . I drink my tea black , but PG Tips is clearly robust enough to maintain character with milk or sweetener . PG Tips is a sturdy , straight - ahead blend with more strength than Lipton 's . It is a caffeine - rich tea - in part because each bag has more tea than other brands . PG Tips uses a pyramid shaped bag that allows more room for tea leaves to expand while steeping . Does it make better tea ? I do n't know , but it is a point of differentiation . PG Tips also sells loose tea . Many tea enthusiasts prefer loose tea . Tea bags contain the less expensive " fannings " or " dust , " remains from processing loose leaf tea . And with some others brands of tea ( not PG Tips ) , many people can taste the paper used in the bag . However , if you ( like I ) sometimes appreciate the convenience of bags , I recommend trying PG Tips as a sturdy everyday tea
5 #### A native Brit - I am addicted to my PG tips . So , now that I am living in the US I am committed to buying it online . The tea is full - bodied and so flavorful . I brew it straight in my tea mug by pouring boiling water from my electric kettle straight onto the tea bag and let it steep for about a minute . It is strong enough for me by then and then I add my reduced - fat ( 2 % ) milk to reach a color akin to pale pine flooring . Drink it piping hot and its a fantastic morning pick - me - up . I prefer to buy it in packs of 40 to keep it fresh but the price on the 80s was hard to pass .
5 #### There was n't a thing I did n't like about it . I 'm a tea person and a fussy one . This was great .
4 #### When I bought these , Amazon was out of PG Tips loose tea ; given the choice , I 'd go for loose tea every time , but if you 're a bagperson , these are really good . I like the freedom to vary tea strength and the lack of waste with leaves , but they are more messy !
5 #### Leave it to the British to produce the best tea on the whole planet . I do n't know anything about the types of leaves it contains , but I know that I look forward to getting out of bed each morning and starting the day with PG Tips . If you have a sensitive stomach , you already know that both coffee and tea can sometimes leave you nauseated with the acidity level . Lipton , Tetley , and most other US supermarket brands are guilty as charged on the upset stomachs . Not so with PG , and it has a smooth , lovely taste that is delicious to the last drop whether you steep your tea for exactly 3 minutes , or if you leave your tea bag in the cup like I do . The only other tea I have found comparable is Harney & Sons Big Red Sun in the red tin , costing $ 8 per 40 - count box . With Amazon 's subscription I am stocked for the next 6 months at a fantastic price . I bought the 40 - count boxes so that I could leave more tea sealed for a greater amount of time ; if you go through 3 or 4 cups a day , look into boxes with larger counts . I store my open box in a ziplock bag in the cupboard and it is good every single time . It really is the best English Breakfast / British Breakfast style tea available , and you will never go back to Lipton 's floor sweepings after trying this tea .
3 #### Good tea , in my opinion not the best , but good . I look at this tea as an everyday tea that is pleasant to drink . The first thing that I did learn is how strong it is . Steeping about 90 seconds is about as strong as I like , not like Tetley or Lipton teas . Overall a good product , but unfortunately I will not be buying these again , there are plenty of other great teas out there .
5 #### Love the taste - much less abrasive than English Breakfast . I 'd drink this all day if I could . Will definitely be ordering more !
5 #### Ahhh , that perfect blend of strong black tea , sugar , and milk that goes down so nicely on a cold winter 's morning . Afternoon . Evening ... Ok , any time , it 's a wonderful taste that 's soothing and comforting at the same time as it wakes you up . ( Because heck yeah , caffeine ! ) This is a box full of black tea goodness , just opening the box allowed the beautiful aroma of fresh tea to fill the air - while the tea bags were each enclosed in their own pouch , so the aroma may have escaped a bit to introduce them to the house , but each individual tea bag is still full of flavor . Yum .
5 #### just randomly picked this product as it reminded me of true indian chai . i am truly amazed with aroma and flavor of this tea . wonderful combination of ginger and cardamom and blended well with cinnamon and cloves . i did see this tea is not very strong and i end up using 2 tea bags but its just matching my taste . very glad i picked this product . i will be buying this item again .
5 #### My favorite tea - happy to find the 50 count boxes here - great price .
5 #### What is more comforting than curling up before the fire with a good book and a great " cuppa " ? Amazon , which for years has made the good book part a cinch , now makes getting a great cuppa just as easy ! PG Tips is fabulous tea ! Much better than any I have tried before . I am so glad to have stumbled onto it - along with all the glowing reviews which helped me decide to take a chance . One bag in my 12 oz Brown Betty teapot for 5 minutes produces a robust brew with good color and aroma . Add milk and sugar and enjoy . Really delicious ! Cheers !
5 #### The product I purchased was excellent , and the service and delivery prompt . However , the item was advertised as " free shipping " , yet when I was billed , I was charged what , in my opinion , was an excessive amount for the handling and mailing . The bill further stated that my order did n't qualify for free shipping ( I ca n't remember the reason ; either it was below their minimum or for some other reason ) . Would I purchase again from this vendor ? Yes , but I would clarify the shipping issue before hand .
5 #### This is the first time I ordered this tea . I ordered based on reviews . Has a very good flavor . Me and My wife love the flavor and how it tastes . Has a feel of Indian tea . This is the recipe I follow to make two cups of tea . Comes out good everytime . - One and a half cup of water . - Half cup of 2 % milk . - Mix them and bring to a boil in a pot . - When it starts boiling , add two bags of P.G tips tea . - Bring the heat down enough to just keep boiling slowly . - After boiling bags for 30 seconds to a minute ( depending on how strong you want ) , gently lift tea bags out of the pot using a spoon and discard . - If you like it stronger , gently squeeze the tea bags before taking them out of the pot . - Add one ( or more ) spoons of sugar and stir . - Ready to serve .
5 #### This is the first time I have tried PG Tips , and have to say that I was pleasantly surprised ! I am a tea drinker , and let me say , it makes an absolutely delicious cup of tea . It would be hard to go back to other brands after having tried this brand .
1 #### This tastes weak with too much tea leaves and no detectable spice flavor ... don't know why they even call it " chai " . Strangely , Twinings now makes an " ultra spice " chai . Have n't tried it , yet , but it 's got to be better than this . Until then , I will continue buying&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Bigelow - Decaffeinated - Spiced - Chai - Tea-20 - Count - Boxes - Pack - of-6 / dp / B000GG5J1I / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Bigelow Decaffeinated Spiced Chai Tea , 20 - Count Boxes ( Pack of 6)</a > , which has a more pronounced , spicy and exotic flavor .
5 #### Love this tea ! My favorite tea for everyday , it 's spicy and reminds me a little of sassafras with cinnamon . It 's great for IBS attacks and tummy troubles .
3 #### I was a little disappointed with this tea . I have been buying Lipton Cold Brew so I wanted to try something else . This tea tastes about the same but compared to Lipton Cold Brew , each bag of this seems to contain a lot less tea . In making a 32 oz pitcher this brand suggests using 4 bags and to get a decent tea I would agree that is required . With the Lipton Cold Brew , I use 2 bags . So Lipton tastes the same , will use less , and is ultimately cheaper .
1 #### have not heard back from seller , but this is really really bad tastes like what hay smells like and dentyne . this ca n't be right . can not recommend .
5 #### I love this tea . I do n't know what else to say . I 'm beyond pleased . It 's got a ginger bite that is just awesome . Thank you !
5 #### I am sensitive to bitter iced tea and this brand makes great tea . The directions are accurate this is quick steeping . Regarding portion size : 5 tea bags for one quart of cold water makes a strong blend . I only wish this came in larger sizes for pitchers of tea or in bulk supply - seems like a waste of packaging . Each small tea bag is wrapped separately . Updated : 3.8.18 this product continues to impress with consistent taste .
1 #### I was looking for black unflavored tea . When box said black tea I assumed it is . I should read small print . I really disliked the taste .
5 #### Amazon definitely has the best price on this tea . Also , by buying multiple boxes at one time ... I do n't run out . The flavor is delicious when combined with regular tea to make ice tea . Its our preferred beverage !
5 #### My daughter is very pleased with this . She loves it .
5 #### This is a nice flavored winter tea . I am actually giving this as Christmas gifts hence its name .
5 #### My favorite tea - seems hard to find on the grocery shelf lately .
5 #### I 'm a lover of black teas , irish breakfast used to be my preferred twinings but I ADORE this one as it lacks the bitter taste some black teas can have but still has that bold flavor . Everyone I know who likes black teas has become a die hard fan as well . I 've easily converted a dozen people to this being their favorite tea !
5 #### This tea is wonderful ! I have always liked lemon teas , but this one is smooth and has a wonderful aroma . I prepared about 4 tea bags with boiling water in a thermos for some work outside in cold weather . It was the best tea I have ever had that way and it would make a great gift for the tea lover in your life . This is saying a lot from a Celestial Seasonings fan who thought there was nothing better out there . I was VERY wrong . If you like citrus overtones I also highly recommend Twinning 's Lady Grey tea ( black tea ) . Before trying it I did not like ANY black tea , but it is truly wonderful and worth giving a try if you need a little caffeine ( they also make a decafe version ) .
5 #### My wife drinks this all the time . Loves it .
5 #### Tasty , tasty , tasty . It has a real lush and flavorful air . Good for breakfast , lunch or afternoon tea . Also good made as iced tea .
5 #### I 'm not partial to flavored teas and coffees but this is very good . has a little taste of apple cider .
5 #### I love this tea ! It tastes and smells so lovely . I use a touch of cream , which takes it up a notch . If you like Chai , you wo n't be disappointed with this brand .
5 #### The Item arrived on time and in perfect condition . If you are looking for a great tasting tea this is the one . It definitely reminds you of the holiday with the mild fruit flavor . If you add a little creamer , it gives it a nice creamy texture .
3 #### Not for me but someone around here likes it ... they took the whole freak'n case ! !
5 #### We love this for sweet tea . Difficult to find in local grocery stores .
5 #### Product is as described . Nice flavor . Drink it all day , not just for breakfast .
5 #### This is our favorite tea which we enjoy each morning for breakfast .
1 #### Not like Wild Berry Zinger that s for sure . I made a real mistake buying this , it is terrible . Its weak and does nt taste like berries of any kind .
5 #### This favorable tea will become your favorite mid - afternoon refreshment .
5 #### I prefer the Twinings brand over all other teas . And of the Twinings brand I have my favorites and Irish Breakfast is right up there at the top of the list . This is a very strong tea so I have to be careful how long I let it steep . It is a very bracing tea and I love it .
5 #### I was SO grateful to find this in Amazon Pantry as the last local retailer stopped carrying it in my area . I use this blended with a black pekoe and Twinings Darjeeling to make the most awesome cold brew tea . It also brews a smooth , never bitter , cup of hot tea . Try it with a dollop of raw honey . Not cheap , but then you get what you pay for .
3 #### I received a plain yellow box , not the purple one shown . In addition , the tea I received is perhaps their new formulation . Very little aroma , and light citrusy without a balanced , smooth blend of other flavors . I wish Amazon had a way to mark , never buy again so I could remind myself to avoid this in future . Got through half a cup . UPDATE__this cold brews into nice ice tea .
5 #### Great tea ! We made green ice tea lemonade .
4 #### I mix it with other flavors , but it is good on it 's own . I 'm not a peppermint fan otherwise , but as tea , it soothes mouth , throat and beyond . I will buy more .
4 #### Personally do n't see much of a difference between this and plain twinnings green tea . Maybe just me ?
5 #### Bought this for my husband who is a tea enthusiast and he loved it . Very calming and soothing and smells nice ! We would recommend it .
5 #### I like the tea and they do n't sell it in the stores anymore
5 #### Excellent flavoured tea . Nice change from ho hum do nothing tea . I even brew in my or Keurig . Ol d way works well too . We 've used it now going on 4 years . Try it , you 'll likje it too . No , this is not a paid review
5 #### GREAT PRODUCT , FAST DELIVERY , THANK YOU WILL ORDER AGAIN SOON .
5 #### Jasmine adds a nice flavor to the Green Tea . I 've been looking for this flavor after having it at a restaurant a few times and now it 's available from Twinings !
5 #### Love having this pumpkin chai tea on a cool night . Perfect time for it now .
3 #### The item delivered looks different , its branded for beauty and the beast and looks kind of weird . Everything looks the same for ingredients but still not sure it tastes the same . The website / normal packaging on bottom , branded packaging on top .
5 #### Great flavor . I make this and then add to regular tea to make great lemon tea . 50 % Lemon and 50 % regular tea is a good combo .
5 #### excellent tea , great flavor and air tight packets and strong bags
5 #### I do n't really enjoy hot teas and this is no exception . When it is hot , I 'm not a big fan . But , if you liked sweetened tea , I would recommend giving this one a try cold . I am trying to cut back on my sugar but I really enjoy sweetened iced tea . I brew 8 cups of this hot for about 5 minutes , let them cool , then pour them into a big pitcher and chill it for a few hours . Although I do n't add sugar , it tastes sweet .
3 #### Tastes like black tea and is n't spicy enough . I prefer to really taste the spices .
3 #### I was disappointed . I guess I expected the strong flavor of chai tea I 've had in restaurants . Not bad just not the flavor I was looking for .
5 #### Excellent Tea ! Good for every time of the day no matter morning or evening .
4 #### Good , but having to use 4 teabags for a quart is n't efficient .
5 #### Great tea favor . Nice and strong with 1 bag . Love that it is decaf and still tastes great .
4 #### pleasant taste ... a lil stronger then i was expecting
3 #### Taste is mellow , but not strong enough in spice .
5 #### There 's not much to say . If you drink tea you know what the stuff taste like it 's tremendous . I buy strictly because of the cost . Sometimes I buy the larger pack which is 25 per box this one happens to be 20 per box they 're fantastic for me . But if you drink he you know what you like . I 'm not paying four dollars for a box of it in the store when I can pay a lot cheaper for it here .
5 #### My new fall favorite . The flavor is wonderful and warm without being overpowering . Add in a splash of milk and a little honey and this is everything fall was meant to be !
5 #### I really enjoy this tea and it is better than the Chai mixes which are loaded with sugar and fake milk .
5 #### Wonderful ! This is a great tea and better than most other Darjeeling products .
1 #### I 'm used to a more fragrant bouquet from other Jasmine teas , this did n't have it , and do n't get me started on the weak taste . Finally had to go to the Asian market for a good jasmine tea . I like Twinings European teas , but this one did n't cut it .
5 #### Best tea on the market . Good price and very fast shipping
5 #### Best tea on the market . Good price and very fast shipping
1 #### The Chai Organic Black Tea is bland . The chai spices are too mild and the black tea has a cardboard / grass flavor the lingers . I tried it because it is organic . If you want good chai black tea try Yogi or Celestial Seasonings instead .
3 #### EDIT : I 've found that this tea is much more enjoyable if I drink it cold . What I simply do is just brew a cup as I 'd normally do but let it cool . I then dump it in my water jug that has one packet of True Lime and one slice of lemon already in it . Like others have already said , I 'd strongly prefer Bigelow Earl Grey than to this one from Twinings . If it was n't due to my curiosity , I 'd never have tried this one as there is nothing wrong with the Bigelow Earl Grey . Twinings Earl Grey here is much , much milder . Technically , I 'm sure that would be considered a positive for some tea drinks that prefer a weaker Earl Grey but if not , stay away from this one . I 've learned my lesson . I will forever stick with Bigelow Earl Grey after I 'm out of this one . Also , I found nothing wrong with the packaging . The box was sealed when it arrived and all tea bags are perfectly sealed individually . There was only a very tiny amount of smell that leaked through .
5 #### Ok , I 'm a Chai connesoir , completely addicted for over 12 years and usually make my own home - made chai every day . I had heard these were good and I like to have Chai Teabags on hand for when I 'm in a rush or my frequent hospitalizations . Well , after going through this box in 3?days , I asked my local grocer who delivers to me - I'm disabled - to please start ordering me a case of this each month ! ! These teabags combined with my cardamom milk I make each day - heat up some milk , crushed cardamom pods , thinly sliced fresh ginger and honey - this is as close to a Chai Walla as I 'm going to get for a LONG time ! !
5 #### My teenage daughter insisted that I order this for her . She is your basic PSL addict and this is right up her alley . She loves it !
4 #### Solid mint tea . Others are more minty , which I prefer , but this one has a good amount of mint and is very high quality .
5 #### My treat when I want a cup of very good tea .
5 #### Bought this tea for my mom . She just love the taste of Twinings English Breakfast Tea ...
5 #### What else can you say ? This tea is refreshing and delicious .
4 #### I really like Twining tea bags . Darjeeling is my favorite . There are better loose leaf Darjeeling teas and even some really nice Darjeeling tea bags that would earn five stars , however , the price would be significantly higher . I sometimes brew " the good stuff , " but for everyday economy and price , I love Twinings .
5 #### Yes , I enjoy it . A freak for all things black currant . It 's subtle in aroma and flavor . I take mine hot or room temp . , black , no sugar . I found it too subtle for iced tea . And the bags are individually wrapped ... if I 'm to be forced by circumstance to resort to tea bags ( I 'm a brew a whole pot kind of girl and much prefer loose tea ) I want those bags individually wrapped ! I 'd most definitely but again , black current seems to be hard to find . I ca n't remember , but it seems like the price was right . I 'm always looking for a bargain , and since I use four bags at a time , they could n't have been terribly expensive .
5 #### Love the smell it help me a lot love it <3
5 #### I Love this Tea ! ! Thank You ! !
5 #### We drink it all the time - our preferred tea .
5 #### Looking for an affordable , organic breakfast tea . Very pleased .
5 #### Enjoyable tea ! For safety reasons - disappointed the box was n't wrapped in cellophane .
5 #### I really enjoyed this tea ! A little different than English Breakfast Tea .
5 #### Really enjoy the flavor of this tea . Package was wrapped in cellophane .
5 #### I really love this tea . Unfortunately it is not available loose in my town at least . I can even have a second cup later by keeping the leaves in the cup and pouring fresh boiling water for a second cup . It 's a tiny bit weaker , but much smoother . And I put the used leaves in my compost .
5 #### Great chai choice . Indian friends have checked out the ingredients and complemented me on choosing a tea that includes the spices they use . Brew with milk and water , sweeten with honey then sit back , sip and enjoy .
4 #### This is the real deal - black English breakfast teabags from Twinings . I 've seen a variety of imitations for these in the US ( Bigelows most recently ) and they are a fair approximation of English breakfast teabags ... but not authentic . Whatever you do do n't be fooled into buying something called " Irish Breakfast " teabags - there is no such thing as an " Irish Breakfast " culturally , it 's simply an English breakfast re - branded for terrorist fenian sympathies and peddled to the naive or misinformed . Cultural appropriation writ large . Do buy these teabags but a word of warning - do not use these with a microwave as they will cause it to explode . Safer to boil your water in a kettle .
5 #### I really like this Chai Tea . Easy to brew and organic .
5 #### Gift for a tea head . Hope she likes it .
5 #### I 'm used to Bigelow Green Tea but wanted to try something different because recently I 've started drinking three glasses a day . One after each meal . Personally , I find this brand to be much smoother and less of an earthy taste compared to Bigelow . At first , I disliked that about Twinings . I actually like the earthy taste of Bigelow ! But I started picking mint from my garden and adding them to my strainer . I put the tea bag over the mint and pour the hot water over them . Then it drips directly into my glass . The mint gives it a much better flavor but it 's good on its own or with honey . I think I 've fully converted to Twinings green tea now . Good price does n't hurt either .
3 #### Tea is a very personal thing . This not sweet in any way . I prefer Haney and Son cinnamon or Tazo liquid chai .
5 #### Wonderful taste . It 's difficult to get in the supermarket so this was a good option . It was less expensive than the supermarket as well .
5 #### My favorite tea and I love that it is in sealed packets to keep it fresh .
5 #### I always wanted to try Darjeeling tea . I am enjoying this tea . I like that each tea bag is separately sealed . This allows me to take some with me when I travel .
5 #### Love this tea . Great price for good tea . Wonderful for the stomach as well .
5 #### I got a deal on this item and they taste fine .
5 #### Wow , is this ever good . Spicy but not too much .
5 #### I start the day with this ever day . Love it
5 #### I really enjoy this tea on a daily basis . I use 3 bags for 20 oz . I use a vanilla protein shake as creamer and it is absolutely delicious . Not too strong and not too much cinnamon .
5 #### Ca n't do better than 100 count . Should keep me going for a while :)
5 #### I was given my first box as a gift . I 'm now buying several boxes at a time so I do n't run out . Great combination of flavors . No caffeine , but the tea helps me stay focused . I occasionally sweeten with honey or turabinado sugar , especially after a meal . Do n't need anything for dessert .
5 #### the only decaf black tee that still taste great ....
5 #### Taste great as English tea with cream and sugar .
2 #### This is my favorite tea but what I received was not what I expect from Twining 's . Bad taste and aroma .
5 #### The wife loves this stuff . ... makes me keep ordering it .
5 #### Wakes me up like coffee dose . I figure that I will try it . I just had my first cup & I just got it at the door just now my package . Works well & taste 's good with one splenda . I love it ...
5 #### Love these teas . I make kombucha drinks with these teas and they are so beautiful in color and delicious in taste .
5 #### My new favorite tea . My first favorite was Earl Grey , then Lady Grey , then Prince of Wales and a few others . But this is my new favorite . Smooth and delicious . Makes great hot tea any time of day . I even make iced tea with it .
5 #### Twinings makes great Tea and this is great Tea !
2 #### Normally Twinings makes great Tea but the package I received was opened and the Tea seemed to be stale . I also ordered Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea and it was still sealed and the tea is great .
5 #### Great tea at a good price with quick delivery . No muss no fuss just great service .
5 #### I love this tea ! I have it every morning ! I steep two bags in a steel tumbler full of piping hot water and two teaspoons of clover honey every morning . It 's better than coffee could ever dream of being !
5 #### Bigger box for a cheaper price . You get 25 rather than 20 . I 'm used to paying between 369 and 399 per box of 20 at my local supermarket . I will never do that again . This is been a very common theme for me over the years . And that 's Amazons hope . But you ca n't find a better price and it is the exact same stuff as the other boxes are . No different just larger and 5 extras
5 #### Green Tea with raspberry ad pomegranate tea bags . Mighty good .
4 #### The package arrived in good condition . It 's the kind of box with pre - carved small cuttings and you just tear to open . Quite convenient and you know it 's originally packed . Put it at home for families . Everyone enjoyed the tea .
5 #### Love this Pure Peppermint Tea . Wonderful flavor and very reasonable price .
5 #### This green tea is excellent , the best , it tastes very good .
4 #### I drink this in the evenings to help me relax for bed time . It 's very calming , and helps put me at ease when I need some general comfort . It also tastes very good , I enjoy the flavor of peppermint tea , my wife does not . It also is very helpful when my throat was sore and needed sweet relief during a recent bout of illness . All in all it 's great for what it is . Tea
5 #### This was really tasty and a nice twist on the Chai . Nice string spicy flavor and aroma .
5 #### Perfectly refreshing cold brew tea . Each tea bag comes individually wrapped , although no ecofriendly , it is nice to throw a few bags in my pocket for work .
5 #### I am trying to cut back on the diet dr pepper . I managed to fit it thru the top of water bottle without braking it . First taste I was super surprised since I do n't drink tea it tasted way sweeter then I expected . Not as good as soda but better then plain water ! And way better then I expected . I only tried it because of the cold brew thing . I do n't like hot drinks . This cold brew thing is a god send since all the other things I can put in water either have tons of sugar or aspartine or splenda which is what I am trying to cut down on .
5 #### Tea is very good . sometimes the bag do n't tear right and use must use scissors .
4 #### Add a little half - and - half and honey , and it 's better than Starbucks
5 #### Smooth tea . High quality packing . No staples on the tea bags . Highly recommend !
5 #### Great cup of tea . This is my go to favorite variety when I need something warm and sweet after supper ( I use milk and sugar ) but do n't want a heavy dessert or a caffeinated tea . Highly recommend .
5 #### Good size and price . Also need " Decaf " box like this .
5 #### This is the best product to take before going to sleep .
5 #### Only tea my British husband will drink at night . Great tea !
5 #### This was a great purchase for me because I like to switch up my breakfast teas each morning . The only one that I did n't drink in the morning was the " Nightly Calm " because ... NIGHT . The raspberry flavor was probably my favorite , but I really enjoyed all of them with just a teaspoon of honey . Will purchase again !
2 #### What they sent is NOT what they show . The classic in the purple box has a much better flavor than the Earl Grey in the light tan box . It 's okay and pleasant . I know the difference because my son brings me the purple boxed Twinnings Earl Grey from England , which has a much better flavor . I thought finally , they had made this variety available in America so I do n't have to have my son stock pile it for me . Wrong . What I ordered is not what I got . The tan colored Earl Grey would get 3 stars ( it 's okay ) , but the it 's disappointing when the Purple Box ( and the stronger tea inside ) is not what they send .. I 'm keeping it because I make iced tea with it .
5 #### Very good tea . I get the impression that the peppermint 's natural oils are coming directly from the leaves and into your cup .
4 #### This is a very convenient way to brew tea . Taste satisfactory . Paper tabs not labeled which can be a problem when you brew more than one kind of tea .
5 #### Great tea , fast service , quality product . Would highly recommend , not a tea I would add milk to , good just plain , not bitter .
5 #### Great quality . Surprised by other reviews that say tea is of bad quality . Perhaps the purple packaging and yellow packaging ( which I received ) are actually different earl grey products . Tea steeps well , also good for cold brewing in room temp or cold water . Each bag sealed in foil bags ( see pics ) . Bag tears easily , convenient . Some grinds remain after tea is steeped , but that also happens with other tea brands like Numi and Lupicia , as I 've discovered . Great quality especially for the price . Recommend .
5 #### My Grandma love this stuff ! She enjoys a cup every morning !
5 #### This is my favorite tea . I never drink anything but this or their Irish breakfast Tea .
1 #### I love spiced chai and though they all have some of the same spices in common , I find that the proportions of each spice make a huge difference to the taste profile . Unfortunately , this one is supposed to be extra spicy , and it is but not in a good way to me . It is not that aromatic but very peppery .
5 #### This is a favorite , whether iced or hot tea .
5 #### Twinings Tea is always good . Makes great iced or hot tea .
5 #### Nice taste and well package , I would drink this daily , love - it ! ! ! ! !
1 #### i usually love the earl grey flavor , but this one is so weak and has a weird aftertaste ... i regret buying it .. the ahmad tea earl grey is twice stronger and flavorful . i m switching back
5 #### My favorite black tea . Drink it daily . Good price .
5 #### love Earl Grey tea ! the boxes in the store were n't big enough .. I kept running out .. but these will keep me busy for awhile ..
5 #### All tea bags are individually packaged in little freshness envelopes . And they were fresh ! !
5 #### My husband loves this tea . The flavor is excellent . And with regular deliveries scheduled , he never runs out !
5 #### I love , love , love Irish Breakfast tea , and Twinings makes an fantastic product . It has a very rich body , without being bitter or having off - putting aftertaste . My only concern with their teas is that each bag is individually wrapped in a wax - paper ( ? ) wrapper that one discards , creating a great deal of waste per tea experience . I love&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/PG - Tips - Black - Tea - Pyramids / dp / B01EUIK75A / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">PG Tips Black Tea Pyramids</a > , too , and with their packaging I only need to keep the contents in a ziplock bag - much more sustainable packaging .
5 #### Love this tea ! Light green tea with rich sweet Jasmine flavor . My favorite for afternoon . Wonderful with honey .
3 #### Pro : Good packaging . Tea bags are individually wrapped . Have n't encounter tea bag breaking so far . It 's pretty good value when you buy such a big box . Con : Despite then ice color , the flavor is very weak ... Tesco 's own label was stronger than this . I had been buying Taylor Harrogate on Amazon but decided to try twinings for its lower unit cost , but I 'm going to stick to Taylor after all ...
5 #### I 've tried drinking plain green tea due to the health benefits but could n't deal with the taste . The Pomegrante / Raspberry / strawberry blend tastes AMAZING ! We have it delivered at work and so many people here drink it . I 've gotten several friends hooked as well . I love it iced . I brew 2 bags in about 8 oz of water , then add sugar , then fill to the top with ice . Delicious .
1 #### This brand was much weaker compared to my usual brand ..
5 #### Nice , gentle flavor . I can drink several cups throughout the day without being over - caffeinated !
5 #### The best peppermint tea ! very fragrant , and refreshing to make into iced or hot tea . Good stuff
5 #### This is my husband 's favorite tea . When I saw this large box of 100 bags on Amazon , I grabbed it ! Our local store does n't always have this in stock and when they do , it 's a box of 50 for $ 8.00 ! So , I was thrilled to find this great deal ! The tea , itself , is smooth , not bitter and very flavorful . Twinings makes wonderful tea !
5 #### Lapsang souchong is one of my favorite teas and Twinings does not disappoint . Tastes as good as much pricier " old rare " Lapsang . The smoked flavor is delicious on a cool morning sitting on the back patio as the sun come up . Drink it unadorned or with milk and sugar . Always tasty !
5 #### I start my morning with a cup of this tea every day . It brings back memories of breakfast with grandmother .
5 #### Twinings is by reputation the best and this tea lived up to my expectations . It is mot cheap , but it is good and worth the price . i will buy again .
5 #### No bitterness even without milk and honey . Perfect coffee substitute .
5 #### My favorite tea right now . Who cares if it is not winter anymore ! Nice herbal tea .
5 #### Ehh .. its really strong flavor but not alot of tea taste .. I wasent to happy with it
5 #### This is very good green tea . Twinings is a good brand that produces quality products . The best tea comes loose , but this is as good as it gets for tea in bags .
5 #### My favorite tea for all the seasons and occasions . I have tried many Camomile teas but for me , this one is the best . It has a single note of Camomile and does not add rose petals , orange peel , or mint . I like the single and delicate note of Camomile .
5 #### Refreshing green tea . Tastes very good and has a positive uplifting taste without the extreme bitterness of some green teas . I put the tea bag on my tired eyes after they have cooled to refresh and bring down swelling in the morning . This tea is perfect for all of my green tea uses . So healthy and great price on Twinnings .
4 #### Good stuff , not very strong but would be great for night time . Oh and for those having problems with the bag breaking open there is a VERY easy fix , just rip the tag off then pinch the top of the bag and wind the string tightly around the top , you do n't have to knot it or anything it holds ! I 've done this and had the bag in my thermos all day and it never broke open , works great !
5 #### Love this tea ! I always have it on hand .
5 #### Lovely flavor hot or cold . It is a nice change .
5 #### I 'm on a tea kick these days and am sampling different varieties . Most of the ones I use have a moderate caffiene rating so I wanted to try something with a little more kick to it since I 'm replacing coffee with tea . I really like this tea . I let it steep until it reaches a nice , rich dark brown - about 4 - 5 minutes at least . I add some milk or creamer and I 'm good to go . Even without sugar , it has a smooth flavor , but if you like to have added sweetness , I 'm sure it would be very good as well . It also has a nice aroma , but not as fragrant as Earl Grey .
5 #### My husband loves this French Vanilla Chai . I often have had trouble finding it in the store . Price is about the same as we buy locally so we were happy to order a few boxes as once . Very pleasant vanilla flavor .
5 #### It 's peppermint tea . Very minty . No complaints . Pleasant tasting , brews quickly .
2 #### This review is for a 100 - count English Breakfast package . This brand has been my go - to tea over the past 5 - 10 years , and I usually get it in 20 - count or 50 - count packages . This 100 - count package tea definitely tastes worse as some others have already mentioned . It almost tastes like cheap Lipton . I 'll see if 20 - count or 50 - count packages also changed and if yes , bye - bye Twinnings .
5 #### I drink this tea hot all the time getting the 20 ct boxes at my local store but was drinking ice tea with regular tea bags . Ran out one day so tried this in my ice tea maker and it was great so came on Amazon and found this great price on a 100 ct box and bought it . Will be buying again .
5 #### My favorite green tea flavor & hard to find elsewhere !
5 #### Only negative was the charge for goods which made it the same or even more the local
1 #### This brand is the worst Earl Grey tea I 've even had . The flavor is rather strange and the tea is weak . I thought I 'd try it , but dumped the rest of the box in the garbage . Back to Stash brand .
5 #### Usually dry my own mint leaves but must say this is just a wonderful flavor , has a very mouth - watering scent .. Will be ordering this again and highly recommend ! ! ! !
5 #### Black currents have a wonderful deep fruit taste without sweetness . This tea does capture that full bodied experience .
3 #### Someone recommended I try this tea as I like flavored teas . I found the flavors weak , even tried steeping longer . I think Stash teas have a stronger flavor to their flavored teas . If you like mild flavor you will like this .
5 #### I buy this all the time -- a favorite strong breakfast tea .
5 #### Love this tea and when I have an upset stomach this tea helps calm it down !
2 #### In my experience really flavorful decaf black tea is hard to come by in the US . After my local store stopped carrying PJ Tips , I tried Twinings . Unfortunately this tea is not my cuppa , it tastes weak , but admittedly I prefer more robust & hearty blends . With these bags I need to use 2 or 3 to get a decent single - cup brew . These bags are also difficult to use & over - packaged with individual plastic wrappers , staples , and strings . Update : I 've since been able to easily order Barry 's Decaf Tea on Amazon Prime , and this is my new favorite -- plus no staples or strings , just the bag , full of tea - goodness .
4 #### I like this brand a lot . I prepare it like the Brits do , with milk and sugar . A welcome and soothing change from my usual morning coffee .
5 #### WOW ! Great product , great price , great vendor = Great DEAL ! I 'm impressed ! Thanks !
5 #### No caffeine - this is a great choice . Very tasty - and smells good .
2 #### Was to sweet for me . Usually like just a hint of currant or citrus with black tea , however this has a sweetness that overpowered the tea .
5 #### Great tea , helps lose weight and taste 's very good .
5 #### This tea is not only tasty but soothed my stomach ! Great for heartburn , acid , and other stomach ailments in a completely natural way . Repeat buyer .
5 #### I 'm not a tea drinker but this I would swim through shark infested waters for ! The subtle hint of vanilla and honey is there but without any sweetness to cheapen the realization ( it tastes like the smell of honey and vanilla ) . Better than plain camomile , but not so fussy that it 's a distraction . I have it every night before bed .
4 #### I love the tea ! Great flavor as would be standard in a Twining 's Tea . However , the packet is almost impossible to open . You have to cut the top off with scissors to get into the tea bag . This is not what i expected at all .
5 #### I 've been searching for ( black / green ) tea scented w/ jasmine & I said I have found it . Other jasmine teas did n't have distinct jasmine flavor but this one definitely has one - highly recommend if you 're jasmine tea lovers .
5 #### This makes my husband 's favorite iced tea ! I brew it and then chill it when it 's done steeping !
5 #### My mom 's favorite tea -- I gave her a year 's worth of this tea for Christmas .
5 #### I buy this every month . It comes well wrapped and Twinings is the best tea !
5 #### I am so happy with the variety pack . I love all the flavors . I have been drinking these teas for years .
5 #### Started drinking this instead of coffee after a neuro health scare . I add some lemon and I really enjoy the flavor . My research indicates it 's good brain fuel .
3 #### Okay but not much flavor . Ca n't taste lavender at all
5 #### twinings is now the only green tea that i buy . i first had tried it when i went to cracker barrel and ever since then i have been hooked ! this box also comes with a sample of pomegranate green tea as well . great marketing strategy because i will now be buying that delicious flavor as well !
3 #### this was given to someone else so I have no comment
5 #### Great buy on the wonderful flavor of oolong tea !
5 #### Love this tea for breakfast . Good price so worth ordering from Amazon in stead of grocery store . Be prepared for a long time for it to ship as comes from England . Ok if you know that . Came before the scheduled time ran out . The tea in this package is not individually wrapped like Twining tea purchased is the USA . It is stronger which I like so can make a stronger tea or makes two cups from one bag . The individual wrapped tea bags are nice but rather a waste of paper .
4 #### I really like this flavor . I was a big coffee drinker and wanted to drink less , only because i put a lot of sugar and creamer in it . This is how I kicked my coffee habit . Small amount of cafine . I put about a tablespoon , I like sweet , of honey in it and I am good every morneing .
2 #### I am still on a quest to find a decaffeinated tea that has a full - bodied flavor . This is not it . I brewed a cup and let it steep for five minutes . It tasted like water . So I brewed another cup using two bags of tea . I let this one steep for one hour . This second cup tasted the same as the first . I thought Lipton 's decaffeinated tea was bad but it has this one beat .
5 #### Great way to start the day . What else can I say !
5 #### Love it ..... I have a cup every afternoon , and it is of great quailty .
5 #### So good hot or cold . I especially love it with cream and sugar .
5 #### Great flavours , especially with just a smidgen of raw sugar .
5 #### Love English Breakfast tea , but the caffein buzz is a bit much after a couple of mugs . This has all the flavor , not so much acid and no rapid heart beat and jangled nerves by mid morning . Add a touch of cream and sugar and the morning is good .
5 #### This tea is a delicious before bed treat . It reminds me a bit of apple cider and I am enjoying it very much on these cooler nights .
5 #### Not readily available in the stores , we became ' addicted ' to this great tea on a cruise . It is a delightful morning or afternoon tea . To me , it seems just a bit more mellow than the regular morning tea .... but still has lots of flavor . I would certainly buy again ...
5 #### We have had a hard time finding Twinings Irish Breakfast tea where we currently live , and were so happy to locate a box of it on Amazon . It 's a robust , full - bodied tea with a stout flavor that 's a perfect pick - me - up mid - afternoon .
4 #### Well packaged and just what I need . Trying to drink healthy
5 #### Other tea brands tend to put too much licorice in their chai blends . This one emphasizes nutmeg and allspice , making for a holiday - inspired blend that is so delicious .
5 #### My wife LOVED this as a divergence from the norm . I also tasted it and agree hat it is different ( in a good way ! ) and has a nice , strong flavor !
4 #### I ordered decaffeinated green tea but I received caffeinated . Other than that I like twinnings green tea .
4 #### it is nice and strong if you let it sit for 3 - 5 minutes .
5 #### This is an excellent tea I drink it every morning
5 #### I love tea . Because I love tea I love Twinings . I drink 3 - 4 cups of tea a day and more often than not it 's Twinings that I am drinking . I do n't recall ever having Lady Grey though , despite being 31 years old , and I am surprised to say that I might actually like it a little bit more than Earl Grey . This package is great because it keeps me from having to remember to get tea when I go to the store , I just get one of these every month and I 'm set .
5 #### I try and buy this tea every year . A couple of friends of mine love it as do I. We have this tea starting after Thanksgiving once a week until after the new year . We really like the tea and would drink it all year but it is a seasonal product so we buy what we can and enjoy it as long as we can . None of us are a coffee drinkers .
5 #### This is one of my favorite teas . I find this to be a good value .
5 #### Love this flavor of tea . buy it all of the time . Cheaper if you buy this item by six box quantity instead of single pack . Twinning tea is great tasting tea at a reasonable price !
2 #### Weak- Now takes 3 teabags to make a decent cup . So think about it , this product really costs 3x the advertised price . RIPPOFF . Why do companies continue to shrink , water down and waken their products ? Do they really think their customer wo n't notice ? Seems dumb to me . They lost this customer and I wo n't ever come back .
5 #### gr8 price use at night i think it works love taste
5 #### This green tea has a very smooth taste , not bitter like Lipton Green Tea . Very pleased .
5 #### This Tea was recommended by a friend and I have to admit . This is a really good purchase . I sometimes drink a cup in the mornings and another at bedtime . It 's just that good . It 's very satisfying and taste great . I recommend this Tea to anyone who enjoys a really full bodied flavor .
5 #### I 've never gotten a bad product from Twining 's . The tea is delicious .
5 #### This tea has a good taste and does seem to calm my digestion after a big or late meal .
4 #### Tea bags . A whole lot of tea bags . Taste fresh and deliver your classic earl gray flavor .
5 #### Great tea ! Individually wrapped so that its fresh every time . I have already ordered some more so I do n't run out . Very refreshing and amazing as a drink after a meal
5 #### My favorite morning tea . Irish Breakfast is good and strong , and tastes good with sugar and half - and - half . It has plenty of caffeine , although not as much as coffee . Excellent tea !
5 #### I love this stuff . Can no longer drink black tea due to kidney stones . No more sulking while my boyfriend is enjoying his PGTips tea . I can have ( almost ) as much pleasure from this . I am fairly new to Rooibos tea ; but this is the best I have found . Tastes great the British way ; with milk & sugar . A negative : reviews are for ALL of Twinings teas , not just the specific type you are looking at . So beware . A review might not be accurate for YOUR tea ! Crazy . Amazon : This needs to change !
5 #### Earl Grey . Hot . Good tea . This box is just the right size . Tons of tea .
5 #### Purchased as a Christmas gift . A squeal of joy was heard . " I love this tea . It does n't give me the jitters like coffee does . " Would purchase again ,
5 #### So happy to receive this . I gave this as a christmas presents , they all liked it . I opened one of the box and used it . It taste so good .
5 #### I love this stuff . I drink it every morning and oftentimes throughout the day .
3 #### smells great in pouch , the tea taste was n't add good . could n't really taste peppermint .
5 #### There is no better tea than Twinings , and the Earl Gray is excellent
3 #### Like the tea but it took a long time for delivery .
5 #### My # 1 favorite tea . Arrived tasting fresh . What more is there to say ?
5 #### I love Darjeeling tea . I tried so many brand of Darjeeling tea bags . Twinings is the best so far . .
5 #### Delicious Chai tea . I have tried lots and lots of brands and this is one of my favorites . I also really appreciate that it is ORGANIC !
2 #### The taste of this gum is good , however as mentioned in the other reviews , the taste disappears quickly . Actually if the taste stays for more than two minutes you will be surprised . I would recommend the spearmint flavor as it is a lot better than this .
5 #### i have been in the search for a healthy gum that works and i finally found this one . it tastes great , it smells good , it chews nicely , it does n't stick to your teeth . and the best part is that it has only natural ingredients , no ingredients that you ca n't even pronounce . it is sweetened by xylitol , a natural sugar , that does n't promote tooth decay . i wished that it was organic , but i have n't found a good organic gum yet . but at least , as i said above , all the ingredients are natural .
3 #### While I love the fact that this gum does not have all the artificial crap in it that most gum does , it is lacking in flavor . It has a pretty good taste for a few minutes then it begins to feel like you are chewing on a rubber band . I got this for my son who ca n't have artificial colors and flavoring , preservatives , etc , and he wo n't chew it . My older son who has braces likes it and can chew it so at least it wo n't go to waste .
1 #### This is one of the worst chai teas I have had . Slightly spicy , with a strong taste of dust . Stash , Bigelow , and Celestial Seasonongs all make economical spiced teas for less and they taste better .
4 #### Would have liked to get this as a variety pack or a single rather than having to buy so many Green tea with mint coldbrews at once , because I have realized that I like the black tea with berry cold brew better . This is not fruity or sweet AT ALL ! Kind of bland - the complete opposite of the black tea berry cold brew .
5 #### My fav Chai tea - perfect balance of spices
5 #### This is a great sampler for this tea company . If you enjoy herbal tea , this is worth a try
4 #### Although these are sugar free , they do n't taste it and they do n't leave a weird aftertaste in your mouth when you 're done with them . The taste lasts longer then the Glee Gum I purchased , which has sugar in it . Great for diabetics and anyone else who does n't want to chew on sugar ! !
4 #### Flavor does not last long but if true it does not cause tooth decay and is more natural and it taste great so it 's worth it , my shipments come once a month .
5 #### I 've had problems with sensitive teeth and sometimes they used to feel like they 're being etched . Too much acid I guess . This gum tastes really good , cleans your teeth and makes them feel smooth . My teeth feel like fresh from a cleaning and the sensitivity is way down !
5 #### Good taste . Even if it does n't last too long , at least it 's without the poisonous preservatives . Item arrived quite fast . I like it better than Glee gum .
5 #### I love this gum . Xylitol is the sugar substitute used and it 's actually good for your teeth and does not give me the intestinal distress that other chemical sugar substitutes give me . And it does n't have that bad aftertaste either . You ca n't blow bubbles and that is my only complaint . I would like to try to chocolate flavor , but it is very hard to find .
5 #### I like to mix different chais together for iced tea -- they all have different spice mixes .
5 #### Maybe second only to the loose tea . The jasmine adds so much to the green tea that it is so soothing to drink . No sugar is needed , unlike some variety of green tea . It is one tea that could n't live without .
4 #### I really like this tea even though it 's my first time trying it . I also try regular green tea also from twinings and I would prefer this over that . This was slightly less than the cost at my local grocery store .
5 #### Is used daily in household Like the larger size
4 #### One of my favorite teas , and I like being able to buy it in " bulk . " It 's a great price for the size of the package .
5 #### This is great for winding my son down before bedtime
5 #### Super tea . Feels like a true bargain . No need to spend more on some snooty brand .
5 #### This was a really great product ; very strong flavours
4 #### I do n't use the fancy loose leaf teas at the office , and this is delightful and easy to use at my desk .
5 #### One of my sons only drinks Earl Grey and this is our favorite one . Consistenlty good flavor .
5 #### Love this tea . It 's great for times when you want some flavor but do n't want the caffeine .
5 #### White tea has more anti - oxidants than green tea which is important for destroying free radicals which leads to aging . It also tastes bloody good !
5 #### Definitely my favorite daytime tea but am astounded at how much the price has increased .
1 #### This is strictly for Twinings ' Decaf English Breakfast , and I do n't know if I got a poor batch or that 's how it is , but compared to their non - decaffeinated version , it 's like comparing Lipton to Twinings . Actually , this decaf version tastes exactly like Lipton 's . I 'd say that usually , English Breakfast has a sort of floral note to it . It might depend on what kind of flower , it 's usually a pleasant floral . This decaf version has a weird flavorlessness to it . If I was forced to describe it , it reminds me of a very watered down Lapsang Souchong , with only a hint of smokiness , and some weird cleaning agent mixed in . So , do I advise it ? Not really , no . If you 're expecting the quality of Twinings and my experience is n't a one off , do n't buy it . If you have really bad tap water , and for some reason you 're now curious , try it , but do n't get it in bulk .
5 #### This is the best Chai tea I have ever found . And that includes several from specialty tea stores that charge a fortune . The " ultra spice " does not make it too spicy , it just makes the flavor unmistakeable . I love it with foamed milk : chai latte . Yum .
5 #### Can not get this tea over - strong , so it is a great evening tea ! I like a cup or two of black tea but not too much caffeine before bed ! I do n't like decaffeinated teas . This is great !
5 #### One of my favorite beverages of all times . I like adding a splash of caramel macchiato ( -sp ? ) coffee creamer to it for a yummy twist .
5 #### WOW ! ! ! ! This is the best way to bring in those cold winter months ... I have never seen this flavor before ... I know I 'll be ordering more ! !
5 #### Has better flavor than regular tea of the same brand . Love it
3 #### This tea is okay , but the flavor is kind of bland . I have other teas that I like better .
5 #### What a wonderful treat for Fall and Halloween time !
5 #### Excellent tea . A nice change of pace if you love English Breakfast Tea .
5 #### Excellent black tea . I have tried a lot of teas and this one is simply very good . You will enjoy it
5 #### This is my favorite teabag tea , by a small margin over Bigelow , which is very good also . I drink decaf 90 % of the time , on doctor 's advice . Fortunately , I never did drink tea or coffee for the caffeine kick , only for the flavor . In fact , I can not discern any " kick " to regular coffee or tea , but I must admit that I do notice a slightly greater feeling of vague well - being during an 8 mile run after a cup of regular coffee than after a cup of decaf . In any case , the strong natural flavor of Twinings decaf , with a tiny amount of sugar and a small amount of 1 % milk , is perfect for me .
1 #### I was ecited to try this tea . When it came it the mail I opened it and made a cup . IT tasted like hot water . I convinced myself I did n't let it steep long enough . A couple days later I made another cup to the same result . Finally , I decided to rally test it . I made a cup with 3 tea bags and steeped for 10 minutes . It was slightly flavored hot water . Do n't buy this garbage unless you just want hot water . If that 's the case , I have the recipe for you .
5 #### Excellent price at Amazon . I like to stock tea bags for college while studying in library and this is a great box of Twinings black tea for that purpose .
5 #### This is so good and it actually tastes like pumpkin pie . Put some milk or cream and sugar in it and it 's HEAVEN .
3 #### The flavor is not all that good compared with other lemon flavored black teas . I would not buy again .
5 #### Excellent quality tea . We have used it for many years .
5 #### I love Twininigs Black Tea , English Breakfast . It has the same fresh taste as Starbucks Iced Tea . I love it hot or cold .
5 #### The very best tea there is . Have it every morning , noon and afternoon . Love this tea .
5 #### Great taste and convenient . Excellent for when you want iced tea , but do n't have a lot of time .
5 #### Great quality . Individually packaged tea bags in the box
5 #### Delicious tea ! Ca n't find it at all in my area ( other than the loose ) . My all - time favorite !
4 #### It 's good enough I suppose . I 've been trying to switch off coffee for a while as the caffeine hits me hard and can upset the stomach . Gave these a shot but the flavor is n't awesome . A guy from work picked me up some tea from his Chinese grocery store ( for half the price ) that is much better . Here it is on AMZ . Little more expensive than what I paid , but worth it:&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Foojoy - China - Classic - Min - nan - Oolong - Wulong - Tea-2g - X-100 - Teabags / dp / B0018QBX6K / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Foojoy China Classic Min - nan Oolong ( Wulong ) Tea , 2 g X 100 Teabags,</a > I wo n't buy this one again , but it did come packed well and there is nothing wrong with it , so I have to give it decent marks .
5 #### My husband and I drink a lot of tea . I like being able to Subscribe and Save a staple like Twinings English Breakfast . It 's great hot or iced , with milk and sugar or with a spramp of lemon .
5 #### I am NEVER without this tea . I take it with me on trips as well . It 's robust and gets me going .
4 #### This was purchased on a whim , so I really was n't sure what I was getting . I bought this just to try something new out . I like tea in general , so figured I would most likely enjoy it . Plus , I buy from this company and and have n't had an issue previously . This was nice but not an everyday tea flavor for me personally . I drink my tea with minimal sugar and nothing else . This reminded me of the pumpkin pies I make for Thanksgiving and Christmas . You can see from the ingredients why . Overall , I thought his was good . If you do n't like pumpkin pie , then you will want to pass on this . Otherwise I say try it out . Its a nice flavor and great for a change .
5 #### Buy this for my mother who believes it keeps her skin clear . She loves it .
5 #### Of all the English Breakfast Teabags out there , I like this the best . When I 'm in a hurry in the morning , this is my go to because you just throw it into hot water and go . Great stuff !
5 #### One of my favorite flavors to relax to . Reminds me of childhood when you did n't have a care in the world . Twinings has yet another win on their hands with this flavor .
5 #### Twinings Camomile tea is simply dreamy . It has a pleasant aroma , and the taste is perfect . I 've tried other brands but much prefer Twinings . This is my have to have tea in the evening .
5 #### Absolutely delightful ! I love this tea and love opening each packet because the aroma that is released is lovely . It has a refreshing flavor , and I enjoy drinking it with my dinner . I steep all my teas for at least 6 minutes . I 've discovered that steeping it a tad bit longer releases more flavor . Well , at least that 's how it is with my taste buds .
5 #### The best Earl Gray tea on earth ! The price is reasonable for outstanding quality tea !
5 #### Brisk and delicious all day long . Love this tea . Stands up well to a bit of milk . Each tea bag makes two strong 8 oz cups . My favorite Twining blend . Also , like the ease and convenience of the bag although I do make other loose tea brews .
5 #### We used this to cook some lamb . It was very flavorful and we were unable to find the same quality locally . We wanted whole leaf and not ground so that it would give the most flavor .
5 #### Part of my taste test of Lemon Ginger teas -- this was a good one .
5 #### Very good peppermint tea . I buy a lot of teas and this is one of my favorites .
5 #### China Oolong Tea is a rich , satisfying black tea blend ideal for enjoying with breakfast .
5 #### Spicy , satisfying tea flavored with cinnamon , cloves , and ginger . Perfect to enjoy during cold fall and winter weather .
5 #### Twinings tea is always great and we love Irish Breakfast Tea bags . This is a great value .
5 #### Love this tea . Have been using this for many years .
5 #### Has a nice light taste and individually sealed for freshness . If you are a health nut like me this is for you .
5 #### I tried this tea at a conference out of town and had to order it that same day . I love it ! The combination of flavors is amazing . So calming . Hot or cold , this is a great tasting tea .
5 #### Excellent taste , I will keep it on hand from now on .
5 #### we really enjoy this tea ... so much more drinkable than plain green tea .
5 #### Got Ceylon one . By far the best black tea I 've ever purchased from the store . No perfumy flavor , no weird aftertaste , no fruity accents or anything like that . And it 's from Sri Lanka , means its healthier too :) Excellent with lemon . Love it .
3 #### Makes a weak tea . No matter how long I brew the bags , the flavor is weak .
5 #### Best tea ever great product great service Thank You
5 #### Makes great relaxing tea for those cold winter nights .
5 #### We eat a lot of salads in the summer time so I have to have my " Bacon Bits " to flavor them . These bits are tasty without any red food coloring . Try them you wo n't be sorry .
5 #### I just started drinking tea again and had to find MY favorite . I got this as part of a variety pack and fell in love ! !
5 #### Not sure what kind of a deal this is .. but it 's green tea . it was gone in a few days . I will reorder . I acutely miss it 's presence in my cupboard . I switched to tea from coffee because i put sugar in my coffee and i can drink tea straight . I seem to have hit the age and weight where i got ta start worrying about not really needed sugar .
5 #### Highly recommend . One of the best Jasmine Green Tea brands around . High quality and simply delicious . Thank you !
5 #### What do you do when you " ca n't " eat bacon ( due to dietary prohibition ) ? Get Bac'Uns . They make my mouth happy & have been for at least 15 + years . AWESOME ! !
5 #### I 've been purchasing these bits of Bac Uns for years in a small shaker bottle at the health food store and paying a small fortune . I was thrilled to find Amazon carrying an economy- size bag which I keep in the refrigerator in an airtight container to retain freshness . Filling up the shaker bottle as needed sure beats running out to the store and getting ripped off every few weeks as my family also loves them .
5 #### Great product . Crunchy , nice bacon flavor , a great addendum to salads , toast and any egg dish .
5 #### This tea has a really good flavor . Very tasty .
5 #### I love Earl Grey tea and have tried several brands but always come back to Twinings . This is my absolute favorite . It is perfect in every way .
5 #### Very nice tea . Very refreshing and nice smell . Like lots !
5 #### Twinings is my favorite tea brand . They have a quality product , nice bags and really good flavors .
5 #### We love this tea . It 's caffeine free and perfect as a late night tea .
5 #### I have been sampling different brands of jasmine green tea . This is one of the best , with a strong , calming fragrance . Now I just have to decide between this brand and Typhoon -- also the right strength and aroma . I must say that I have n't tasted a Stash flavor that I did n't like .
2 #### I love most of Stash 's green teas . LOVE them . Most of them are grassy and flavorful but lack the bitterness of many other brands of green . This is the exception . Blech ! It is incredibly astringent , something even more common in Jasmine greens than in a straight green . I recommend trying it from a grocery store before committing to a large Amazon purchase unless you happen to like bitter tea . That sounds absurd to me , but I do have friends who prefer their tea with a bitter bite . The&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Yamamotoyama - Jasmine - Tea - Bag / dp / B002P9D3GC / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Yamamotoyama Jasmine Tea Bag</a>&nbsp;(which stash also sells , but I could n't find it here ) is flavorful but NOT bitter .
5 #### This organic cornstarch is the finest that I 've ever seen . It 's so pure white and fine that I use it to refill my bath powder box , it 's perfect for after showering / bath use . The stuff we used in the old days was talcum power , even baby powder . From my research , I now know that talcum used to contain asbestos . It 's a wonder we 're not all dead . Even today the stuff is not safe to use . Talc is a mineral composed of hydrated magnesium silicate . Cornstarch is n't ideal either , but its particles are larger , not as easily inhaled as talc , and I 'm no diva in the bathroom . A little bit goes a long ways .
5 #### IT IS GREAT TO FIND A CORN STARCH , WHICH I USE ALL THE TIME , IN AN ORGAINIC FORM ! ! NO CHEMICALS , NO PRESERVATIVES ! ! AND NON - GMO ! ! !
4 #### the product was fresh and the packaging was profesionally done , the price could have been better , but you get what you pay for . no complaints
5 #### Love , love , love this cornstarch . I cleaned out my kitchen of all GMO products . So my cheap Argo cornstarch had to go . I also contacted Frontier before I purchased this product and they confirmed that this is a non - GMO cornstarch . Yes it 's more expensive but it 's much cheaper than other non - GMO cornstarch sold on Amazon . The mylar packaging was n't a concern since I found the entire one pound bag will fit nicely inside a quart Mason jar . I added one of the reusable plastic canning jar lids&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Ball - Regular - Mouth - Jar - Storage - Caps - Set - of-8 / dp / B0000BYC4B / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Ball Regular Mouth Jar Storage Caps Set of 8</a>&nbsp;and store the jar on my pantry shelf . Frontier is a fantastic spice company and it 's the brand I use almost exclusively in my kitchen now . Thanks Frontier for another great product .
5 #### Love that it is NON - GMO ! I have a fool - proof recipe for crispy fried chicken which requires cornstarch in place of flower to make it crispier . Worked great ! Glad to have found this product so I can cook with cornstarch again . Never been disappointed with Frontier organic products .
4 #### The only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5 is that it does n't come in a shelf stable container and it 's kind of a lot of cornstarch to have to transplant . I did n't have a container large enough for the whole bag so I had to split it up . We use cornstarch for homemade pudding and for thickening gravy and sauces . I used to use a roux , but cornstarch is just so must easier even though it 's also more processed . We also use it in place of talc based baby powder if my little guy gets a rash and it makes a great dry shampoo mixed with some cocoa powder ( because I 'm brunette ) . This is probably about a 6 month supply for my household of 2 adults and 1 baby . This is wonderful quality corn startch and since it 's organic it 's from a non - gmo source ! Overall , I have a great experiences with all of Fronteir products .
5 #### Love the flavor ! A splash of creamer or half - and - half makes it taste like the six dollar a cup at the big name store .
3 #### It 's okay , if you are looking for something cheap to put in your coffee table for guests , it 's okay . For you to taste green tea like the best . IT ISN'T Feels like water I have to put 2 on it . I 'm going to go for a more pricey one this time
5 #### I love this tea . I was weary about the vanilla at first but I really love it after I tried it . I drink a cup every night before bed . Its very relaxing tea .
4 #### Product arrived promptly and in excellent condition . I will not buy this product again , however , because the texture and flavor and not appealing .
5 #### Phenomenal seasoning . I use these bacon alternatives liberally throughout the day for almost every meal .
5 #### Love these ! My family does n't even know it 's not real bacon bits ! I do n't have a problem with the size of the bits ; they are n't all powder .
5 #### WITHOUT A DOUBT , THE BEST IMITATION BACON BITS ON THE MARKET ! Have been buying these in my local nutrition store for at least twelve years , then finally thought to look for them on Amazon . Such a great deal , I could not pass them up - and I fool people with them all the time ! They think they are " real " bacon . When I show them they are Frontier Bac'Uns , they are surprised and then go out and buy some for themselves ! As a 25 + year Vegetarian , I highly recommend these .
5 #### SO useful and well - priced , instead of buying small amounts that are super - expensive at markets .
5 #### I love using this ! I have no issues with this product .
5 #### I only buy organic corn starch only way to go !
4 #### I 'm not a tea person and I really enjoy drinking this tea . It does n't have that weird " tea " taste to it . Which probably makes absolutely no sense . I did notice that after " binge " drinking it for a few days that I had a sore throat . So maybe do n't drink a ton of it for 3 days straight , or do you may be able to get out of work .
4 #### Breathing in peppermint can significantly aid in cough spurts . While I have the essential oils to help with this , there 's nothing quite like a cup of peppermint with some honey in it when you 're sick . It 's a great quality , I always trust the Twinings brand
3 #### I 'm a lover of chai tea . We 're talking the type that tastes like a cinnamon fake blended - ice coffee . Not the ones leaning on tasting like black tea or spice . This tea is leaning more on the black / spice side of things . It is n't as bad as the Tazo chai tea . That was very bitter black tea . So while this is n't something I really like , possibly due to the clove in it , it 's okay and I do drink it . I just wo n't be buying another box . My search for a good , sweet , chai is still on - going
4 #### A very nice flavor for hot tea or iced tea . But I do use extra bags since one is not enough for me . I like very strong tea .
4 #### I would give this cornstarch 5 stars except Bob 's Red Mill Corn Starch , 22 - Ounce ( Pack of 4 ) offered on Amazon for the same price ( 5.5 lb ) and Bob 's claims that their corn is non - gmo and kosher .
5 #### I try to use organic ingredients for cooking whenever possible . I could never find organic cornstarch until now . VERY happy with my purchase !
5 #### Picked some up in the store the other day . What a pleasant surprise ! The tea is wonderful ! Very mellow with a delightful after taste . Will buy again .
5 #### I love this tea . It has a subtle flavor that 's not too strong and not too light .
5 #### I 'm thankful that amazon carries this item . It is high quality and exceeds my expectations .
5 #### I use these instead of extra salt .... works well , tastes good , and helps cut down need for salt .
5 #### Very nice product and I like the consistency of the powder - not to fine , not to grainy . I recommend and would buy again .
5 #### This onion granule product is great . I use it every day on my eggs . It would store very well , for a very long time , I 'm sure . The packaging is air - tight , yet easy to open , when needed . The container is glass . I have yet to reuse one , but I intend to .
5 #### another hard to find baking product available to me from Amazon . this is a good product and I use it to thicken sauces and soups and gravies without having to worry about using GMO or chemical filled starch from the grocers
5 #### Frontier organic products are excellent in whole food meals . I have been using for years which has grown into a family staple over time . Grateful to have Frontier products in my spice rack and family .
4 #### Bought this as an addition to fill out a Pantry box . It is nice to have a tea that actually has nothing added to the Green Tea itself . No Pomegranate , no Honey , just straight Green Tea . Which is what I want in the first place . It did last me a while , and there was some leakage of the leaves into the tea itself , but the taste was great and more convenient if you have a Keurig to put out the hot water to brew it with . Thumbs up .
5 #### You know you are a serious tea drinker when you buy it a case at a time ! My father recently moved in with me and we are both serious tea drinkers ... at least 3 cups each / day . And Twining 's is n't cheap when you buy it in the 20 bag boxes .... so I finally came on here to search for a better deal and BINGO , I get this choice . Perfect ! 1/3 less in price and it will last us well over a month . We both love this tea which is reasonably strong and flavorful . I lived in the UK for 8 yrs and my father is British so we both like a good cuppa and this is our joint favorite option . I purchased this at full retail price as a PERSONAL purchase and am reviewing this because I want to . I have not been asked to write a review and I have no personal connection with the seller . As usual my opinions and experiences are a real and true reflection of my experience with the product . I hope my review helps you in your purchase decisions !
4 #### Camomile , Mint , Lemon , Organic . What more can you say . Great value . Good after dinner / nightime with no caffeine .
3 #### Does nt thicken sauces and soups very well and not much in the bag . Unfortunately , I would not purchase again
5 #### I am very happy to find affordable , organic cornstarch .
5 #### I love onions ! I can put them on everything ! And I 've have tried several other brands of onion granules but this brand is by far my favorite . Wonderful flavor and consistency . Strong but not overwhelming onion taste . Huge bonus that it 's non - gmo ! I 've also bought their ceylon cinnamon and the flavor is exceptional as well .
5 #### Love this company . I used to buy cheap spices at the grocery store thinking there was n't a big difference but there is !
5 #### Excellent . BEST English Breakfast Tea . Ca n't live without it . Really enjoy it every day .
5 #### It 's a seasoning . It seems of good quality and I use it on just about everything .
5 #### Delicious , This is one of the best onion granules I have bought . I have just started buying all the Frontier Naturals spices and I have n't been disappointed with any of them
4 #### Good onion granules- not minced , or powder , but very small granules that you can see . Good for meatballs , sauces , etc- where you want onion flavor , buy maybe not the texture of larger mince .
1 #### Did not care for this . Another brand tastes better
5 #### i usually use organic garlic cloves ( not from China ! ) , but occasionally I run out . I have used the flakes and powder and both lack flavor and amount for use . The flakes do n't always " melt " in time and the powder flies around . The granules are much better . Try this product and see for yourself !
5 #### I love this stuff , I emptied it already the other day ! It has a very tasty real onion flavor and is a granulated and not a powder which I like . I do not think you will be unhappy with this product in any way !
5 #### Just add a little half and half , Voila , perfection !
5 #### I 've tried Lipton 's , Tazo and one other I ca n't recall the name , but for my taste none compare with this Twining . I 'm through shopping around . This my chai .
5 #### I ca n't find this in the stores very often . This is a very good price ! I really enjoy this tea and can drink it any time of the day .
5 #### I had been looking for this particular tea for quite a while .
5 #### My favorite go to tea for morning or afternoon . No bitter taste .
4 #### EXPENSIVE ! Though what is not to like about real vanilla extract ? Love real organic vanilla when cooking .. :)
5 #### Great product , has awesome coconut flavor . I also like the packaging .
5 #### I searched for a good vanilla . I tried this on Amazon , and , by jingo , it is the best . You taste vanilla without cringing from a bite of alcohol . I love it and recommend it for others to try .
4 #### really like this tea and can use at work is great just wish it had more of a pepperment taste
5 #### I really enjoy the Blackcurrant flavor . I purchased one of the 20 count boxes and have now added the 6 - 20count box item to my Subscribe and Save . Hopefully , the price will stay nice . The tea bag has a nice smell which is shared by the tea . It has a nice light fruity flavor .
3 #### I tried this Chamomile tea as I recently started drinking chamomile for digestive issues as it is antispasmodic and anti inflammatory . I 've found that Chamomile can have many different tastes . However , I suggest this tea be called Vanilla , Honey Chamomile as vanilla is the dominant taste and it is very sweet . n. I will not buy it again . I really like Choice Organic Chamomile for digestion
2 #### I did not find it strong enough for a black tea . Super market English tea is double the strength of this . Very disappointed .
1 #### It has absolutely no taste or smell . It just tastes and smells like alcohol . I tried it plain , putting it in my coffee straight , and also making a mix with milk . NO TASTE . I cook a lot , and I know what extracts should taste and smell like . This one is just plain alcohol .
4 #### Good tea , less strong and more delicate than Celestial peppermint . Prefer it over Celestial . Good tea for aiding in digestion or just as a tea to sip on in the late hours ( no caffeine ) .
5 #### I love earl grey . While this is n't the finest I 've ever had , for breakfast everyday it does the trick and it 's a great value .
5 #### I typically never use premixed spices . However , I love this for a very simple tofu chicken . I dice a cube , throw it in the pan with olive oil , salt , pepper and lots of poultry seasoning . This is an extremely quick method if I want to throw together some on the fly " chicken " noodle soup .
1 #### I ordered 3 bottles of the Frontier Poultry Seasoning a few years ago here on Amazon and was very disappointed when I received my order as all items were stale and had no aroma or flavor . Unfortunately , I must have received items that had been sitting on the shelf for years . I ended up throwing them in the trash and never ordered this brand again . I would highly recommend The Spice Hunter Organic Poultry Seasoning ( salt free ) . The herbs are perfectly balanced and absolutely always fresh and aromatic .
5 #### This spice is ground to a fine powder which I like , because my 3 year old grandson does not like strong flavors , and I can use a small amount when roasting a chicken and making soup . The flavor is savory and aromatic . Is has no salt , and is organic , what more could I ask for .
5 #### My wife loves peppermint tea , and this tea fits the bill perfectly .
5 #### I 'm trying to lose my last 15 lbs . and according to all the research I 've done , Oolong , White and Green Teas are the best for weight loss . I drink 3 - 5 cups of these wonderful teas everyday and the pounds come off .
1 #### I 'm not sure if the tea bags I purchased were " seconds " or what , but this tastes nothing like what I buy in the grocery store . Awful . Thought I might try to save a bit and stock up , but I 'd rather pay more and know what I 'm getting .
1 #### I 'm not sure if the tea bags I purchased were " seconds " or what , but this tastes nothing like what I buy in the grocery store . Awful . Thought I might try to save a bit and stock up , but I 'd rather pay more and know what I 'm getting . Literally tastes like hot garden dirt .
5 #### I love this tea ! Perfect for summer when I 'm not trying to drink hot tea all the time . It 's so easy to make and delicious ! I drink it without sugar . The mint is a great additional taste that keeps it light and flavorful -- sometimes I even add extra mint leaves .
5 #### So easy to brew and so delicious to drink ! ! ! ! Saves boiling water in the hot weather .
5 #### Love this tea - it helps my stomach when I have indigestion especially stomach cramps from wind .
5 #### No complaints . Smells great , food tastes like you 'd expect after putting in vanilla extract =)
5 #### this vanilla had the best taste of the organic vanilla we have tested
4 #### Its good , its herby but I still use it . I do n't use it every time I cook chicken , but here and there is is a nice change of pace !
5 #### I use it to make turkey and the turkey smells and tastes so good .
5 #### Good basic seasoning for my purpose . I was looking for a straightforward poultry seasoning . It was in my cart and when the price decreased I quickly purchased it .
5 #### First time to use this brand of seasoning . Honestly only bought this one because of it 's price at the time . It has a really good fresh taste and well worth the price . We will be buying more of this brand seasoning .
4 #### Disappointingly bland . At first . But I m a fan of this brand and I hated to waste it , so I experimented by supplementing it with stronger spices & fresh / dehydrated herbs , such as paprika , cayenne , granulated garlic & onion , sage , basil & more . Even simple , course - ground , black pepper helped give it the kick we prefer . Opinions about spices are perhaps among the more subjective of reviews , & my initial reaction was indeed that this was far too bland . Now I m going to reorder in the belief that its a pleasant combination that can serve as a base mixture , agreeably augmentable to suit our palates . Recommend .
5 #### Very particular in my spices selection for Poultry ... great blend .
5 #### Love the favor and I do n't miss the SALT .
5 #### I use this for my meat free meals veggies and food . The best salt free seasoning blend I 've ever tasted !
5 #### Love this product ! I love to use it on tofu or veggies , smells great and contains no salt !
5 #### I know I sound like a broken record ( look it up , kiddies ! ) , but I love Frontier seasonings . Most of them are organic , they do n't use GMOs and the taste is always fresh and potent . In addition to treating their business partners fairly , Frontier demonstrates a lot of client care . They use great ingredients , so that even flavorings you thought were mundane come alive again . That 's certainly the case here where I feel like I 've rediscovered an old friend in the kitchen . There are subtle notes that you just do n't get from the mass market stuff . Given it 's size , quality and packaging , this is a STEAL .
3 #### This is okay for a poultry seasoning but I have found others which a prefer over this product . One can never have too many seasonings !
5 #### VERY SEASONAL TASTING . USE IT IN MANY POULTRY AND BEEF DISHES
4 #### Was good enough to make a gluten - free , millet - based stuffing virtually taste like that real thing .
5 #### This poultry seasoning is actually better than the tried - and - true brand I have used for years , plus is it ORGANIC . It has a tiny bit of zip to it ( heat ) but not much . My Christmas cornbread dressing was a big hit .
4 #### Lovely English Breakfast tea at a great price . The 100 tea bag package is much more economical as we use six a day .
3 #### I did n't realize it would have black tea taste so strong . It 's still good .. though I prefer a stronger chai taste .
1 #### not happy with this teabag . it does not have any jasmine in it . disappointed .
3 #### I 'm not much of a tea lover , I bought it because I wanted the benefits of Jasmine tea , to my surprise this is not 100 % Jasmine , it 's a mixture with green tea . I have had family members try it and they did like the flavor . It just did n't work out for me .
2 #### I love Twinings Teas but this one fell short for me . I buy 4 other favors from Twining and I 'm very happy with them . This lemon flavor reminded me of furniture polish not lemons .
5 #### My husband and I both love Earl Grey -- and Twining 's has the best flavor .
5 #### Strong ! I used a half of teaspoon for my water bottle mixed with water and lemon . I was unable to drink because it was too minty . Only need a drop may be two . Definately worth it !
5 #### Perfect in my homemade ice cream ! It 's all organic , thanks to the extract being available in organic too
5 #### I use it season seitan and it comes out fantastic I love it .
5 #### I 'm vegan , so I do n't use this for its intended purpose , but this spice blend really adds a delicious savory " Thanksgiving " taste to soups , stews and seitan . If I 'm just cooking from the seat of my pants , I always reach for this to give my dish a good blend of spices when I do n't feel like experimenting on my own .
4 #### I like Frontier 's brand of spices , and this is no different . I also like that it 's organic . This is very tasty , and much like other poultry seasonings , but the organic part is why I got this .
5 #### Adore this tea ! Especially for any tummy aches or sinus issues ! And it is just yummy !
5 #### Surprisingly good . Far better than I expected . I thought this was going to be generic get - dinner - on - the - table type seasoning to fall back on but it turns out that it 's really a terrific combination of herbs and spices that brings out the best in chicken . My recent favorite has been buying a pack of breasts with rib meat ( BONE IN ! SKIN ON ! ) , rubbing those with a bit of oil ( try avocado oil if you can find it ) and then sprinkling them with this spice mix and then broiling them at the bottom of the oven for about 40 minutes , half of those minutes with a sheet of foil on top . Delicious ! Then shred the leftovers for sandwiches the next day . Really good stuff !
5 #### Pro : No salt poultry seasoning . Tastes good . Works as a rub . Would be good for rice fish and savory dairy . Cons : None .
5 #### Thank you for carrying organic herbs and spices at a reasonable cost on Amazon !
5 #### Smells delicious ! Have used in many things now . wonder if they have larger bottles - I 'll have to check .
3 #### I bought this for use in drinks , but it 's not a true peppermint flavor
1 #### Now I know why products that contain flavorings have so many ingredisnts . This changed the yogurt I put it in a few days later to be inedible . Though the same batch ( unflavored ) was still good . It made the yoghurt ( homage ) taste oddly alcoholic and acetone like . Smelly in a toxic way . I ca n't imagine what this " organic " additive does to me if it does that to yoghurt . Tossing it .
4 #### We all like this certified organic poultry seasoning . It gives a great taste to poultry and also to gravies and sauces . We are getting used to the poignant fresh flavor and have learned to add a little less .
3 #### This is so so ... not really what I had in mind for a rub on the outside of roasted chicken . The flavors are the basics for poultry but the power is very fine and not really as granular as I would like . Not a particularly good rub for BBQ or oven .
5 #### Fresh and flavorful . Not only do I use it for poultry ; occasionally , I dust a salad with it . Adds a zesty layer . Try it !
5 #### Happy to find a tea with nothing but peppermint !
4 #### Good value , but does not taste / smell at all of jasmine . Just tastes like plain green tea .
4 #### This is my first time trying green tea . I 've been a drinker do black tea most of my life but I 've heard about the benefits of green tea and decided to try it . This tea has a nice flavor , however I have no comparisons to make with it . The price was right to try it and I 'm not disappointed , though I reserve major judgement until I 've tried more varieties .
5 #### I have bought this product multiple times . That is my review .
5 #### This is the only vanilla extract I ever use . I like that it is organic , non - GMO and gluten free .
5 #### I have purchased this through Amazon and this seller before , the quality of taste and consistency is always there . Highly recommend this Certified Organic ( yes , seal is on the label ) seasoning from Frontier .
3 #### i 've used this a few times , but i do n't love the flavor or smell . i usually opt for seasoning blends where you can see the individual herbs . this is a brown color with all herbs ground together . i 'll probably use it in a pinch , but i wo n't buy again .
4 #### Good price and product ! Use this alot with my biscuit and gravy receipe . Yum !
5 #### These are perfect to add a little zing to plain old iced tea . I use 2 bags to add to regular cold brew tea bags to have an iced tea that 's just a little different .
5 #### Great Tasting Tea . I love to relax at night with a cup of hot tea . My favorite is Jane Grey ( or as I say- Lady Jane Grey ) . I like Italian or sweet cream added to mine . It is like a reward at the end of the day and sends the message , hey , relax . It is best with a Biscotti or a Hershey bar ! No way , can you beat the price . It arrives fairly quickly . Usually it is well packaged . I had one bad experience ( that was UPS fault ) . This package has a 100 tea bags compare that with what a 20 package sells for at the grocery store . Thank you Amazon for offering fine English tea . It is not a strong , black tea but is really good . These came sealed in individual foil packets . I buy from Amazon only now for most of the tea & coffee , ca n't beat the price or service .
5 #### I LOVE THIS SEASONING NOT JUST ON POULTRY BUT IN MY BURGERS AND IN SOUPS .
5 #### Delicious seasoning for chicken , and even vegetables . And I love that it is organic - free of contaminants and pesticides .
5 #### Nice for chicken and dumplings I use it for that only . It 's really good for that dish and for stuffing at holiday time try it out it 's wonderful .
5 #### I could really taste how much better this is than non - organic . I will buy it again .
5 #### Wonderful spice ! Treat yourself to this wonderful poultry seasoning . It is one of the best I have used . HIGHLY recommend this .
5 #### Parsley , sage , rosemary , and thyme , the ingredients in poultry seasoning , always seem to come in very small jars that do not fit conveniently on the spice rack on the door of the pantry . Moreover , these little jars can not be stacked atop one another . This collection of herbs is exactly what I need when making turkey or chicken stuffing , and the size of the bottle is perfect for the herb and spice shelves . Moreover , the larger opening allows for using a measuring spoon .
5 #### Nice to be able to make my own peppermint mocha without all the garbage you get in a store bought coffee . Watch your portions - too much makes whatever you 're using it for inedible .
1 #### So , I 've never had any other coconut extract before , so maybe they all taste this bad . But this does not taste anything like coconut . Takes like what I imagine mold would taste . Trashed it
5 #### I love this peppermint extract . I love that it is organic and that it tastes great !
4 #### bags rip semi easy , but tea is pretty good .
5 #### Through pregnancy and through normalcy :) :) A wonderful herbal tea to enjoy , not just to settle your stomach . I have tried a few ginger teas and find this one 's flavors perfectly balanced .
5 #### Consistent quality and great taste , I would purchase this again .
4 #### I use a few drops in every pitcher of filtered tap water to mask any remaining foul tastes . It 's refreshing !
5 #### Good quality , nice flavor profile . Works well for me .
5 #### We use this for smoothies to make a chocolate mint smoothie . Love it .
5 #### I love this stuff but I have found that I like keeping it in the fridge .
5 #### The drink of my after noon . I drink way to much caffeine for my own good i am trying to switch it up with the more healthy green tea . This is a cheap and good one
5 #### Love tea from this brand , taste great . One of my favorite green tea brands .
5 #### I 've tried many different brand packaged green tea , personally this is my favorite . Love it .
4 #### One star deducted for Twinings changing the color to a darker red on the box and little bags . One develops a strong association between colors and products . Change often signals inferior quality these days . But the tea tastes the same , thank goodness .
5 #### Brews nicely , but is a bit weak for my taste
5 #### Really nice , flavorful tea . It 'll never replace coffee for me but this can be a nice change .
5 #### Really nice , ' deep ' tea flavor . ALMOST a direct substitute for coffee for me , in the morning . I enjoy this late morning / early afternoon . Nice flavor .
5 #### My family loves coconut and this really brings out the coconut flavor .
5 #### Whenever I find organic I 'm pleased and extract is a must . The flavor was supreme and I love the glass bottle .
5 #### Purchase this tea every year and drink it all year ! ! Love ice tea and this is delicious , no sugar necessary , has a wonderfully peachy flavor , never bitter . Have yet to find in any store so always buy here in bulk . Works for me .
4 #### I had one for my first time and I think I would prefer them over lipton ones . Thumbs up .
3 #### Tea is good , but over - priced . It is small individual bags , not the larger sized ice tea bags I was expecting .
5 #### I usually buy small boxes in the grocery store , but this was a great price and Amazon Prime beats a second trip to the grocery store , for a forgotten item :) I really like Twinings tea bags . My loose leaf teas are wonderful , but for a quick , economical cup of tea ( I drink a lot of tea daily ) , these are great .
5 #### Always have good luck with Twinings . Their tea is consistently good
1 #### This is by far the absolute worst tasting " Thai " spice I have ever used . I have been to Thailand numerous times and this is nothing like Thai seasoning . The taste is bland , although a bit spicy . This would best be used as something you might put on a salad as an accent . This being said , I have also tried The Spice Hunter Jerk Seasoning and it too is awful . Maybe it 's because Spice Hunter seasonings are salt free ... There 's a reason why store shelves are stocked with name - brand products , because they are good . This brand is harder to find and there 's a reason . I had such high hopes ...
5 #### Bought this for my pepper grinder I got myself to Christmas . Love the taste of fresh ground pepper .
5 #### My favorite tea -= hands down ! Pricing you have to watch ...
5 #### I have been drinking Jasmine Green tea on a regular basis for a few years which for the longest time actual tea leaves and jasmine . This product is both affordable and great .
5 #### I love the Lemon and Mint tea 's . I was so happy to see these on a deal . They are so flavorful thankfully . I use 4 bags and make a small pitcher , and have a very nice refreshing drink in this heat . i will buy again for sure .
5 #### Loving this product . The variaty is amazing you get to try different flavors
5 #### Gentle and tasty . . A refreshing tea for after dinner either hot or cold .
5 #### Really convenient blend for a quick Thai meal ! I love saut&eacute;ing ground chicken or beef with this and making lettuce wraps or a jasmine rice veg stir fry .
5 #### If I have a Asian dish I will put this on it . It give the dish an extra kick !
5 #### Ongoing love affair with Twining 's English Breakfast . My every morning drink so must have an adequate supply on hand . That 's why Amazon is there .... to make sure my tea is delivered as ordered . Also gave a monthly delivery to my daughter in TN who also shares my love for this tea . Said it was such a great birthday gift .... a year 's supply thus far . Having lived in England for a few years WAY BACK WHEN I was delighted to become a member of the tea drinking culture .... morning and again at afternoon tea time . Still visit local tea houses here in Tampa to enjoy that repast .
5 #### Really , really nice tasting . This spice is a nice combination and is not overwhelmed by any one of the spices . Fresh smelling and fresh tasting . Will purchase again .
5 #### Has a great combination of seasonings with enough heat but not too much . adds a seafood flavour . it almost smells a little fishy but it tastes great
5 #### An amazing spice that Frontier COOP ships freshly ground . I love adding Cardamom to my smoothies - I make mine with fresh veggies like beets or butternut squash , almond milk , a dash of stevia and some plain greek yogurt then put in 2 teaspoons of cardamom for a tasty and healthy beverage . What a wonderful addition to my spice closet . And even the Amish grocer ca n't beat the price .
5 #### Great find . The glass bottle keeps the beautiful spice potent with it 's amazing flavor and aroma . There is so much in here , I have shared with a few of my fri.nds and I have so much ! Delicious , non - irradiated ( does not destroy the beneficial components of the spice ) . Thank you ,
5 #### I really like Frontier spices and I only buy organic . I use cardamom in many recipes . Try it - you 'll like it .
5 #### I always buy Frontier brand spices . Their products are always consistently high quality and fresh . I would recommend them to anyone .
5 #### This is my first venture into using Cardamom as a seasoning , but the Frontier Culinary Spices Ground Cardamom Seed smells delicious , and I ca n't wait to make some of the recipes using this spice . Also got some UMI tea that is made with cardomom . Supposed to be healthy stuff . At this rate I may live for ever , LOL .
5 #### They pepper corns are very clean , no sticks or stones , and smells great . I found a clear acryllic pepper grinder , nearly two feet high at a thrift store for five dollars ; it may take nearly the entire bag of corns to filll it . It is a great grinder , I 'm looking forward to using it .
2 #### Very weak on flavor . I have suspected for some time that many of the tea producers that attempted to package fewer than 20 bags per box and got terrible results in sales volume may have sneakily decided to reduce the amount of leaves per bag keeping the number of bags at 20 but making the cup of tea suffer . Even when using half the amount of water I normally do for a cup of tea this pure peppermint the result is terrible . Wo n't be buying this again and removed it from my auto - ship settings .
4 #### This is a nice mild peppermint flavored tea for those who do enjoy the taste of peppermint . On the other hand , I wanted this tea for IBS gas cramping ( which if you have ever had severe gas cramps , you know they are excruciating ) . The tea was n't strong enough to get rid of my gas , even after drinking several cups at a time . I ended up having to use pure peppermint oil drops inside this tea to make the gas go away ( which by the way , peppermint oil is super concentrated & just one drop is somewhere around the equivalent of 10 or 20 tea bags- do n't quote me , I ca n't recall the exact number of tea bags ! ! ! ) For a nice cup of flavorful and richly scented peppermint tea this is wonderful . For gas , not so much .
5 #### My favorite new spice . Very tasty . Full of anti - inflammatory spices . I use it in a lot of recipes .
3 #### This spice has a nice flavor , but I expected a different flavor since it is labeled as Thai spice . Gives a nice flavor to stir fries , but nothing really all that special .
5 #### I have tried more than one spice blend from this company ( via grocery store and their website ) and thus far , it has never failed to be delicious . This particular one is probably my personal favorite . It is a little bit spicy but contrary to what many people believe about Thai cooking , it is NOT always outrageously hot . This has a spicy sweet kick to it . I 'd rate it about a 5 on a one to ten heat index . Try using this on chicken breasts that you are pan sauteing . Put your chicken breasts ( boneless / skinless ) in a hot frying pan that you have put about a tablespoon of oil into ( can use cooking spray also ) . After one side has browned , flip it , add the seasoning blend , brown the other side , put on your plate and season that side . It goes wonderfully with rice noodles or brown rice . The seasoning itself also goes great IN the brown rice or stirred into the noodles . It 's a great way to make a relatively low fat / low calorie meal taste outstanding . If you like this blend , you have to try their others ! Deliciously Dill is also a personal favorite .
5 #### We got this to try something new . We are very pleased with the result of the flavors this offers . Easy fast taste change for us .
5 #### This is a great blend . I love Thai in general . Spicy without being too hot . Try it on lots of things and you will be impressed .
4 #### I 've used it once or twice . I got it with a few others and have been trying them out . Spice Hunter makes good spice mixtures . So far so good .
5 #### Organic Coconut Extract is not easy to come by . I asked my husband to pick some up at the store and everything he saw was not only not organic , but also artificially flavored ( yuk ! ) . If I am going to the trouble of baking I want to use natural and organic ingredients not just because they are healthier , but they taste better . I made coconut cupcakes with them & they turned out quite delicious - yum !
5 #### This is very good organic black tea . I love it anytime and love it does n't have all those chemicals .
5 #### a great tasting tea at a reasonable price . Most jasmine teas are pricey , especially the " high quality " ones . This tea has all the convenience that a tea bag offers , with the great flavor I love in the jasmine . The green tea , fortunately does n't mask the taste of the jasmine .. which was my main concern when I first tried it . AND , altho I have tasted and love the Premium Jasmine teas .. this brand is fine for general or daily tea consumption . The other I keep around for a treat .
5 #### Love this tea ! ! Keep coming back to Twinings Earl Grey blends .
5 #### Love this tea . Will be getting more when I run out . Not too strong , easy to drink , tastes great .
2 #### Yes it is a dark tea but that is all it is . There is no flavor it tastes like water . I am a tea drinker so I do know how to brew a decent cup of tea . I will switch back to English breakfast tea from now on . I just do n't like hot water by itself .
5 #### Very good . Like the large size box . Fast delivery . Good price . Will order again .
5 #### We are enjoying this wonderful spice , hope to buy it again soon .
5 #### As a recent convert to Middle Eastern and gluten - free cooking , I can use ground cardamon without having to pulverize the seeds . A wonderful aroma !
5 #### Really good flavorful cardamom . Some have such a strong menthol - like component . This goes very nicely in my chai tea .
5 #### It 's a great product . Yes , I would reccommend it to my friends . Amazon is a great way to shop . It comes right to your door .
5 #### A great value and an excellent tea . I love it hot or cold and drink this year round . I love tea whether Iced or hot . This is an excellent tea and a good value . Thanks for making such a great tea .
4 #### ... but I prefer the powdered Chai latte products
5 #### My sister was shipped off to Guam in order to lighten the load she left quite a few things at my home including 6 of these teabags . I 'm one of those people who goes to bed on time only to lay awake , staring at the ceiling and listening to the rest of the house sleep . One night I got up about 1 am and decided to try one of these tea bags , by the time I finished about half of the mug it was beddy by bose time . I went back upstairs with mug in hand and very , very quickly fell asleep . After that , the bags went a little too quickly and Wally 's did n't carry them . I bought 2 other chamomile products ( Cozy Chamomile and Nighty Night ) that did n't taste nearly as good , nor did they work . Having learned my lesson , I ordered 6 boxes with a prime coupon for subscriptions for $ 15.95 , which are typically $ 7 something a box . Needless to say , I am very happy with my purchase .
5 #### Pizza is a staple for us and this has become essential . The ground up bits of dried tomato add depth beyond the usual italian spice mix -though Frontier 's other italian spice mix generally gets a shake or two as well . Well worth the small premium over the usual italian spice mixes .
5 #### purchased this pizza spice for my son to use in his off campus apartment to make pizzas from supermarket purchased dough and jarred sauces . his pizzas came out really well and tasty . I love his anchovy pizza with hot peppers . !
5 #### great product . I 'd love to buy this in bulk . This is the basic ingredient that all pizza chains are missing these days . Small details make a world of difference . Buy this and be transported back in time to that point where pizza joints actually cared about the quality and taste of the product being sold to the consumer . Bravo . This same product in a fine , medium , and course grind would be a good idea . FYI
5 #### I looked all over for coconut extract and could find only " flavor of . " Flavorganic delivered in spades !
5 #### My favorite tea . Does n't need any sweetener or anything
5 #### This is my favorite tea ! Rejuvenating peppermint tea leaf ( not oil ) scent and flavor . Great hot or cold .
5 #### First time trying this brand and it met my expectations for bulk Tellicherry peppercorns . I like it . Smells wonderful even before cracking and tastes like gourmet pepper . Am storing in the fridge . Could use a sealing strip to keep fresh but using a clothespin for now . Will buy again when done with this package and recommend .
4 #### these are priced well and seem fresh . The only thing that could be improved is if these came in a zip lock bag .
5 #### Great price for the amount of tea bags that you get . I 've found that it costs more in stores .
1 #### Where is the hazelnut ? There is no hazelnut flavor , except a slight lingering bitter taste of alcohol . An absolute waste of money . I can not figure out why Flavorganics would think this extract is okay to sell . I really have to question the integrity of this company . This was the first and last thing I ever buy from Flavorganics .
5 #### Have n't tried it yet but believe it will be good .
5 #### Very tasty peppercorns for the price . I had tried some of the boutique peppercorns , but I find for flavor pungency and aroma these are just as good and a lot less expensive . You wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### Adds great flavor to a frozen pizza and is great for making pizza sausage .
5 #### My last peppermint extract was one of the victims of my last move , so I had been meaning to purchase more , since it seems to come up , a lot , in the recipes I come across . I chose this particular item because of the amazing reviews , and I 'm happy to report that I was n't disappointed . This extract smells amazing , the second you open the bottle . I 've used this extract in desserts and body products , and both the taste and scent are amazing . I was worried that the scent would come off as an unpleasantly harsh peppermint ( my last one was good , but not great ) , but it kind of has a sweetness to it that makes it smell heavenly . I used some in a peppermint bark popcorn recipe , over the holidays , and it turned out amazing ; if any dish tastes like eating Christmas , that would be it . The small amount of extract that I added infused every bit of it with an intense peppermint flavor . The only downside I can think of is that a dropper is not included , but I do n't really mind . I do n't think I could ask for a better peppermint extract .
4 #### Over the years , the quality of tea in general has greatly diminished . To make a large cup of tea , I need to use 2 teabags . I am about half way through the box , and have n't decided if i will reorder ... Just the cost difference of Twinings vs Lipton . I just miss the good old days when I purchased a ' better ' tea , and I was rewarded with a full bodied flavor . I may just have to go back to tea leaves , and see if I can get a decent cup of tea there . I am 73 , and been drinking tea since I was a child . My grandmothers brewed and I was given my own cup at about 7 or 8 , with lots of cream and sugar , at first . If I had the option of purchasing the tea of yesterday , I would . I do n't think any good tea comes in a teabag anymore . A good cup of tea is a wonderful thing . Shared , even better . So , I resume my search .
5 #### Light Earl Grey flavor with a slight citrus undertone .
5 #### LOVE THIS ! It made home made sauce so easy ! Tomato sauce and this ! Nice and flavorful , fresh and delicious . Good for sgetti too !
5 #### May be good but it 's an add - on product . Ca n't get it .
4 #### Very , very good . The aroma from this blend is awesome . Mine was somewhat different from the picture , the bottle was glass and had a slender , metal screw cap . The focus for this seems to be pizza , but have found it adds great taste to other dishes like spaghetti and lasagna too .
5 #### Absolutely fantastic seasoning for pizza , or anything else . What else to say ? ?
5 #### This spice mix tastes great and is greatly needed for delivered and frozen pizzas these days ! ! !
5 #### I could tell this was fresh when I opened the first box by well of the scent - it smelled like tea , with a nice , fresh tea aroma . It brewed up nicely and makes a nice cuppa . Makes good iced tea as well . And the price was right . Delivery was very fast , right to my door . I 'm pleased with the purchase .
5 #### Just started using this in my new pepper mil . I love pepper . This is just right for my taste . I am looking forward to adding to all my cooked foods . jack
3 #### This is OK pizza spice . Nothing too exciting , but it does add a little flavor to the sauce . I would n't say it 's great though . Also it has quite a bit of fennel in it . Some really go for that flavor , but again I 'm probably not one of them .
5 #### On the occasion we make a homemade stromboli or some sort of sub this makes a nice seasoning . Just like a pizza shop right at home .
2 #### Much of the peppercorns are dry and old it seems . Wo n't be getting again .
5 #### This is my new favorite tea ! I will buy again
5 #### Mother brought me some from Vancouver island many years ago . Only one store in my town carries it . My daughter started sending two big boxes thru amazon . I drink it all day . Everyone wants tea when they visit . Best flavor .
5 #### Decaf tea can be more unhealthy than regular black tea ; but this is the only naturally decaffeinated tea out there ( only this and the Lady Grey , though , not the English Breakfast ) . I get to drink good and tasty tea while kicking the caffeine habit .
5 #### have used it for years and will continue to order again and again . Great tea !
2 #### Buyers you should know that the top ingredient in this product is water ; the second is alcohol . The coconut flavor is weak .
5 #### This is a wonderful vanilla for cooking . I like the idea of knowing that there is some level of cleanness to the food I am preparing .
5 #### I really like this because unlike other extracts it does not have canola oil or other oils mixed in with it . It is just water , alcohol and peppermint oil , not to mention that it is organic ! It has a great taste and smell , I have used it to make mint chip ice cream and love it .
5 #### This is probably the best coconut extract I have ever had . love it .
4 #### We like this pizza seasoning . It 's the best pizza seasoning we 've found . It adds a a boost of " pizza " flavor . My family is not a fan of oregano and this seasoning is not full of oregano but still gives you a delicious pizza flavor .
5 #### Best bagged tea I 've found . I drink tea like it 's going out of style , and I 've found Twinings the best for the money . It is rich and malty , but not bitter , and stands up to milk and sugar without losing its character
5 #### I buy these to refill my pepper grinder . Taste great and the bag refill my grinder at least three times .
5 #### I ordered and got this a long time ago but I just opened it today after I ran out of pepper and had to replenish my stores . Holy cow ! ! When I first opened the bag the aroma was intense and beautiful ! This is the real deal folks . The stuff which 18th century land and naval wars were fought over and whole new trade routes had to be established . This stuff is why Columbus went in search of another way to the far east from the other side . He was NOT looking for the new world . This is far and away , the best Telicherry pepper I have ever had . I have bought peppercorns from grocery stores and membership warehouses and while they were good , this stuff here puts those to shame . If you love the taste of black pepper and you are picky about the freshness and pungency of your spice , then this is for you . If you think Telicherry pepper is too strong a spice then you may want to give this one a pass . I am extremely pleased and I will be ordering this again in about a year when my supply runs low again !
5 #### This blend is perfect for pizza night ! It 's got wonderful spicy flavor and a true Italian aroma . It 's non - GMO , non - ETO and non - irradiated . The only thing that could make it better is if it were also Organic .
5 #### This was a great purchase , and I like this pizza seasoning better than regular old Italian seasoning . I made the most delicious mac and cheese with it last night .. (it was a tomato version with elbow macaroni , tomato soup , crushed tomatoes , a little butter , milk , minced garlic , black pepper , medium cheddar cheese , lots of PIZZA SEASONING , and buttered bread crumbs on top ) . I look forward to trying this spice on scrambled eggs , garlic bread etc . All of the Frontier seasonings I have purchased have been very fresh and fragrant .
5 #### Love this tea in the morning . Bold tasting black tea with just the right amount of caffeine to get you going . I 've given up coffee completely and find this a great alternative .
5 #### I love this tea ! It 's probably not for everyone ... it has a distinctly smoky flavor . But it is so soothing ! Especially after a frustrating day of work , Lapsang calms my rattled nerves . I always pour myself a cup late in the afternoon and do some painting or writing . Then another cup after dinner ... perfect in the evening . Definitely my favorite tea !
5 #### I 'm not a spice person really but we put this on everything Italian now . It 's really good and I got it as an add on item so was a good price .
5 #### Great taste and better than the generic stuff I 've used in the past .
5 #### I LIKE MIXING THIS WITH MY DOUGH BEFORE LETTING IT RISE . I THINK IT ADDS SOMETHING , COURSE MAYBE IT 'S JUST ME . I REALLY LIKE THIS STUFF !
5 #### I used this product to make a wedding cake , and the bride and groom were delighted . I did n't want to buy an artificial flavoring , so I was excited to find this pure coconut extract , and it was delicious . Thanks so much !
5 #### Best Vanilla Extract out there . I have been using this vanilla for the past 3 years and no other Vanilla can come close to the flavor this vanilla has . It 's the closest to using a vanilla bean that I can find .
5 #### Great Peppercorn for my mill . Enjoying the peppers :)
5 #### YUMMY ! We love this seasoning , I purchased this with subscribe and save and plan on added others to my July order ! ! Not limited to just pizza . Great on veggies , and roasted potatoes . Great for scrabbled eggs ( my 17 month old loves it in eggs , I sprinkle it in my palm and he takes it and puts it on his eggs . ) I also used this on Chicken the other night . We make our own pizza dough and cook it in cast iron and this is that little missing something ... now our pizzas are complete ! I had never used or heard of this brand until this order but I am so pleased with the quality of this that I ca n't wait to get my others ! ! ! !
4 #### Too much fennel for my taste . The overall flavor is very good and gives a vibrant complexity to your pizza , but the only downside in my opinion is there is just too much fennel . I would up the oregano content a little bit too but other than that , its a good spice blend and I would buy this again . It definitely takes the guess work out of seasoning pizza and makes for an above average flavor profile .
5 #### I will rebuy this over and over . It makes a frozen pizza taste like a pizzeria
5 #### We are about to buy another bottle . I am late reviewing this one due to being a crazy busy mom . We love this stuff . We make homemade pizza all the time and we sprinkle this right onto the crust batter . Oh my goodness does this impart bold flavor . We love our pizza and this is part of why . Will be buying this again , and I will recommend .
5 #### Twinings Tea never disappoints me . Classic English Breakfast Tea .
5 #### my go to tea . i drink this every day and prefer it to English Breakfast or Awake . Better taste IMHO .
5 #### I purchases this to use in a recipe for some Protein Bites - the flavor is absolutely perfect . I am hoping they have a Caramel Extract as that is my next one to try for this recipe .
4 #### We have put this on pizza and numerous other Italian and American dishes and we all like the taste and freshness .
4 #### Very good flavor but I do n't like to buy anything that is n't organic . Hope they come out with one in the future !
5 #### Most other brands of Lemon - pepper have salt added . I have over - salted some foods when using them . With this Salt - free brand , I have not had that problem . Besides being salt - free , the lemon flavor is present and just what you would expect from a quality Lemon - pepper spice .
3 #### For a tea called Pure Peppermint , I would have expected a stronger , more distinctly peppermint taste . This tea tastes more like an herbal medley of mint and chamomile . It 's pleasant enough , but I much prefer Stash Peppermint tea . I love me some Stash !
5 #### The Twinings orange pekoe makes perfect iced tea , perfect for these hot summer months . Six bags of Twinings plus two bags of either peppermint ( Twinings ) or lemon makes two quarts of delicious iced tea .
5 #### have a child that has tea with me and this is her favorite by far
5 #### Best flavored breakfast blend out there . The fact that its organic and fair trade certified only add to its appeal .
5 #### Tastes great and its a nice addition to any Italian food , not just pizza .
5 #### My kids literally believe this turns everything they eat into pizza . I 've taken the liberty of truly abusing this idea and feeding them everything from eggplant to brussel sprouts . A little bit of tomato sauce and a sprinkle of this , and it 's suddenly not that horrible healthy food mom makes them eat , it 's PIZZA . I only with my husband were this gullible .
5 #### I grew up thinking I did n't like pepper . After using this , it was a lie . Fresh ground pepper makes my meals better . I grind some and put in a pinch pot for cooking and have a pepper mill on the table . I recommend this to everyone !
5 #### It 's great to find organic hazelnut extract . I put it in with my organic coffee grounds when I make coffee and I have hazelnut flavored coffee ! ! :-D
5 #### It 's a perfect addition to my homemade ice cream .
4 #### This is great .. I just wish they did n't add sugar to it .
5 #### My wife loves the Irish Breakfast while I prefer the English Breakfast . But they both have an excellent flavor ( sorry I mean " flavour " ) and a bargain price for the quality .
5 #### It 's Twinnings tea . If you 're making the decision to buy it off of amazon reviews I 'm curious how you even got here .
5 #### I 've made lots of homemade pizzas for many years but never quite achieved " professional " results until I started using this seasoning . It was the missing link !
5 #### Price fluctuates greatly , so I buy in bulk . I always want it on hand . I love it on pizza and all Italian fare . I do n't recommend the subscription because they triple the price off and on for some reason . I use one of these small bottles in about 2 months . What sets this apart from other inexpensive Italian / pizza spices is the relatively large amount of fennel . It is a grown up flavor . You either love it or you do n't . That being said , a little goes a fairly long way . I have been using this for probably 8 years and although I try other spice mixes for pizza , this is the one I always come back to . Unlike mixes with salt , you ca n't ruin your food with this .
4 #### I bought this for a Cambodian recipe which I ended up not liking . The Coconut Extract is a quality product .
5 #### I love that this is organic . It goes great in my smoothies or homemade peppermint patties or ice cream . Mmmm . I 've tried a lot of extracts . This is tied with frontier in my opinion .
5 #### Added to homemade almond milk for something a little different and it 's really good .
5 #### Good lemon pepper . I was disappointed when all the seasoned pepper at my grocery had salt as the main ingredient . I use lemon pepper to cut down on salt . I will be buying this now .
5 #### This is a good salt free lemon pepper herb mixture with an excellent lemon pepper flavor .. I like all of the Frontier brand salt free herb mixes . More convenient than mixing the mixtures yourself . It stores well & does not seem to clump like other brands over time .
5 #### Our fave Lemon Pepper . all the others I 've found have additives I do n't want . Happy to get this one on Amazon . We especially love it to season chicken breasts for grilling .
5 #### I always buy organic when I can find it in all things , but if I ca n't I then purchase natural and hope for the best . This seasoning smells and tastes as it should & arrived promptly without any issues . ca n't go wrong here . I have no problem buying it from now on and do n't hesitate to recommend it to others .
5 #### The flavors we all miss from pizza shops today . This blend is fresh tasting and is superb ! My local grocery stopped carrying it , I was so happy to find it here . I am addicted , use it as a dry rub when grilling meats and veggies , soups , roasts , garlic bread etc .
4 #### The Mix is exactly Right in one container . Use in INSTANT LUNCHES that contain TOMATO . Make HEALTHY homemade DIP or sauce .
5 #### This is a terrific blend of flavors , with a bit of red chili flake for zing . I have found that I use it in everything from soup to sauce to salsa .... and of course , pizza always gets a shake or two . I even went on Subscribe and Save since I seem to go through the jars pretty quickly .
5 #### As another reviewer mentions , this is the flavor missing from today 's pizza joints . It 's like a step back in time , three or four decades , when huge shakers of oregano , crushed red pepper , and grated cheese were on every table ( without customers having to ask for some ) . Using this blend alongside " Go Veggie " Parmesan flavored sprinkle is fabulous . We are dairy free , cook 98 % of meals at home , and do n't have a salt shaker in the house ( do n't care for the stuff ) . We LOVE and use plenty of spices , and have been sure to keep this blend on hand ever since we first tried it two years ago . Goes on our marinara sauce , soups , and tomato - based vegetable stew . Also good when reheating leftovers ; it gives a slight change to the flavor when heated into the food instead of just sprinkling on top .
5 #### We love this tea ( both hot and iced ) . It is the best white tea I 've found on the market . Good price , packaged well , and delivered on - time .
5 #### This is my preferred tea so having a big box like this is a good thing . Can not beat the price at half the cost I pay for the same ammount of bags from my grocery .
1 #### Definitely not the best Chai tea I 've had ... actually quite bad . The spices are pretty imbalanced . Twinings is still my favorite tea company and they have done great , just not with this one .
4 #### Great tea but the packages are impossible to read the top off so I have to cut them .
5 #### I use this in combination with white vinegar as cheap & healthy fabric softener when I do laundry . Smells good and lifts my spirits !
5 #### This is an excellent ; product . If you are looking for a vanilla product without all of the unnecessary and unhealthy additives this is the one to purchase . I especially like that it is packaged in glass .
5 #### I was very impressed with this tea . I found it in a Twinnings Variety pack . I could n't pronounce it and was surprised to find out , it is one of the oldest teas ever invented . It 's cured by smoking it . I bought 6 boxes after trying it . It 's delicious .
5 #### Really enjoying these , but I love Twinings teas . Taste is good and so far quality is good . I will buy again .
5 #### Bought it a few times now ! ! Comes greatly packaged and good flavor !
1 #### This is basically a flavorless sweetener in my opinion , and a complete waste of money . I was looking for something to give a coconut flavor to my smoothies without having to use high fat coconut , but this is not the solution .
5 #### Some of the best smelling pepper I ever bought . I am good for a whole year with this size bag .
5 #### Purchased this for my pepper grinder . Taste like pepper so 5 stars there .
5 #### I love this pepper , it 's so fresh and flavorful . That spice is perfect !
5 #### The best black pepper you can get . Best if you like course ground for steaks . Fresh and zippy flavor , like an expensive restaurant .
5 #### The very best almond extract I have ever used . It tasted great in many things . Try some in your breakfast cereal like oatmeal .
5 #### I could n't find pure extract in stores & ca n't wait to use it in my home made coconut ice cream recipe .
3 #### I thought this had a good taste to add to my chocolate diet shake ( Nutella shake ) but it was a bit expensive - friend bought me a cheaper shilling brand hazelnut extract from so - cal - it was much cheaper , just as good
3 #### I was hopiing for more of an essence of Fra Angelico in this hazelnut extract . Hazelnut is a subtle flavor , but this one is just a little too subtle for the protein shakes I wanted to flavor up with something different . Flavor may be released in cooking , but used at room temperature , it was a bit of a disappointment ,
1 #### I purchased 2 of these with the faith that the product was more healthy ( without imitation flavor & additives ) and that I would be getting something I could use in thai dishes and beverages , but there is simply ZERO coconut flavoring to this ! If there is coconut flavoring in this , it is imperceptible . I put a few drops of the extract in a mere teaspoon of cold unflavored ice tea , as well as in a teaspoon of my thai curry , and the extract provides ZILCH contribution of coconut flavoring . All I can say about it is ; it is good for a couple shots of alcohol ! When I tried to go through the normal process of returning it on Amazon , it was apparent that because Nutricity sells it ( 3rd party ) I could not go through Amazon to do the return , but now at the mercy of Nutricity to take them back . Very disappointed in this product . Follow up note ; Nutricity , the 3rd party seller here , REFUSED to allow a return . Shame on Nutricity . Beware of companies that do n't stand behind the products they sell because you will be S.O.L. and they only care about their monetary gain .
3 #### I love hazelnut flavored coffee but I have to avoid them since they are almost hundred percent artificially flavored . So I would either have to sacrifice taste for health , or find a natural DIY solution for this problem . Despite the mixed reviews for this product , I gave it a chance and ordered . I tried it in different doses starting from low to high gradually and either I sensed no change in the taste ( in lower doses ) or a syrup like awful taste ( at the higher doses . ) After all these experiments , and wasted cups of coffee , I gave up and now it is sting in my cupboard until we find someone that would like the taste and would be willing to take it . Why I did not give one star then , my wife thinks it is tolerable , so she has not , at least , ended up dunking the coffee into the drain .
5 #### Very tasty and pleasant tea that I 've not seen in stores before . The flavors were exactly as described on the box ( apple , chamomile , cinnamon , cardamom , and clove ) . Also not necessary to only drink in the winter !
5 #### This is my go - to herbal tea . It tastes much like Celestial Seasonings Sleepytime tea except this is organic . This is the only organic tea I have found that is a combination of mint and chamomile .
4 #### Too lemony , while still quite good I 'd prefer to taste the ginger more . To be fair I probably should have stuck with plain ginger . Still this is enjoyable tea , I just wish the lemon flavor accentuated the ginger rather than overwhelmed it .
5 #### Excellent value for the size . Peppercorns seems to be a great quality at a good price . Love the resealable bag
5 #### Great flavor , totally different from the junk available at the local market .
5 #### Nice sized bottle , well packed ; ca n't wait to use it . It might be awhile but I 'll write back when I do . Comes in your mailbox ; so I was happy I did n't have to go to the post office ; sometimes I get the package there because the apartment manager does n't accept them ; other times like tomorrow I plan to be home for deliveries and sometimes they leave the box outside my apartment door ( security building ) .
5 #### This peppermint extract is extremely potent . Just a little bit will go a very long way . It is exactly what I needed for peppermint chocolate pudding and peppermint hot chocolates . Soon I will start branching out into other peppermint recipes I 'm sure . Excellent product .
5 #### I used the Flavorganics Peppermint Extract during the Holidays to make delicious chocolate peppermint cupcakes and roll cakes ! It tastes delicious ( super minty - a little goes a long way ! ) with NO harsh after taste ! It is probably the best tasting peppermint extract on the market . I just wish that they sold single packs as I am not sure how I will ever go through 3 bottles of it especially since I mainly use it during Christmas . But I wanted to buy the " best - tasting " peppermint extract and it exceeded my expectations .
5 #### I am happy with this product . It smells really good ... strong vanilla . It 's expensive but so far I am happy with the baking I have done with it .
5 #### I really ca n't understand the extensive multifaceted reviews about the nuances of peppercorns . These peppercorns look , smell and taste like peppercorns should . They are the right size for any pepper grinder . There is not much more to say ! I hope that this review is helpful !
5 #### This is my go - to black pepper , now . I always keep a bag handy in the pantry use it to fill my pepper mills and even just for general cooking . It 's fabulous stuff and at a nice price .
5 #### Much better than the pre - ground black pepper from the supermarket . Has nice aroma and kick . Careful opening the bag ! You 'll be finding peppercorns for weeks .
3 #### Mistakenly gave 1 star . It is a good product with enough flavor and aroma . It could be better though , that is why 3/5 .
5 #### Very good price . I use a lot of Irish breakfast tea and like buying in bulk . I think the Irish breakfast type of tea makes me feel better .
5 #### Love this brand of tea . Great price so I bought two
5 #### I buy this in bulk for my office , lasts a long time , popular flavor , great price to value ratio , and arrived quickly .
5 #### as expected , good and fresh . we go through a lot of these at our house . Will be buying again .
5 #### It is great in baked custard , hot cocoa , and chocolate candies . It does n't lose strength when baked . I have even used it in brownies .
5 #### Flavorganics Organic Peppermint extract is an excellent product & excellent buy . I have used it when making my chocolate mint chocolate chip cookies & peppermint patties . The flavor is fresh & crisp without being overpowering . This is not a one time purchase for me . I really like the product .
2 #### I really wish that the ingredients had been posted . Here they are for the rest of you : Water , Organic Alcohol , Organic Agave Syrup , Organic Coconut Milk . This very , very faintly smells of coconut , and kind of , almost , tastes like it . Not sure why an extract , particularly one as sweet as coconut , needs a sugar in it ? As heat typically decreases the intensity of flavor(s ) , I ca n't imagine this " Extract " imparting much coconut flavor into baked goods . I will try it in ice cream and frosting and update this review at that time . I am thinking that , in order to get a super - duper coconutty flavor , I am going to have to just take the time and reduce some pure coconut milk . Or , maybe I 'll try juicing a fresh coconut . Has anyone else tried this before ? Results ? I am open to suggestions .
5 #### What a fragrant , pungent pepper . An absolute delight to grind freshly on your food . The aroma of the pepper reaches you instantly and it is a delight . I grind it a bit rough just to have the texture and taste I love .
4 #### Delicious - even though it is decaf it still kept me awake for 2 hours last night so will try drinking it earlier in the day !
5 #### This tea is delicious . I have never been a tea drinker in the past . Now I have tea in the evening to relax myself .
3 #### Disappointed that they are not individually wrapped . Like to put some in my purse .
5 #### The is just about the best tea I 've ever purchased . It requires no sugar ( for my taste ) and is so tasty . Nice tea for a cold evening in front of the TV or fireplace .
5 #### mountain of pepper at a solid price per oz . very tasty and keeps well .
5 #### My local store has been completely OUT of black pepper in bulk for a while now . This is a very inexpensive , quality pepper ! It has a strong , wonderfully sharp and pungent scent . I use it daily as a small part of making chai . Pepper helps assimilate and digest anything .
5 #### One of our 3 fave teas , a classic that never disappoints . Very nice flavor blend , always consistent .
3 #### Be aware that these peppercorns are surprisingly hot - much hotter than other brands I 've used .
5 #### I purchased this&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Twinings - Tea - Green - Tea - Pomegranate - Raspberry - and - Strawberry-20 - Count - Pack - of-6 / dp / B00IDXQW5I / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Twinings Tea , Green Tea , Pomegranate / Raspberry and Strawberry , 20 Count ( Pack of 6)</a>&nbsp;variety of Twinings tea for one of my daughters , who prefers green tea over black tea . She raved so much over this flavor combination , I had to try it for myself , and it is a lovely tea that is enjoyable hot or cold , with creamer or not ( I love most teas with a bit of creamer ) . Hot and without creamer , it is clean and refreshing ; with creamer , it is subtle and comforting . I do n't prefer raspberries in general , but this does n't have an overwhelming raspberry flavor at all . In fact , the fruit flavors are more in the aroma than in the actual taste in my opinion , which is one of the reasons I enjoy it . The fruit flavors are very subtle , perhaps the strawberry being the most pronounced of the three fruits . Again , the very light fruit flavors are very much in the background , with the fruitiness more in the aroma , which makes this a nice " quiet " kind of tea that my daughter and I quite enjoy . Thanks for reading !
5 #### Delicious Tea I Love Year - Round ! ! ! Started drinking this once Christmas and now I 'm addicted - not as spicy / orangey as Constant Comment .
5 #### Excellent pepper . Like what 's available in Europe where we usually buy our everyday pepper . No matter how much pepper we 've purchased in the USA , frequently at absurd prices from " gourmet grocers " it 's been so mild / old it was unusable .
5 #### A " must " in our kitchen pantry as THE tea for everyone : wonderful quality , taste , etc .
5 #### I drink a cup every morning . Calms me down and settles my stomach .
5 #### I love mint tea and this is my all - time favorite . I drink it as both hot tea and iced tea and it has such a great flavor . I get it through my subscribe - and - save order every month and it 's cheaper than at the store and I never have to worry about running out . Love it !
5 #### Nice flavor and very peppery ! ( Believe it or not , some pepper smells are just not that potent to my nose .... this is . )
4 #### I like this for egg salad and fish dishes . Tasty product- I 'm pleased with the brand .
5 #### highly recommended , I like the rich flavor the dried leaves imparts yummy
5 #### One sniff beneath the seal will shout " FRESH ! " to the nose . This is n't supermarket jar , grade Tarragon it still has tons of flavor and aroma . When I need spices I will seek this brand .
4 #### Good price for this product . Will know more about how I like it when I use it and see how it seasons food .
4 #### The tarragon odor is not potent . The product is good .
5 #### I have always considered Frontier spices and blends of great quality . But , to actually smell the fresh onion scent when the bag of onion flakes is opened is still a nice surprise compared to most store bought onion flakes . I love these , and use them every day .
5 #### For the first time in my life I started buying stuff that was good for me . I m not sure what s the difference between good pepper and bad pepper , but this stuff falls into the " good " category to be sure . I got some Himalayan salt and one of those fancy shakers with windows in it . This stuff definately tastes better , so I 'll keep buying this if available .
4 #### My favorite black " quickie " tea . It 's easy to brew , and the taste is something I can always count on .
5 #### Love love love love love my English Breakfast Tea * * * * *
4 #### The Twinings English Breakfast Tea is a good dark and full bodied black tea . The teas are all individually packed so you can take a few packs with you anywhere , and the everything is packed in a larger box for easy storage . The tea itself brews very quickly and I 'm able to get a good two to three cups of tea per steep . The third cup is definitely weaker than the first two , but still quite good . While I enjoy this tea , this English Breakfast is a bit more astringent than other teas I 've tried . This is definitely a tea I have to add a small spoon of honey and maybe a bit of milk in to soften the flavor . Overall , I do enjoy this tea , and it 's a nice change from the more mellow Earl Greys and Green Teas that I drink regularly . If you 're looking for a very dark and strong flavored tea , this is a good one to consider .
5 #### Gave to mother in January . She likes chamomile tea .
5 #### This is a really nice jasmine tea . Not too flowery , but you can still taste the jasmine .
5 #### I love fresh ground pepper and these peppercorns have just the right amount of bite .
5 #### Use the tarragon for pickling baby beets . Seems to serve the purpose . Nice " herby " fragrance .
5 #### Spices that are fresh can mean the difference between blah and gourmet when it comes to preparing meals . Not all bottled spices are the same ... the way a spice is dried , packaged , etc really makes a difference . This Frontier brand of Tarragon is wonderful ! As soon as I removed the seal from the wonderful glass jar I could smell the wonderful aroma of " fresh " tarragon ( in it 's dried state of course ) . I think this is some of the best tarragon I have ever tried and well worth the price .
5 #### Great spices from Frontier , full bodied to add to recipes for great taste .
5 #### Tastes like tarragon , smells like tarragon , yes it is tarragon . Not sure how to review this ? Great fresh taste , not old or faded at all . If you like tarragon , and really who does n't , then I highly recommend this tarragon .
5 #### wonderful addition to chicken dishes , seafood and even scrambled eggs . Fresh and flavorful . and glass jar with screw on lid will help keep it that way .
5 #### My preferred brand in seasonings , essential oils , etc . I know Frontier brands are always 100 % delightful , and authentic . You can trust Frontier .
4 #### This is just a needed spice for various recipes . Not something I notice that much but probably would if I did n't add it - but would buy again .
5 #### Wonderful tasting tea . Great on cold night . Try their chai as well .
5 #### Fell in love with this while on vacation to Ireland and Scotland ... I think it is the best lemon tea , and I have been a tea drinker for 50+years !
5 #### dried , so it will not spoil in the refrigerator , & needed for my chillie
5 #### Product comes in a bag , just need to store in mason jar to protect flavor . Good quality . Good flavor . Will order again without hesitation .
5 #### These are my favorite dried onions . Some things dried onions are more flavorful in and this is the brand I always use and they have always been really good . I use lots of onions as I cook a lot but some things I just like the flavor better with these .
3 #### Ok , but the leaves are a little too big and woody . Some of them are even a little brown like they are old . I probably would not buy this brand again and would by fresh if I can find it or a better known brand such as Spice Islands or McCormicks . I purchased the Frontier brand because the other two brands I just mentioned were either not available or too expensive . Also , I have purchased Frontier products before and they we 're fine , but the Tarragon is just too woody and not so fresh .
5 #### I use tarragon when cooking eggs and this brand is very good .
5 #### I 'm a huge black pepper fan . This stuff is great . Very spicy and fragrant .
5 #### I buy a bag at least once a year . We use lots of black pepper and I fresh grind it using a mini coffee grinder regularly . Taste great and great price in bulk .
5 #### While in England , on my first trip , I enjoyed the English tea . I had tea at Harrods with all the trimmings scones , cakes , clotted cream , and , of course English tea . When I returned home , I wanted a good cup of English tea , but I could not find a tea that replicated my English experience . It was not until 15 years ago that I found Twinings Irish Breakfast tea , a black tea that brought back the taste of tea I remembered . To make good tea , use a good tea pot , place one teabag per cup into the pot . Heat water to boiling , pour into tea pot , and let it steep for 5 minutes . Pour into a mug or teacup of your choice . They say that good tea should be drunk straight , but I like a little cream in my tea , to each his own . I like a good mug of tea in the afternoon with a biscuit or digestive or cookie . Enjoyable ! Recommended . prisrob 05 - 12 - 16
5 #### I have gotten on a chai tea kick lately and this one seemed really interesting . I like any kind of kitchen spices so the pumpkin spice was really good .
5 #### I love this tea ! Got it at a steal as an add on item and will be back for more . Tastes great hot or cold . Twinings teas are awesome !
5 #### What you see in this picture is exactly what you get , this will last some time .
5 #### Was exactly what I was looking for and tastes just as great . Came on time and packaged just fine . Nothing crushed nor was it broken open
5 #### This is one of my favorite jasmine teas ! The aroma is mild and soothing . Also , I do not notice the bitter taste that comes with some green teas .
5 #### This is great tea . The price of Twinings has been going up a lot , this is about 3 times the cost of Lipton or Red Rose . I still like it and purchase from time to time
5 #### Can not say anything bad about this tea . I love peppermint in any form . And this tea did not disappoint me . Loved it .
5 #### Clean flavorful taste that gets compliments each time it is served .
5 #### I 'm a hot tea addict . Love this brand and flavor .
5 #### Love Twinnings Decafe Black English Breakfast Tea . Could n't be better !
5 #### If you want Earl Grey tea , you ca n't beat Twinings for quality and consistency . Must get through a thousand tea bags a year .
5 #### This delicious tea was n't available at my local Publix anymore so I had to order it from Amazon . It 's one of the only fruit teas I find has an abundance of flavor and does n't just smell good ! Twinings really do make the very best teas :)
5 #### A bit less potent then the caffein enhanced tea , I have to use two tea bags to get the same flavor but quite frankly I 'm perfectly okay with that as I 'm pregnant and ca n't have high doses of caffein , this stuff gives me my tea kick without putting my baby at risk . ( And yes I understand it still has caffein but it is within the acceptable limits )
5 #### My wife likes Chai tea , and she likes how Twinings puts each bag in an individual packet . This has good flavor and brews quickly .
5 #### Log it just love it , now this is what fresh pepper should taste like
5 #### These peppercorns are absolutely wonderful ! I have never in my life smelt such fragrant pepper ! I 'm sold ! These have an exotic , gorgeous aroma ! Thank you !
5 #### Has a fantastic smell and tastes good too . Perfect for a snowy day
5 #### Not too overwhelming , just right at a good price
5 #### Nice very dark tea . I drink it with fresh lemon and honey
5 #### Twinings Earl Grey is my favorite . This is a much better deal than in the store .
4 #### Pretty good but preferred the Tazo but it 's a personal preference
5 #### White tea is good for you and you ca n't beat this price .
5 #### This is my favorite herbal tea . Twinnings does n't disappoint .
5 #### I was so happy to find this flavor love it
3 #### I will buy at my tops store as the price is about the same ..
5 #### My grinder was lonely . Now it has alot to keep it company . Very impressed with the quality .
5 #### Love this stuff . tastes a little earthy , but I brew and drink it all the time , both hot and cold . Good for you !
5 #### Hard to find in my area . I fell in love with Blackcurrant while stationed in Scotland . This tea has just the right mix of black tea and blackcurrant . It 's wonderful with just a bit of raw sugar . Great price as well .
5 #### My favorite spice it goes on everything and Indian peppercorns other way to go These are organic and whole no broken pieces Or fragments Just open the bag and you get lost in the smell Yummmm
5 #### My husband loves these peppercorns and goes through so much freshly ground pepper .
5 #### This is my new favorite seasoning . I put it on everything including eggs , meats and salads .
5 #### I love the seasoning , price was a bit high .
5 #### The spice is very tasty , I really like it .
5 #### Quick delivery of long used product . Will order again .
5 #### black tea with very subtle hints of orange , clove and spice . it 's a much much much milder lightened up version of their chai . I add a tad of honey and some vanilla soy milk to make it more a treat . the tea is quite delicious on it 's own , but the addition of sweetener definitely brings out the flavor . i only wished i purchased more when i saw it .
5 #### This is a really , really good tasting no boil tea . It has all the snap of a hot cup of English Breakfast with the benefit of being iced tea . Have bought before , will buy again .
5 #### I purchase this item every couple of months . It is the best tea ever
5 #### I love this tea ! Delicious I highly recommend it !
5 #### This cream of tartar does everything it is supposed to and arrived very fresh . We use it in baking and also for DIY kids crafts , and it is very effective . Frontier is one of my favorite brands . I buy their bulk cinnamon , cocoa , and other herbs and spices . I have always been pleased with the quality I have received from them . The packaging is always very solid , and the product arrives very fresh and in perfect condition .
4 #### I bake A LOT . Snickerdoodles , which require cream of tartar , ( a.k.a . Angel Cream ) are a friends - and - family favorite . I found Frontier Bulk Cream of Tartar to be the best value for the money , and just as good tasting as the store brands . The reason it got 4 , not 5 , stars is the foil bag : It should be rezipperable . So , I rolled up the top of the cream of tartar bag , & put it in my own zip - lock baggie . Voile ! Problem overcome .
5 #### The product was delivered quickly . The price was very reasonable . I would definitely purchase this item again .
5 #### We use only Spice Hunter when cooking / grilling . They are natural , no salt , and very nicely blended . Ingredients in each bottle all go well together . I say this because sometimes you find that they put cinnamon or something gross like that in soup seasonings and such . This is a great product . We buy them by the box .... We use the Fajita Seasoning , Mexican Seasoning , and the Steak and Chop Grill and Broil . We always several on hand .
5 #### I am really enjoying the combination of spices . We use it on different asian dishes and have not found one we did n't like .
5 #### Salt free , of course . Gives any dish a nice underlying heat . Great on rice and pasta as well . A dash in eggs gives variety .
5 #### My local store quite handling Spice Hunter Seasonings , so finding on Amazon was great . It is the original Szechwan Blend that hd been looking for ... so glad I found it again .
5 #### Nice and strong smell when cracked or ground fine . The best black pepper we have used .
5 #### Twinings makes the best tea , and their Earl Grey is no exception . The bergamot is n't overpowering , and the tea itself is excellent .
5 #### My favorite of all the Rooibos . The taste is clean and natural with no bite or lingering aftertaste .
5 #### Great tea for a great price . I bought this tea for my wife . Twinings is a good brand . She 's a happy camper .
3 #### I use Cream of Tartar for the potassium . I mix it in OJ with a pinch of CoT and a pinch of sea salt . I feel better taking this cocktail than when I do n't take it . My problem is n't with the product , it 's with the shipping . It 's taking forever to be delivered . Two weeks is too long in my view . I was running out of the little spice jar I have and order this bulk type right away to avoid having to purchase another small jar . It did n't work out so well . Yes , I guess I 'm wanting instant gratification but when I order something from Amazon , I do expect and I do usually get quick delivery of my goods . This package of Cream of Tartar will most likely last a long time so I probably wo n't need to order it again but if I did , I would order from another vendor .
5 #### It 's great for polishing silver and for making play dough !
5 #### Great value , great scent , totally worth it . Try adding a dozen uncracked peppercorns into a soup or stew and see the flavor develop ! Great !
5 #### I like that this is an herbal and has nothing else added besides peppermint . It has a really nice peppermint flavor . It 's delicious iced . :)
5 #### I love Earl Grey tea and I love Twinings teas . There 's really nothing more to say !
5 #### This is my favorite herbal tea and I drink it almost everyday . Perfect amount of spice to the tea ratio
5 #### If I had but one tea to sip the rest of my days , let it be Twinings peppermint . Brewed or iced , it is always refreshing and delicious .
5 #### I was n't sure if I could really tell the difference between this and just any regular black pepper but I was so wrong ! It 's delicious and really flavorful and does sort of have very subtle cherry notes . I 'll definitely buy again .
5 #### Great product from a trusted source . Purchased to make homemade baking powder .
5 #### I used it in the bath bomb ( Chlorine neutralizer ) and it worked well .
4 #### I buy this so that I can make baking powder . I love buying frontier products on here because they come quickly and are great quality . The product is fresh and works the way I need it to .
5 #### I 'm very happy with this product . If you are going to use a lot of cream of tartar , the savings by getting this bag vs small jars is well worth it .
5 #### This is a great deal through Amazon . I like the varieties offered in this pack .
5 #### My wife loves tea , and Twinings is her favorite brand . She stors her tea in one of those glass topped boxes with the little compartments , so she wants her tea bags individually wrapped . This is a good product and well packaged to stay fresh .
5 #### Delicious ! ! ! It 's just pure peppermint . I enjoy a cup every night . I 've bought boxes for friends . Hint : chocolate cookies go well with this tea ! !
5 #### If you 're looking for a good , quality tea ... you 're not looking at Twinings tea bags . That 's a different market , and these will offer you a pale facsimile of the " real thing " . That being said : If you 're looking for a cheap cup of tea that you can drink daily without breaking the bank , this fits the bill perfectly . The quality is more than acceptable , the price is right , and the quantity ensures that you 'll almost always have some on hand for when company visits .
5 #### What to say about this ? If you like camomile , this is very good .
5 #### Use it as I need it to make Golden Paste and for seasoning , I use my coffee grinder . It is not as finely ground as what you would buy in the store already done and I prefer it this way . Strong excellent pepper flavor .
1 #### These were way too spicy for us . Left a burning taste . Used in a pepper grinder . Amazon is being kind enough to refund ud after we return product . Was looking forward to these .
5 #### The best tasting peppercorns there are . The colored ones look nice , but Tellicherry have the boldest , freshest taste . A little bit goes a long way .
5 #### Used for Golden Paste making . Fresh STRONG flavor that does alot to mitigate the flavor of the turmeric .
4 #### Really enjoy the flavor burst this pepper adds to my food , big difference from the stuff you pick up at the grocer .
5 #### I like all these teas , but probably the raspberry the least . My favorite it the Nightly Calm . I purchased it because I wanted to try the Orange & Cinnamon before committing to a larger box .
3 #### This tea is ok if you 've never had Traditional Medicinals . Once you try that brand , other herbal teas are blah .
5 #### I love chai tea and this is another great chai by twinings , I have always liked all twinings teas and this is a great chai , not too spicy and not understated cinnamon . add a dash of honey and splash of 1/2 and 1/2 for a wonderful hot sip of chai .
5 #### Everybody has their own taste and to me this is the perfect tea . And by George , my two adult daughters agree with me so I am not alone .
5 #### is what it is and done was it does
5 #### I love this spice ! I had no idea they made a garlic pepper spice until my neighbor told me about it . We put it almost everything ! !
5 #### I originally ordered this because it had a great coupon which , along with the 15 % subscribe and save status , left it at 50 % off . Having received and used it now , I would have been willing to pay full price . Every Spice Hunter I ordered came promptly and was in perfect condition . Most important , though , is the fact that every spice I ordered was of a wonderful quality . This is now my go - to brand for spices . I love to experiment with new recipe designs and these are such a huge help !
5 #### I was a little hesitant to try spices that do not include salt . Everything I 've tried so far left something to be desired . I bought five Spice Hunter flavors and every one of them are fantastic ! I was prepared to add salt , but it was not needed at all . I 'm not on a salt restricted diet but want to reduce my intake to a moderate level . This is making it a lot easier than I expected .
5 #### This is heave on the pepper but use a little and it does add really nice flavor without using salt .
5 #### A great way to add lots of flavor without the salt ! I use it to season meats , vegetables and even salad .
5 #### Tellicherry peppercorns or not , this is a great buy . Peppercorns are plump and full , great value for the price paid vs. the store bought stuff sold in plastic cylinder container .
5 #### This is my most favorite tea . It tastes delicious . The Twinings Ceylon Orange Pekoe tea is a black tea and it has a lovely fragrance with a taste that is not overpowering . It is a great go to tea - I drink it in the mornings sometimes in place of my coffee , and throughout the day when I need a little pick me up also .
5 #### great deal on tea , Twinings EG may require an extra bag if you 're used to making tea from lose leaf or from a higher end tea co.
5 #### This is currently my favorite tea available . Constant Comment by Bigalow was my favorite , but they have ruined the flavor by changing the spices and tea . Twinning so has kept their flavor the same as it always was . And there is a reason the blend is over 100 years old . Keep it up . Love this rich , not overwhelmingly Bergamot , a delicate yet flavorful tea .
5 #### Twinings Lemon and Ginger has been my go - to tea for several years - I order it through Subscribe and Save with 15 % off . It has a sweeter Lemon taste when drinking it after 2 - 3 minutes of steeping . The longer it steeps , the lemon becomes slightly more bitter but then the ginger really begins to come through . I drink it both ways and enjoy it every time .
5 #### Great price . I have a pepper grinder and use these peppers . After owning a pepper grinder I will never go back to buying pre - ground pepper . So much better and fresher this way .
5 #### This pepper has quite a kick to it and I love it . Perfect for grinders .
5 #### I found home recipes for several uses and this product is used in large quantities . So I have plenty
5 #### Purchased this to make homemade playdough and everyone is right . You really do need that bit of cream of tartar . We are making so much I saved money even keeping just half and giving the rest to our playgroup !
4 #### seems to be good quality ! I have n't cooked with it yet but soon . will update when I do :)
5 #### Frontier is a wonderful company . I buy most of my herbs from them . Their prices are good , the herbs always arrived securely packaged and seem fresh ( can a dried herb be ' fresh ' ! ) and the color is good . I will buy again .
4 #### It 's a nice quality . Smells and tastes nice . For " sifted " I expected it to be a bit finer it 's pretty rough . Works nice as a tea . Could probably make it finer in the blender but this is pretty course as is .
3 #### Twinings has changed this tea . Good tea , but taste has changed .
5 #### I bought this tea around Christmas and still drink it ! I love Chai teas !
5 #### This is the best black tea in the world .
5 #### Nice chai tea , but fairly mild in flavor - which I love , but my best friend prefers stronger flavor ( just a heads up if you have that same preference ! )
5 #### Nice pepper , a good buy . I got tired of all those little bottles from the discounters !
5 #### great deal , very nice product , worth twice the price
5 #### This was a gift for a good cook they liked it .
5 #### The aroma from the peppercorns let you know it is a quality peppercorn the moment you smell it . I can not keep them in stock !
5 #### We got this mostly to make out own baking powder ( 1 part baking soda and 2 parts cream of tartar - we use&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Frontier - Baking - Soda / dp / B004T33MW2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Frontier Baking Soda</a > . Worked great every single time , and we are pretty pleased that this is non - irradiated . Great value too .
5 #### Order processed and delivered quickly by this vendor , Frontier Natural Products . Packaged in a very tough plastic pouch . Cream of tartar is my go - to for whipping up good egg whites , and for homemade baking powder for quick breads and cookies to raise , because it works fast and does n't contain aluminum . I also use it to clean burnt steel and enamel pots ( well they are not aluminum because I do n't use aluminum for cooking , so I do n't know if this is appropriate since it is somewhat acidic ) especially roasting pans by soaking overnight in hot water and a tablespoon or so . Makes the burnt stuff come loose so much easier . My mum taught me that , and she learned from her grandmother . It 's a fine white powder made from the salts that form in wine making . Buying the bulk product this way , is more convenlent for me than the tiny baking powder tins . Because it does nt ' contain " double acting " powder with aluminum , batters made with cream of tartar should be baked as soon as mixed , and not left standing . I pour the powder into an old coffee jar to keep it dry until needed .
5 #### This cream of tartar or " potassium bitartrate " by Frontier Natural Products works great in helping stiffen whipped creams and baked goods that call for cream of tartar . I used to use this same branded product in a small glass bottle but was glad to see this in a larger package format , which saves money if you use it often . Frontier sells a variety of kitchen pantry needs and this is one of their excellent products from my experience .
5 #### I have never seen such a wonderful price for this !
4 #### Stronger and more sour than it used to be ? I used to drink this kind of tea all the time at a certain restaurant I liked , and this tea just seems more sour , more fruity , more strong . Usually I like strong fruity flavors , but it 's over the top even for me , making it hard to taste the black tea in it . I think a blackcurrant lover will really love this tea , though , especially if they have a taste for sour flavors . I 'm happy to have tried it , but probably wo n't refill after finishing this box .
5 #### I love tea but normally loose leaf . This is the first teabag I actually like .
5 #### The only tea my husband drinks and you can get it here in bulk at a reasonable price .
5 #### Work perfectly in my pepper shaker and make black pepper consistently fresh . I 've been purchasing these for years and have no plans on switching brands anytime soon .
3 #### Bag was slit open and there were loose peppercorns in the shipping box .
5 #### Very nice quality ! Sure is amazing how much marjoram leaf is in a pound ! ! ! It will last me forever & should stay good a long time in the foil packaging .
4 #### I just purchased this product . It is very good .
5 #### I use this in baking and love getting it online !
5 #### What can I say ... its Cream of Tartar ! Great size great packaging ! I use the large quantity for making bath bombs . So glad this company sells large quantity for making soaps ! They will always have my business !
5 #### I used it on chicken breasts and they came out nice . Good price here as well . I purchased it using the add - on program .
5 #### I Have Always loved The Exotic Taste Of The Caribbean Islands . This salt - Free Combination Is Perfect As A Rub : All The Flavor and none Of The Salt ( You Add Exactly The Amount You Want ) . Try This Rub On Your Next Batch Of Wings .
5 #### Delicious , All Natural , and No Salt and really does taste like the real Jamaican Jerk seasoning . I wish it came in a bigger size .
1 #### This product is n't found on store shelves very often for a reason ; it 's terrible ! Like all their products , it 's salt free and maybe that 's the difference . I consider myself kind of a jerk chicken aficionado and this is not jerk chicken . I also tried Spice Hunter 's Thai seasoning and it too is awful . Stick to the mainstream brands in the supermarkets because they are better than whatever this product claims to be . Sorry Spice Hunter , you 're 0 for 2 in my book . Awful products ...
5 #### Smells spicy and with 1,271 reviews i do n't think you can go wrong . Nothing beats fresh ground pepper .. the preground shakers we used to find everywhere just do not justice to the profile these peppercorns produce . This is a HUGE bag for a great price ( i do n't think you can beat it ) and will last months and months . I am storing the excess in an air proof container to save for later !
5 #### Starts my day off just right .... I combine it with a bag of Twinings Lemon Ginger and it 's delish
5 #### This is the best " TEA " . They changed the inside package but tastes the same . I shopped around but you ca n't beat this price . The best breakfast tea .
5 #### Excellent fresh herb aroma and flavor ! Frontier continues to provide great - quality products ! I now have many different herbs from them , and find all of them to be excellent . I use many different herbs , depending on what I am cooking . For Italian foods , I make up my own " Italian Seasoning " of herbs acquired from Frontier , and I have recieved many compliments on the flavor . I would not hesitate to recommend their products to anybody .
4 #### This is a LOT of marjoram for a non - business consumer , but I was having trouble finding it in the spice sections of any of our local stores , let alone organic . Now I can use it generously and I 'm set for a couple years , I think ( ! ) at a reasonable price .
5 #### I 've bought several herbs from Frontier thus far , and as always , I 'm satisfied with the quality and freshness of the product . And the value is incredible . For the price of about 4 tiny jars ( which may not be organic ) from the supermarket , I get FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCT and it is better quality . Will definitely order again . Tip : I refill my standard - size glass spice jar then seal the remainder of the product in a large vacuum Foodsaver - type bag to preserve better .
5 #### Excellent quality . So much I 'm going to have to share .
5 #### Beautiful , fine and fluffy ! I Love this and use it for teas and as a smoking mixture . Thank you very much !
5 #### Beats buying a tiny bottle for four or five dollars in the store . I seal the bag and freeze it so it will not get stale .
5 #### I am a preschool teacher who makes a lot of play dough in a year . Finding Cream of Tartar in bulk has been fantastic . Ca n't really review it for other purposes but the price is really good , I recommend this product .
5 #### Of the higher quality tartar powders , this one is easily available . It consistently performs as expected ( I use it primarily to make my own baking powder ) .
5 #### I bake a lot and the little jars of this product were very expensive . Now I can bake and not worry about the cost of the cream of tartar . I like saving money .
5 #### It filled a quart jar and it made the most wonderful coconut macaroons ever ! It is a very fine smooth powder .
5 #### I use a lot of Cream of Tartar . I make my own baking powder , which requires only a limited amount , but I use it much more for cleaning certain items . I collect vintage cookware . Often aluminum pots , pans , roasters and etc . , have very dark interiors from cooking certain foods . Filling the vessel with water and adding 3 or 4 Tablespoons of Cream of Tartar and boiling the liquid for 20 - 30 minutes ( occasionally longer ) will bring the aluminum back to the bright , silvery color it was when new .
