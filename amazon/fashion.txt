4 #### I love my Chuck Taylors , but there 's no reason they should cost about 50 bucks a pair ... other than good ' ole supply and demand ! I mean , they 're canvas shoes with rubber bottoms . What sets these apart from cheap - o knock - offs , is the that the rubber does n't so readily peel from off the canvas at the place where they crease when you step . Just like a pair of original 501 jeans , these only look better and better with age !
5 #### These were exactly what I needed . My rifle had the swivel mounts already . They loosen , install and tighten .. They work as advertised .
5 #### Strong band , fits my large wrist . Indigo light really helps at night . I wore this fishing and reached into the water several times and it is water proof .
5 #### This is my third pair of this size and model of Justin boots , always consistent and durable , well - made and comfortable . I expect to get another identical pair when I wear these out in a few years .
4 #### Nice pogo stick , the " training wheel " is very helpful for the youngsters !
5 #### My husband loves this watch , he has several watches but wears this one everyday . Keeps great time and is so easy to read for a person who has eye problems .
5 #### Ordered these for my grandson . Fit well ( he has a wide foot ) , made well and seem comfortable . He loves wearing them .
4 #### The sling shot is awesome . The rubber and leather pouch are very sturdy and the metal beams as well as arm guard are nice . The only complaint I have is the plastic handle is cheaply made . So you have to be careful with it . There is a nice sized compartment in the handle for storing glass beads , marbles , or bullets if you want .
5 #### My wife has a small head and I have a big head . I bought it for her , and it fits her great . But I ended up using it and it fits me too .
4 #### Traded up to these since the new Grid Ignition 2 was a flop and very impressed . Have n't had a chance to run in them yet , but lots of support in the toebox and the big landing pads on the heel . Saucony = forgiven .
4 #### pretty sweet . not for daily consumption but nice to have every couple weeks
5 #### I bought three different knives and ended up liking them all . They all are boot knives , and depending on which pair of boots I wear is to which knife I take . So it could be work ( in an industrial plant environment ) , work at home on farm , hunting and hiking , I have the " go to " knife for which ever application I am doing at the time . Love Smith & Wesson !
5 #### Good holster , my Glock 22 with TLR-1 fits just fine . Still very expensive , I wish it did n't have to be that way .
4 #### Timex is reliable and no one is going to steel it from you ! This is a nice watch for the money .
5 #### Typical Converse . Not great for all day walking or standing , or for rainy days .. but a great choice for leisure days . And always stylish .
4 #### The quality and and price are good . But the size is a little bit large
4 #### I like Carhartt 's . I wear them all the time for work and these stand the test !
4 #### After the exchange , I 'm satisfied . The last pair looked counterfeit-- the logo was off - center , but they look great now .
5 #### I love the size , it looks classy and very light . Just perfect for every day use ! !
5 #### Very nice brass collection . These rods are not aluminum which break easily for me .
5 #### I had a torn elbow tendon repaired a few months ago and this flexbar has helped me regain the strength back in my arm . They had me using it in rehab and once I ran out of sessions , i purchased this for home use .
3 #### Why does n't someone make these big enough to hold a smartphone ! ? At least interior 5 - 1/2 " high , 3 - 1/4 " wide ! WITH a beltloop .
5 #### Very comfortable shoes , can take a while to get acclimated to the heel position being some what lower than other shoes . the wide width is really extra wide . get gripping soles
4 #### Icant imagine the price increase if a parallax adjustment were integrated but it would be a blessing when extending toward the high end magnification .
5 #### This is my third pair since Keens first released . I live in Tucson and wear them almost year round . I got many years from my first pair , possibly 10yrs . My second pair only lasted about 2yrs but that s because my dog thought they tasted good . He and I had a talk about that . I prefer the Newport to the H2 because I like the microfiber footbed and leather upper .
4 #### I love this wallet . I never used this style before . Its compact and organized . Although the inside looks like fake leather . I did expect more from Buxton
1 #### I 'm on my second one , and the ball still wo nt ' stay inflated . The first one we received did n't have a rubber stopper in the inflation hole , so that was defective . The replacement one we received looked O.K. but when inflated you can hear the air coming out of the same inflation area . We double checked the directions to see if there was some secret step we missed but bottom line the ball was defective and wo n't stay inflated . I 'm sending both units back - very frustrating for 8 year old who 's been waiting by the door everyday for her tetherball set to arrive .
4 #### The packaging was not great but now that it 's assembled the kids love it . They were disappointed it only went 5 mph until they realized how fast that really is . It is plenty fast for kids and there have been a few times I had to make them slow down . So far everything about it has been good but they have only had it a couple weeks .
5 #### Used this and a couple of other items and made the ultimate seat , Ice chest . Comfy enough you can sit on it and your rear does n't get fatigued like your sitting on a bucket lid
1 #### This product does not fit a Mossberg 500 - 12 gauge . The rear sight is too small to fit on the rear sight ramp .
5 #### Great watch ! My daughter loves it and it is extremely durable !
4 #### shot a nice whitetail 100 yrds ... muzzleloader with this scope ! ! ! ! it works ! !
5 #### Fantastic ! I purchased a pair of these for my wife and she absolutely loves them . She is a size 9/10 depending on the shoe and she ordered a 10 . The Width was perfect and she has been very happy with the comfort . She has totally switched from her sneakers over to these for her casual shoe . Excellent product ! Well made !
4 #### Bought this helmet at the same time as the Schwinn " Intercept " Adult Micro Bicycle Helmet . The " Thrasher " seems to hold up a lot better . Would recommend this item to others .
5 #### These shorts are great for me . A little bright , but that is exactly what I was looking for . They live up to my expectations , and I will wear them proudly !
3 #### I bought these to use when I tried P90X , and they wore out around day 60 ( I ended up buying the bowflex 5 - 52 adjustable weights to finish ) . I enjoyed them while they lasted , and it should be noted you must have shoes on when using this , otherwise it will pinch / rubber burn your foot ... common sense should have told me that I suppose but I learned the hard way haha .
5 #### A classic shoe ! But because Chucks always come with a minimal insole , they generally fit large . But that means you can add an after market insole if you like and they 'll still fit well .
5 #### I was looking for a roasting pan to fit in the oven in my travel trailer . This set was the perfect size & the other pans have been a great benefit .
4 #### We use this every single day . But that 's more of a praise for ping pong rather than this table . The surface is n't perfectly level either . But , gets the job done for recreational TT .. and it 's smaller than a full size table , so do n't expect any championships on this .
4 #### great price but white only . this is not 1950s south had to spend anothe 4 bucks on blk plastic paint . but still a great value . P . S. thanks Krylon great paint
5 #### Put them on and walked 3 hours with no problem ! Love them ! So light feeling
2 #### Sizing ia WAY off .... too big by a mile ( 3 different pairs .. all too big ... all returned )
5 #### This Converse is very sharp looking . If you are a Converse fan , and want to look cool this is the one to buy . I got this as a gift for my 34 year old brother , and it definitely makes him look cooler . What makes it look even cooler is the black rubber . He had the white rubber before and it got dirty too fast . This one will last him a long time . Happy with the purchase .
1 #### When I got them everything looked fine . Until I put them on to go hiking in them one of the straps broke on them.dont seem like was maid very well or at least this pair i bought was not good at all I 'm very unhappy with this pair . Not the sellers fault at all.always treat me great .
1 #### Very unstable . 3 year old had a very hard time . I would not recommend . Trying a Micro scooter which seems to be a better fit .
5 #### Jeans fit great ! I washed and dried them after trying them on and the fit remained the same . Found them to be exceedingly comfortable . Did note as another responder said they are a medium weight jean so not likely something I would wear if I were I were say , a bull rider . I think they will serve my purposes long and well .
5 #### my wife loved it ! she wears a 7.5 in womens and the 6y in boys fit her just right !
5 #### Just as expected ... perfect accessory for your Dutch Oven ... not absolutely needed to use the oven , but well worth the small price tag ...
4 #### One cube burned for a good 16 mins , but never boiled my water ( about 12 oz ) . Would be a great fire starter . Does indeed smell bad .
5 #### This was a hit as a Christmas gift ! The recipient is very happy with the quality of this item .
5 #### Better than most . My last one moved around my face to much and would get uncomfortable when working more than an hour . This is comfortable and stay up on my face without issues ..
3 #### Cute style , but makes you sweat easily and runs large . You can see my bra through the back .
5 #### I really like these shirts . They are durable enough to handle most anything . The pocket is big enough for my iPhone 6 and a pair of readers without falling out . Now I just need to figure out which colors I like so I can order more .
5 #### Husband loves Carhart shirt . I love my Skechers sandals and plan to order another pair .
5 #### This is a great product . I bought this as a Christmas present and my son uses it all the time .
1 #### Weigh too much for backpacking you need 1.5 for each meal at least . Adds up fast . Get a JetBoil .
3 #### Not sure why , but my mid section of my foot starts to hurt using these shoes for a long day or a tough workout at the gym . I 've owned other nike shoes of this line but that never happened to me .
1 #### Too small so I returned it . Would n't have worked anyway as I needed to add fiberfill breast pads
1 #### The strap does n't stay on tight , so this is going back !
5 #### My daughter wanted these for her birthday and they were perfect . She wears them almost every day .
5 #### These are the most comfortable shoes I 've used for working out . Extremely light weight and flexible . Loved them so much I purchased two more pair in different colors .
3 #### The snap on the coin purse part is n't always secure , and I 've found change ( and my husband 's wedding ring , following a surgery ) in the bottom of my purse . Also , the bills compartment is very deep ; maybe it 's designed for larger bills than ours , but it makes getting them in and out cumbersome . It 's a nice looking piece , though , and I had already been through several worse ones when I got it , so I wo n't be trying again for a while .
5 #### My son loves these shirts . So sturdy and well made .
2 #### The color was nice but the shoe was not comfortable at all . That 's the only reason why I had to return it . It was like walking in card board .
4 #### It is simple to install and keeps the unit from rattling . It is a great lock to secure the rack . excellent price .
5 #### My husband wears only these shirts in the summer . They are roomy , airy , and come in great colors . They wash well , and keep their color . He loves that there are pockets for things like cell phone , glasses , pen , whatever . We could n't be happier with a shirt , which is why I bought him 10 of them when I last ordered . My husband has a broad chest / back and he has lots of freedom of arm movement in this shirt . My husband is a farmer and now owns 10 of these shirts in both the short and long sleeve version . He wo n't wear another shirt when he is working because 1 . The pockets have Velcro closure and that keeps his phone from falling out . 2 . The breath ability of this shirt keeps him cool in the summer months . In the winter he puts a thermal t shirt under the long sleeve shirt and is very comfortable . An all around good shirt . The only thing I am not satisfied with is the condition it comes out of the dryer , needing ironing .
5 #### These are well made , but definetly for kids or pre - teens .
5 #### Have tried a few other , more expensive , helmets and they just do n't fit my head ! This one does ! It may not be fancy but it seems just as good as the higher priced helmets . I do not use the front spoiler on mine . I have two of these and on the older one , the plastic on top separated from the foam requiring me to glue it back . Otherwise , this helmet has been great . The straps are adjustable and durable . Would recommend this to anyone .
4 #### I wear them for Zumba and my heel slips on turns . A little annoying because I have to pay attention but they are so cute and comfy , it balances out .
4 #### I like this rod for the price , I 'm not up on fishing rods but for 30 bucks I could n't pass it up ! There is a 14 ' down the street for 70 ! And amazon gave me free shipping . I did n't find anything wrong with it I would buy it again .
5 #### Little 8 year old loves these . Easy to use and love the dark lenses . Next time I will buy the Aqua Sphere Kayenne for her though because they are so much easier to use . They have a sliding buckle that adjusts the head band and she fits into them .
5 #### They are comfy and wear well . I like the vegan part and am now only interested in vegan wear . A little too orange but fine . They are sneakers !
5 #### but with respect to the product is what I expected , durable and ideal size , excellent packaging and arrived on time ... Everything arrived on time and I loved it , as they were in perfect condition and as I thought , except that brought the clothes smell but otherwise very good office and also prices
3 #### The fit was n't as relaxed as Levi 's 550 , closer to Levis 505 . Seems like they should call these regular fit and call their regular fit , slightly skinny jeans . I do not mean around the waist , rather everywhere else . The waist was true to size , as was the length . They are about average weight ( material thickness ) for jeans in this price class , but thinner than the Levis ( dark ) mentioned above . I do n't see why they are calling them rugged wear . They were fairly inexpensive so I ca n't deduct too much but since there are only a few primary things to choose on these , that they 're supposed to be rugged and relaxed and are n't quite either of those things , minus 2 stars . I would buy them again at the right sale price just to beat around the house in , but would have to randomly happen upon the sale , am not seeking these to buy again .
5 #### Great addition to any fan 's yard ! Show your team pride ! We love this flag . Great construction , very durable and strong vivid colors . Standing up to the Kansas weather so far .
5 #### Great scooter for my daughter ! She loves the green and has been using it daily since getting it just a little over 3 weeks ago ! Highly recommend this item !
5 #### I absolutely love this knife . The yellow color of the scales is bright and unusual for a knife . This is my EDC knife . I feel naked without it .
5 #### They are a classic and they never go out of style . What else can I say ? They 're exactly what I expected .
5 #### Was bought as a Christmas Gift . He enjoys them because of the material your feet can breathe much better .
3 #### These are a bit longer than they should be . I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5 . The width is accurate . The pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it is n't as gray as shown in the picture . It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming . Also two grommets on each shoe is dark . I 'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo , I 'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces ( opposite side of side shown in photo ) . I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe . Kind of odd and not pictured . Overall , they are very comfortable shoes which is why I am keeping them ... even if you can see me coming from a mile away .
5 #### I bought these as a gift for my niece and she loves them . She has a very high arch on her foot so I warned her that Converse will always be flat and have no good arch support . So I expected them to have little to no arch and also expected them to be narrow because that 's another thing that Converse are known for . She wears them about 6 - 8 times a month for her school colors .
5 #### Great for the final wipe down of your revolver , shotgun or pistol .
5 #### The only tape I buy . Been using this tape for years . Just the right amount of non slip ! Fast shipping and reasonable pricing .
5 #### This is my 3rd pair of Merrell Jungle Mocs - I have actually worn out 2 other pairs from almost constant wear . They hold up well , work in all terrains and walking situations , easy on an off . Love them .
4 #### Bought this for my husband - great watch . However , we had to take to a jeweler to remove links . Lightweight - goes with everything .
1 #### Bought this and the barnett Junior 28 inch arrows , after one day all of these broke and all the Barnetts survived . To be fair we were missing the targets and getting them stuck in 3/4 inch OSB and had to wrench them out ... but the points all broke off on the Bear ones .
4 #### Arrived on time . I probably should have gone with a 7.5 instead of an 8 because they do seem a little big , but if I wear thick socks they are fine . Also , they can sometimes make a very annoying squeaky noise when I run on certain surfaces so I 'm trying to get them worn in . Over - all , I am satisfied with my purchase !
4 #### You can never go wrong with a good pair of Chucks . They are inexpensive , nondescript and work with just about any casual outfit . You can throw them in the washer and air dry them when they get dirty . They do n't provide a lot of arch support , but that 's what Dr. Sholls are for .
4 #### Funny how these are making a comeback ... Loved them as a kid and love them now .
4 #### Great shirt for guys that want a pocket like my hubby ! Washes well and , what I liked the best was the ability to remove the tags ... hubby does not like " advertising " and other things on his shirts . Does not fade like others . All good . Do
5 #### They were just want I wanted for my grand baby
5 #### I 've never been one to wear Converses , but I decided to try these out for the first time ... and they 're now my go - to 's . The ordering process was seamless and quick , and the shoes themselves offer sufficient support for those who have feet a little wider at the toes .
3 #### No so universal . I had to drill a new hole into the frame for this kickstand to be installed . The bolt required a 5/8 " drill bit , which is pretty large and may not be in some homes . Once I got it installed , the angle on the kickstand is pretty wide and the bike leans way over to the side . But it does stand up on it 's own , so it technically did the trick . I put this on a bike for a 5 yr old . I would n't use it on a nice bike . The adjustable length is a very nice feature .
4 #### They were a little bigger than expected but I should grow into them . I love how they look though !
2 #### I clearly ordered 5.5 they sent me 3.5 . Its not fun to get.excited then i can not wear them and have to send them back .
5 #### I love having this with me when I am up in my homemade tree stand , keeps my rear end comfy and warm
5 #### LOVED THEM ! . I usually wear 10us , but Chucks are always half size bigger , I got 9.5 and fit as expected ! ! ! .
4 #### Purchased for hunting small varments on my property . Set up a small practice range with hay bales . Trumark works very well , fits hand and arm perfectly . Sturdy . The in handle ammo pouch is very handy . Recommend .
5 #### Bought these for my son when he was learning to use roller blades . They are comfortable and can fit many sizes . I would n't get them for kids under 50lbs because they can only get so small , and i think at 50lbs these would n't sag and you could get them to fit snug enough . These would be too big for my 4yo who is only 35 lbs . My son says they 're comfy and overall we 're very happy with this purchase .
4 #### bought these for ma sister , she still loves and cherish them , nice material built alright thumps up got no more to say
5 #### My daughter still loves Chuck Taylor 's . She had worn out her last black pair so I got her a navy pair for her birthday . Chucks are not fancy but they are ok if you like the nostalgia factor . My dad played high school basketball in those shoes and said they were a great improvement over what they 'd had to play in before . If you like the style , they 're pretty durable ; and although I think the whole line is a little over priced , I have two pairs myself .
5 #### These are always nice for the working man . There are not thin at all . They last a long time to . Great products .
3 #### well .. i guess bali panties are more reasonable in price compare to warner 's . and bali has a okay type of fabric but much thinner than warner 's panty . i 'd go for warner 's next time but bali is okay too .. soft and comfy .
5 #### The Billfish is one of Sperry Top - Sider 's best shoes . I love my shoes a lot . They are very comfortable .
1 #### I was not expecting much for the price but I only needed it for a weekend . I got it blowen up and we left camp for the day , came back and it was totally deflated . I thought maybe I did not put the plug in correct so I blew it up and hoped for the best , in 30 min I was on the ground . I only needed a weekend but I did not get even 1night .
5 #### My husband has been wearing this shoe for years . It is the only boat shoe he likes . He has a large wide foot and it fits fine in the 13 wide .
5 #### My boyfriend kept stealing my manduka mat for push ups ... so I got this for him for his birthday ! He loves it . These mats are heavy duty and give great wrist support for my yoga and his mother traditional work outs !
5 #### Not your classic yoga mat . This thing is really thick and heavy duty . Perfect for your at home workouts
5 #### great price , they fit my son well , he loves the fit.very pleased with the quailty
5 #### Great for sighting in at s distance . I went to the range to sight in at 100 yards . In most targets you have to wait until the range master shuts down the range do you can see where your shot hit . Then you make adjustments , shoot again , and wait . With these you can look through your scope and see where you hit
5 #### This pair fits perfect ..... the first pair was wrong size in the right box ..... definitely order again ! ! ! ! !
2 #### It is good looking and has an easy - to- read dial but it only lasted one year to the week .
4 #### Getting ready for fall and winter . This is what I was looking for my son so it can simply match all his outfits . His father bought him the mustard color , but this is child color safe also warm . Gripping at feet are great this is my sons second pair .
5 #### Great product . Galco makes quality holsters at affordable prices . The inside the trouser holster is quite useful for concealed carry , provides a good level of retention , and protects the firearm from accidental discharge .
4 #### works well , keep my ghillie in it with scent wafers
2 #### Tjis only lasted a couple of weeks before getting flatter than a pancake . Did not hold air long . Cheap .
4 #### The shirts are nice but over priced . The pockets are pathetic and useless . The products that MAGELLIAN makes are a better buy .
5 #### Takes some practice but really fun once you get the hang of it . Make sure you have plenty of open space .
5 #### Looks like they will work . Mine came with the pull RINGS installed
5 #### They 're cute . My daughter ( and ALL her friends ) have these and I have n't heard a complaint . The sizing is true to the ' size chart ' . Measure your kid 's feet and check the chart . The laces are super long .
1 #### I thew this garbage away after spending only 1 night on it . Kept deflating and I had to wake up repeatedly to re - inflate it . Be careful - if you order one you might get a leaker and spend a miserable night on it .
4 #### It has instructions of how to use it . It 's half the size I thought it would be . Not sure what I was referring the size to . I 've never used one before but will give better feedback in a few weeks after I use it .
4 #### These are nice rifle socks and in the 6 pack they end up less than $ 5 bucks each . Hard to beat . They are well made and more robust than I expected , yet nice open weave for good ventilation . We all have rifles that sit for a long time without being used . Clean 'em up well and slide them into one of these , and your valuable firearm will be preserved for the next generation .
5 #### Bought these as my back up shoes but they have turned into my daily ones I go to ! So comfortable and my feet do n't hurt after long hours on my feet . I own a cleaning business so I need my feet not to hurt in the middle of the day .
5 #### Great arch support and cushion both for the heel and ball of the foot . Great aerobic shoe !
5 #### I ve had foot problems for 25 years and having Keen shoes has been my saving grace . Pain does nt go away but my life is more managable since finding this brand of shoes
5 #### What I like about this watch : 1 . The numbers on the dial are easy to read . 2 . Each minute is marked with a dot , so I can see the precise time without having to estimate the distance between the numbers . 3 . I can illuminate the dial when needed . 4 . The leather strap does not make my wrist perspire ( as vinyl does ) . 5 . It is the ideal size for my small wrist on the fourth - hole setting .
4 #### For pancakes , this iron griddle heats slowly and evenly , and it holds the heat better than a teflon griddle but ... you ... must ... season this and instruct well - meaning helpers NOT , repeat , NOT to use any soap of any kind , sponge , steel wool pad , on the griddle . Ever . If you are worried about cleaning it , you can scrub the surface with a hot , clean water , handful of cooking salt and a clean paper towel . After seasoning , pancakes cook evenly and this is wide enough to go over two burners and really get some production going at breakfast . Just remember about the seasoning and the No - Soap .
5 #### Got the wrong size , had a new pair within two days , fit great . Thanks !
5 #### Every one of my long guns has a sling and every sling is attached with Uncle Mike 's QD swivels . I 've used them for years and never had one fail me .
1 #### I have n't been able to wear the watch yet . The watch band is huge , and the instructions for removing links are not clear at all .
5 #### As helped my tennis elbow .. I had been dealing with tennis elbow from weight lifting for a year . Had 4 injections and a bout of physical therapy where they never had me try this .. After much frustration and some youtube videos I decided I would try it . In really a week I felt better and now several weeks later there is no pain ... 4 injections and a few rounds of oral steroids did n't help as much as this , well it did but the pain always came right back ... Not so with this .. plus it was $ 5 cheaper then what I seen in the store ..
5 #### Tried them on in a store before buying online so I knew they 'd fit good . Overall I was looking for a durable cross training shoe that would hold up to my rigorous training and these have been great so far . They are really light and comfortable . Most importantly for me they have grips on the bottoms so my feet do n't slide out from under me while doing planks , push - ups , etc . Highly satisfied with this purchase .
5 #### Great for all my workouts at home . I have owned this for many years and works great . Helps with high impact jumping or whatever exercise you want .
5 #### We purchased this backboard to replace one that shattered after many years of use . The design of this backboard was a little different than the original Lifetime brand product , but I was able to make it work fairly easily . My son was so excited when we got it put together and back up . Thanks , Lifetime for making it possible to retrofit our existing system !
5 #### Great design and easy to use . The quality is wonderful and the company is wonderful as well . Awesome workout with these bands ! They travel wonderfully and working out using this easy clicking /carabiner system makes changing or adding bands to the handles very easy . You can use 1 , or several bands at the same time ! Excellent design and very sturdy ! I called the company to tell them how much I love these bands .
5 #### Perfect mid range . As a climber I wish I had the tougher one though .
1 #### too Large for the Stevens 5100 Shotgun stock by one inch !
5 #### Been wearing them for fifty years . Tried others but always come back to comfort and quality ... Hopefully wear them another 50 and still be able to run in them !
5 #### One for my wife , who has very thick hair and so has trouble finding a helmet that will fit properly . I also have a fairly large head and it fits me as well . I 'm bald though , so no hair to add extra girth ...
5 #### Not to flashy in the bag it comes BUT THE PRODUCT MOUNTS GREAT , LOOKS GREAT , PERFORMS GREAT . I m talking FLUSH meaning like its custom made for your rifle / shotgun/ assault rifle whatever , I got one for all mine . Nice polished finish looks better than some of the guns i put it on . STURDY SCREWS , flush screws , fits perfectly , does nt stick out does nt fall short when screwed in . MAKE SURE YOU BUY THE ONE SPECIFIC FOR YOU FIREARM .
4 #### I really like this little mini - griptilian except for two things . First , the omega spring broke . I had to send it to Benchmade for warranty repairs . Their service is very good , but I did not need the $ 10 expense and the hassle of shipping the knife back to the manufacturer . Second , the pivot screw keeps getting loose . Nothing that a little locktite would n't cure , but mildly annoying nevertheless . I have lowered my rating from 5 stars to 4 after a couple of years of use .
5 #### These are long enough to not have my rear hanging out . They 're comfortable and fit perfectly .
5 #### My 4 1/2 started Karate and uses these in class . It 's a great practice tool for home . Love it !
5 #### It 's extremely loud for the effort needed to blow it !
5 #### this is my favorite cheap bra .. that has great support . an every day bra .
5 #### Perfect for chasing geese away that are pooping all over our dock in Wisconsin .
3 #### The best chalk I 've come across . I 'm not sure if this chalk is different from weightlifting chalk since it is labeled as rock climbing chalk but it does seem to grip better . The basic idea behind chalk is to keep your hands dry and that 's exactly ehat it does .
5 #### Bought this for son and it seems to holding up against anything an 8 y / o could throw at it !
5 #### These hose look nice on , give fairly good support and let me dress for a wedding without it being obvious that I was wearing support hose . For someone who experiences some swelling in my ankles due to a medication I need , that is a real treat . I can still have access to nice hosiery with support without ordering them from the medical supply store looking and broadcasting my infirmities on a day where the focus is on the happy couple . These hose support so well that if I know I will be on my feet longer than I need to be , I put these on as soon as possible after awakening . They help me not have as much discomfort from the swelling at the end of that day . As far as their care goes , washing by hand with the hosiery wash from Spanx will give them the longest life . They can be washed in a lingerie bag in a gentle cycle in the washing machine but do not last as long . Using the machine , you will still get several wearings from them before you notice their strength weakening
4 #### Had to buy a whole size smaller for our son .
4 #### I bought this watch for a more sporty style . I love the face of the watch and it has worked fine . I also like the indiglow feature . The date is pretty small & unreadable for my over-50 eyes but I do n't depend on my watch for the date . My only complaint is the color of the casing is gray in all online photos of this watch , which I really liked , but the casing is actually black without a hint of silver or gray ! Oh well , it 's still pretty nice looking so I chose not to send it back .
5 #### great jacket . had to break it in . first one they sent has a busted zipper but returned it and got the new one within a couple of days and the jacket is great .
5 #### I really like this knife . It fits very well into the sheath , and is snug enough to not have to worry about it coming out on its ' own . When you first get it , it is very stiff when removing it from the sheath , but if you work the knife as if your trying to widen the opening of the sheath , it will free up a bit , then all you have to do is put a little forward pressure on the knife when you go to remove it and it comes right out . You can put a really good edge on it . It 's not too small , but not to big . The handle is fairly comfortable , but it is n't anything out of the ordinary as far as knife handles . I have n't gotten to really test the strength of the clip on the sheath , as I have only been hiking once since I have bought it . If I do occur any negatives about it in the future , I will update my review .
5 #### Keen sandals are the best , most comfortable shoes . I have a 7.5 in another version ( Whisper ) which fits really well . But I stuck with my normal size 8 on this one . It fits perfectly . I love that you can wear these shoes anywhere in all kinds of warm , wet weather or areas ( beaches , rivers , water areas of Carowinds , Legoland , UniversL Studios , etc ) . They are my " go to " summer shoes .
3 #### The silk is very thin and thready . I suppose that is what Pointelle means . I did n't know what it meant and ordered it assuming it was smooth silk . It 's okay for the price ........ but not worth more than that .
5 #### runs a little large . super cute , but get dirty . pretty quickly . sometimes heel gets squicky after having them for a while
5 #### Got these shoes for my 4 year old grandson , he wears them all the time and has fun in them along with really enjoying them .
4 #### Good quality for a good price . this is a Sisal ( * self healing ) board will last a very long time , this comes ready to go ( with two sets of darts but you may want to get more later ) just hang it up and start throwing . Time will fly and you will have a great time with family and friends . You can get pricier boards and set ups but this will do for the occasional get togethers with friends and family . They also have a wall protector that you can get that is a good idea if you are putting this somewhere where you are not wanting the wall to end up looking like a pin cushion . It is listed here on Amazon just search for this product asin B00UKUPPPA or " Viper Defender Backboard " it is about $ 20 but putty and paint will definitely cost you more ! * They make a few complete sets that include this but they cost considerably more ! This is a good price for the quality and just what you need . ;-)
5 #### These were a Christmas gift so had to wait for the person to try them on .
5 #### I bought this for my grandson , he loves it . Using it everyday . Works well . Looks as it did in picture .
1 #### Horrible . Not even close to being able to mount level . My rail and scope were both level , and this was way off to the side . Upon inspection , it appears the mount throws the level off when torquing it down to the rail . Other reason not to buy - There is no locking piece to keep it positioned on the rail . Meaning the screw does not slide through a slot , and there is no bar to keep it locked into the rail . Under recoil this level WILL slide forward unless you mount it up against something else ( like a scope ring or sight , etc ) . Buy something else .
4 #### I 'm not giving these a full 5 stars only because of how large they are compared to the size I was expecting to get . They are a full inch longer than my son 's normal size ( which I purchased in these ) . I read the sizing chart for Converse and followed it and they 're still much bigger than advertised . The quality is what I expect from this company , so I will just hang on to them for a year and my son can enjoy them later .
5 #### These shoes fit my little girl chunky wide foot perfectly
5 #### I 'm 6 ' and I have a +3 reach , this pad is plenty long enough for me , If you are even taller then you might want to find an even longer pad , but this has great grip , and stores well . Would n't want to drag it very far though , its heavy , which is good for walking to your local studio , not traveling .
4 #### My kids saw the older neighbors using a scooter and wanted one . I debated between this and the tri - wheel version . Although this had a bit of a learning curve I 'm happy we choice this one so he could go into it . A friend bought the 2 wheel in the front designs and my kids had a rough time with it . They kept stepping on the wheel . Very happy with this scooter .
3 #### The product is lightweight plastic . I had to return mine because the lens was flawed .
4 #### In case it 's not obvious , be sure to have the " Galco " logo pointing out when you put on this calf strap . I was n't paying too much attention and wore it inside out for a day and it was rather pokey and uncomfortable . Overall , it 's exactly as you 'd imagine , and has held up well to my rough treatment . You 'll need to find the correct snugness to give you the proper hold without being too tight , and that point will likely change for the first week or two while the strap settles into its " true " size and stretchiness .
5 #### I use 3 different camping stoves and the ' Esbit ' is the one I carry in my back pack . They can be used in your tent and they do n't smoke or give off fumes . Try them , I think you 'll like them .
5 #### Just the right density for me . Not too thick that it makes it hard for balancing poses , and enough padding for hardwood floors . Did not have off - gassing .
5 #### I GOT MY SHOES IN THE MAIL VERY FAST I LOVE THEM THEY GO WITH EVERYTHING I WEAR I RECOMMEND YOU BUY THEM .
5 #### good strong and durable . I hang my camera from it
4 #### I 've been a long - time fan of these timex kids watches , I even wore them as a kid myself . I just bought this one for my eight year old daughter who wanted to get better at telling time with a " real clock . " I like the idea that this had both the hour and the minute numbers on the face . But when I received it , I realized the minute numbers are different than I expected . The minute numbers are not listed as 0 - 60 as I expected . They are 0 - 30 , and then counting down 30 - 0 during the second half of the hour . I 'm not sure what the intention is , perhaps to teach " It 's 20 minutes until 3:00 " ? But either way , I would have preferred 0 - 60 to be what was on the face of the clock . But still , my daughter loves the watch and has enjoyed wearing it and telling time with it .
4 #### My spouse thinks I 'm a dork for wearing it . But it 's functional for runs , and trips to the beach in which I 'm throwing dog toys in the water for my dog . I can safely carry my phone , car key and lip balm . I loop my dog 's leash in the strap , so my hands are feed up .
5 #### My granddaughter loves her watch and the color . I was worried that she would n't like it . She like the flowers on it too .
4 #### It fits fine , but it is a tad tight in the top elastic . I wish the elastic top were wider so that there was no danger of interfering with my circulation as I am 75 . We need to watch out for deep vein thrombosis .
2 #### very long shoulder straps and small cups in the large size ( 4 ) . makes for " massive spillage " over the cleavage and out of the arm holes . inadequate " bounce control " and very uncomfortable .
5 #### These worked perfectly on my customers wreath - made by Pink Door Wreaths ( Facebook or Etsy )
5 #### Fit as expected . I washed them before I wore them . I like the way the fit . I have to adjust the draw stings in but nothing too bad .
4 #### Good quality leather and it came well packaged with quite a few compartments
5 #### just love the quality of the sign it a great 12x12 sign that way hung on my daughters bedroom door . for a lions fan its a great gift
5 #### I love this product . Perfect color , comfortable fit , great look and feel . I will definitely buy again . Highly recommend . * *
4 #### Decent compact inexpensive throw bag . I use the compact ones on my PWCs , Packrafts , etc ..
3 #### Excessively too large ! I thought they may be a bit too big to make them last 2 years ! They might fit her in 4 years !
5 #### My son loves it and it fits perfectly . Looks cool and nicely padded .
4 #### I have a few Bianchi 100 holsters for other guns and love them.however this one is made for J - frame size guns and the trigger guard is a little larger on the sp101 . It works but the seam is going to tear sooner or later where the trigger guard enters the holster , it is extremely tight . This fits my 642 s&w perfect .
1 #### This thing will not fit on any gun .... the shoulder padding is unmoveable and comes nowhere near your shoulder when put on the gun ..... I got a refund on this and they did n't even make me return it ... I threw it in the trash and got my money back ..... This is the only item I have ever ordered from Amazon that I was disgusted with ..... it is truly a POS
5 #### Love these shoes . My feet have been weird since I was pregnant and my old shoes were uncomfortable . These are very comfy and help me get active . They are also stylish and go with anything .
5 #### A great buy . Shopped elsewhere and it was twice , or more , the price here . Recommend to everyone .
4 #### We use scooters in our production plant , so we use scooters alot . They work really well as long as you are not over 250 lbs . The plastic rims just ca nt handle the weight .
5 #### The best warmers around . I use the hand warmers in my bike shoes and gloves . I put them outside my bike shoe and then put my booties on . They 're too hot inside your shoe and can burn your feet . I put them in between my gloves and my glove liners . Great product they last a couple years so you do n't have to use the whole box right away . They stay hot about 8 hours . Do n't forget to put them in air tight bag after using and you can get two uses out of them .
3 #### They seemed well made and comfortable out of the box , not sure how they are as they were a gift .
5 #### Bought a 1/2 size down and they fit perfect . Super comfortable and stylish . Would recommend .
5 #### Very nice price and product . Will use for my rowboat , and training Scout Troop for rank advancement .
5 #### Using these for 3 + months , only for the gym ( particularly deadlifts and squats ) . Feels minimalist on my flat feet , which is exactly what I want . These will last a long time ! Runs a tad smaller than my regular shoe size , as others have mentioned . Its a slim profile . The shoelaces are 1 - 2 inches longer than I prefer , laced up in a single knot they hang on the floor . Rare risk of tripping on them .
5 #### Once I figured out my size , I was happy ! Great price on Amazon ! !
5 #### My daughter loves these ! Super cute . Make sure you get the right size . We almost got a men 's 7 which would have been a womens 9 . Glad we double checked
5 #### This is a great pop up tent , works well ! Highly recommend !
5 #### Very nice frisbee . My son likes to throw it when I 'm not expecting so it 's not as bad when it hits me in the head .... He just turned 3 so we 're learning how to play frisbee . It 's got soft rubbery edges but is heavier than a typical plastic frisbee so I 'm still worried about him getting hurt by it .
1 #### 8 1/2 EE fits like 8 1/2 D. Way too narrow to be comfortable . Returned and will continue to buy Luchesse in future .
2 #### In one day I got a run and had to get a new pair , exact same problem . Wo n't be buying these again .
5 #### This work great and are better than just normal snow pants . I did size up to double XL like someone else suggested for being 6'2 " Already logged a lot of snow shoeing , shoveling snow and tubing
5 #### Limbsaver products are generally pretty great , but these recoil pads really do wonders for taking the snoot out of many long guns with sharp or heavy recoil , this includes big Magnums . definitely worth buying and putting on your gun .
5 #### Ordered half a size larger than my usual shoe size and fits perfectly .
5 #### Got this for skiing . Kept my neck very warm , and it was small enough to stuff in my pockets when it warmed up on the the mountains .
5 #### I ordered this ball because of the thick rubber ball . My grandson loves it , he he is 3 yrs . He is learning to throw and kicking it . It was just as it was advertised . I would recommend this ball .
4 #### Very comfortable sneakers and I also like the way it fits .
4 #### Seem like great little pans that should work well for a long while ( just got them , so time will tell ) . The only problem ( for me ) , which I knew prior to purchase is the muffin pan , which is too big for my toaster over . It would be nice if all of the pans in the set were of similar size . The muffin pan is substantially larger than the others . But I ordered a cast iron muffin pan that does fit , so I 'm all good . And for the overall price , I 'm happy with it anyway . This muffin pan will still work in the regular oven . :)
3 #### Great shoe . However I ordered blue and recieved a black pair .
4 #### The sleeves and tail are long , and I should have ordered a smaller size , but the shirt is well - made and looks as if it would last . It had two small holes , but the seller refunded the complete price .
5 #### my tennis elbow is gone because of this little dude .
5 #### This watch is great for my elderly dad . He can see it well , and most importantly , he can look at it and quickly know what day / date it is , which is what he really needed .
5 #### kids and I have used this several times and enjoy it .
3 #### The shoes were ok , but had to return they are large in side .
5 #### As always , great product and a great purchasing experience , fantastic on both accounts !
1 #### When I got around to wearing them , they fit , but the shoe laces were different colors and had different lengths . The left shoe lace was so short it would not form a proper bow and would not stay tied .
2 #### This is one of the outsourced carrhart shirts . Too thick , and a small restrictive fit .
5 #### I own three pairs of these . Great , understated , economical pair of cycling shorts . The chamois is sufficient and has stayed well . Fit is great . I also own Canari tights for colder mornings and winter : http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0047WDG9O
5 #### These are great nylons . I 'm a Flight Attendant so I 'm pretty hard on them . They last & have great support . Very good price . Cheapest I 've found , even our crew sore is more expensive . Definitely recommend
5 #### Husband is happy with them . Works even in some snow .
4 #### i d been wearing Duluth tees for a while . these surpassed them . I only wish they made the green color in a pocket less version .
5 #### I read the reviews saying that they fit a little large , and that is what I wanted . I wear mine while riding my recumbent bike and for street wear for concealed carry of a small Glock . If you understand that it will fit large you will like this shirt . Note that it does have a small logo on the back saying " Performance Fishing Gear " , but that is pretty unobtrusive .
4 #### A little on the baggy side but other than that very solid . Extremely durable .
5 #### Excellent shoes . Worth every dollar . Will use them a lot this winter .
4 #### It runs big . Could not give it five stars because the horns that come with it are pretty lame . I bought the Disney Maleficent Horns to go with it and those helped make the costume .
5 #### Fit well . Thick jeans for the money . Do n't look cheap like most in this price range .
5 #### Bought this as a Christmas present for my son . He loves it . Quite large and keeps all his golfing equipment organized and neat . Sturdy and well made .
5 #### After a day of hiking , back support is necessary . It only weighs a pound so wo n't be a burden to your pack . I wish it could pack down smaller but I will always find a way to bring this with my while hiking . At the camp site , friends ask to borrow it as soon as we get up . We ended up buying more chairs to give as gifts .
4 #### Would 've been 5 stars if fit was n't confusing . This is now my second pair of hi tops , the last ones lasted 15 years ! I have wide feet so they 're super comfy . However , Chuck Taylors run 2 AND A HALF sizes larger than men 's not 2 sizes larger for women - I had to return these ( 5 men 's , 7 women 's ) and buy from a different seller as they did n't have my size in black as everywhere on all these products it says 2 sizes larger than men 's . I 'm a size 7W , the 4.5 Men 's ( Women 's 6.5 ) fit me perfectly . On the bottom of my 15 yr old hi tops , it said 4.5 , why I did n't stick with that I do n't know , thought sizing had changed in last 15 years . Got new ones from different merchant , 4.5 Men 's , fit perfectly !
5 #### Shoes are very nice , but they seem a little big for a toddler size 6 . That 's OK because children grow fast !
5 #### I wear this to cut the grass and keep the sun off , but lets be honest , I pretend I 'm some elite soldier in the bush . So far the stitching looks good and I do n't see it falling apart anytime soon .
5 #### Very nice and super sturdy . My teen wants to get organized this year so I bought these because I know they last because I have this at work .
5 #### Perfect fit but I already had a pair so ordered exactly the same size as before . They run a little small as they are 1 size larger than my others .
5 #### i 'm thin but these do n't slide down on my skinny legs
4 #### We ordered this shoe cleaner to keep outside the back door , on concrete . By itself , this is worthless on concrete as there is no way to hold it while cleaning your shoes . Also , it rusted quickly on the bottom where the concrete scratched the paint . I ordered the steel base and now it works good . The side brushes do a good job , and the bottom has the metal edge that you can scrap off the mud as well as the little brushes . For deep tread on your work boots , you will still need to scrap out the grooves , but on smoother soles , it cleans good . You will definately either need to screw it to a wooden deck or buy the base to use it on concrete .
4 #### Very good , high quality rings . Easy to install and setup . The inserts make it easier to install the scope and protect it from marks .
4 #### I used to use these way back when . Anyhow , for car camping this stove is all you need . Easy to carry and clean .
5 #### These are my favorite shoes . I wear them for casual lounging and I can also wear them to work or social occasions as long as I keep them clean . Often when I 'm traveling I ca n't spare the space to bring more than 1 pair of size 12 shoes in my carry on , these are my all around solution . They slip on and off for security screenings . I can walk around a city all day comfortably . They are water resistant enough that getting caught in the rain is no problem and they look fine ( in my opinion ) out to dinner with khakis or out and about with shorts . They wear well and with a little care I can get a couple of years out of a pair even with heavy use .
5 #### Have never found anything that works any better on shoes , purses , saddles , stirrups , etc . ! Love it !
5 #### my baby is already in love with this pair . tried it on her and now she wo n't let me take it off . she has been running around with it as it feels very comfy even without a socks . i am buying more of it fir my older son.maybe the black this time .
3 #### Slippery on wet tile floor ! I expected better traction in these , with the name being JUNGLE MOC . The style is not very fashionable but if your jeans are long enough , no one needs to see . I have worn them to work ( mostly sitting ) and to walk around the block . Comfortable enough .
4 #### I was really excited when I opened the box to see the color is exactly like the image shows ! I have the Nike flex tr 5 and used the same size to order these . They are a little bigger than expected but still comfortable .
4 #### Silicone grease is grease but the instructions said to use it , so I did . We 'll see if it prevents a water leak in my RV toilet .
2 #### I will just echo much of what " The Shepard " said about the knife . It 's almost impossible to remove it from the sheath without playing tug of war with yourself . And to make a strange situation even more strange , the belt / boot clip that is an integral part of the sheath is so weak that it is useless for holding the knife in any location ..... which is why I no longer own this knife . Rideing my motorcycle today , the knife fell away somewhere on I40 . I do n't miss it .... Lynn Stubblefield
5 #### This slip was the expected Vanity Fair quality . Fits well , feels nice , and does n't cling . I would order again .
5 #### Perfect no more wear Levis that within a few months . These are thicker and are more resistant to the perfect fit body ideal for daily work
5 #### What can I say ? If your reading this , buy it ! If your looking for a compass , buy this !
4 #### works great against all bugs , from smallest to biggest . i do n't use it for garden works , i use it for hunting and it protects me very well .
2 #### If the inside pocket is n't weighted down it flips upside down . If it is n't snapped shut in both overlaying flaps everything is all over the ground with the risk of losing cards and IDs . I even had a nightmare about on my second day of owning this . lol
5 #### I bought these for our youngest son for the skatepark . They work great !
5 #### We 've only had minimal play time with these to date , but so far they seem to fit well and be well built for general play .
2 #### my title says it all . will probably return it to amazon . if the hat had more upper body then I would keep it
5 #### This has turned out to be a great bait for inshore trout . I even caught a few Jacks . The hollow bottom makes them much easier to put on the hook correctly .
5 #### I 've worn this bra ( and Fantasie 's other smooth styles ) for decades . If you are large chested , there 's no better bra . Worth every penny . Great support and fit and no seams show through ! LOVE !
4 #### My husband wears them with orthodics for better arch support . He likes them and uses them for almost everything . They are good for casual dress at first but after the suede gets worn they are best for every day use .
1 #### The release works well on my 55 # recurve bow . However it was bought for a compound bow purchased from Amazon , that was never delivered . Without the bow I can not be more accurate as to the quality of the release , but I will say that I find Amazon to be lacking in integrity and customer service . If I ever get the compound bow from Amazon I will modify this review to be more a performance based review than customer service based one .
5 #### This does not feel as rickety as the other reviews would have you believe . I did put this up in just a few minutes . The toughest part is getting the hooks on , but that 's just because the bolt is pretty long ... so probably just tighten them a good amount before strapping them to the pole . I put a bit of brake cable housing in one of the holes to prevent slippage ... some people used screws in other reviews ... it 's not necessary , I was just nervous after reading all of the reviews that complain of sliding . All in all , if this falls down , it 'll be because I 've stumbled into it , haha . Very good purchase . Holding two road bikes in my tiny apartment .
5 #### This is my second Skagen , and just like the first one , this is a Fantastic Watch ! Thin , Stylish , and Uber Cool !
3 #### The fit on this is awesome , and I love the design . However , a few things prevent me from rating it higher than three stars . First , even with the adjustable straps ( which are nice ) , the chest area is way too low . I 'm nursing ( one main reason I purchased this dress - it works well for that purpose ) and am guessing my bra size to be a 36D , and there is no way I would wear this without something underneath . I wear a nursing bra that looks like a v - neck undershirt under it and it covers better that way . Then I pair it with a shrug and it looks nice . The other issue I have with this design is that it 's advertised as being red and white . It is so far from being red . It 's pink , almost hot pink . I love the floral pattern and birds and everything else about the design , but I was seriously disappointed with the color and never would have bought it had I known it was pink . I just wear a red shrug over it and that makes the pink stand out less without clashing too much . Essentially , it 's a really nice dress if you know what to expect and work with it a bit . Not sheer ( I tried a black bra under it and it did not show through ) , and very flattering . I actually bought another pattern of this dress a few weeks after buying this one because I liked the fit and design so much .
5 #### Exactly what I needed . High definition between face , numerals and hands for daylight and especially the indiglo viewing . Great size , has day and date , is very light feeling on the wrist . Well done again , Timex .
5 #### Must have for outdoor cooking . Keeps Dutch oven lid off the ground
5 #### Great hammock . It is plenty big enough for me and my boyfriend , and seems really durable . The attached bag is wonderfully convenient .
5 #### i used this for several weeks and it cured my tennis elbow or whatever it was called . i did n't think it wopuld work but i used it every other day and tehn i jsut forgot to use it for a while and noticed i was healed . i now use it once a week just to keep up with the exercise . really great item ... oh i got the bluie one
5 #### Nice sturdy bag , perfect for a coach to transport to tournaments .
5 #### So happy with my purchase ! ! Love them and fit great with some growing room !
5 #### I ca n't believe what a good little scooter this is for the price . My grand daughter loves it !
4 #### Solid , well made . Takes a beating and last forever . my only complaint is the side thigh pocket is a tiny bit too small to fit a smartphone into . Get with the program Carhartt !
4 #### For the wife . She wears rainbows all day so these are a slight upgrade . She loves them so there you go .
5 #### I purchased this because it 's a lot better quality than the others I had purchased . I got these as training tools and gifts , since the others I bought I could n't even light the mag shavings with a torch . These take a spark quite readily , and I happened to notice the other night that they glow in the dark after exposure to light . Not a really bright glow , but in pure dark it is quite obvious . Definitely a good purchase if you are going to use the mag bar or if you are putting it away in your emergency kit . Remember to carry other ways of making fire also !
3 #### This thing flies pretty well . However , I was a little disappointed with easily the corners started getting damaged . After a few uses , the cracks started degrading how well it flies . At this point , it barely works . Perhaps I was a little rough on it , but I would have expected it to hold up a little better .
4 #### Got this for Mom who suffers from macular degeneration . It is easier to read than most watches , but she still has a hard time telling the time with it .
5 #### This is the second one I have purchased . They work great and are quite inexpensive . Would recommend .
5 #### I own six of these . Heavy duty , well made , I 'm 6'6 " 325 and I wear them to work every day .
5 #### For a few dollars more than Target 's Champion brand you can get these and they 're much better quality and sturdier material .
5 #### The absolute CLASSIC . Wears well , washes back white and lasts for extended use . Well Made !
4 #### Every brand has their own sizing quirks and honestly , any input I can give you on that front is going to be anecdotal . If you happen to want that , here you go : I measure a 38 waist , and these , unwashed , were about a size too tight . After a good wash , hang dry , and tumble through the fluff setting in the dryer with a tennis ball , they fit better everywhere but the waist . If you 're on the middle - high end of a given size , I 'd say go one up . That minor gripe aside , these have very true coloring , have yet to fade even slightly , and look amazing .
5 #### Bought these for my boyfriend and he loves them . The backs were a little hard at first , but once they were broken in , I am told that they are very comfortable .
5 #### Wanted a official ball for the game to get auto graphs .
5 #### This is a great travel case for my jewelry and nice and small and flat . it has lots of compartments .
5 #### I had one of these in Scouts that I loved . I had a 100 % cotton one and this hat is a blend and is much stiffer , I 'm hoping it gets a bit worn in with a little . The brim is perfectly cut to slope down a little bit or curve up when I want it to . Some boonies come with poor cut brim that almost causes it to blindfold over your eyes . These are made well .
5 #### I ordered these shoes because I had owned a pair previously and totally loved them . Will order these again in the future .
5 #### Does what it 's designed to do ... hold dutch oven lids . Solid , sturdy design . A must to keep your lids off the ground and out of the dirt !
5 #### very pleased ! fit just like my others . i wear a size 10 usually but a size 9 1/2 in converse fit every time . they usually run a little bigger in size . verry happy with these shoes , as always .
5 #### Nice to have on cold winter days . Just keep the box on the closet shelf and grab them as needed .
4 #### This is in my emergency bag . Ready for use if needed . this needs more words . five more words . one more .
5 #### No hay zapatos mas cmodos y duraderos que estos clsicos ... Lucen con todo tipo de vestimenta y como dicen , lo clsico nunca pasa de moda .
5 #### There is a reason these are the standard for grip strength . These are very high quality ( Made in the USA ) and are built to last . The knurled handles may be to rough for your hands if you do n't do weight training with free weights that are n't knurled . I bought the Sport ( 80 lb ) gripper and it 's just a bit too light . I was a three - sport athlete in high school ( class of 2005 ) and I still regularly exercise and do free weight strength training . I am currently training for the USMC Officer Candidate Course . So if this sounds like your level of exercise than you 'll want a heavier gripper , if you have less activity maybe this one or a lighter one . With this weight gripper I can easily do 2 sets at 10 reps with each hand . I also reverse the gripper ( spring closer to pinky ) and can do one set of 10 reps . I will probably work my way up to 20 reps ( to simulate 20 pull ups ) on each hand before I go to a heavier grip . Hope this helps
3 #### Debating returning these . The jean material is a nice change from my regular canvas pants of the same type . The difference is , the thick canvas seem to fit better . These are snug around the thigh and butt and feel stiff . They look very nice from a style perspective but are too thick for a regular wear pant .
5 #### Good hat but not water repellant like my old one . Sized slightly small too .
5 #### Nice color , kinda grey . Cooler color in the summer time .
1 #### Has potential but the manufacturer 's decision to use lower / thinner quality fabrics results in a quick tears in the netting . Along with the single stitched wasteband , this product is literally falling apart at the seams . I have really nothing positive to say which for me is rare . Sorry , but this product needs to go back to the drawing board or be discontinued .
4 #### I usually wear a 7.5 but for Converse I 've consistently bought a half - size down and they fit snugly . It 's known that Converse have a flat insole so I recommend getting shoe inserts for all - day wear . These usually last me a year or two , but yours will probably last longer if you 're not constantly taking them to outdoor events . Great classic shoe .
5 #### I love how comfortable these sandals are . They are comfortable even when walking for hours . They grip the ground well . I would highly recommend these to anyone .
1 #### terrible . immediately fell apart when i tried to shake off the loose dried pieces .
5 #### Thr item was delivered as expected , fits well and gives that " old school " look with jeans .
5 #### I 've worn these for 20 + years . If you 've never bought these , then here 's the secret .... 1 ) Buy gel inserts . Otherwise you are walking on cardboard all day . BUT if you get inserts , you can wear these daily forever . 2)They are sized odd . Try them on in a store first .
5 #### This is my go - to way of staying comfortable in the winter . I prefer it to scarves that are too floppy for my taste . I used to have about four of them , and my stash got whittled down to just one , so I recently bought two more so I 'd have plenty in the wings .
5 #### I require comfortable , sturdy shoes for work , and also wanted an outdoor shoe with toe protection . This is my first pair of Keens , and they are great . The ergonomic footbed fits very well , and cushions my feet . Easily adjusts tighter or looser . I highly recommend these shoes .
1 #### Ped&iacute ; unos pantalones 34x36 y me llegaron unos 36x32 . Afuera en la etiqueta dice 34x36 sin embargo dentro del pantal&oacute;n en la etiqueta dice 36x32 . Por tanto no me sirvieron y me quedaron super grandes .
5 #### My husband and I had one of these when we were growing up and we wanted to share the fun with our boys this spring / summer . The best part of this great outdoors toy is that even if you are not the best at tossing a Frisbee in the air , the Aerobie Pro Ring will still fly in the air . Great for kids of all ages to play with outside . Watch out for windy days and high tosses , for it will fly in the air well above your heads . Lots of fun for all ages ! !
3 #### I purchased this for my husband , since he wanted a new orange jacket for hunting season . The style and quality is nice the color is great and overall feels well made and warm . I first ordered a Large after reading some of the other reviews that it runs big . But when he tried it on the arms were too short . They did not have the Large tall in stock when I ordered either time so we ended returning and going with the XL . That one fit better in the length for the arms , but leaves a lot of room around the middle and chest section . It probably will be okay since when he plans on wearing the jacket , is during deer season and he tends to dress with more layers anyways so he can use the roominess . Anyone who is tall and normally has trouble with the arms being too short , may want to order the tall size or go up a size as he did with the XL.The color is nice and overall a nice jacket
5 #### We bough two for our 8 and 5 year old daughters . The scooters are well built and the girls have lots of fun on them . You might want to be sure the children wear long pants and maybe helmets knee and elbow guards until they get used to riding . We got a few scrapes and bumps in the first few days because we did n't .
5 #### Its comfortable , feels just like a facemask should . The holes are big enough to accommodate different sized faces , which is nice , gives it a ' one size fits all ' appeal . Other than that ? Its a ski mask . It 'll keep your face warm .
3 #### This was great for about six months and then the seals stopped working .
4 #### I really needed some chalk at a gym that does not typically allow such a thing . This seemed like a viable alternative . I dropped a star because I assumed it would be less messy than ordinary chalk . Honestly , it seems like a sock full of chalk , which is sort of what I was trying to avoid . That being said , keep it in a Ziploc , use it as necessary , and you 'll be fine . Most people tend to overuse chalk and dry / rip their hands . Before chalk , try a towel . Then chalk if necessary , meaning only if your sweaty grip is preventing further work . Good product .
3 #### I got the impression it 's cushiony and comfy by reading the reviews on this product , when i tried it on it was a much firmer than my other work shoes , i 'm standing all day and need enough support and comfort , this is n't the right product for that . So i had to return it , but i would assume it would work fine for training . It looks decent and clean . and seems sturdy . just not the right thing for me . I was refunded instantly upon returning so .. credit for that .
5 #### I like it and seem to made of good materal .
5 #### My son loved them and they arrived quickly as promised
4 #### Great , stirdy net and poles however , the velcro net holders do come off . We ended up using zip ties .
5 #### not my 1st Carhartt so i knew it would be stiff . but it already is getting softer and i would think in a another weeks time it 'll be perfect . love the deep outside pockets
5 #### These jeans are made of a good weight fabric and fit as expected .
5 #### Very nice product and it works great . Keeps a lot of little debris off our kitchen floor . Just remember you need to bolt it down to a larger board for your other foot to stand on when brushing the opposite boot / shoe . Screws are included .
3 #### I have never bought stockings before but I had a wedding to go to so I bought them .... I based my size on the size chart provided when looking at the stockings and when I got them they were EXTREMELY tight around the thighs . The color of the stockings was perfect , I did read some people had issues with the neutral being too tan but I thought they made my legs look a nice tone ( I am white and my legs have not seen the sun in many many months , lol ) . I would buy again but at a larger size .
5 #### these are so cool ! I love them and they have little circles you can peel off in the corners to cover shots so you get many uses out of each target . Easy to see when you hit because they turn yellow in the bullet holes . easy to stick on a big paper or wooden back target . they are n't that expensive when you but the 30 sheet set .
4 #### Easy to install , works great and seems so far great quality . Just wish price was better . Could use two more , but ca n't justify the cost !
4 #### I work in a studio environment and appreciate the heavy - duty closed toe in this sandal when I do n't want to put on my heavy steel - toed boots . Great for light hiking as well . I would give five stars if the bungee on the front was some sort of buckle instead ; it 's stretching out and getting brittle , as bungee does .
4 #### Go a half size up from normal . Overall , satisfied with the shoe for crossfit and weightlifting purposes . Short runs are good too .
4 #### Like it a lot so far . Worried about replacing the band because it takes a beating : water , sweat , sun screen , bug repellant , some accidental banging . My previous " every day " watch had several interchangeable wristbands .
5 #### Greatest mat ever ! I seriously think it has improved my practice because I do n't consciously think about body placement or how certain positions cause areas of my body pain because of lack of cushion . My previous mat sometimes bunched up and using it on wood floors was always uncomfortable because it hurt my bony butt . I love the cushioning of this mat . It feels substantial and while it is heavier than standard yoga mats , it is sooooo worth it ! BTW , I got the Black Magic which is a very pretty deep , dark purple shade .
5 #### This has helped my tendinitis soooooo much . Look for you tube videos rather than the diagrams they send . It will make more sense .
4 #### THis is light and warm , as advertised . However , be aware that the scoop neck is n't that low or wide , so you ca n't wear it with a shirt that 's more scoopy .
5 #### these shoes were fantastic . i got a hole in the big toe area from wearing them so much . i would buy them again definately .
5 #### I struggled with the gray gun cloths leaving fuzzies on my weapons . In other words , the rag tended to brake down . This yellow wax treated cloth holds up well ! no complaints .
5 #### Great price for a great comfy shoe ! ! ! You wan't want to buy another brand after wearing these !
5 #### Nothing more to say other than this is worth having in your collection . CoC has really helped improve my grip and made sure my hands do n't come off so easily when apprehending someone .
5 #### Super comfortable and works for any temperature . The armpit zippers sound weird , but they are life savers in the summer heat . Every inch of this jacket was very well thought out . The best part is that it weighs almost nothing and packs down to a negligible size . Perfect for backpacking !
5 #### These rags are outstanding . I use them on more than guns and reels . Leaves a nice finish and protective layer against fingerprints , rust etc . I even wipe my bike down with these things . A must have for guns and whatever else you may need it for .
2 #### I give 3 stars and i will mention why First , i have 4 pairs from converse shop ( nike right now ) None of those looking like this i got here Not the label , not the down part ( sice is not written on the bottom as it should on all my original converse shoes do have ) The glue its visible on the fabric on some parts I tell myself they are not the original It might be a 1:1 copy But , I might be wrong ... And they run one sice bigger , but the original onces run half biggest and it mentioned on the site in description ) Here I could not find the note about running bigger I do n't know , i can give them to my boy next year will be exactly in this sice but still do n't feel good to pay so much for a replica ( if ) I might return them .. or keep and buy just from the original site of nike / converse
5 #### This stove serves us well when we go camping . My only beef is that the flame does n't really adjust much , but we are only doing basic cooking with it , so not a huge deal .
5 #### I was pleasantly surprised at how well this pantyhose fit , not only was it able to accommodate my plus sized figure but also my tall height . A rare combination and very much appreciated . Recommended !
5 #### Fit correctly at a fraction of the store price . Comes with screws , made from aluminum .
5 #### Great product . Tried a very expensive one[klymit ) on motorcycle trip and it was terrible . This mattress is super comfortable but a little big when packed .
3 #### I was sent pink shoes with purple plaid detailing . I did n't even realize Converse made shoes that ugly . I was able to return them and get a refund , but will have to reorder at a later date .
4 #### Great Quality , I use to hold my ski to the dock during short visits . They work well but tend to fray with heavy use .
5 #### I 'm not sure why my 9th grade daughter wanted me to order this , and I prefer not to ask . I will say it fits her medium sized head , her little sister 's smaller head , and my husband 's great big large head , without any problem . It is not quite as thick as what I would want in a ski mask , although we live in the south and cold is not really an issue . I also prefer the ones that have smaller mouths , but my angel really enjoys this one and wears it frequently . It can be kind of unsettling and unnerving walking in on her in the kitchen getting a drink of water in the middle of the night , and one of the dogs is terrified of her when she wears it , but if ski masks are your thing , this one 's a keeper .
3 #### Has a hard sole . Bought this for walking around Disney and without socks ended up with a blister
5 #### Went to africa for 10 days and hunted hard , scope was bounced around a lot and held zero perfectly . Great product . Buddies much more expensive scope had to be re zeroed . Highly recommended the Weaver .
5 #### Installed it in less than 10 minutes ... superb ... looks and works great ! The local bike store wanted $ 15 for similar deal !
4 #### They 're Converse . Do I really need to say more ? They are a classic . These were purchased for my 14 yr old daughter who loves them and wears them constantly . I will say from experience that I would n't recommend them for someone older than 30 . I had a pair around that age and the lack of arch support means that you can only wear them for a short period of time before your feet begin to ache something fierce .
3 #### It was relatively easy to inflate it by blowing air through mouth , took around 20 min . However , it feels very uncomfortable to sleep on . The width is less making it difficult to roll over or move side to side . The mattress tends to tilt / tip over if you change sides . Also it does n't feel very comfortabelto sleep on , stiffness is high . Overall a decent product but there are certainly better out there .
5 #### Chuck All Stars , what is not to like , they are a classic cool addition to your wardrobe
5 #### I bought a pair of these jeans for my son who is very tough on jeans ( he works in construction ) . The first pair I bought for him last year have held up so well , I bought him another couple of pairs . They fit according to his measurements . They 're nice jeans .
4 #### I 'm completely satisfied with these shoes . They are well made , comfortable and good looking . What else matters ! I 'll purchase again in the future .
5 #### I like having a horseshoe game , even if no one plays it
5 #### loved it but color is not what is shown . It is a dark navy not this color shown
5 #### I use it daily . It holds all I really need .
5 #### Very nice shirt . Quality with a capital " Q " for having great , heavy duty fabric . Long enough to tuck in for a tall person .
5 #### I 'm a woman and I needed some long sleeve , casual , cool weather shirts . All of the women shirts , like this , are either too clingy , or thin material . These shirts are fantastic . I ordered 2 , and I 'm thinking of buying more , great price .
5 #### Not as good quality construction like my dads one , but it is cheap and works fine . I use it mainly for frying fish , chicken , onion rings stuff like that .
4 #### Timex Women 's T21912 " Cavatina " Watch with Leather Band is a nice piece for the money .
5 #### Love my chucks ! I normally wear a size 10 , but since these are notoriously narrow ( and I have a wide foot ) , I went up to a 10.5 and they fit great ! I kept blowing the sides out , and hopefully now that will cease .
5 #### Purchased for my son who is participating in an archery program . Arrived in purfect condition . I had to perfom minimal setup , to " Crank down " the tension , adjust the stop and add an arrow rest . My son is shooting 3D and with targets he is doing nice tight groupings at 10 - 20 yds .
5 #### Absolutely love them . Can even wear them without my insoles .
2 #### I 've worn converse for years . This pair does n't fit correctly .
5 #### Very versatile workout kit and packs in a nice small kit . Great for traveling and stores in small areas .
4 #### Nice lock to secure your Thule hitch add - on 's such as a bike attachment FOUR * * * * stars only because it is pricey for a lock , should be in $ 25 - range
1 #### Great shoes ! however , the shoes size chart do n't give the right measurement . I wear 7.5 U.S women size . So I ordered the shoes size 7.5 U.S women/ 5.5 men size . When I tried the shoes were pretty big like size 9 to me . I can put three finger on the back of my heels . So I returned it , and I never reorder it . Because I do n't know what is the right size for me .
5 #### This costume really is as great as the reviews suggest . I purchased a size 2/3 for my 2 - year - old 's 1st trick - or - treat outing 2 years ago , and it was a hit with him , we his parents , and our friends and neighbors . He was kind of swimming in it that year , I have to say , but we made it work . I was amazed at how realistic it looked , how durable it appeared , and how heavy - duty the clasps on the jacket are . In the 2 years since , it has gotten occasional dress - up play , and it continues to look brand new . And now this month my son who is now 4 years old wants to wear it for Halloween yet again ! Yay , I say , as I wo n't have to try to find another great / expensive costume , so this thing is paying for itself ... Plus the 2/3 fits him very well now ( at age 4 ) , so it appears to run a bit big . If I could think of any negatives , the aforementioned heavy - duty metal jacket clasps seem too difficult for a child to easily open and close , and so I find that I need to help my son get in and out of this costume whenever he wants to dress up in it .
3 #### The watch band has quit latching and i have n't even worn it for a year yet .
3 #### This worked great for a month or two , but it quickly broke down . We used it several times a week for 4 square and stored it inside . It was never used as a ' kick - ball . ' I bought a Mikasa that has held up much better .
5 #### These are great shorts . Comfy and perfect around the house . I 'm the husband so I 'm not wearing them but they look great on my wife if you know what I mean .
3 #### The shoes are as expected , but they arrived without a box ! That 's annoying .
1 #### These arrived to me in a paper envelope which was ripped open , and re - wrapped with tape . The package had been broken and half of the sleeves were bent . These are too large for Magic cards , and I would not recommend them .
5 #### Very good light resistance training for fore arms .... it helps with tennis elbow and forearm splints.you can also use it for thighs .
3 #### Initial colors and quality looked great . After only 2 weeks the flag ripped and had to be thrown away . Kind of expensive for something that I planned on getting more use out of !
4 #### I got these for a friend of mine as a gift and she loves them . They get the ball teed to the right height for her and they 're easy to find after the shot due to the bright orange color . However , this color can actually be hard to see if you 're red - green color blind . She plays 3 - 4 times a week and can get a set to last a year before replacing . The downside is the brush bristles tend to splay out over time so after about 3 - 4 months it can be a challenge to get the ball to stay on the tee . This is the reason I do n't use them but that 's her only complaint about them .
5 #### Ok - I am new to the world of fly fishing - but , I have spent about $ 5,000 on equipment and trips already since June - this is a must in your vest or fanny pack on the water - helped me enjoy my time on the water and reduce frustration with remembering the knots - buy a nail knot tool before you do anything else ...
3 #### Ok , very flimsy . Worked for Halloween , but not for long for a kid who is playing dress up daily
5 #### I had one of these many years ago , hardly ever used it and sold it at a garage sale . Now that we have a motor home my wife wanted another one so she could cook outside and not get grease inside on the walls whenever she fried food . It works great just like the last one we owned .
4 #### So far these boots are okay . The fit and shape are good enough for my feet ; obviously boots like this are n't going to be perfect . The only reason I gave them 4 instead of 5 stars is because they are so wide at the top to the point where it is excessive . Yes , it makes it easy to get your feet in , but it also makes it easier for rain , puddle splashes , brush , stones and soil to get in as well . I tried tucking my pants in just a little and then folding the rest down over the top of the boot , but they are wider even than my pant legs and I do n't wear skinny jeans . These are okay , but not great . I main reason I got them is because they are white , all the other rubber boots are so dark .
5 #### This is a very attractive shoe . It is true to size and fits as expected . Very satisfied with the seller - delivered on time .
5 #### I bought this because my other mat ( I do n't remember the make ) is made out of Jute which is supposed to be very eco - friendly . However that mat was a bit too thin and unpleasant if you had to have your head / forehead on it without a towel . Manduka has great reviews and still seems to care about the environment . I know that it might not be the most eco - friendly mat but I felt confident that this mat will last and is already comfortable . It 's a bit heavier than others when you carry it , but it 's thicker and thus has more padding to it . I 've been using it for the last 8 - months or so on a 1 - 2 session / week average . It 's got good enough grip as is . I was doing a lot of hot yoga classes so I have been accustomed to using a yoga towel even in non - hot classrooms . Bite the bullet and spend more on a mat that will last and is of excellent quality !
3 #### Very low cut heel so if you training and pushing sleds - I ran right out of shoes ! Although the traction on toe and heel are great
5 #### I work retail night stock . I average about 20000 steps a night . These shoes lasted 10 months before developing a large hole . The cloth part separated from the rubber in the front creating a hole in the shoe . For how much wear I 've put in these , I 'm surprised they did n't fall apart . Most shoes I buy last around 5 to 6 month with less comfort . I could easily use these for another couple of months but I feel like getting another pair is the best bet . If you work retail , this is a perfect shoe . Pictures are after 10 months of wear .
4 #### I purchased two of these " shipped and sold by Amazon " and received the better plastic helmets , not the silly latex mask some of the other buyers got . The helmet does not look like the mask currently shown on the item page . It comes in pieces and does fall apart easily , but a glue gun along the seams took care of that quickly . The helmet is ginormous , even for an adult . I cut and glued pieces of air conditioner weatherseal foam inside to get them to fit my 7 and 9 year olds . The smokey lenses are somewhat difficult to see out of , but they worked . Painted the mouth black on one with a sharpie . Spray painted the other helmet pink and added a bow . These were adorable and the best helmets I could find for the price . Update : Held up well . My son is now 12 and still has fun putting this on every now and then . Added 2nd pic .
5 #### My wife is happy , so I 'm happy . Ca n't be beatten for the price . A real value . Also buying from Amazon give peace of mind knowing how they stand behind what they sell .
3 #### Plus size corsets are hard to find that fit properly . This one was way too small and my daughter had been measured several times ! So very disappointed ! But is was a pretty one !
4 #### Great knife perfect edc size I would have given it 5 stars but I had to change scales very plastic feeling but 154 cm steel is easy to sharpen and holds a good edge
3 #### Unfortunately Carhartt is getting ' flimsier ' thinner material in shirts and pants .
4 #### I use these to " lie " to the thermostat in my classroom . It forces the room to read warmer than it actually is , so it keeps the AC unit on . This is a good little tool for that , typically does not exceed 100 degrees and lasts for about eight hours .
5 #### Received on time and as advertised . I bought as a set with the gloves and ca n't be happier with the product .
5 #### I use it for working out at home and its very good . It 's a great thing to use when you 're not able to go to the gym and lift weights and also for phyiscal therapy . its very light , easy to store , and carry . you can do various exercises . I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves to work out
2 #### These binoculars arrived with problems and I returned them : - the right - lens diopter is very iffy and difficult to adjust . In fact , I never was able to get a satisfactory focus with it . - both lenses displayed significant distortion around the outside edges - It was impossible to clearly focus on anything beyond 50 yards - the quick focus mechanism frequently failed to work and took a few tries to adjust Unfortunately I had some similar problems with recently purchased Bushnell 20x50 wide angle binoculars . Bushnell used to be an inexpensive and decent brand . Not anymore .
5 #### Let 's just say there is a good reason why ( as of the date I am writing this ) there are about 2500 reviews with an average 4 - 5 star rating . For the price these are an unbelievable bargain . They are good quality and allow you to easily band together a few band without having to hold on to two sets of handles .
5 #### A replacement for my wife 's older Timex , when the lick'n finally killed the tick'n .
4 #### Very good shoes , perfect for the workplace . Slightly small , but not uncomfortably so .
5 #### This is a great product . I have a small stove that works with a alcohol burner or a fuel cube . Between the two , I can do all my cooking for a short trip .
1 #### Too small for my one year old . Did not know there was a less than 30 day return policy from day of delivery . Now I am stuck with a 30 dollar pair of brand new shoes that he will never wear and do n't have the option to exchange apparently .
5 #### I love Smartwool socks , not sure how many pair I have not . Dress , running , hiking . Just bought two more pair . Ca n't beat these for your feet . Treat them right .
2 #### I ordered the same size waist that I always wear and the waist was way too small . The shorts were also very baggy around the legs .
5 #### This was my 2nd set of these grips , on 2 different handguns they are great and have a good feel in the hand
5 #### Another great bianchi product ! Perfect fit as advertised and good quality leather . and this is the lined 5bhl model . Highly recommend this holster for your n frame smith and wesson .
5 #### My son , a man , loves it . It 's strong like the Eagles !
5 #### The classic stove . I love it . My parents had one while I was growing up and they still have it 30 years later . We used ours on our recent camping trip and had no problems with it . It lights easy , folds out and back down easily , and wind was not a problem . We used it to cook every meal and were totally satisfied .
3 #### Very cute costume but the ears do n't stay on . I suggest buying some ears on a head band to go with the outfit . My son looked really cute regardless and it fit great .
5 #### I play at a Table Tennis Club . A number of the players I hit with play in national tournaments ..... and they have no problem with the ball . In terms of durability the balls have lasted a normal amount of time . So a good ball at a reasonable price for this quality
5 #### The scope was packed well and arrived very quickly . I was surprised at the clarity of the lens . I can see the numbers on the mail box 500 - 600 feet away very clearly.(at maximum magnification . ) I can even see the neighbors gutter nail heads at this distance . If you are using this for target spotting , you should not have any difficulty seeing .22 caliber holes 200 yards away . Like any high magnification lens , you need a good tripod . I would not hesitate to buy another one .
5 #### Will never wear another pair of cheap Levi 's ever again in my life
5 #### I do n't know how people do it , but when I put this thing on , it instantly makes me look like a dork . But of course , if I had to choose between head butting a 2 ton car without protection or looking like a dork , I will have to choose the former . This is a pretty stylish helmet , the back looks really fly . Only problem is either I have a really small head , or this helmet is gigantic . Because when I put it on , the helmet looks like a space ship landed on my head . With that said , the helmet is 1 size fits all unless you have a head the size of grizzly bear . Adjustment to fit the inner loop to your head is a snap . The strap length is very generous , so if you have Jay Leno 's chin , this helmet will accommodate . I highly recommend this helmet if you wanna stay alive .
2 #### These are so heavy ! Then when you unpack it , it takes forever to blow up by mouth and then sleeping bags slip off of them all night .
5 #### Purchased these for my daughter 's bday . They were less expensive on Amazon and fit her perfect ! Love having Amazon Prime !
5 #### The Horse has been one of my favorite standby top water baits for years . Unfortunately last summer , I lost one that had been part of my arsenal for many years . Scores of bass have fallen for " Old Reliable " . This is a must have for any tackle box .
5 #### Great to have on long family trips ... Large food / drink storage area ... One plug for both Warmer and Cooler ... Super easy operation ... Quick clean up
4 #### Very comfortable sneakers and I also like the way it fits .
5 #### This is so soft and warm . I love it ! It fits loosely around my neck and I can fold it down like a turtle neck if I do n't want to have my entire neck covered . The colors are beautiful too .
5 #### My little granddaughter loves these . They 're so cute on her and so comfortable . Thank heavens for that since she wants to wear them everyday !
5 #### Like most Surefire products this thing is remarkable . I carry my P3X on a duty belt with this holster . It is solid and locks the light in tight . I never worry about losing the light during a chase , arrest , or any other tactical movement . Highly recommend if you carry a Surefire light on your duty belt !
5 #### Nice wallet . A bit stiff initially , but loosening up after a few months . I really like the color and plenty of room for cards .
5 #### If you 're interested in exploring any area of New York beyond the metropolitan areas , this Delorme Atlas and Gazetteer is your best bet . Over the years I 've collected these gazetteers for quite a few states , and they 've come in handy when exploring out - of - the - way places , as I 'm fond of doing . For me , this atlas proved most useful when driving around and hiking in the Adirondacks . I was able to find ways to get to some remote areas , thanks to the fact that the maps show secondary roads and backroads , and also show hiking trails . Because the maps are topographical , I have a pretty good idea in advance as to the sort of terrain I can expect to encounter , particularly in the hillier and mountainous territory . While I 've used this mostly as a guide to the Adirondacks , it also appears that it would be quite useful in exploring other parts of the state because of the detail it shows .
2 #### The shoes are nice , but they are very stiff shoes . They 're not comfortable to wear . I purchased them because I heard Sperry 's are very comfortable . These are NOT ! Unfortunately I kept them for a little too long to return .
5 #### I love these shorts . I have them in several colors and would wear them everywhere if I could ! They fit true to size and the color is true to the photo shown .
5 #### I bought my first pair about four years ago and was quite pleased with them . They are like a heavy duty control top panyhose but they really lift and tuck the goopy stuff . Recently while trying on some new skirts I turned around and was dismayed at what appeared in the mirror ! Horrors ! My butt has gone south , but not to worry , I tried the said skirts on with my Spanx and that solved my problem . Now the twins back there look nice and perky ... well , not like when I was 16 , but maybe when I was a 33 year old dance teacher . The waist and thighs stay in place , no rolling there . Even though I 'm a size 2 it does take a little more " work " to get these babies on . But once they are in place , wow !
3 #### The waist was the right size , the inseam is more than an inch longer than advertised . Otherwise a nice pair of jeans .
5 #### I love my shoes . I got them for xmas , but they 're still going strong . Will buy more in the future .
1 #### Ordered 9(m ) received 9 Wide for the second time . Returned them for the second time .
3 #### This part ended up working pretty well for my Browning 22SA . The screw holes in the part lined up with my tapped / threaded barrel holes for the scope mount . The only problem was that the screws that come with the part are too long so you wo n't get a tight mount unless you have a bench grinder and can remove about 1/8th of an inch off of each screw tip and still manage to get the finished result to fit into your threaded barrel holes . Otherwise , a good part for the money if you want a simple weaver scope mount for your 22LR .
5 #### Quality sling swivels .. Worth the money . Beware the made in China junk !
5 #### Bought to use after Hurricane Irma and it was perfect
1 #### The rods biggest eye was bent almost flat as well as numerous scratches and dings in the enamel , this is a sign of how bad this product is made and definetly wo n't stand up to anything more than a makerel . Was supposed to go fishing today ... I guess not ... This is absolutely terrible rod and i hope they make this right for me .
1 #### Nothing is adjustable about this deivce and it is big and heavy . Though I have relatively small hands 2 or more of the finger springs were simply too long to do me any good . Likewise , the " finger rings " are too thin to make the device comfortable to use . I would not recommend this product for ANYONE for ANYTHING .
2 #### This is a low - quality belt . It is adequate if your child only needs a blue belt for judo tournaments . For a class belt , get a higher quality one
5 #### I took my daughter to shoe store to have her try them on then I purchased her size on Amazon ! They run small- normally a 12 had to get a 1.5 . No issues , these shoes are durable
5 #### This is my fourth pair of grey chucks . It 's my everyday shoe as they 're cute and go with anything casual . My normal shoe size it an 8.5 but they run a little big so I always order an 8 .
2 #### The wallet is nice , has lots of pockets , but it 's a little stiff , and the snap closure on the coin purse will NOT stay shut . I 'm constantly ending up with a bunch of coins in the bottom of my purse . UGH !
5 #### excellent material made , i used few times and do n't rust it yet .
5 #### I work construction ... which is vague because different crafts put their gear to different types of abuse . I 'm a carpenter and for the last 9 years I 've been working with large building foundations and large types of concrete formwork . So I spend all day on my feet , walk in mud , walk on slabs , kick rebar and climb it too . These may cost a lot and I 'd be better off with a cheaper pair of boots but nothing fits and feels quite the way these do . So every once in a while I treat my feet to a pair of the Rain Forest specials . This time I went all out and got the Super Rain Forest . If you walk on slabs a lot then you might be better off with a non - Vibram soled boot because the finished concrete chews up the Vibram soles in a matter of a few months . The leather holds up somewhat decently on these provided you keep it greased with Danner boot dressing provided you are n't kicking formwork or climbing rebar curtains a lot . These are great boots to have if you 're in the dirt and mud all day long . I managed to get 11 months out of these before the soles were shot . The leather did get a hole in it but they did n't absolutely come apart like a cheaper Danner Knock - Off boot would .
4 #### Great home defense idea . Hopefully will never have to use .
4 #### Basic lightweight sweat shorts , a bit bulky on top due to the ribbing . Comfortable . Nice and long . Requires drawstring to be tied for running .
5 #### Kept my neck warm while snowboarding , a must have !
4 #### I love mine but it needs the base unit ! ! I forgot what it was called and am still searching for it .
5 #### Just as described , thank you . I would order this again .
5 #### Nice base set ! I bought the cheaper throw down base before , but they fell apart after a couple practices . This set lasted the whole season and will even get some use for a couple more seasons ! Great product ! Stays in place too !
5 #### Shoes arrived just as expected and I am happy with the purchase price and quality of service !
3 #### Update After a Year : This inflatable mattress does not hold up to prolonged use . I 'm sick of tracking down seem leaks etc . I use this maybe one weekend or so a month and it seems to be more trouble than its worth now . I do like this but I have to say it does not last . Original Review : I wish there was no pillow portion to this camping mattress or at least a separate compartment from the main mattress . If it was a separate inflatable or nonexistent this would be a 5 star product . The problem is when your body is laying on the mattress the pillow area is very stiffly inflated because there is no separation from the main portion of the mattress . However , for what it is it works great . I keep it rolled up in a sleeping bag and in the back of my car . I have used this numerous times both on house floors and inside tents . It takes a while to blow up without any kind of compressor but it is possible . I have bought a second one of these since purchasing this first one . It comes with a patch in the box incase of small holes .
5 #### I got this on Amazon for $ 9 ( and with Prime free shipping ) . I take my basketball very seriously and this ball has good grip , comes inflated , and feels nice . But then again at $ 9 its an amazing value and does n't feel cheap at all .
5 #### Everyone loves Keens , got these for my hubby for fathers day , unfortunately these seem to run a bit narrow so we had to return them . He wears normal sizes ( not wide ) .
4 #### I GAVE THEM 4 STARS BECAUSE NOW THAT SOME OF THE TONGUES ON THESE BOOTS COME ATTACHED PRETTY FAR UP THAN USUAL IT IS VERY HARD TO GET THEM ON . I HAVE TO HELP MY SON JUST ABOUT EVERY TIME HE WEARS THEM . I HAVE THE 6IN WOMEN 'S PREMIUM WHEAT ONE 'S AND THEY ARE MADE THE SAME WAY AND EVEN I HAVE A HARD TIME . BUT THE QUALITY OF THESE NEVER DISAPPOINT I BUY HIM A PAIR OR 2 ( DIFFERENT COLORS ) EVERY YEAR . FIRST TIME PURCHASING THE HELCOR STYLE THOUGH . BUT THEY SEEM TO BE HOLDING UP MUCH BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL . ONCE THOSE GET STAINED IT IS OVER FOR THEM .
4 #### It 's bigger than what I had imagined but it a nice toy for the kid . Give my son what 's involved in a swiss army knife .
4 #### I use 2 of these to tether my pontoon boat to my dock . they work well and do stretch allowing the boat to move with the current For my use , they were a bit long and I have to wind them a bit to keep the boat from being too loose .
1 #### I am not uniquely relying on these fine docklines to keep my 20 footer in place - but i believe they are a good alternative to standard docklines to keep your boat in place without meters of line to wrap up . I do however rely on a dockline+ snubber combination for the crucial attachments . Nylon wears out fairly quickly when attached to metal , but ca nt say that any of the lines i own broke yet . EDIT : During the last autumn winds breezing over our island in the past days , 2 of these docklines just snapped ! Not stretched - they literally snapped . Luckily i did not rely on them to keep my boat at the slip and had 3 other old fashioned .6 ropes in place - otherwise it would now be floating over to Jersey . Do not rely on them - will never buy this junk again . Good for calm sea and no wind , but if you want a reliable dockline - and frankly that 's what you need - DO NOT BUY THIS .
5 #### Beautiful watch , great finish , great looks . Tried it but to small for me , so gave it to my wife . Already order a bigger model for me .
5 #### I have several AmeriBag Healthy Back Bag totes in X - Small and Medium sizes . I like this X - Small because it is comfortable to wear and holds what I need . It also forces me to leave behind the random quite unnecessary things I only think I might need . I love the Apple Green color , but I also have red , light blue , yellow and beige . What a great bag for one who , like me , has had back surgeries and needs to keep the weight of any bag off my shoulder ! Thanks , AmeriBag !
4 #### If you do n't have a proper - sized jag for a barrel that needs a patch , this is the next best thing . Might be a little easier for certain tasks involving less dirt but demanding more freedom of movement than a jag 's fitted , uni - directional approach .
5 #### This was the exact wallet I was looking for ! It holds everything neatly and orderly ... and fits in every purse I own .
5 #### Love these shoes , especially the black on black . Very comfortable for running around all day in .
5 #### Good value , good service and just what I wanted . Very compact and perfect for travel .
5 #### Use this frequently . Very well made . Zero signs of wear after 1 year . Roommate tried them and said that they 're way better than the ones at his gym , and he 's paying $ 40 / mo . Ha !
3 #### Was thinner than tin foil . Served the purpose of our camping trip but had to throw away after it .
5 #### fits a surefire g2 nitrolon perfectly . either bezel up or bezel down , it holds securely either direction . there is a positive engagement of the retention device too so you know when your light is " hooked " . also holds the other " clones " of the g2 or 6p .
5 #### love these shoes . use them to workout inside and to work
5 #### Works better than I would have thought , does n't leak works well .
5 #### This was bought for my son who is 5yo . He was able to ride a bike . I do not understand the 12yo rating .
4 #### A very nice looking watch for the price . The " indigo " light is a bonus .
5 #### I wear a 12.5 and got a 13 . It fits perfectly and is clearly a GREAT shoe for martial arts training needs .
4 #### These are a good medium grade goggle . They do n't have an adjustable nose strap so you do want to try them on someplace before buying through Amazon . Unfortunately I set them in my gym bag and they did get hit and plastic lens broke so in line for a second . I will most likely look for the blue tint as it was great in the sun .
5 #### Great watch for the price if you do n't need macho or fashion . I just bought my second , having had the first for about five years . The glass has lasted well with only one visible scratch and I do a fair bit of DIY and mechanics . I bought a new one because the old one must be near the end of its second battery and the strap is shot at last . Battery and good strap is almost the same price as a new watch , so . . .. Easy to read dial and date in light . The Indiglo dial is perfect for time in the dark but you ca n't see the date . I use hotels a lot , and when I wake in the night the dial provides enough light to find my way in the unfamiliar room without having to turn on a light . Even using the dial like that as a flashlight the battery lasts a couple of years . So I now have two of these , too sad to toss the old one that still works perfectly well ! Maybe I 'll grind the strap lugs off and use it on my motorcycle . Remarkably , the two have maintained time 15 seconds apart for over a week now !
4 #### For the money it 's a 5 star . But compared to Uggs , straight up , not quite as good . But Uggs cost almost five times as much and are not even twice as good . These are warm , look exactly like the Uggs and are the same height sitting side by side . As everyone points out these are exactly one size smaller than claimed . I wear a 10 1/2 . So I got a 12 ( as these do n't come in half sizes ) . They are slightly to big but I can compensate with socks . An 11 would definitely have been to small . The interior of the boot is the kind of fake fur you would normally find in a glove , not the nappy wool found in Uggs . It 's not as thick as wool ( but it is warm ) . I doubt that these will last for years as the Uggs did . But for the price.these are very good . These boots have a tread on the sole and when you walk you can feel the tread design- it is annoying if you want to walk any distance in them , but around the house it 's fine . I got my wife a pair- she wears a woman 's size 10 and we got her the men 's 10 . It is just slightly to big , but again perfect if you wear socks with them
4 #### very good for what it is , but it 's not adjustable - meaning you 'd need to buy many of these over the years . there are excellent adjustable ones out there . My favorite : GD Iron Grip Adjustable Hand Gripper , EXT 90
5 #### I use it to seal my snorkeling mask while skin diving . It seal the mask well to my face with very little leakage
5 #### Love all of my Neatnix products for organizing my jewelry . Well made and looks nice . I have had no problems with it and it looks great with all my other Neatnix organizers .
4 #### i needed a replacmenet dart board and this one was just what i wanted . i can recommend this
5 #### My son loved them and at a half size bigger than his shoe size it fit perfectly
1 #### This reel malfunctioned right out of the box . The anti reverse would not work and the reel would hang up when trying to reel the line in . I sent it back ! ! !
5 #### These are seriously the most comfortable shoes ever . They are also durable and CUTE . I already have these in black and wore them non - stop so I decided the get the tan ones . Everyone noticed these and want to get a pair themselves haha
3 #### This is a nice leather wallet with one BIG drawback . If you fill about half of the credit card slots , you can not close the wallet ! Therefore , the additional card insert is almost useless unless you plan to put single business cards in the additional slots . So , do n't be deceived , the " Double Cardex " is NOT intended for credit cards , it should be used for business cards .
1 #### My daughter got a blister from the heal part of the shoe .
1 #### Do n't buy any Razor products except for their original scooter . Their customer service is non existent . If they believed in their products you would be able to buy and return them at a retail store like any other product . You would not have to sign off that you will not return it to the store . After the success of their original scooter they took their brand name and tried to squeeze every bit of profit out of it that they could . Razor does not mean quality to the many people screwed by their products .
5 #### I suffered from Tennis elbow . Yes , note the past tense . I ' suffered ' . I 've used this consistently for around 4 months doing the so called ' Tyler Twist ' ( look it up , it 's all over the net ) and yes , if you use this consistently and properly , it will improve tennis elbow . I 'd call mine 95 % gone and that 's amazing . Try and work out a little , and do some mild stretching also , and the results will be quicker . If you buy this , then use it as a doorstop or something ( which I was guilty of for the first two weeks ) , then it 's probably not going to cure your tennis elbow . I would call this an essential purchase .
5 #### Great shoe for a great price . This is my 2'nd pair of leather K siwss . I still own the other pair but they are now 7 years old and looking a bit worn . I ordered another pair because I knew they too would be great quality .
4 #### I really like the show have to keep them clean
5 #### I 've bought three sets of these things and love them ! I , unfortunately , lost my first set when I was living overseas and bought another one when I came back home and ca n't imagine using another brand . The quality is fantastic . The bands themselves are very resilient and last a very long time . I have n't had one snap on me yet ( and yes , I have had that with other brands , like Gold 's Gym ) and am very happy with everything BMP includes in the bag . It 's very easy to swap out bands , I really appreciate the cheat sheet the include to see the different what resistances is equivalent to what weight , although I wish they would upload a PDF copy of it to their site . I 've recommended this set to my friends and have bought one as a present for someone who was starting fitness for the New Year . Great product all around !
5 #### purchase them as a gift . Never heard a complaint . They stays indoors at the table to look at the wild life that passes by in the yard .
4 #### It works okay for throwing knives ( in other words ... they stick if you throw them effectively ) however the fibers do n't heal very well after the blade penetrates the board several times . With darts they work fine , however I 'd recommend buying better quality darts ( Amazon is your friend ) . The board itself is quite heavy and has metal rings around every circumference . Looked as though I were carrying spare bike wheels when I packaged this thing up and gifted it to a friend .
5 #### Love the color and fit . I use them to work on at the gym on the treadmill and they are very light and comfortable .
5 #### Great small bag with lots of pockets and compartments . It even has a padded zippered pocket for a tablet or e - reader . Size is perfect for an everyday bag to carry everywhere .
5 #### Did exactly what I thought they would . Which is , be shoes . I am still wearing them and probably will continue to wear them for some time .
5 #### Nice singlet . Tomahawk Open champion , 138 pound middle school , in it 's debut .
4 #### I used to use petroleum jelly on the O ring for my whole house water filter . But then an expert told me that petroleum jelly is bad for the O rings . So I purchased this . It seems to go on good and makes a good seal . And if it allows me to go through * less * O rings throughout the years then it is a cost saver for me . I wonder if it comes in a larger container though ?
1 #### I ca n't believe I ignored the negative reviews hoping this would save me some money . This is the first negative review I have ever written . I installed them , I could hear it sucking air from the tank end and when it finally pumped gas in it poured gas all over my motor and dripped to the ground . This product does NOT work ... 1 star is generous , waste of money ..
5 #### Bought this for a 22 Magnum handgun and it works fine .
5 #### Love love love . Pink goes with EVERYTHING ! Will buy again !
5 #### Plain white unisex is great ! Product is just what you expect . No surprises . Reliable .
4 #### its ok , I thought it would be louder . I also purchased Binboll Servival double Tubes which are significantly louder
5 #### Use the bands for all kinds of exercises . Daughter bought an additional set for traveling and use in hotels without a gym ,
5 #### I love the color and look of this wallet , but it is more like a clutch . It does n't have a good checkbook area , or a little plastic divider for duplicate checks , but otherwise is very nice .
3 #### my daughter loved her boots they fit true to size and she could not even more happy with them .
5 #### Seems funny to write a review for something as inanimate as a fishing rod holder , but it does exactly what it is supposed to . Great Berkeley quality , made in USA , it 's mounted out of the sun , so it should last forever .
5 #### Great rings for a great price . I am using them with my tasco pronghorn 3 - 9x40 mm scope .
2 #### Bought these for work . I 'm 6 foot but these shorts made me look like a gang banger from the 90s . They are extremely long . But the fit is right just the latest they go down past your calves .
4 #### Great quality . Cheaper than what you would pay in store . Runs a little big .
4 #### I use this at the gym when lifting . Keeps you grounded . What 's not to like about Converse ? An all - American classic ( except for the made in Vietnam part ) .
5 #### Great product . Solid and durable lapel pin . Go Big Red !
5 #### Received within 3 days to replace a " worn out " one . It is attached to my golf cart which is beautiful . Our US flag on the " facing the cart " left and the Mizzou on the right . In 5 years will order another . Thank you for swift shipping ! ! ! ! !
5 #### My husband loves the big numbers , so he can see the time .
1 #### Absolute crap , terrible material , leak developed first day in pool , do not buy
5 #### Amazing goal for the cost ! ! ! SOOOO worth it ! You will not be disappointed with this goal !
5 #### Used in Yellowstone to give my an up close look of everything . Worked nice ! !
4 #### Would have given five stars if caps were n't loose . I was aware of this before purchasing from reading other reviews . Great for watching the creatures in our back yard . Easy to focus !
4 #### Well made as I would expect from Capezio . Fits well and looks good . It 's a little heavier than I would want for hot humid weather , but it 's good for spring and fall . As ridiculous as it sounds , they 're also just dressy enough so you do n't look like a total slob when you match them with a nice top and shoes .
4 #### The shoes look great , but the sizes definitely run big . I am typically an 8.5 womens , it was recommended that I go a half size down . So I got the 8 , but they are still a tad too big , I could have went a whole sized down to a 7.5 .
4 #### Expensive but lasts longer than the cheap Gan2 shoes you get at wallyworld . Toe robber is starting to come off but still holding strong . I like the look / style , no strings attached .
5 #### I bought this one and a gray version of the same kind . I would give the same review as i gave the other one . This is a stylish wear . I would highly recommend it
5 #### Great price fast shipping just what I need one key for all my locks Thank You
5 #### These are classically flat , hard soled shoes . Do not expect any support , however if you are shoe minimalist and you want to use them for dead lifting & squats instead of lifting shoes ... they are awesome ! Plus , you will look cool wearing a classic shoe doing your reps at the gym . * * * Fun fact : The high - top version are great to use for scuba diving instead of traditional neoprene booties ! * * *
3 #### A little small for a tall person and quite difficult to get inflated but it works well for the price .
3 #### The shoes look terrific . They seem well built . But , even though I usually wear an 11 in Keen , I think I probably should have ordered a 10.5
5 #### As always , Merrel fits perfect and provides great support . Slip on makes it so easy to get moving quickly . Worth the cost for sure .
5 #### Exactly as described . A must - have for any fisherman 's tackle box .
5 #### This Boker is one of two of the most beautiful knives . The green , bone & gold bolter quality is through the roof . If you want to see the # 1 Boker look up the pearl handle version . PS . Love Amazon for having all the knives in one pLace .
5 #### i am looking forward to using this ... it looks like a lot of fun . Just have not gotten aroud to putting it together yet .
1 #### What the heck was this ? It was a bamboo pole that was cracked with some weeds attached at the end . The size is less than a yard stick . Not a good buy . Very poor construction .
4 #### I have wide feet and these were too narrow but very nice looking .
3 #### I supposed these are ok but because they seem bigger and look uglier than my existing pair I have never worn them . Price and specs were pretty good if I remember .
3 #### This was so cute for my 6 year old , with the tassels and the bell . She loves it , but I was super disappointed that the tassels came off with in hours of her opening the box . She did not yank on them , they just pulled out . They just are n't well attached at all ! Aside from that , it is a good scooter for a child . But if it is the tassels that you love ( as I did ) , then you might be disappointed .
5 #### These shirts are what my husband wears for construction work . They are thicker than a normal t - shirt and hold up and wash up really well . They fit as expected and the colors we ordered were nice . ( Red , Orange , Army Green ) Package and delivery was good too . Will definitely buy them again !
5 #### they are very comfortable feel like you have nothing on .
5 #### These shoes were everything I was hoping they would be ! Very true to color ( a vibrant tiffany blue ) and they fit true to size . They are super comfortable and I wear them everywhere . I have had these shoes for about a year now and they are still my favorite .
5 #### did n't know how it would work at first , crappie , blue gill , bass all loved it
4 #### I wish I had started with this mat . I started with cheap mats because I did n't want to spend the money . I figured all yoga mats were the same . They are not ! ! I had to go through 3 mats before finding this one . This mat is unbelievably grippy . My hands sweat during practice and this is the only mat where I have not slipped . It 's almost the perfect mat . I 'm actually about to upgrade to the Pro which is longer . The only reason I did n't give this mat 5 stars is because I feel like it could be thicker and longer / wider . This mat has been nothing but awesome . I wash it once a week in tea Tree oil soap . It dries quickly and never loses grip . I waited to leave a review because I know some mats lose grip or stain over time . Not this mat . I have been using this mat 6 - 7 days a week for 6 months and it 's even better than when I first bought it . It does smell at first . I suggest leaving it outside for a night to air out and washing it really well when you first purchase . Starting yoga ? Start here .
5 #### Anytime you use a Jitterbug , expect a great day of bass fishing . I fish 5 set - ups when I bass fish . The jitterbug ( in calm water ) produces more hits than any other rig . WORK IT SLOWWWW !
5 #### Great outdoor and hunting clothing ! ! ! I need a new set every few but I really work them ! ! !
2 #### fabric it cheep . I ordered black It is more grey . This is not something I am going to where to stay warm and try to look nice in . It definitely does not look nice , bad color , bad fabric , and fuzzy stuff all over it .
5 #### The patch is on the opposite side of shoe not like picture ( advertised )
5 #### Just recived it . Took a long time about two weeks . Have not used it because we have no snow ( sucks ) . Thought the quality seems really good . Very tough not flimsy . It 's also very deep . I want it to pull my kids with while I 'm on the fourwheeler . Should be great over the snow and little water and keep them dry .
5 #### This product is great fits great and I love the color of these hose thank you so much .
5 #### These shorts are wonderful ! Perfect just above the knee length , not too tight , not too loose . They are of a moderate weight , so you 're covered . They wash and dry beautifully , without shrinking . These shorts are true to size , so order your normal size for a perfect fit . You can exercise and move in them without the " bagging out " effect . They are just nearly perfect , including the price !
5 #### Very well made . Light weight material . A bit hard to button and unbutton .
5 #### After purchasing dozens of these shirts over the years , it 's time to write a very satisfied review . Very comfortable and quite durable shirts . Been through so many washes and they just hold up so well . Been a go to t - shirt purchase for a long time . Love 'em .
5 #### Excellent , Quick delivery ! Daughter loves them . Easy to clean and fit perfect . There Converse- that says it all
5 #### Is a very good item . My son was very happy .
5 #### This was easy to install and works perfectly with my child 's bike ( 12 " ) .
5 #### I have used this product for years . Put some in the toes of your hunting socks and it will keep your feet dry as you walk to your stand . This translates to not getting cold toes due to perspiration . I find I can sit all day on stand now due to dry toes with my feet staying warm with 600 gram thinsulate rubber boots down to 20 degrees . 10 degrees with 800 gram boots . insulation does nothing to help against sweaty toes getting cold in cold weather . The reviewer that said this makes their toes sweat probably had way to much insulation in their boots . The powder ca n't make your toes sweat , heat does that . This prevents the perspiration and keeps you on stand longer . Am buying another bottle to replace my original one .
1 #### I bought these thinking it would be easier to dock with some nice stretchy ropes . They have been nothing but trouble . First , they are too short . Makes it difficult to throw them to your buddy on the dock until its too late . Next they tighten down by themselves since they are stretchy . Sounds nice , but a few times they almost needed to be cut off the cleats . My buddies laugh at me when they are trying to tie these down to the dock and I tell them you have to do it a certain way or we wo n't be able to get them off . I m going to switch back to normal rope next season .
5 #### I have been looking for a watch with indigo lighting , metal band and the date on the dial , for a long time . I was thrilled when I saw this watch . It is described as elevated ..... I had no idea what that meant . The watch is elegant and perfect , it does not stick up high . The dial and surrounding metal pieces are the prefect size . It you have poor eye sight , you must understand the the hour and minute hands are not large and not black . Of course , I have to bring it to my jeweler to have the wrist size fixed .
5 #### A great classic for the right price and the fit is perfect , although you have to order at least a half size smaller .
5 #### I never considered buying a bra through the mail because I felt to get a true fit , you should try on , but this bra is perfect fit , great price and lovely ! I 'm 100 % happy with my purchase thru the mail and will buy more bras this way . Highly recommend ! Annemarie C.
5 #### These Rod holders are bomb proof , and are the best quality holders I have found . The have virtually infinite mounting options , and will last forever .
2 #### Bought 3 shirts , green , ash and brown . All XLT . Being 6'5 '' 230lbs I need a long shirt . I ordered Carhartt shirts just because the brand name . The green one fits perfect , it hangs in the middle of my pant pockets ( right where I like it , hides the butt crack ) . The upper fit is perfect , not to tight and does n't hang off me . Now the ash shirt , This shirt hangs right were the green one does . But the upper is more of a large . Its really tight on my arms and its uncomfortable . And now the Brown . This shirt fits just like my XL shirts . It hangs to my belt . the upper is tight . These shirts are heavy . They are really hot . Not a bad thing during winter but when its 90F out they 're a little to warm . The green one was made in Honduras . The brown and ash one were made in Haiti . To bad they do n't make more products in the US any more . They wo n't last long , most of my Carhartt clothing does n't last a year . I gave 2 stars because only 1 of 3 shirts fit . Shirts form Walmart last longer . Cheap junk .
5 #### Just because they are white , they do need a washing regularly but I have received many compliments on how pretty these white and pink shoes are . Extremely good Nike quality . Highly recommended .
1 #### If you do n't mind shooting without the tips and knocks this product is for you . Arrow tips popped off in side the boy 's youth target when he pulled them out . Not sure why the knocks fell off . Get the Genesis youth arrows .
4 #### I bought the HB 22 for pest control ( fruit rats and ground squirrels ) and it has proven to be well suited to the task . It 's accurate up to 30 yards and shoots really flat using the standard Crossman .22 cal pellets . With 6 pumps there 's plenty of stopping power as well . The sights are a little crude and I might change these out eventually . The shape of the pistol lines up perfectly with a small flashlight ( I use a Streamlight Scorpion ) for night shooting . It 's reasonably quiet as well .
5 #### My eyes do n't do the job they have in years past . The # 2 Lyman tang sight on my 339s 35 Remington Marlin gives me clear sight pictor and puts meat on the table . It makes shooting fun again and I shoot a lot year around .
5 #### Comfortable to wear for an under - wire bra and affordable too . I probably should have gotten a cup sized bigger , but it is still wearable . I like that I can adjust the straps from the front too . Yes , this is a classic bra , but since it is still being made , that says something about the quality , fit and affordability of it . I Love It !
5 #### Finally some place to put my bracelets that keeps them from getting tangled and easy to find . I was delighted .
1 #### I 've been buying lots of shorts recently without decent pockets , so I bought this wallet . This has an elastic band which you stretch to get the thing around your wrist or ankle . There is a small velcro pocket which is not big enough for a whole wallet . Mine came with a couple of plastic ziplock bags that are just the right size for one to three credit cards . The very first time I wore this seriously this summer for a few hours when I went shopping , I ended up having both my credit cards and spare key drop out without me recognizing it . I figure that the problem is ( 1 ) the velcro closure does n't clearly show that it is closed securely and ( 2 ) The ankle is a very active part of the body , and if you 're very physically active , stuff can be jostled out easily , ( 3 ) when things drop out , they are too far away from your ear , and so close to the ground that you ca n't hear them drop . A zipper or a button closure would be a lot better .
5 #### My husband looks so great in these shirts . They are extra thick . He has had them for 2 seasons now & they wash & look wonderful ; no shrinking , no twisting of fabric .
4 #### Hard to see if you drop them in the water . We lost a pair this way cause we did n't know they fell in the pool at our condo .
5 #### I love the shoe and it fit as expected the photos and description are accurate if you 're looking for a shoe that has more cushion or support try a different style but as far as wanting a lightweight and breathable shoe this is it . I am very satisfied with this purchase
1 #### I 've been on a quest for a decent jewelry case for travel . This is n't it . It is very cheap and flimsy . Smells funky . You get what you pay for , or in this case , LESS than what I paid for .
5 #### These are the only sneakers my daughter wears , she is fully grown and we already know her size . They are very popular so the stores always seem out of her size or color , so online ordering is awesome !
5 #### Overall : Highly recommend for car camping Pros : durable enameled steel exterior easy to set up and operate compact Cons : flame control / adjustment not great Purchased this stove for car camping as I was sick of using a backpacking stove for cooking meals . Car camping allows for added luxury like this coleman stove . I am very happy with this stove , as it has a nice heavy solid feel , and seems very well constructed . The heat output is n't fantastic , but it does the job and managed to boil water in a decent amount of time in 40F and windy conditions . As others have mentioned , the flame adjustment is n't the greatest , but then again most camping / backpacking stoves are n't either . Love this stove , highly recommend and would buy again .
5 #### Tired of buying low - priced and discount panty hose and having them tear or my toe going through on first wear . These are definitely top quality and do n't rip when pulled up with normal handling . Will be purchasing more .
5 #### GOOD FISHING LINE THE GREEN REALLY HELPS IT BLEND IN RESULTING IN MORE BITES .
5 #### So easy to put together since it 's already assembled . Right out of the box and spin the wheel . Slides easily even on carpet . Just wish my flexibility was moving along faster ....
5 #### Make sure you get them long enough- thought I had them long enough , I did not- awesome product !
5 #### This is a good product , but it is an RCBS , and works as any quality product .
5 #### It was purchased for a 22 and so I wanted low to fairly high power range . It delivered that . I want AO scope , it also delivered that . Time may change my opinion , but right now I am extremely pleased with it
5 #### Good retention . Easy on / off compared to the tuck style holsters like the Alien ware . I prefer it when I know I need to disarm for specific locations and environments . Unlike the tuck style holsters which require a visit to a restroom to rearm properly and discreetly . Just as comfortable as the tuck holsters . Buy it and buy a real gun belt regardless of your holster choice ...
5 #### Like the fact that it can be taken apart quickly for storage when not in use .
5 #### Just what I was looking for . Right size and nice quality .
4 #### Good product , gets the job done and its got a handy compass that I have yet to use , but its there just in case !
5 #### Now that I have one I find uses for it all the time . Like it a lot .
5 #### A great tarp , we used it on our recent camping trip and kept things clean under and inside the tent .
5 #### My daughter is crazy about these shoes ! It 's an added plus that they arrived before the scheduled due date . Will order more .
1 #### The y where size men and I wanted a women
5 #### What a great Shirt ! Heavy weight thick cotton material . Feels extremely durable ( and a hair stiffer than a normal T - shirt ) . Stitching heavyweight . Pocket placement and size are as expected . I own 4 of these in various colors ( bought two initially , then two more since I was so impressed ) . One of the few easy options for Tall sizes .
3 #### Ordered my usual size but these are much too big . Otherwise as expected . Maybe it 's my age but why are plain sneakers so expensive ?
5 #### Love these shoes , I have worn them all day and found them really comfortable with no aching feet at the end of the day . Fantastic colour and true to size . I also bought Nike Women 's Flex Supreme Tr 3 Pnk Pw / Mtllc Slvr / Cl Gry / White Training Shoe and these shoes are slightly more comfortable than those even though they look very similar .
5 #### My nephew love it . And I loved I got it soo cheap . I got it for $ 20 on a 1 day christmas sell .
1 #### I was wet , cold , and very tired that night I spent on the mountain . I shaved off a pile of this to start my fire . It goes " poof " when the spark hits it . I never got a fire started , all the wood around was wet . What I have used with 100 % success is Fire Ribbon . It is in a tube like toothpaste . It will burn while floating in water . It also burns along time . I now carry a half used tube ( smaller that way ) in my kit . It always , alway lights .... Is about $ 3.00 at REI . Happy trails ...
5 #### These slip on Mocs are great . The sizing is always on target and they are quite comfortable . I live nearby a Merrell outlet and I find that Amazon pricing is competitive .
5 #### Best frisbee we e ever purchased ! ! ! ! ! Works better than perfect ! Easy to use and goes very far ! ! !
5 #### Great nylons . Great price . I do n't know how they wash as I treat nylons as one time use only items , but overall , I 'm very pleased .
5 #### THIN is the definitive work here ! Also elegant and classic . My husband collects watches and this is by far his favorite . While the clasp is sometimes a bit challenging to link , he still fumbles thru it because he loves this Skagen Watch so much !
4 #### The 4 stars is because the knife is so small - smaller than I thought it would be . It flips open nicely and looks cool etc . but it 's just really SMALL . That said , the small size allows it to be clipped to the inside of my trousers completely unnoticeably and it has been very useful . I think that I may order the Flash II - the same thing but larger , 5 stars will be likely . The locking mechanism is great . I love this knife despite the size . ~ K
4 #### Wow ! I paid $ 67 for this exact watch on Amazon just a few weeks ago ! I was shocked to see that the current price is $ 112.50 . It 's a great watch at $ 67 , not quite as good at the higher price - note that CostCo sells them for $ 69.95 . The links are truly a bear to remove . I suspect that the link removal device sold on Amazon may not work due to the particular design of these links . You have to push the linking device out from inside the band rather than from the outside edge of the band .
5 #### Versatile , sturdy , and able to make your own resistance by clipping as many together as you want . I 've had them for two plus years and used them alot . Will be taking these to travel with me .
5 #### As far as I 'm concerned Keen makes the most comfortable shoes I 've ever worn and these are absolutely the best Keen sandals I 've tried . I can wear these all days long ( and do ! ) What else can you say about perfection
5 #### I have used these silicone cloths for years , and I really like them . Good Product .
1 #### Really hard to determine size with these . The options are kind of ridiculous . Too big and I even used a previous pair of these to order the same size . Waste of money for me to have to spend to ship back .
5 #### I am very happy with the fit and quality of these . I purchased to wear under my karate Gi . They fit well - wash well and wear well .
5 #### This will set off your Husbands Man 's Cave with PURE Class ... Every one admires it even the RAIDER haters . We almost want a " Do Not Touch sign near it . Even can not believe the high quality of the product . May others should be ordering this one , because everyone who comes to our house asked about where did we get it . True BLACK & SILVER , Authentic look , its perfect .
5 #### Its like good quality ( as far as i know its my first for one of these ) and works just as it should .
3 #### Definitely just a cheap item to get you through Halloween . The " stick " is actually like a thick cardboard tube Yes , it 's hallow ) , and the bristles shed . It is only about 4 feet tall , so walking with it was a little awkward .
1 #### Plugged it in on a newer and an older Macbook , literally nothing happened .
5 #### Got the first scope and was very displeased . The cross hairs was scattered . I return it for another one . ( Thank you Amazon , Amazon send me a replacement before I was able to return the broken one ) . Second one is just great . Place the scope on my Smith & Wesson M&P15 - 22 and shoot thousands of rounds thru it and its still hold zero . Great Scope . Squirrels , be afraid . Be very afraid .
3 #### I have fairly wide feet , so was very surprised that these were too large . After this experience I went to a shoe store and found that I needed one whole size smaller in unisex , but my regular size in women 's . Although just the style I was looking for , I had to return due to size .
4 #### This was a gift . I have not heard good or bad .
5 #### I purchased these shoes for my husband in the gunsmoke brown color . They are very nice looking shoes . My husband says they fit him perfectly and are extremely comfortable to wear . In fact , he likes them so much that he will hardly take them off . I 'm planning to order him another pair in a different color soon .
5 #### Bought for my teenage son . He wears a 36x29 jean and large / xl shorts . They fit perfectly . Very warm .
5 #### They were a gift to my granddaughter and she loves them .
4 #### This watch is really nice and thin . It looks nice , but ... The pins connecting the band to the watch face have broken on me twice . They 're easy to replace , but an odd size . Overall , I like it , save that one problem .
5 #### It was a little bit small than I thought , but it fitted and we were very satisfied . I would recommend to buy for a three year old child .
5 #### This was a perfect fit on a savage mark ll rifle . These are sold individually so you will need to buy two packages .
5 #### Lightweight and keeps my bum off of rocks and stuff when hunting . Great seat !
4 #### It 's on the short side .. especially after a couple of washes . Get the Tall versions ... You 'll get better coverage .
3 #### I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED , I REALIZE THAT THIS TRICYCLE WAS MADE IN CHINA , HOWEVER IT SPORTS THE RADIO FLYER NAME A NAME MOST AMERICANS GREW UP WITH , THAT MEANT QUALITY , AND SOMETHING YOU COULD BE PROUD OF . I DON'T KNOW IF THE RADIO FLYER LOGO IS EVEN AMERICAN OWNED ANYMORE , IT 'S ALL ABOUT THE BUCK ........ SAD . ANYWAY THE DECALS ARE CROOKED THE PAINT JOB LOOKS LIKE MY GREAT GRAND DAUGHTER DID IT WITH A BRUSH . THE UNDERSIDE OF THE DECK IS ONLY HALF PAINTED , THIS IS PROBABLY INTENTIONAL SO IT WILL RUST OUT QUICKER ! BUT THIS POP POP IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THAT OVERSIGHT OR POOR QUALITY CONTROL WHICHEVER IS THE CASE . YOU CAN GET QUALITY ITEMS FROM CHINA YOU JUST HAVE TO HAVE QUALITY CONTROL MEASURES IN PLACE .
5 #### Was for my son . Very happy with the present . Fits grat and he look is awesome . Just what expected . Very happy
3 #### Love the front of the costume but the back is PINK . There is nothing but pink on the back
5 #### I really love these pantyhose . They fit comfortable . I will always buy these product .
5 #### I love chucks they are nice and fit just right . Highly recommended
1 #### The stockings appeared to be irregular . I actually ordered a size larger than normal and they were still too small .
4 #### It 's huge but I did n't get for wearing around but more for fun . Good quality for what I use it for but I would be up for getting an upgrade
5 #### First time ever in my life I the rest of me was cold before my feet ! I had been looking at these for 20 years . Finally bought them with my phone one day in a tree stand when I thought my feet were going to shatter like glass they were so cold . Not disappointed . Big and bulky but not heavy . Strapped them on my stand , slid them over my boots when I got up my tree , and good to go !
3 #### This thing is the most fun and frustrating thing I have ever bought . Getting a group of people together to take turns throwing this thing and looking like idiots is great ! I have thrown this boomerang , in all different speeds and orientations , around 500 times . We 've managed to throw it in such a way that it was catch - able only about 5 times . Fun , but frustrating .
5 #### I bought this for my three - year old son , and he loves it . I love that it 's sturdy ( and adjustable ) enough that I can even use it ( well , with only one foot on the board ) .
5 #### enjoyed very much with my children at the beach , watch out with the sea because will never find it anymore
5 #### I place this on my anatomy shooting targets and they compliment each other , now i can see where my bullets are hitting and i can now make adjustment to my shots even if i m far away . Holes are very visible . I recommend this to every shooter out there !
5 #### I give this item 5 stars because the quality is very good . the only problem I found is they run big . I normally wear a size 8 - 1/2 and I need a size 8 .
1 #### spent way too much time trying to put this is the magic spot so that I could see . anyway its garbage to me .
5 #### Great product and great work out . My kids enjoy trying to jump rope ( they are a bit little still ) . I think this will last us a long time and is a lot of fun .
5 #### I found the sight to be bright and easy to line up . The install was a little tricky and the packaging needs to be changed . The package contains very , very small parts loosely in the molded slot for them . So be careful when you open it and place a light colored cloth on a table to catch any rollers . The instructions do not say how to get those small nuts in the mount 's slots . It comes with a short and long screw set . My maverick needed the short screws to mount it to the rib . So I used the long screws and threaded those small nuts to them . Then pulled the screws to draw the nuts into the slot . I unscrewed the long bolts and then installed the short bolts , done .
5 #### Military grade . Dermatologist suggested a full sun protection hat . This is it .
5 #### Great Shoe . Well made and very stylish . I bought them for my son and he loves them . Fits pretty true to size .
4 #### A lot of pieces = a lot of options = can get cluttered and complicated . I use the red and black bands . I tried contacting the company to get the free orange band that they offer , but I never got a response . Perhaps they will see this review and send me the orange one . I currently use the red and black together . Not sure what the velcro loop is to used for .
5 #### I do n't have too much to say other than my husband loves these shoes ! I ordered the 11.5W , hoping they would fit , because he usually wears an 11.5 WW ( or triple E ) . But surprisingly they fit him quite well .
5 #### I ordered these for my size 8/10 year old son . They 're a bit long in the legs for him , and the neon green shows mud like you would n't believe , but his boots hold up the legs , and he 's stayed warm and dry throughout vacation . He 's only 7 , and has trouble with the buttons , velcro and zipper , but the adjustable waist is awesome . And he 's got room to grow , which is what I wanted- bigger than he needs , but not falling off him .
5 #### Looks pretty . It was a gift for my daughter 's birthday . She is very happy .
4 #### Fits my head a little loose , but that is better than being to tight . Great Quality , very well make .
5 #### These are replacing my 5 year old pair , that may wear out someday . I have 11 pair of Keens including 2 pair boots . They are the only shoes I do n't need orthotics with , do n't need any break in , & in 5 years of wear , are not worn out !
5 #### Good price for chucks , they 're one of my favorite shoes and reliable as they 've always been ! Would nt change a thing
5 #### These bands are really great , I do not mind changing bands on the handle and they are what I needed . My trainer has me working out with different resistance in the gym so these where great for my home gym to help build strength !
4 #### This was cool at first and definitely started to help but I think I 'm ready to move on to real gym chalk . Although it does n't seem to last , it does a decent job and is cheap . Helped with gripping the bar on heavier weights . I got it for the convenience , most of all .
5 #### I bought them for work to match my uniform and I love them . They are very comfortable !
5 #### I love my Merrell slip - on shoes . This is probably the sixth pair that I 've purchased . The size is perfect for me and the fit is snug but very comfortable . I 've used them on long car drives as well as long hikes without any discomfort .
3 #### I was hoping these would fit in my hubands dress shoes to keep his feet warm while outside directing cars at funerals . Unfortunately they are way too thick and can not be used for that purpose . They will be good for in his boots while hunting , etc .
1 #### First time my son wore them one of the eyelets fell out , very upsetting . The quality of products is so disappointing these days .
2 #### My son loves K Swiss , it 's what I have always known him to wear , so when he sent me a gift card I thought I would try a pair . The shoes looked great when they arrived but the first time I wore them which was to a meeting , I notice they hurt my heels . I was shocked to also find that my heals were bleeding . I did get to return them which I am grateful .
3 #### Unfortunately they do n't stay where you need them to stay , with or without a bra on .
5 #### I agree with other reviewers I would n't use this bag to sleep in freezing temperatures . I do not , however , find it difficult to put it back into its stuff sack . A very nice stuff sack , incidentally . The zippers are heavy duty . There is a draw string for pulling the hood tight but I have n't had to use that as yet . The nice thing about the hood is you can pack a pillow in there and it does n't slide out away from your head during the night . Nice feature . I 'm so used to annoying , irritating things happening with equipment while camping and it 's nice that this product actually seems to have been carefully thought out . Affordable quality . I 'm quite happy with this bag .
1 #### very good quality and very comfortable too . Once the water gets in -- even though I dried it the gloves became moldy inside ---will not buy it again
2 #### I returned these infant t shirts . the 6 - 9 mo size appeared to be newborn - 3 mo size . The bottom edge had a 1/2 inch hem that pulled it tighter than the body of the shirt ... meaning it would probably be too tight to easily pull on and off over an infant 's head and potential uncomfortable for the wearer . The fabric was not of the quality i preferred .
5 #### Purchased this for my coworker son . She stated that he loves it .
5 #### Daughter loves this Scooter . It does go pretty fast at top speed so a helmet is definitely needed . Would recommend . Not sure how long it will last but for the month we had it its working as intended .
2 #### Far too flimsy . As soon as the children began pretending to sweep the feathers flew off . But it will not be needed again .
5 #### My son in law loves the shirts . Great quality item . I know they will last . Arrived in time for holidays
5 #### Worked on a few really mean aggressive dogs out in the country . They attack walkers and riders and the owner and local law did n't care , but a few times in the butt and with the Dog Dazer II they are now behaving .
2 #### Dickies used to fit as advertised . Loosely . Originally men 's work wear that was adopted by the hip - hop community , Dickies is often made overseas now therefore the sizes are nowhere near accurate for the larger American male . I am 6 ' 1 " and 215 lbs . Men are not my size in Indochina . Time to move on from Dickies .
5 #### Already have Chucks in white , which I wore for the b - ball team in high school ... yeah , when Chucks were the shoes to be wearin ' ! ! Decided to re - live days of Sandlot Black PF Flyers with the magic wedge , make you run faster , jump higher ! But when I got them , they were about a 1/3 size too small and the shoes felt uneven ( one bigger than the other , both still tight ) . Thought I could wear them in and could n't . Chalked up to a loss . Paid less for black Chucks and they fit true to size ! Love these black Chucks ! GREAT PURCHASE ! ! Wonder what the difference is in the monochrome black . Anyone know ?
5 #### Great lifting shoes for the gym or for running around works .
5 #### This is a fantastic hat , a hidden compartment inside to hide the detachable rabbit ! ! ! Hat is also sizable with Velcro inside the hat . Keeps the shape very durable for my 6 year old magician !
3 #### I wish I would have ordered a size larger like other reviewers advised . The area on the waist and belly area is pretty tight , but I was able to get it to fit , however the cups for the bust are way too small . Not true to size what so ever . It is probably close to 2 cup sizes smaller than I ordered . The fabric seems like it 's good quality which is why I 'm leaving 3 stars .
3 #### I got this fit my daughter . It fit the purpose but the truth is the quality of the plastic where the jewelry is put in was not so good
5 #### Converse have always run a bit long , but I have very narrow feet , so I can buy one size too small which makes the width much closer and my toes do n't hit the end of the shoe . They do n't have any arch support anyway , so I throw in a pair of insoles , and they fit fine . They way they lace helps too .
5 #### Awesome costume ... Received many compliments . I have worn twice , once to school and once in the evening . Made very well . Washed and still looks great .
3 #### thought this would be a nice addition to my gear . until now did all of my cooking over a fire . good product for the money . I wish i would have gotten a 3 burner but for what i do , this works pretty well . controls were easy to use , heat settings were adjustable . I am happy with it .
4 #### I chose this glove because of the free shipping and low cost . It lasted a month or so and I do play rball 4 - 5 times per week .
5 #### I should have bought this years ago . Forget fooling around with the laser boresighters ... just suck it up and go with this one . Took minutes to boresight my scope . Went to the range to fine tune it , and within 5 shots , I was done . Well built , will last my lifetime .
5 #### Very strong and protective . When putting them on , my daughter liked to fall down suddenly to test them and we all had a good time .
5 #### Okay , so you 're not going to be the belle of the ball by a long shot in these sandals ... not even close ... but that 's not what they are intended for in the first place . I just joined a rowing team and everyone on the team highly recommended purchasing a pair of Keens . Our team color is purple , hence the color I selected ( they are not as " purple " as pictured ) . I took them out of the box , wore them around the house for a few hours , and was really surprised at how comfy they are . In fact , I forgot I had them on . There is n't that " newness " or " breaking in " phase . They fit perfectly -- and I did take the advice of others to order one half size up ( a definite ! ) . I love them !
3 #### Its a little tinny . But it will do the job nicely . Too bad that manufacturers ca n't make things like they once did .
1 #### I recently bought two pairs of these ! I was very dissapointed when I received them and I saw they were not original Feiyue shoes , but replicas . They are very similar but the shape is very diferent . The originals are more pointy and these are rather round ! I would have prefered to buy just one pair of original feiyue shoes than two replica pairs . I think AMAZON should be more careful on how they sell certain products . If not , in a couple of years you 'll buy an Ipad through amazon and you 'll get a chinese replica .
3 #### These fuel cubes are fairly decent , and are nice and compact for backpacking . They do have a very fishy smell to them . Also , the ratings for burn time / boil time are off a bit . Even under OPTIMAL conditions I think you would be hard pressed to get them to work as well as they say . For boiling water , I recommend using 2 fuel cubes .
5 #### It is heavy ! That is the only downside I can come up with . Very clear images . Saved me countless walks to the target to verify hits when zeroing my rifles . Tried to use it free hand but could not keep it on target . Once I had it mounted on a bench top tripod , it was awesome .
5 #### All of my friend who wear moc 's recommend Merrell . I had owned a pair years ago and I was very please with how long they lasted . I know that they are a great quality shoe . All of these points convinced me to order another pair . I order another pair from Amazon who had the best price and fast delivery . After I received the shoes I tried them on and they fit great and felt very comfortable . I wear them mostly for casual events going to the beach or the gym and running around town . They are a great shoe very comfortable and I would recommend them to anyone .
5 #### Exactly what my daughter wanted and they held up well .
4 #### This rifle scope is very good for the money . It holds the same point of impact no matter what power I set it on . That is more than I can say for my Redfield battle zone 2x7 rimfire scope which cost at least $ 70 more than the Tasco . I am also pleased with how clear it is . For light recoiling rifles I believe I would by another one of these Tascos .
1 #### Well made but the size is way off . About a size larger than size marked . I am returning them today .
5 #### These bands are great . I really like the removable handles vs. fixed handle bands . The orange band promotion is great too . I got mine the day after I called .
5 #### nice design - I ordered 3 of these , and they all came rolled up - so I had to iron them to get the brim to lay properly
5 #### Just the right size and protection for 9 year old with skinny legs , these fit perfect
5 #### My daughter LOVES this watch ! Great for new time readers !
5 #### Size is perfect , but this is also because I basically knew the size I need . The fabric is excellent and the degree of black color is very nice
5 #### I 've used it pretty strenuously for the last couple of years and it 's still smelling great Great product ! Great company . A++
5 #### I have owned a number of other compasses and never gave it much thought . Then with those compasses I cam into an area where I was concerned about my location . I have not checked the declination and struggled somewhat with location . I finally got out but swore I would research a product that had an adjustable declination and climb indicator . This Suunto is just that compass . It is well made and has many features for the price . The declination is adjustable with an attached small screwdriver and the climb indicator is accurate and easy to read . I highly recommend this compass !
5 #### I have flat feet so I love these ! I put Dr. Scholls sport in them and I wore them on a Disney and Universal Orlando vacation for 10 days and did n't have one problem . They are n't bulky and heavy and dorky like most running shoes .
5 #### This was one of those purchases that I wished could be replicated with all my purchases ! The shoes arrived on time , looked just like they were supposed to and fit me like a glove ! Kudos ! ! ! !
2 #### Comfortable shoe . First time I 've ever bought nikes that feel so large . It feels about 1/2 size too big . I bought 7.5 . I normally wear exactly that size and on occasion an 8 .
5 #### I wore these during an all - day trip to the zoo with shoes that do n't breathe . My sweaty feet were not wet or uncomfortable by the time I got home . May get another pair or two to remove snow on those cold days .
5 #### Very nice dock straps , have a pair and they work very well
5 #### Fits great and helps with my bone spurs has a good arch support
5 #### I purchased this scooter for my grandson . It was one of the daily deals at the time , and was at a great price . This product is made of quality material and will definitely stand up to the test of time and the abuse of a 6 year old active boy . If you are looking for a scooter for your child or grandson , I would definitely look into buying a razor . My son actually had one of these as a child too , and they definitely hold up and withstand the hardships of being owned by active boys , and I even still have that one at my house for back up when they are here .
5 #### I bought it for my wife who has very little feet . And it fit prefect with a size 5 feet in women .
1 #### I was really disappointed in the quality of this item and decided to return it . It is made of the same ( almost see thur ) thin material of a typical witches costume . The collar wo n't stand up right and ties in the back like a child 's costume . The white part of the collar is not as pictured . It is not as wide as shown and was frayed , not hemmed . It 's made of the same thin material as the black fabric . It also fit kind of snug and I 'm fairly fit at 5'11 , 179lbs . The length was good for my height , but that 's the only positive comment that I have to make . Wish it was better quality !
5 #### This is the ONLY bra I have found that fits my figure and is able to hold me up in full comfort . A lot of my breast is under my arm , and this strong , comfortable material puts it back where it belongs -- front and center . It is as comfortable as a support bra . I can never find my size at the department store , so buying my hard - to - find size on Amazon was so easy . And I can order my size in white , black or beige . Amazon is where I will buy this bra from here on out .
1 #### Ordered 9(m ) received 9 Wide for the second time . Returned them for the second time .
3 #### It is very hard to see where you are hitting ( that s why a 3 not a 5 ) , but if you are just throwing lead down range these are great !
5 #### Love these shoes the fit is great . Have n't had converse tennis shoes in years glad they r in style again .
5 #### These run a little larger than I expected . I usually wear an 11 womens in Nikes or Adidas , so that s what I ordered in these . They were a full size too large . Returning for a smaller size .
4 #### My daughter loves Abby from Sesame Street so I ordered these hats for her birthday party . They fit nicely on young children 's heads as well as adult 's . They were a little expensive but it is very hard to find Abby party supplies so it was worth it to see the look on my daughter 's face when she saw these .
5 #### Good fit and comfy . Not so cushiony so definetly better for training and not for running or aerobics . Bought size 8 which is my usual size .
5 #### This mattress is worth the money , it takes a little time to inflate , and to get the air out after you are done with it . no problems with holes , and it stayed inflated for the three days that we used them camping .
5 #### Really protects your long guns in a safe where things have gotten a bit tight from bumbs , scratches and such . Especially if you have one or more AR 's . Highly reccomend ! ! I have them on most of my handguns as well ( not this size of course ) .
5 #### Simple and perfect for my family with enough incase a guest or two comes along extra . Easy to clean and everything stacks in large pot .
5 #### It 's not the loudest but I it does the job . And the compass works just fine . It also installs very easily , needing just a philips head screwdriver .
5 #### Got this for my ten year old , he is very happy with the fit and style . Size is adjustable and seems to fit well . Love the colors .
5 #### I have had this band set now for a few weeks and I have to say they are a great way to avoid getting fat while working as a driver . During my down time instead of watching movies and playing games I decided to try these and with a lil will power and these bands I get a nice workout in the bus and also in hotel rooms . Made very well great purchase ! !
5 #### My children love this float in our pool ! Not sure if I would trust an inflatable on a lake , but works great in a pool .
4 #### I love these but my high arches make them really snug . It 's a little.effort to get them on but once I have them on I am happy !
2 #### This metal is so thin and fragile , every drop left a huge dent and when it got cold it split right up the middle . Not worth the money , went to walmart and bought on for half as much that is three times as good .
2 #### The elasticity is going out of it , and the color is fading after about 2 months of daily use in the ocean . The material is very thin . Unfortunately , it 's the only high - vis orange Lycra cap in existence , apparently . I 'm searching for a better one but it just does n't exist . If you 're not here for the color , forget this piece of junk and get a speedo or TYR one , I have Lycra caps from both those brands and it 's really a no - brainer .
1 #### My height and weight pu me smack dab in the size B. I tried them on at home with the dress I was going to wear . The tummy part rolled down . I figured that was n't optimal but it was still usable . While I was out the panties caused so much static , I was embarassed to stand up . I used some water in the restroom to reduce the static . A couple of hrs into wearing them , the leg hem started rolling up my thighs , creating once again embarassing bulges . Not sure if the sizing chart was wrong or what happened , but I sure wo n't be wearing these expensive underwear again .
5 #### I thought this would make a cute gift for my daughter . I was extremely happy with the size & quality of it . We decided not to just hang it on her door , instead it will become the center piece of a wreath we are making for her door . Of course the wreath is a Steelers one with black & yellow . :)
5 #### Love the fit of this shirt . My husband has a long torso and has a hard time finding shirts that fit him length wise . Usually he has to order and XL to get an shirt to be long enough and these shirts he can order his actual size Large and not worry about the length being to short .
5 #### This is one terrific watch from Timex ! Just as they say , this is one watch you 'd have to TRY to kill . It really keeps time very well even if you 're a bit careless and bump it into a wall once in a while ( and I do ) ; and it fits well on my wrist without making me feel uncomfortable . The band is well made and it 's great that you get such a flexible band ! The day and date are easy to adjust using the dial on the side of the watch ; and the face of the watch is actually pretty easy to read despite the fact that the watch lets you count seconds and even in twenty - four hour intervals . The ten year battery life guarantee impresses me all the more . With the proper care this watch should last for years ; the only thing I have n't tested is its underwater capability but I would assume that it works well just as Timex and another reviewer say it does . I highly recommend this watch for casual wear and for anyone who wants a sturdy , resilient watch . It 's officially a men 's watch but I do n't see why a woman could n't wear it ; and you wo n't regret this purchase .
5 #### I connect this between my reel and a light float tube from which I hang a game bag , lobster snare and spear . The coils are sufficiently joined so that they do not pull loose , and they are just the right pressure to keep the line from yanking in a wave . I almost never clip them together until I 'm on land , and then this makes a great " handle " for my gear .
5 #### As with anything that is universal , your firearm may vary . My AK took a bit of work to fit but it does . My Garand fits in it quite well with some room to spare . You can easily drop a desiccant packet or two in there as well . Definitely would recommend this .
5 #### These are a great alternative to the Five Fingers when you do n't feel like wearing them every day . It 's nice to have a shoe that provides the feeling of being barefoot without people asking , " Are those really shoes ? "
5 #### high quality , last a long time - I just bought 3 more after trying one out . My only complaint is that they chafe my nipples a bit while still new , hardly the fault of Carhartt though .
5 #### just ca nt go wrong with chucks . for anyone ... at any age !
4 #### I have smaller hands so I bought this grip for my driver . Even though I installed this on a standard diameter driver shaft it still feels small . I would recommend that standard size grip even for someone with smaller hands . The grip itself is great . Very sticky and comfortable . It alloys you to get a solid grip without having to really squeeze down on it . I 've swung my driver with this grip both with and without a glove and either way my hands stays in their original position ( no twisting or turning ) . I plan on buying the standard size and re - gripping my irons .
5 #### Ok the title is based on Julie Sarinana check out her blog and you too will see why . The shoes arrived on time to my girlfriend house . A perfect fit she said , as she is wearing a mens 4.5 for her 6.5 . Strange I know but that how they are listed . I purchased these Converse in White Canvas shoes for my little asian cutie she is 5'1 " and maybe 118lbs . My girlfriend will be wearing these new Canvas Converse at Disneyland . She 'll copy the amazing fashion style recommendation in Sincerely Jules web site . The complete outfit for the day at disney : Tangerine Sweatshirt , Crisp WHITE Roxy Cotton Shorts , Sneakers : White Canvas Converse Chuck Taylors , Sunglasses : Karen Walker . Another great purchase . Enjoy your All Star White Canvas Shoes . I am sure enjoy my asian cutie wearing hers .
5 #### Same as store bought . I have worn this brand and model for years . Very comfortable .
5 #### Like this design and recently discontinued so ... take advantage of good pricing . Nice overall , handle may be on small side for some ... Fits me fine . Either 440c or aus8 steel , not sure but came sharp , and took to much better . Thick for size , 3/16 " easy to sharpen straight edge , ca n't say how well it keeps one yet ... Secures well in tough little sheath , little rattle - ish going in and out but good overall , plastic clip not so great but lashing holes help . It 's a tactical blade , so like I always say rate as what was made as . Good fighter / rope cutting , etc . keen point and strong , might make it as survival knife in basic ways , good as dive knife , not much in hunting , etc . it is a great design as what it is .
5 #### It does n't look super quality but it 's been very good for several months in the garden . it gets the sprinklers every night and no sign of damage to it . I hope it lasts a long time
5 #### A few years ago , Levis changed the cut of their jeans just enough so that -- at least on my bod -- it made a difference . Back then I switched to Wranglers , and I continue to be pleased . These have turned out to be the best fit of any brand I 've tried , and priced very reasonably .
5 #### We have searched many shoe stores and can not find a better shoe than these Merrell slip on shoes . My husband wears them back anf forth to work . He loves the ease of putting them on and the comfort . Thanks much for a great shoe !
5 #### I purchased these resistance bands after going through PT for my right shoulder which was diagnosed with tendinitis . The PT gave me both stretches and band exercises to do , and these bands have really made all the difference . I was given a few of those flat elastic bands by the PT , but they quickly gave out , while the Black Mountain Bands have lasted a full year of use 2 - 3 times a week . Using these bands has brought my shoulder from being painful to move without any external load to being able to do pull - ups , rock climb , and play squash completely pain free . The handles are comfortable and make it easier to pull with more force , and the door jam strap gives me confidence that the bands wo n't come loose . The bands do show some wear in the middle where they come in contact with the door jam , but it 's not surprising given the friction and I 'm counting on the lifetime warranty in case it does break .
5 #### I have 5 pairs of this particular style of shoe . I live in them on weekends and wear them to work in inclement weather . I wish Merrell made dressier shoes for work with the same last and support . Excellent shoe for people with " bad " feet .
5 #### A bit masculine but hey it 's a man s watch ! Exactly what I wanted , I see the time perfectly during the night which was the reason for buying it . I end up wearing it during most days even though I have a dozen watches .
5 #### Nice fit , looks good , and good quality materials . I 'm happy .
3 #### Use these for work shirts but was a lil disappointed , because I 'm aware of carhartts quality in the past these shirts do n't shrink much but they are almost like the cheap ones you find in models or foot locker that are 5 for $ 25 but just a little thicker .
5 #### Out here in the four best states of the Union , Idaho , Wyoming , Montana , and Utah , many men and women are well armed and will stay that way until the end of time . This is a first class holster for carrying a large bore revolver .
5 #### Perfect size for just the bare essentials : keys , phone , meds / supplements . Well constructed and fits comfortably and securely . Can wear it with the pouch resting against your abdomen or back ( very versatile ) . Quality seems to be pretty good .
5 #### Bought for Christmas present for Grandson to go with the Bow I also purchased for him . Work well with the bow .
3 #### Elbow guards are fine but I am not happy with knee guards . They did not seem to fit right for my 5 year old son . They were little bit tight on his knees but did not fully cover his knee caps for good protection
5 #### These were my daughter 's first pair of Chuck 's and she ADORES them ! ! They were to go along with her Spidergirl costume for Halloween but she has worn them sense she got them . She loves them !
1 #### Too short to be useful . Adjustable only on one side - could not position the pad anywhere near my shoulder . The one buckle included would not hold the webbing in place . Again , it is also very short !
5 #### These shoes where purchased as a Christmas gift . They were perfect . The sizing was exact and they looked really great on !
5 #### Finally a tshirt that fits ! Intelligent I have been buying 2x size shirts which usually shrink to a L after a month or so . This is not the case with Carhartt . I bought XL and it fits like a tshirt should fit . Roomy and comfy . I will be buying more and replacing all of my blended material work shirts with these durable shirts . Too bad they are not made in the USA .
5 #### Love these shoes ! ! They are true to size and very comfortable ! ! This is my second pair - I wore out the first pair ! ! Good arch support - I have a high arch ! !
3 #### seems a little flimsy ( this is in reference to pulling back on the rod ) but it works , definitely worth the price .
1 #### It loses flexibility very quickly , just after a few days of occasional use . It became limp when bending in the U - shape . After trying to resolve the situation with Thera - Band , I was told this is " normal and within spec . " Recommend you use something else for wrist recovery and exercises .
5 #### Russell athletic wear is a staple for me . The quality and fit is always perfect .
4 #### It is a lot more sheer ( " see through " ) than in the photo . However , this shirt really works and is a great , comfy base layer for hiking in areas where the weather changes quickly from warm to cool .
4 #### they quite flat footed , but they serve a purpose well
3 #### After reading some of the reviews .. I feel like I can actually go a full size down . Its still a little big but it will work for now
2 #### Hanes needs some better quality control these days . The color I ordered , " barely there , " is a very dark color . It is supposed to be so light and transparent that anyone can wear it and appear to have bare legs . Overall , Hanes is a good product and fits well , but it 's a hassel to bother with returning things when they do n't catch color problems like this .
3 #### this is cute but a credit card fell out of it
2 #### First one we bought was good and lasted a few years , second one is slowly leaking from the first inflation and we ca n't find the leak , so it 's useless . Poor quality control .
5 #### I gave this as a gift . The recipient loved the color and feel of the material . I have one of my own .
5 #### Really cut down on the recoil from my Tikka T3 Lite . Fit is near perfect ( very slight lip on the bottom of the pad but not enough to notice during use ) .
5 #### These bands have stood the test of time and strength ... There are several bands that can be used separately or together to create more resistance as necessary . They are great when traveling to get a quick workout in . The door anchor is handy to create even more exercise options ...
5 #### I absolutely LOVE them ! I had a pair of these when I was a teen - now age 44 I still appreciate the look of a classic pair of white K - Swiss . They fit perfectly and arrived in immaculate condition - ca n't wait to pair them with the perfect attire and show them off .
4 #### I use this product for my lunchtime walks . Once I set up the instrument , it worked very well . The sensitivity of the instrument is a little hard to figure out . Otherwise , it has worked pretty good . I would recommend this to others as a simple and economical device .
3 #### Great for what we needed . Our 12 year old used it for a season and did n't break her neck . I 'll take that as a win !
1 #### Cheap ( what did I expect for the price , right ? ) . Bought for a costume . Did n't come close to picture . Threw it away .
5 #### These can take a beating and keep going . My kids have used and abused them for 9 months now and they are still running strong .
5 #### Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise ? It 's a Sith legend . Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise , he could use the Force to influence the midi - chlorians to create ... life . He had such a knowledge of the Dark Side , he could even keep the ones he cared about ... from dying . He became so powerful , the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power ... which , eventually of course , he did . Unfortunately , he taught his apprentice everything he knew . Then his apprentice killed him in his sleep . Ironic . He could save others from death ... but not himself
5 #### I bought these for my 11 year old son and a bought a pair of the speedo junior hydrospex for my 8 year old son . During the winter they are on swim team and practice indoors so not having the tint / shaded lens work better , they are not constantly removing them to see what the instructor is demonstrating . They do not fog up even after an hour in the pool . No complaints about leaking so the fit is just right . The dual strapping keeps the goggles in place for when they dive into the pool and when they are just messing around . They keep them in the plastic case / packaging so they can just throw them in their swim bag and not worry about scratching or breaking them . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Speedo - Hydrospex - Swim - Goggle / dp / B00005UDHZ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Speedo Hydrospex Swim Goggle</a >
2 #### I really was n't a fan of these tights . I was looking for something with more tummy control and the were n't sheer enough and way to tight on the legs . My legs are fine . I needed it tight around my tummy
4 #### wallet has many compartments , ample slots for cards and is well made
4 #### First off , they are original , second they fit rather large so have this in mind before making your purchase but not to the point of being unwearable .
5 #### Prompt shipment . Nice dock lines . Perhaps TOO nice . I bought four and two have been stolen .
5 #### I purchased this Thera - Band Flexbar along with the red / light one for golfer 's elbow . I had done research and found that many PT offices use these bars . After using the red bar for a few weeks I was able to move up to the green bar and my elbow pain continues to diminish . Using these bars strengthens the wrists , forearms , and elbows so that hopefully one does n't develop golfer 's or tennis elbow again . Highly recommend .
5 #### You can put a lot of stuff in the main compartment and the three pouches outside which are very deep . Considering a bug - out - bag , this is better than the molle bags offered because you do n't have so many compartments to worry about . Can fit a sleeping bag in the main compartment , but I chose a emergency casualty blanket and a small throw blanket . Anyway considering you have to carry your own , ammo , first aid , food , change of socks and such , that is a lot of stuff A good buy
5 #### Fit and feel about the same as the pair I bought a few years ago , the old pair are 4 or 5 years old and the stitching is just starting to frey .
3 #### Would be great if they fit . But I am a little more built and they are shaped for stick - people .
5 #### Have used these straps for years with my Thule Fold Down Kayak Racks and they are still perfect for all uses . Rubber clip protectors will save the roof of your car .
5 #### I ordered two bags to take a trip flying ( 3 plane changes ) then sailing for 7 days . The bags held up great and were easier to stow on the boat than traditional luggage . The bottom compartment kept my clothes as straight as any other luggage . I would buy more .
5 #### Just what I expect from Chucks . Note these are more of a pale peach / yellow than true orange , but they are a nice color . Very happy with them and wear them a lot .
5 #### Great product and fast shipping . Already used and love the excerises it comes with . I highly reccomend this product .
4 #### I 've been eyeing chucks for a while , I had n't purchased casual sneakers in a while and these are just what I needed . Super comfy - but a tad bit big . I generally wear a Women 's 8.5 , these feel like a 9 .
5 #### They fit true to size . Extremely comfortable with good tread . I have relatively narrow feet , and I 'm able to tighten them down enough for a good fit . I 've already mowed the lawn in them . They were completely covered in grass clippings , so I threw them in the wash . They came out looking good as new . Fingers crossed for good durability .
5 #### nothing bad to say about keen sandals or about keen shoes in general . they are the shoes that my podiatrist recommended and i 'm so glad that he did . i love everything about all keen shoes ESPECIALLY the colors !
5 #### I gave these shoes 3 months before I reviewed them . I 've had no problem with my big toe breaking thru like I read on other reviews . They still look and feel great and I wear them everyday to work . I work a desk job so I 'm not on my feet a ton , but I wear them 9 to 10 hours a day 5 times a week . I love them and would buy another pair in a heartbeat .
5 #### A bit stiff but excellent . Still waiting to catch my dinner with this one .
4 #### Esbit has become the industry standard for solid fuel in the backpacking world . Unlike the other fuel tablets on the market , these are all individually wrapped ans sealed . That is important when you consider the odor you have deal with . The individual foil packets reduce that smell to almost zero . As expected , these burn reliable well under all weather conditions . You ca n't spill them . They never expire or lose their effectiveness over time . They really are the industry standard . All that being said , they do n't get that fifth star for one reason - cost . You can find other fuel tables out there that have every feature and are just as reliable as these - with one exception - they are not individually wrapped . While that individual wrapping is really nice , I am not sure it is worth increasing the price by a factor of 2 to 3 .
4 #### With two sons we go through Converse Chicks like water in this house . They do run large and I love them for dress up or down- just do n't depend on them to offer much support or last a long time- they are more for style than practicality . But we love them nonetheless .
5 #### Bought these for my 14 old granddaughter ! SHe loves them ! !
4 #### I got these for concerts and such . Love em . They run long though so I got room at the end of my feet that I do n't like . Suggest a half size down . I had another pair that were long too . So I think its the brand . A little of the problem was solved with an insole .
5 #### Just as advertised , love it and will get a new pair in the new year
4 #### Previously had the same size and 99 % same model and it fit well with a narrow foot . New pair was too small , toe hit end . Purchased larger 11 and it was slightly too large , purchased cheap insert and now very comfortable . Nice shoes
4 #### this knife is pretty good looking knife the reason i did n't give it a 5 star is because mine came in with unbalance blade at the end . and it is not very sharp . but those are not a big deal you still can sharp it yourself and use it well .
4 #### Nice scooter but sometimes the lever gets stuck when your trying to fold it down , makes it tough for anyone but an adult to fold it or un fold it .
2 #### was gon na mark this one star ... the size was miss - leading , and too large for my daughter to wear . She really , really wanted these , was soooo excited when she opened them . One full size , or more , too large , maybe men 's vs. women 's ? Miss - marked ? Now what ? There they sit in her room until I can fix the problem . But ... the quality was very nice , shipped well , all that . SO , two stars .
5 #### I like the shirt a lot . I just wish other bright colors were available in my size .
5 #### I love these hose ! The offer support and they are sheer . I have a lot of edema in my feet and I was so disgusted with support hose because they were so thick and unattractive . These offer support and I feel elegant and my legs are supported and look great ! I would recommend these to anyone they really are sheer , affordable , and made great . I usually will ruin a pair of hose because I fight to get them on and off , but these are a perfect fit and they support and so far I have not thrown anyway ! I wash them in the machine on delicate with my other delicate items , hang them up and air dry and I am ready to wear them again .
3 #### Okay , so shoe shopping online is a skill . I do n't have any good shoe retailers super close by , plus we get better prices online , so I 've taken on the task . For some reason , the pairs I ordered from Amazon just did n't feel as good as other pairs I tried out . The only thing I can think of is different batches / plants / etc . I ended up with this same shoe , but from a different retailer and it fit better . I would suggest looking elsewhere for this particular shoe , but then again , Amazon 's return policy is so good , it could be worth a try .
5 #### Makes a great gift for a boy up to a teenager , this was a blast at a boy scout party with ages 11 - 17 . Looks cool at night .
5 #### They are chucks . Do I need to say more ? Party on
5 #### PURCHASED FOR MY SON . HE LUVS IT . I KEPT HIS REGULAR SIZE .
5 #### This was bought for my 6 year old . He needed something to help use some of his energy ! He loves to jump on the bed . This is much safer and he can bounce all he wants . He loves it ! ! Great exersize for him while he is watching his favorite show .
4 #### A solid brand name that has not slipped much with respect to Quality standards over time .
1 #### Was terrible . Fell apart the moment it was opened . Unusable completely ! Got my money back- but bummed at the product
5 #### Purchased a large , based on the fit reviews . I normally wear a large in this type of shirt . Fits perfect , if you 're 220ish / 5'11ish , and you 're a little bigger , this will still fit great . I believe that x - large may have been too big . Free returns though , if it is too big , or too small . I wear this at 5,000 ft , in the hot sun , between 90 - 110 F degrees , and this fabric and color scheme is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT . It is not too hot , and looks awesome . Have received a ton of comments and many others who saw it on me purchased the same , and in many other colors .
5 #### Have been wearing Keen Sandals for about 10 years . This will be my fifth pair . Comfortable and sporty , the are a great summer shoe for kicking around in shorts . Would defiantly recumbent them !
4 #### The magnesium block is fine . I use a separate flint / rod for making bigger sparks . The price was good , but I would just as well buy something that only had the magnesium without the striker and key chain .
4 #### Better than sleeping in the ground and provided decent comfort during camping . Wish it was slightly longer to accommodate people over 6 ft tall .
5 #### My son loves these shoes ! We got them for him to wear as a ring bearer to my sister - in - law 's wedding . He loves them ! I have loved Chucks all my life and these are still the same great quality they have always been !
5 #### If you have never used one of these , get one . Nothing like the standard Frisbees . These things GO ! Even little kids can throw these far . Warning : They do not float , so be careful at the beach .
5 #### Few more dollars is totally worth it ! Instead of using stones , this makes the pot I place on top to be leveled straight . It does n't weight much and feels very durable . It takes some space in your backpack but I love it anyway cuz it 's light . Keep the retail box as it 's tough to pack it alone with other clothes and all .
5 #### Great shoes . I just need to reorder in a smaller size .
5 #### This is a great whistle . I like the mouth piece the most . It feels like quality construction . I also like how loud it is , without much effort , and the absence of that little ball they have in many whistles . I bought it to use in a gym full or middle school students .
5 #### Love the pearlized face to this watch ! Easy to read when I want to check the time in the middle of the night ! Looks like an expensive watch .
5 #### My grandfather loved the shoes , said they were very comfortable and I have seen him west them every day since I bought them for him .
5 #### I bought this for my husband . He says it is comfortable , well padded , and stylish . Reasonable price too . Good buy .
4 #### good product and really helps with tennis elbow . I keep it in my bag all the time .
5 #### I wear boots all the time and need really good socks . These fit the bill . Would buy them again and recommend them to others .
3 #### The burgandy one was made in Haiti which ran a little small . The grey shirts were made in Honduras which fit better BUT fabric is rough and the black shirt was made in Guatemala which fit me the best as they seem a little longer . Also , the shirts made in Honduras and Guatemala seem to have softer cotton AND . . . today , the latest shirt is Made in Mexico and is as rough a fabric as the one made in Haiti . UGH . . . wish there was a way to only get ones made in Guatemala as they are the softest , the most true to size and fade the least but you never know what you are getting until it arrives .
4 #### I bought two of these on for my self and one for my girl friend so we had something to use while we were out in the boat fishing and we could view birds or other boats on the lake to see what they were doing . My girl friend reall loves hers . She has used it to just look at diffrent things while we were on a small trip in the car . Would buy again ..... carry mine in my fishing bag so I have it with at all times .
5 #### Such a simple design and so comfortable . I 've liked my converse even before they came back and I highly recommend them .
5 #### When a product works as intended and meets my every expectation in regards to function and price , what more can I say ?
5 #### These were purchased as a birthday present for my niece . She loved them and refused to take them off the entire weekend ! While a bit more difficult to keep clean , the white looks very sleek and goes with everything . I feel very good purchasing Converse as I know from personal experience they are a quality and long - lasting shoe .
5 #### Perfect for waiting for the school bus in the morning .
5 #### This is my first pair ever . I squealed from excitement when they came in ! I 've wanted a pair for seven years , now at 20 years old I can live out my emo aesthetic dream .
3 #### I think the handle in a bit light weigh . Its nice for holding stuff but I am putting power bands on it and do n't think it will hold up very long
5 #### These are great youth arrows for amateur archers . They 're rugged , they can handle the wear and tear a young shooter puts on arrows .
5 #### Most comfortable shoes for my son and daughter for many years . It 's part of the school uniform .
5 #### Got that for my 10/22 last year . Easy to zero and keep zero all the time . For the price you ca n't beat it . Quality built and fit perfectly my rifle . Recommended A + + +
5 #### Great for tying up out together out on the lake . Handy and easy to use .
4 #### I opted to order several variations of the SPRI Xertube bands as a cheaper alternative to paying hundreds of dollars for a weight set . ( This was for the P90X exercise program . ) I 've completed the P90X program three times ... unfortunately , I 've had to order several of the bands multiple times ... once each time I 've done the 90 day program . So ... be warned ... if you 're going to be REALLY working out with these bands for an extended period , you 'll probably wear them out in a few months . At first you 'll notice little white areas where the rubber has begun to fail . Once a hole develops , use care , because it does n't take long from that point for the band to be in a position to snap during exercise . I did n't heed my own better sense of judgement the first time I went through the program , and had a blue band snap on me mid rep . This was my own fault as I KNEW I should have discontinued use . Why the four stars if I 've had to replace them ? Because the bands work ! ... and they 're a great value . Free weights typically cost about a buck a pound . So if you 're capable of lifting large amounts , a suitable set of weights can set you back a fortune . I 'll continue to use ( and order more ) of these bands as I wear them out in the future .
4 #### IT WAS A GIFT , SO FAR SO GOOD , MY NEPHEW IS HAPPY WITH THEM SO THAT PASSES THE TEST AND THEY LOOK GOOD ON HIM .
5 #### I liked these so much , I bought a second pair . Quality material and stitching . A small pistol can be easily concealed in the cargo pockets .
5 #### I really like Hanes I have been wearing then for many years . Good quality and good strength does not run easily .
5 #### MY 9 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED THESE SKATES AND CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT SKATING PARTY .
4 #### Have n't went camping yet , but have tried it out on the living room floor . The flaw I see in this product is the air valve . You have to squeeze it while inflating or deflating . Makes the two processes more difficult than they need to be . Took 7 - 10 mins to blow it up , but took just as long or longer to deflate it to pack it away . Air valve aside , it 's a good product . I 'm 6 ' 270lbs and the mattress supported me well . Was reasonably comfortable to lay on . Material seems tough enough to hold up to regular use . Overall , good product for the price . EDIT : Just took the thing camping , worked great . Did n't lose any air over night , was comfortable to sleep on . Worth the money .
4 #### Nice watch for every day wear . Band has plenty of room , but easily can remove links . Great buy .
5 #### I 'm happy to have this thermal wear to keep me warm on those cold winter days ahead . Wish they made these in petite , but being warm is my goal , not fashion .
5 #### Met my requirement for a sturdy bag for gun maintenance tools to take to the shooting range . The side pockets are handy for small items !
4 #### I ve bought at least a half dozen pair in the last few weeks . They are made in China , India & Vietnam . For some reason the insoles in this pair do n't feel as spongy . BTW I usually wear a mens 10.5 I purchased a mens 10 & they are still a bit roomy .
2 #### 3T-4 T barely fit my 2.5 year old son . It is one piece and very difficult to fit his whole body thought the narrow neck opening . The hat is tiny and fits my 10 month old daughter . The ears flop forward instead of stand up .
4 #### The shirt is okay on me but the sleeve is rather too long and wide for what I wanted . Overall it 's cool . I recommend it for a work wear that it is .
3 #### The Venice H2 Sandal looked like it was well made . The color was fun in jester red / persimmon , but the length of the shoe from heel to toe was way too short . I exchanged them for the Keen Whisper sandals .
3 #### I ordered large and once I washed them they are really tight fitting . I guess I 'll try them in the field but I think They 're gon na be a bit uncomfortable . Let ya know . But for now ... THEY SOCK ! !
3 #### Had they not got a run as I was putting them on I might give it a higher rating ... Was bummed .
5 #### Great product ! really helps with tennis & golfer elbow . Also reduces pain from Carponal S ( wrist ) . This tension is stronger than red .
3 #### I was a little disappointed that there was some scratches on it and it just do n't have a great look that the Schwinn tricycle has . I bought the Schwinn 6 years ago for my oldest grandson it was a great bike , I wanted to get a different kind for my granddaughter so I bought this one . Now this is a well built bike and yes my granddaughter loves it , just wish it looked better .
5 #### This works as advertised . It would be cool if they added a clip on the fuel rod that clips to the inside of the stove for transport .
4 #### Everyone should expect that converse run bit .. The color of these shoes ( red ) is amazing .. super vibrant !
5 #### I bought Capezio tights , leotards and shoes and they are all great quality . These are a pure white and match any leotard perfectly . Fit my smallish 3.5 year old great with a little room to grow in to .
4 #### Bought a size up , great converse shoes my son loves them .
5 #### I wear a watch every day and my sports watches always broke at the strap , so it was time for a metal strap . The face is very legible . The strap is very long . I had to get four links taken out for it to fit properly , and I do n't have particularly tiny wrists .
5 #### Bought it to put weight in and drag at the park for a work out . I use it in conjunction with a Speed Harness Vest from CCS . Both are excellent so far and give me a good workout . I did n't want to have to walk miles and miles to work out . So I set this up to pull 100 lbs , and walk the length of the local soccer field pulling this behind me . I walked 600 meters which is about 4 tenths of a mile and could definitely feel the burn in my legs , and was quite winded , more so than if I had walked 2 or 3 normal miles . Workout was done in 20 minutes . Next time , I 'll do some dumbbell curls since I have the weights in the sled . I put them in a crate so they do n't slide around . I 'll also use it to drag out pigs when I go hunting , but primarily got it for the workout benefits . At least I know I can drag a 100 lb . pig 4 tenths of a mile now ..... on level ground .
4 #### Ordered for my daughter . The Timberland boot is a NY staple . It 's a classic . Keeps the feet dry and warm with the right sock . Traction for slippery conditions . They are apart of our landscape . Good quality from a trusted brand .
2 #### This fits well , but the fabric is so thin , it hardly provides any support , coverage , or shape . Also , there are only 2 rows of hooks on the back and for a size 36F , I prefer 3 .
1 #### I ordered these and they were to big , sent them back on the 10th of April and have n't received a return .
4 #### I wish I 'd read the other reviews and gone a size down , they are too big but I can still wear them comfortably as long as I have the laces on tight . They just look a little doofy being too large for my feet .
5 #### easy to assemble . Lightweight and comfortable . Very happy with my purchase .
5 #### My boyfriend loves these . He hikes in them and everything ! Very comfortable and will last for years .
5 #### I did n't know how much my kids would like this item until I took it out of the box . Oh my they played with it for hours . Sharks and minnows is their new favorite game . I love that it is an inside as well as outside toy .
5 #### Use these and some other tights for my lower body layer and the combo works great . For awhile I was using just the other tights I had but when I incorporated these I can honestly say I was comfortable even when it got quite cold on the trail , well worth it , I have had very good luck with the brand all the way around .
5 #### Wish I would have bought this mat a couple years ago ! This mat has taken my practice to the next level . No more slipping ! Once I plant my hands or feet they stay in place . Very easy to keep clean and with the closed cells I am able to wipe it down after my daily use . I will never again use anything but my Manduka mat !
5 #### I 'll spare the gory details since those targets should be well known to anyone who hits the range on a regular basis , and they are extremely helpful when shooting to 50 + yards because they stand out extremely well when stuck onto white paper . On the other hand , I find the complaints of high price really hard to believe . Frankly , their cost is almost negligible when compared to the cost of center - fire ammunition as well as their usefulness . I bought a few cases of my .223 PMC ammo for ~$6.50 per box of 20 rounds last year . This adds up to roughly 30 cents down range with every trigger pull . With my Prime membership , I bought a stack of 60 6 " targets for ~$20 along with another 240 3 " targets ( 4 targets per sheet , 60 sheets total ) for the same price . In other words , a 6 " target or four 3 " targets cost the same as a single .223 shot . If you 're a good shot with a good rifle , your 10 - shot groups should have no trouble fitting in inside a 3 " target ( costing less than a dime ) at 100 yards . 6 " targets are also nice for a warmup round when you had too much to drink the night before . Finally , if you are one of those folks with a bench rest target rifle and a ridiculous 2 " thick bull barrel , you should be using the repair pasters as separate targets ! :)
5 #### I never knew it would be such a hit and I wish I had bought one a long time ago . Family fun for the whole family . My rope has stretched so that the ball almost reaches the ground which is great for the baby to be able to reach . As an adult , I simply step back and play as normal . The pole has remained sturdy without shaking . Glad I purchased .
2 #### I really like wrangler pants ... being a bit short legged I need a 27.5 inseam , so I buy 28 when I can find them ... this pair was a lot closer to 30 or 31 than 28 ... so I got them rehemed . Guess I should have just gone to Walmart .
5 #### All my store cards . gift cards and credit cards fit in it . It is easy to close and has a divided change purse .
5 #### I love these ! I ordered an 8.5 which is my normal shoe size and they fit great . I used them for my strength training class and they performed well , and they are sooooo pretty ! Comfortable , low profile and stylish !
4 #### Fit very nice , feel very good on and look good also
5 #### Great helmet nice fit and nice and light but tough
4 #### It ran a bit small . Not too much . Used these for a wedding . Worked well and the stockings held up .
5 #### I was looking for a classy and simple watch . This is exactly it . Pro - tip get the band wet and then put it on so it breaks in and conforms to your wrist .
4 #### They feel nice , are n't scratchy at all . They also stretch very well .
3 #### One cube heated the water at 9200 feet . But did not boil it . Approx . 2 cups of water . It 's okay though I 'll still buy them .
5 #### Excellent shorts . These fit great with the size as expected . These do have the side pulls to help with fit . Pretty much the only down side to these is that they are made in China which is really an insult to the US Military but other than that they are really nice . These do have the normal gov't tags inside .
3 #### These seemed to have worn out sooner than other converse I have bought . The next time I will end up buying a half size smaller .
5 #### Fit like steel sausage casing , but for my tired old arthritic stems , it 's exactly what I wanted and needed . They take the word ' support ' seriously . And the control top is even better than Spanx .
5 #### I ca n't say enough about how this simple rubber stick helped me recover from some fairly severe tendinitis I developed from contact martial arts . Actually recommended by the stand up bass player in my band this thing just works . I have no explanation but its easy to use , I can take on trips , and it only takes a few minutes a day . A really , great product .
4 #### I have n't been able to wear my watch yet as it needs about 4 or more sections taken out so that I can wear . We do n't have a jewelers here in town , and I have n't had opportunity to go somewhere to get it done . I love the color and the face . I have to keep track of my time for different jobs , so the ability to read the minutes is going to be a big help .
4 #### Durable and adorable . Not in love with the band , it 's not velcro . But it stays on and she loves having a watch like her older brother !
5 #### FINALLY GOT A SUNNY DAY- NO WIND - TO SIGHT THIS ON MY SAVAGE AXIS .223 . MOUNTED EASILY WITH FACTORY RINGS . BTW $ 35 SCOPE ON COMBO IS THE WORST BUSHNELL I HAVE EVER SEEN . TASCO SCOPE IS AS CLEAR AS MY PENTAX OR SIMMONS ... PLUS HAS GOOD ADJUSTMENT SETTINGS I WOULD NOT EXPECT FOR $ 80 . I WAS ABLE TO GET NICKEL GROUPS AT 50YDS . USING A TREE BRANCH ( 8X ) BEFORE THE WIND CAME UP . THIS COMBO IS NOT FOR A TROPHY HUNT- . BUT FOR CALIFORNIA SQUIRRELS / VARMINTS IT SHOULD PROVIDE YEARS OF FUN . HIGHLY RECOMMENDED . ALSO SEE REVIEWS ON GUNBLAST.COM
5 #### The device is very simple , but it seems very sturdy and well - made . I ca n't imagine breaking it . It squeaked a bit . Two drops of oil on the spring and it is silent . I really struggled to decide which model was the right strength for me . I weigh 145 pounds , and I am active . I am a competitive paddler , which does develop some hand strength , and I do some lifting , but nothing aimed specifically at grip strength ( until now ) and do n't think of myself as having an unusually strong grip , so I figured the Sport model ( 80 pounds of resistance ) would be the right place to start . However , I can crank out three sets of 20 with either hand . I was hoping to start with something I would be able to close perhaps 4 - 6 times . If I was able to do this purchase over , I would go with the Trainer ( 100 pounds of resistance ) . I do n't necessarily want a huge collection of grippers ( or the expense of accumulating them ) so I might try to make the jump to No . 1 ( 140 pounds ) once I have spent a few weeks with the Sport . As some have mentioned , the texture of the grippers is rough . I do n't mind that -- I need my hands to be tough for long paddling sessions . If you do n't want that , you will need to either wear gloves or put tape on the grippers .
5 #### My son loves this scooter . And its his first one . The boy has it mastered already within 3 - 4 weeks after getting it . I like that its collapsible too . You can take it anywhere with you and it does n't take any room at all .
5 #### I have gotten so many compliments on the blue color and look of this shoe . It is super comfortable . The grip is wonderful for my indoor gym cross training classes . I always order a half size larger in Nike brand shoes and thy fit perfectly as I did with this shoe .
4 #### Bought this to lubricate our treadmill . Has a sprayer insert but no dropper insert . I use a foam covered " wand " to lubricate and with the sprayer , a lot of overshoot that got on the floor . So good silicon but not so good applicator .
3 #### Too large and no real way to return them . Would not order again .
4 #### Very nice shoes . Look good and fit well . Very comfortable , but the soles that provide the comfort wear rather quickly . Hopefully I can get 2 years out of them before the soles wear through .
5 #### I Had No Trouble Assembling ThisTrampoline By Myself . We Bought It For My Son And He Loves It . The Quality Is Nice .
4 #### This board works really well on small hills . My kids enjoy snowboarding on this . It definitely works better than the more expensive Lucky Bums snowboard that we have .
4 #### i wear a size 40 in birkenstock 's arizona sandals . i got these in size 41 and they fit fine .
5 #### Real solid and rubbery . a good deal if you r into solid rubbery baton - like gizmos . Not sure if my elbows are getting better .. but fun to bend while watching movies .
5 #### We recently got more into Dutch oven cooking in the scout troop , and I could n't think often enough " Where can I put this hot lid down ? " when checking or adding ingredients . Also good to get some separation from the bottom coals if your oven 's legs are n't that tall .
4 #### For my husband , he loved them . A little blast from the past .
5 #### works as advertised . a little overpriced , but worth it knowing that there is a slight theft deterrent on your bike rack .
5 #### This is so well made and launders beautifully ! It is a good fit and a good weight to the cotton .
5 #### The best item to keep all your jewelry organized . I have so many of these ! They remain in good shape for a long time if treated with care .
4 #### This would be perfect except they run large . I read in one of the reviews that they run small so I got the next size up . That was definitely a mistake but worth rebuying the right size .
5 #### Very satisfied with item as well as the quick shipping .
5 #### Love these basic cotton shorts . They are so affordable and you can get them in virtually any color you want . They fit great , hold their shape and last forever1
5 #### These are some of the most durable work t - shirts you can get . Being in the logging industry is hard on clothes . These shirts live up to their Carhartt name every time
3 #### Bought this for winter Yosemite trip but no one wore it because it fit very snug around your neck . We like to have breathing room .
5 #### Took a friends advice and purchase one full size smaller and they fit perfectly !
5 #### Bought for my 5 ' girlfriend to keep on hand for when I ask her to wear pantyhose . Good fit and most important - a nice texture if you appreciate such things . Would buy again .
3 #### It looks like one leg of the fabric was sewn on inside out . It has bold black lines going across it . Also one of the straps that holds the boot covers down was not sewn into place . Other than that , it 's a cute costume ! Bought it for a 3 year old with the 4 - 6 size . The torso fits great but the legs and arms were too long . I hemmed it myself with no issues to fit him .
5 #### the only underwear that I own , These panties never bind nor ride up -- and they are thin enough to wear under smooth clothing
5 #### NKG plug was exact OEM replacement on my 8hp yamaha outboard , and has worked perfectly right out of the box . Plug was perfectly gapped , which takes alot of guesswork out of the install .
2 #### The description instructs to order based on your actual waist size . That 's exactly what I did and the belt is too tight even on the loosest position .... I will be returning this .
3 #### It 's a whistle and it blows like a whistle , but it 's not worth over $ 12 . It 's thin metal with a wooden ball . You can buy these at your local sports store for under $ 6 . Overpriced at Amazon .
5 #### Great accessory . Extra security assured for my Thule Apex Swing bike rack . Reasonable price . Very pleased .
3 #### Nice little set . Not sure about having to post a review to get the free Orange band offer though . I do n't like trading reviews for incentives - I think that skews reviews in favor of products .
5 #### Beautiful color , texture and the quality is great . Nice sticky mat .
4 #### Upon receiving these boots . They appeared to be decent quality and would have been a great purchase . However , they were just to small in the width . The better news was there was no hassle returning them , which I regretted . When I decide to buy again I will check out this merchants merchandise first . Thanks Again ..
5 #### This works great to keep lit cigars when working in a truck etc . It does not crush them and can be attached almost anywhere .
1 #### I 'm considering throwing this away and finding another solution . The upper clamp will not stay in place no matter how much I tighten the screw WITHOUT a bike on it . So one can imagine it becomes even more of a challenge when adding a ~20 lb bike . I found a barely adequate solution by taking a piece of thick rubber tube and cutting it and placing it between the upper clamp and the pole . Even with this in place the bike eventually slides down and rests on the seat of the lower bike . This is a complete waste of time and money , it does n't even come close to performing its most basic purpose .
5 #### Actually it has ok arch support I have to add more and it looks silly but I have extra high arched and these support it somewhat . I wanted the shoes for climbing hiking in Greece and they were perfect for that . They give on rocky terrain and supported me enough for hiking walking all day for several weeks
3 #### I got this for my mother ( 85 ) to aid her in making jewelry ( stringing beads ) . The LED light is a little underpowered . Using an additional overhead light introduces glare that impedes vision . The magnification is good . It worked well enough that I bought one for myself .
5 #### This is a really cute watch and works very well . The indiglo is an added bonus ! The second hand is flowers that work their way around the clock . My daughter loves it !
5 #### Surefire Rugged Polymer Speed Holster works great . The SureFire G2X Pro Dual Output LED Flashlight fits snug in this holster .
5 #### Bought this for an upcoming trip to Mexico for my snorkel and mask fits great but have n't acturally been in the water yet
5 #### This is my # 1 product for cleaning and maintaining my silver jewelry . No , it is not the best for cleaning large pieces of silver ( because it does require some work ) but for jewelry , I think it works great . There is a cleaning side and a polishing side and both do exactly what they say . There is no weird odor ( like you get with some silver cleaning products ) and it does n't leave a weird residue on your hands . I can clean a piece as I 'm walking out the door for work , just as I would clean a pair of sunglasses , and be on my way .
5 #### Amazing what this little piece of rubber has done to reduce felt recoil on my .300 WSM . I never thought this was possible .
5 #### We used this stove for our family camping trip a couple of weeks ago , and it was great . A lot of heat and cooked food fast . We did most of the cooking over camp fire , but had this stove as a backup . It worked well .
5 #### My son is a basketball fanatic . And at 15 , in just a year and a half of playing seriously ( pickup games , etc . ) he has become quite the fanatic . He already had 3 previous balls he plays with . But when he saw this one he said ' yep , that 's pro quality ' with a long smile . The grip is so good , the response is up there also . If you want to bring a smile to your players face you ca n't go wrong .
4 #### These stockings fit very nicely . I have now worn them several times and they have not torn yet - which others usually do after the first or second time . I will buy these again .
1 #### I have large breasts , larger than some but not the largest , 40 DDD . This bra did not even pass the bounce test . I put it on and jumped up and down . FAIL . I like to run and do Turbo Jam and even Zumba , but with the way this bra is I doubt it would have even held up to my Zumba classes . Back to the drawing board . Does anyone know of any great support / sprt bras out there ? !
5 #### This is a very attractive shoe . It is true to size and fits as expected . Very satisfied with the seller - delivered on time .
5 #### These are much heaver material than you get at wally circus and they are well worth the extra money .
5 #### I am in my 40 's and these pantyhose are the bomb . I buy the color " Barely There " in non - control top sandalfoot , and I would say that if you are my approx . height and weight ( 5'5 and 125 lb . ) then you will need a size EF . I know , strange , and even so , you can still feel the band at the top . But the pantyhose LOOK FABULOUS , and I am caucasian , and these add ' just enough ' color to my legs in the middle of winter . These really look very lovely with dresses , and feel great . If you buy the " Jet Black ' color , be careful upon handwashing them , as they will never look ' quite ' as good as the first time you wore them . They wo n't tear if you are careful , but they will have these tiny ( 1 - 2 " ) black horizontal lines in a few places . Be sure your nails are smooth when you put your hands through them to pull them up . This is the only brand I will wear , and I am 1,000 % happy with this color and look and feel .
3 #### I previously bought an expensive folding compass that was attractive , sturdy and well - made . Unfortunately , I could n't figure out how to use it ! This little compass is easy to use , fits in your pocket , and has a nice price . But -- fast forward a year -- for some reason , it no longer works . Strangely , the directions are now wrong ( North is now South ) . I do n't know if I somehow demagnetized it , but my recommendation is to spend a bit more on a better - made compass .
4 #### Not the best - looking footwear , but , if you are looking for the best shoe / sandal to hike / water / play , this is my go - to . I seriously believe everyone should own a pair . They are easy to put on , comfy as all - get - out and shield your toes from stubs .
4 #### Bought these for my grandfather for his bird and wildlife watching . He says they work pretty good .
4 #### Ordered a 14 - d and it was way too long so I ordered a 13 - 2e it was just right ! I go between a 14 and a 13 in shoes since they do no make a 13.5 and a 14 in boots
5 #### Same thing I used in physical therapy to improve leg strength and balance .
3 #### This works great , but the center rivet looked extremely suspect to me , so I knocked it out and replaced the assembly with a bolt , washer , and locking wing nut I got at the hardware store for $ 3-$4 . I ca n't imagine why the maker chose such a poor fastener .
5 #### Not my first set of Unc . Mike 's swivels and probably wo n't be the last . Love the way they work and they 've never failed me . If you are reading this , you must be a newbie , because everyone else knows about Uncle Mike 's consistent quality in swivels .
5 #### Nice wallet with a lot of room and slots to put credit cards and pictures .
4 #### Very comfortable ! I 'm enjoying these converse . I got a pretty good deal buying them here instead at the actual converse store . I saved myself a bit more of money . Satisfied customer
3 #### Probably should have paid more attention to the size , but this knife is pretty small . Other than that , I have no complaints . Fast opening ( although does n't always lock closed ... sometimes I have to push it a little further to lock it ) and sharp
4 #### Not quite as cute as in the picture , but comfy and fits just right . Will be a good top for right after having my baby .
5 #### Fit perfectly and even came in the box ! I was worried but these turned out to be exactly what I asked for .
5 #### Camping and fishing , this is a great outdoor shirt . Long sleeves that roll up nicely when things warm up . For the fisherman it has nice pockets on for easy access to little items .
5 #### This wrist wallet is exactly what I have been looking for . I hate carrying a purse but I ordered this the day I went to get my keys out of my pocket and forgot I had a $ 100 bill in my pocket as well . I have no clue where it fell out . My credit card , i d , key and cash fits perfectly inside a very secure velcro closing . I ordered a L / XL and it fits perfect on my wrist . The strap has some give but not to much and I tried to see if this would fit on my ankle and it was to small . My teenage daughter is a runner and while she takes her phone with her I hate that she has not place to carry money . I just ordered her one in the size S / M. The only con I could say about this is that the velcro is very strong and if you had to open and close it a lot it would become a pain . If this wallet had the option of a zipper that would make it perfect .
3 #### Not a bad scope but the screw holes for the mounts were n't drilled the best . The optics were fine . I did have to mcgyver the holes .
5 #### I bought this Matrix for my wife after she used mine and really liked it . There are better masks out there , and better ones from Cressi , but this one I believe is a perfect balance of quality and price . I would definitely recommend to anyone who 's serious about diving but are on a bit of a budget .
5 #### I love the simplicity of this watch ! I wear it nearly every day ! This replaced the last Cavatina watch that I had for 10 years but lost while on vacation ! I have small hands and wrists and so the thin band is perfect ! A must have watch for every woman !
4 #### Very warm good material .... just looks like wearing a neck brace .
4 #### Got this for Xmas ! Love the color ! Sage black ! So pretty ! Very dense and solid mat ! Only thing i dislike is the cost and its so so slippery ! I d k if its bc my hands and feet sweat a lot ? Or what ! But so slippery
5 #### I ordered my belt last Saturday and about half way through the week , it came . I am greatly pleased with the speed of the delivery . I was not expecting it for another week at least ! And they got the order right . Double Points ! I would without any hesitation order from them again .
5 #### You gave a quick delivery . You gave me a good product . I really like this product costs . I am very grateful to you . I hope you are rich .
5 #### This is a very nice , high quality compass . It made a great gift for our grown son , who has loved maps since he was a Cub Scout . He 's now into geospatial information technology ( GPS stuff ) , so this is a throwback to days gone by . Bottom line though - it is not a toy . It is a nice , accurate compass ,
5 #### Thank you , they arrived rigth on time , and the shoes were more than my expectations . Thanks !
5 #### this shirt is great its long and my hubby loves it . Great purchase
5 #### Easy to use . Good quality . It looks appealing and it rides really really smoothly . Both my husband and I have stood on it and it held up with out a problem . We were happy with the purchase . I would recommend it for 4 and up . I have read that others scooters have scratched ankles but not this one !
5 #### I store my fly rods and attached reels . Helps keep the moisture at bay in the off season .
5 #### Has held up well this far . Girls are actually playing with it in front of house as I type this . It 's definitely not for pavement use as it will scuff easily .
5 #### These are the best t - shirts out there . Nice fit and material thickness . Sizes seem to be larger than most other shirts . I need an XL most shirts , when a Carhartt fits in a Large .
5 #### Ordered a couple of these shirts in large ..... my usual size but they are a " loose " large for me . That was my fault & will still wear them . I then ordered a couple of medium & they fit real good . The neat thing about these shirts is they do n't seem to shrink . Very well made shirts .
5 #### The color pattern and fit is what I liked the most what I liked the least is that they are not easy to clean and stains do not come out very easy or at all
5 #### bought as a gift for my boyfriend who is a big giants fan . he loves it
5 #### Looking forward to warmer weather so I can wear these more often .
5 #### These are a great line of shoes . Very comfortable walking long distances , and very durable .
2 #### Nice shirts but the ones made in Haiti are way smaller than the ones made in other countries.this is a common complaint from all shoppers who have got shirts from there . You would think Carhart would please their customers by not having anything to do with poor quality goods made in this country
3 #### I have not used these yet , but they look like they are worth more than for the price they are sold .
5 #### We 're proud new owners of our first Ping Pong table and these balls are standing up well to 9 year old twins who are learning the game . There are no complaints from me and the price is right !
4 #### I love the tee , but as another reviewer said , order a size smaller .... actually I ordered a size bigger because it was a 100 per cent cotton and I was sure it would shrink , but it did n't that much ! It 's a bargain for the price , so I 'm going to order another one .
5 #### this shirt is very oversized so beware . It is a great looking shirt though and can be worn out or tucked in if required . Sleeves can be rolled up if you get too hot . Great for hiking or for use as a very light jacket .
5 #### LOVE them --- wear ALL DAY -- GREAT LOAFER__FAB PRICE -- ordering another pair soon -- diff color ! ! !
4 #### Perfect for my kids who are 5 and 6 . They are just learning the basics of basketball and this is just right for them .
4 #### This will work just fine for my back pack stove . I like that they are small and fit into a small vacuum sealed bag . this keeps the smell they give off contained
5 #### The Silver Tech is cool looking and as for all the parts that come with this well I have used a Hunter for over 30 years and have never been disappointed with it .
5 #### I 'll be honest ; I do n't play tennis . I bought these for my dog . He kills regular tennis balls , and seems to have a hard time destroying these for some reason . He is a strong chewer and these last quite a while - I 'm not sure how that would translate onto a tennis court .
5 #### Use it with my Camp Chef . Ca n't go wrong with Lodge products
5 #### Firstly it is a Timex . The large numbers on the dark background make it so simple to read . I arrive sooner than promised .
5 #### This are sturdier than your normal bases and have the waffle structure to reinforce them . My son loves these bases .
4 #### Pretty comfortable , for the price , you ca n't beat it . Ca n't hear much with these on . I usually do dual hearing protection at the range . In the ear and over the ear .
4 #### A GIFT EVERY ONE AS TO HAVE A PAIR AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFE SO WHY NOT NOW
4 #### Very comfortable shoe . Ordered a size 8 which is my usual size , but should have ordered a 7 or 7.5 . You might want to try them on in a store first before you buy , so next time you can buy them online knowing how they fit your feet .
5 #### This little sled has turned out to be really handy . We use it to haul fire wood , corn / seed we put out for the critters , straw / hay , and shipments we get out by the mailbox . I 'm very pleased with it .
5 #### so far I have purchased two boxes of these and I think they are great . they really heat up and the size it just right to fit inside my gloves . I 'm into photography and it gets really cold where I live so I put one in each glove and sometimes one in my pocket . They last several hours and stay very warm .
4 #### It works , nothing else really to say . If you cook with a dutch oven , these are a big help
3 #### What a shame , these shoes would be great if they both fit the same ! The left shoe is wider than the right making my foot slip out . The insole also popped up when I brought it up to my foot to try on . The right one is perfect . If it was n't for the fact I need them starting Friday for a weekend away , I 'd return them . Keeping my fingers crossed they 'll last !
4 #### Heavy duty bike rack . The U bolts are very short . If you do n't tighten them at exactly the same rate and keep them even , you might pop off a nut trying to tighten one side with shorter threads , and screw up the threads on the shorter side . I had to have Swagman send me another U bolt because of this . I 've only tried the rack for a short distance . I 'm anxious to try it for long - haul trip . I use it behind an older Honda CRV that has the spare tire mounted to the back door . The rack just barely clears the tire . I like the design that keeps the bikes fairly flat .
5 #### The young lady who received it is thrilled and wears it well
1 #### Is great big when full , so did not meet my needs for a Small holds - all wallet . Honestly , by measurement it seems tiny . But when you add all the credit cards and money and things it will hold , it is a big fat stuffed wallet-- probably just like the one you 're trying to replace . I suggest not looking for something to hold Everything , but instead look for something very small to hold about 6 items of necessity , else you will always have a wallet about the same size . When full of all my stuff , it took up 1/2 a small shoulder bag . Another Amazon waste of money . Hear me Amazon ? I quit . Go ahead , do n't publish this .
5 #### These were for my 3 year old grandson ! They fit & look wonderful ! ! I love these boots , I bought two more pair for my 2yr old twin grandchildren ( boy & girl ) !
4 #### Fit and quality are good . I would describe the color as a dark tan . They will likely wear well due to the texture which appears to be made to last but does not have a silky feel . If the feel and texture is not important , you will likely be happy with this product . If you like a silky smooth feel you may not . I 'm taking off a star since I gave these to my girlfriend and prefer the silky smooth type . If you do n't have someone who likes to put their hand on your thigh , my preference wo n't be a factor .
5 #### This is an excellent stove for camping . We used this when we did n't want to use the camp fire . It stores well and is easy to use
4 #### I like the quality of the material and the large clamping surface . Hope that these will stay put on a hard kicking rifle .
5 #### Not sure how they work as chafing fuel but as an emergency fire starter in tandem with a ferro - magnesium stick and striker work great ... just a well placed pile of shavings , one of these and a spark is a guaranteed fire in seconds . They burn very hot and stay lit even in windy and rainy conditions . Buy a pack just to stick in your camping gear .
4 #### Love the shoes but I wear a 12 in men 's and decided I better get a 11 1/2 to be on the safe side because I order some all black chucks and I felt like I had on my dads shoes lol but a 11 would have fit perfect rather than a 11 1/2 ? If it was n't for the fact I need the shoe 's ASAP I would have sent them back to get a different size cuz besides the side the shoes are nice .
5 #### Very classy and productive boots . After reading the product description and reviews , I was willing to pay $ 89 . When I saw the price , it was a no brainer . They arrived today and these are some of the most comfortable boots I 've ever worn . I plan on getting another pair so I have one for the boat and one for the yard .. 12 inches high so I do n't have to worry about the morning dew or splashing sea water on the deck of my boat . I have wide feet and these 10 's fit me perfect ( I typically wear 10 EE ) . Absolutely 100 % water proof . I live down in Florida . Will definitely wear these during all future hurricanes . Comfortable yet rugged . Classy yet built to last .
5 #### much faster than a rope . I wish they had shorter ones too .
5 #### This is the best - fitting , and highest quality bra for me . The price is reasonable , and if you already know your size , and what color you want , you can order this from Amazon , and you will receive exactly what you want , without having to drive from store to store , inevitabley not ever finding what you want . I will always buy this from Amazon .
4 #### Shoes are great , but I have a feeling my pair might have been tried on before and not totally brand new . There 's a little red mark near the toe of the shoe , which looks like ketchup or something . No biggie , just wipe it down with an antibacterial wipe or toss it in the washer . These shoes do run big . I ordered a 4 M , and it fits more like a 5 M on my 14mo - old son .
5 #### I 've been avoiding pantyhose for well over 20 years because nylon irritates my skin ... well , I ended up trying these and they are soft ! NO irritation at all . Yay , not all nylon is itchy . No problems with runs either , so far .
5 #### Bought these for my husband . They were a perfect fit . By getting the tall they are long enough to stay tucked in . He is very happy with them .
5 #### I use this and a matching bottom to sleep in when I am out backpacking in the back country . Warm or cool , these are perfect for staying comfortable at night . They add just enough warmth when the night air gets nippy and just enough breath - ability when its hot and humid at night . The fabric can snare easily , but little snares here and there do not affect it 's function in the least . The fit is perfect , the material feels good on my skin . It is very light weight and takes up very little space in my clothing bag . It 's a perfect addition as an under layer if it gets chilly while i hike as well . I would never go on a backpacking trip without them .
5 #### just got these I think they will be great ... now to just use them . Really like the way they show how to use them .. now I have no excuse
2 #### The Champ " Stinger 's " wear very quickly ( 4 - 5 rounds ) and twist out on tee shots . The plastic is too soft , which impacts their durability and ability to stay locked into the shoe . I have used Champ Zarma 's , and do not have this issue , so not sure if Champ have started using cheaper material , or if the problem is only related to the " Stinger " series .
5 #### Love the weight of these shirts . Not too heavy and not too light . Fits great even after washing .
5 #### Very good quality ! light weight and rolls so smooth . Would recommend
5 #### My son 's friend had one of these and he loved riding it so of course we had to get him one . Durable , easy to maneuver ..... fun !
5 #### This bag is great , large enough to hold a large wallet , sunglasses case , keys , notebook , and some little extras . But not so large that it is bulky or uncomfortable to wear .
1 #### Every day I look at the dust on this ball and wish for my wife 's hundred dollars back . She barely used it one time . I would use it for ab work except I find it very uncomfortable .
5 #### Works great for him when he is riding at night !
3 #### Loved the boot but it was too loose in the heel and a smaller size was not available . Had to buy another brand .
5 #### My Fiance was very pleased to receive this gift for our 5 year anniversary ( the year of the wood gift ! ) . He takes it everywhere . I was pleased that this was real wood and not a wood press .
4 #### I love the boots .. Too bad they do n't fit ! Make sure to get a size or .5 of a size smaller than your usual size . The are cut big
3 #### It seems to work but the Quality is not what I expected for the price . Update : It is compact and light weight . It puts out a good spark and has a locking blade . It has a built in whistle . It has a some what unreliable belt clip . The blade and handle are flimsy . I paid more for it at the time I bought it , so at $ 20-$25 it may work for limited usage .
5 #### Perfect for lubing pool pumps and acc . Tad pricey but , it works .
5 #### This net was a way better option than anything at Dunhams or other sporting goods stores . Nets available at most big box discount stores are either too small vertically or the holes are too large . This puppy is just right and it looked exactly like the image in the listing . My pool is 20x40 and this net crossed it perfectly . It 's great for badminton and pool volleyball both . Seems sturdy enough and a season of chlorine and beating has n't hurt it . Not sure what others found wrong with this product ; it 's the best net I 've found in ten years of pool badminton and I 've purchased several different nets over that time . Enjoy !
4 #### I 'm a definite fan . I use the product on my pickle ball paddles over the factory grip as I like not only the comfort , but more important is that here in south Florida heat and humidity , sweat is not a problem ; it wicks away , so I do not have a slippery grip .
3 #### Did return . Just did feel right for me . My wife ... However loves her 's .
3 #### This does n't fit the same as the other Bali bras I have . The wires poke outwards on the sides and are uncomfortable because they ' jab ' into my arms .
2 #### I usually wear a size 7 in women , but I ordered a 4.5 . The size chart told me to order a size 7 which is men size / 5 for women . I read reviews saying they ran a 1/2 size big , so I went down 1/2 a size and they are still 1/2 size too big . I 'm really disappointed bc I have no use for them now .
4 #### I had belt loops break on a pair of jeans that thought were Wrangler , but closer examination showed them to be Levi 's , so these were OK .
5 #### My husband loved these shoes ! He used them for work ( HVAC ) and loves the easy slip on / off shoe . Always having trouble finding a comfortable shoe in a wide width , these Merrill 's over- filled his expectations . They have lasted almost a year of extreme wear and tear while on the job . Will definitely be ordering more of these shoes !
3 #### check size according to Hanes chart . If you are near the edges of the chart , go to the next size up .
5 #### These jeans fit great and wear good . Very happy with these jeans .
4 #### The theraband has helped in alleviating my tennis elbow . I 've also used it to improve my grip in both hands . Both my doctor and physical therapist recommended it .
5 #### When I was looking at these shoes online , I was skeptical because I hate ordering clothing and shoes online because I like to try things on first , but these converse turned out to be really nice ! I ordered the optical white , size 10 in women 's and it 's a perfect ! I love these very much . The shipping was on time too ! I ordered them three days ago and I got them today ! I would highly recommend at any time . Super comfortable .
5 #### I could only find the half sizes on line and these fit my daughter perfectly and were well priced . They arrived on time and were as expected .
5 #### For all of us with aging eyes this is the answer . Keeps great time , fits well just an all around great watch .
5 #### Bought for my teenage son . He loved them , so I 'm happy .
5 #### Daughter requested it for Christmas and she is satisfied and I am happy because she is picky .
4 #### This is a good cheap alternative to the surplus SKS slings if you need a sling for a stock Saiga rifle . The ends easily loop through the narrow swivels that they put on there . This sling has a little padding on it , unlike the SKS type slings . It seems like it is n't going top fall apart or anything . No complaints so far .
5 #### Very easy to use and move around . Not sure if I would travel camp with this but its great when we were able to drive and set up camp . Very compact and uses very little gas . We cooked twice a day for 4 days used between 1 and 2 burners and did n't go though 1 16 oz can even !
5 #### I should have ordered a 51/2 instead of a 6 . I love them , they are just a bit to large !
4 #### Nice shirt , but too long , the measure changes according to where I originally intended , I had one of those that manufacturing was elsewhere and that measure is the largest to be found , but the shirt fabric is super excellent , good the purchase , did not know it hurts to have a little margin of error is super - xl xl lol
3 #### I was n't sure how to purchase a slip and read that you should go with your bra size . Well , that did not work for me with this purchase . The slip is too small and enough so that I can not wear it . A sizing guide would be very helpful .
5 #### This parka was a gift for a homeless man who came into the soup kitchen where I volunteer , in the dead of winter , in his shirt sleeves . Each day he would put his pack and sleeping bag in the back , out of the way , and immediately begin hauling tables and chairs around , helping us get set up for feeding the 50 or 60 folks who come in each night for a hot meal . When he was done , he would haul a chair over by the heater , pull out a copy of his latest reading project ( he 's into the classics ) and keep himself warm . I asked him if he had a coat , and he said no , but he grinned and said he keeps himself warm by keeping himself moving . When I handed him this parka he broke into tears and sobs . It was one of the sweetest days of my life .
2 #### Had to return . Inflated first time out of the box to test before river trip and it did n't hold air . Suggest you inflate it ASAP to make sure it works before planning to use it or bring it on a trip .
4 #### I bought these knowing they do not have arch support . The quality of the material the shoe is made of is good .
4 #### A fun watch , but the band design leaves a little to be desired ( the " extra " length is wrapped beneath the outer band and is cumbersome to tighten ) . This is a small nit , and the watch overall is a great value to for a young girl .
2 #### I did not like it , I returned this item . I found a similar one with an LED light , and a lens cover for the top . This may be good for someone else .
5 #### Day / Night flexibility and excellent Optics . I would buy this with a smaller aperture to any Maksutov claiming terrestrial viewing . The glass is great quality and the zoom is decent with regards to eye relief . Quick to set up and well weighted for balance
5 #### I prefer to sleep in a hammock when camping and I live in Florida . Not only is it bug infested here but , it 's hot too . With this I can sleep in a pair of shorts with no sleeping bag and wake up with all of my blood intact .
4 #### This is a one size fits all costume , made for someone much bigger than my 5'3 " petite self . But I knew that when I bought it . The only thing I do n't like , and it 's NOT SHOWN IN THE PHOTO , is the " cap " ( horns and ears ) - there is a cow face designed into it , and it 's not big enough to put over a person 's face , so you have to cut it off or tuck it under . Bad design there . But the costume 's fun . Udderly ridiculous .
5 #### I love these shoes . They are light weight and wide enough to never hurt my feet .
5 #### My go - to winter shoes . Warm , comfortable , go with most outfits . After about three or four years of constant wear , the soles will erode and the uppers will stretch out and I will happily replace them again .
5 #### As mentioned in other reviews they need to be ordered a half size larger
4 #### Very nice but stains quickly and is hard to clean .
4 #### Almost perfect . Very sharp steel , love the color , Axis lock is great , no up and down play , only minor side to side play can be tightened with adjustment of pivot screws , great " grippy " handles very smooth open / close , in fact the best on a thumb stud opener I have ever felt , it is a bit expensive but it is made in the US and is a quality knife . Took off one star for two reasons : 1 . Blade centering is off . 2 . Only tip up carry only If I lost it I would buy another . In fact I did n't lose it and I bought a 555 with the thumb hole .
4 #### Would give it 5 stars but they seem a little small
5 #### I am very pleased with this dress ! I was n't sure what size to get when I ordered it , so I got an XL ( I 'm about 5'7 " and weigh 210lbs ) . I was pleased to see that this has smocking in the back which gives it a bit of stretch . It is very comfortable , and is exactly the look I was going for . I will probably buy a couple more dresses from this brand , although I may go down a size as I am in the process of losing weight and would like to be able to keep wearing them . I added a picture of the back of the dress , one without a petticoat , and the last picture is the dress with a petticoat . I bought " Vintage Women 's 50s Rockabilly Tutu Skirt Petticoat White(L ) " on Amazon to go with this dress . Please note that as this dress is cut to have a big circle skirt it tends to be much more flattering if you do decide to add a petticoat underneath it .
5 #### I use to wear wranglers and Levi 's . I have been wearing carhartts for years . They fit better and they wear better .
4 #### This is the second pair that I bought for my teenager child , simply he loves them . He says they are comfortable and trendy .
5 #### My son , who had been leaning toward the saggy look for awhile , decided to try dressing a little nicer . These Wrangler jeans suited him just fine . He took a liking to them immediately because they 're hardy enough for skating and he feels handsome in them .
5 #### Wish the padded bras fitted this well . I will continue to buy nipple covers and buy these bras because they fit and have a naturL shape to them .
4 #### Great toy knife for my 5 year old ! He really likes it !
5 #### These are high quality replacement golf soft spikes . They seem to last longer and retain their shape better than many other brands .
4 #### I 'm returning this shoe for a wider version . Otherwise I like them just fine .
5 #### Keeps my old 336 marlin 30 - 30 protected even with under light mounted on it . It is a little tight and grabby but ca n't beat the socks for the price ! Will buy more for sure .
5 #### Always buy a half size down . My hubby normally wears a 10.5 , but we get him a 10 in Converse because they run a bit big . Other than that , my husband LOVES these shoes ! ! ! !
5 #### I 've tried to buy more expensive watches , but always seem to come back to Timex , especially their Expedition series . Nothing beats the Indiglo feature for me . I was looking for one that was still cheap but expensive enough for free shipping on Amazon . This one fit that requirement . I like casual looking watches , and have bought several Expedition series watches in the past . This one is nicer looking than the photo might suggest , in my opinion . The brown is a real medium sueded brown strap , and the face is a nice brown - green color , but still neutral . The hour handles are very easy to see , offset in white with black borders . My only complaint , and a minor one , is that the date window is too small to be of any use , even if I correct my vision to 20 - 20 with reading glasses . I have a bunch of Timex watches sitting in my drawer , I admit . After the battery runs out , I am sometimes too lazy or disorganized to make a trip to a store that will replace a battery . When it only costs around $ 30 for a brand new , spiffy Timex Expedition watch , why bother ?
5 #### I got this for my dad for Christmas and he loves it and plus he is a huge uva fan just like me
5 #### My kids love this scooter . I bout it for my younger son who is 8 but my 11 year old loves it too . My 17 year old has even taken it for a joy ride and its got plenty of power to move him around at decent speed . Works well and holds a charge well . I purchased the separate charger and have trained my kids ( sort of ) to plug it in when not using it and then its always charged and ready for fun !
2 #### I ordered four of the large size of these shirts for general use in the sun . They probably would have performed OK , but the cut of the shirt is very large in the midsection , and I am not . This is not apparent in the picture . They are quite expensive , so I would want them to fit well . I returned all four .
5 #### My mom wanted to get this for the kids so I ordered it for her . My kids have so much fun playing all the different games on this board ! Even my 5 yr old can play most of the games !
2 #### Unlike the edited photo put up by Cycleaware they do not come with glasses which is not make Clear . With that in mind this is not for persons who use wrap around sunglasses , with are safer , as the lens does need to be able to have a view behind you and will not . Also If you have perscrpition Glasses it is also not functional as you will not have your corrected vision for rear view mirror . Posted photos to show packaging .
5 #### Jockey is the BEST . the have larger sizer and are n't afraid to sell them . Large woman need cotton comfort and Jockey gives me that .
5 #### Great swivels , as I expect from Uncle Mikes . Ad did not say they were pairs , but thanks to previous reviewers , I knew .
5 #### I absolutely love this knife . I try and spend as much time outdoors as possible . As such , the things I wanted the most were a blade ( obviously ) , saw , and tweezers ( for pulling out seemingly endless splinters ) . The thing I did NOT want is a cork screw . I 've yet to stumble across an unopened bottle of wine in the woods that just had to be opened and drank at the moment ( yes I realize you can use a corkscrew for different things but I just do n't need one especially for the real estate it takes up in a knife . ) Obviously when you talk about tweezers , Victorinox is where you 're looking but precious few fulfil those needs without the dreaded space hogging corkscrew . This one does . It is my ' dress ' carry . The other knife that fulfills the above requirements but is much bigger is&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Victorinox - Swiss - Army - One - Hand - Trekker - NS - Pocket - Knife / dp / B001DZT0M0 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Victorinox Swiss Army One Hand Trekker NS Pocket Knife</a>&nbsp;and yes , I bought that one too and it is my ' casual / jeans ' carry . Love these knives .
3 #### The torso needs to be a bit longer . Great material .
3 #### How can a package of 3 pairs of panties have 3 different fits ? One was perfect , one was a tiny bit small and the other seemed just a little off center somehow . Jockey has been my brand for a long time and I 'll keep buying them , but I 'll know that the fit is not consistent from pair to pair .
5 #### This is my second on of these watches . I loved the first one but the place i took it to get the battery changed did n't put the seal back on right and it lost its water resistance . I never take my watches off and i swim a lot so it is usually very water tight the indigo is a nice feature and it is dressy enough to wear for work .
4 #### these fly good and do n't hurt when you catch them
5 #### This butt pad tames my very light .300 WM . The limb saver pad it replaces had been on for 10 years !
4 #### Perfect for my skirts . Ca n't get too many uses out of them but I guess that 's partially expected .
5 #### Got my turtle fur neck warmer today , and it 's exactly what I wanted . It 's a very thick , double - layered fleece that seems like it will be a lot warmer than a regular scarf or other types of neck / face warmers . It 's also quite soft and comfortable to wear , no itchy fleece here ! I 'm happy it 's stretchy enough to stay up over my nose without being uncomfortably tight . Only thing about it that 's a little different than what I wanted is the color . I ordered it in Poseidon Blue , and it 's not even close to the purple - blue color shown in the picture ... instead , it 's a bright teal color . But whatever the color may be , I 'm looking forwards to keeping my face warm this winter .
5 #### This is my second of these hats . The first one lasted several years , during which time it held up quite well in almost daily seasonal use until I lost it . Although not really military grade , this boonie is well enough made to be an excellent value .
5 #### Hogue grips are simply just outstanding ... These are not an exception .
5 #### Small but it fit me 5'8 " 210 lbs and my 3 year old . Took it out on the lake and it held up great . Came with 2 surprisingly decent paddles and a pump . I definitely got my money 's worth out of it and will absolutely buy it again .
5 #### These socks are almost a year old and look new ! They are heavy and keep feet warm in cold weather .
5 #### Decent scope for the money . If you are looking for high precision at 100 yards , though , like seeing a 30/06 hole in a paper target ..... then keep looking . Good out to 50 yards , though .
5 #### It 's specifically made for marine and scuba gear but I use it to lubricate the o - ring on the watch backs when replacing the batteries . 2 oz . will probably last me 30 years for that purpose . It 's also great for use on any products that have o - rings and rubber seals .
5 #### It nice heavy cast iron , that folds flat for easy storage and keeps your dutch oven lid out of the dirt , What more could you ask for .
4 #### They are great shoes and I adore chucks for their style and simplicity
5 #### my favorite watch ! Always buy timex ! Easy , dependable , not too expensive , great for a careful shopper like I am . Bought this brand for over 50 years . ( old guy you know ) .
5 #### The boat arrived quickly and has been great for the summer !
4 #### I love this style billfold but agree with others that it would be nice if the coin pocket and picture insert were leather as well . It is a cheap plastic but it serves the purpose .
3 #### i got the persimmon orange and hated to have to send them back . they are really cute and i love waterproof everything , but the arch really pinched for some reason . everything else about it was OK . I had bought 2 other pairs of Keen sandals and they had no pressure points on them at all , so these really stood out as painful . I returned them that day .
5 #### Works great ! Wo n't scratch . Love the extra keys . Great pack of 3 !
1 #### I really do n't know how this pantyhose would have fit because as soon as I opened the package and prepared to try them on , I noticed a hole in the " reinforced " toe section of one leg , large hole . One that was there when it arrived . Back in the package and I am returning for refund . They did feel very soft , shame I could n't try them on . Hopefully you wo n't have the same experience I had .....
5 #### My two year old was all about Dora the Explorer 's new fantastic gymnastics episode when Santa brought this for Christmas . At like $ 7.95 then it was a great little something to put in a box with a new leotard .... Little did I know it would be the hit of ChristmAs ! Perhaps her favorite present of all time . It eventually got so ratty from all that play that it " got lost " during our move . I should probably buy another b it was so loved .
4 #### Looks good , comfortable , cam wear with any outfit , I love and my favorite shoe till now but started pealing from inside may be I need to change insole otherwise its great great shoes .
5 #### I have worn this model watch for many years . I especially like the indiglo feature . as well as the day / date feature .
5 #### Great ... it 's a baseball folks :) When visiting a MLB ballparks seeking autographs , you 're much better off having a good pen in hand with an authentic MLB -- works wonders and players know it .
5 #### I can always rely on Keen to provide me with the comfort and durability I 'm looking for in a shoe . I love the color and fit of these Venice H2 's . Highly recommend them !
5 #### This fit my Remington 1100 12 gauge perfectly and it 's rock solid on the gun . My only con is that all the edges are pretty sharp and if you are not careful you can easily cut a finger . Otherwise it does just what it is suppoosed to .
5 #### Comfy . Easy to clean and easy to wear . Thick strap and material is supportive .
4 #### I really like these shoes , but either they just do n't fit my foot correctly , or I just do n't care for their lack of comfort . I bought my girlfriend a pair of women 's , and she thinks they 're extremely comfortable , so I may have to look into getting a wider size . My feet usually fit in regular shoes and wides seem to be a bit loose , but these shoes must run a little narrow , so if you 're in the same boat - get a wider size
5 #### perfect if you like the naked foot look in a shoe without your foot actually being naked . These are hard to find any more at department stores in California .
5 #### I wipe on and then wipe off excess . This product is cheap and works .
3 #### A little difficult to keep on , but worked when they did !
5 #### Great for starting campfires under wet conditions . Easy to start and burns a long time . Pleanty of youtube reviews of this item .
5 #### This top replaced one that I have worn for ages and it fits and feels exactly like the old one . I wear it under sweaters in very cold weather and under jackets for running . It is light - weight and keeps me warm .
5 #### The all black look is great and slim so it works well with the back in style skinny jeans look for guys . Not the best arch support though so be wary of that . The shoes came quickly and although it seemed like they had been tried on ( dust or animal hair on the bottom ) it did n't seem as though they were worn outside or anything beyond being sampled as most shoes in any store would encounter if not purchased .
3 #### That 's the quality of all Chucks though . They just suck , plain and simple . I mean , if you like that not perfect look then by all means , but if you want a prefect shoe do n't buy Chucks .
5 #### I use these to stick on to the large paper targets issued free with lane rental at my local range . They work exactly as advertised and were delivered VERY quickly . I will definitely be buying them again .
4 #### Watch is fine but it cost me an additional $ 20 to get the band adjusted
2 #### These wear out way too fast . Chuckie T 's I get at a store last about a year . These last only about three months . I have questions about their authenticity because of the huge difference in durability .
5 #### Great Gift - she loved it ! It 's a nice shoe !
5 #### My daughter has a small wrist so she wears it over her long sleeves . Comfortable for young kid
3 #### I 'm not going to impress anyone with the taste of this , but it works for dinner . Each pack is supposed to be 2 servings , I count on 4 . Even so , 2 packs are lighter than 1 MRE .
5 #### Love these shoes ! My 12th pair of Chuck 's and of course they 're the best ! !
5 #### We gets watta frum a spring near are house . Works gooder than mason gars .
5 #### Arrived in time . Fit as exoected . They take some breaking in but I wore them 2 days in a row for more than five hours per day .
4 #### Have been wearing Wrangler 38x30 jeans for years . They always fit . For some reason these are about an inch and a half too long . What 's up with that ?
5 #### My husband LOVES these socks . His job requires him to often be outdoors and indoors in extreme temperatures ( hot and cold ) through out the day . He also is an avid outdoorsman . He loves that these socks keep his feet warm and dry . He probably has more than two dozen pair of these and other similar smart wool socks . We recently introduced my Father - In- Law to them and he also loves them . He is a diabetic , so taking care of his feet is important . He also likes that his feet stay warm and dry , and he does n't have a problem with seams or an uneven texture leaving marks on his feet .
5 #### Bought a couple of these , one for my wife and one for me . Have n't really had the chance to use much but what little we have we 're very pleased with them . I like the focus mechanism which is a paddle in the middle of the binoculars . Much easier for me to use than the standard rotary . Also has the on adjustment for the one eye .
5 #### I have had several hearing protectors over the years and the Bull 's Eye 9 is by far the best of the lot . Now all I have to determine is how long they will last . I have a pretty large head and the pressure to seal out the noise is not without noticing . I just hope the plastic parts hold up over time . I mow several lawns each week on a lawn tractor and the noise is unbearable without using some kind of hearing protection . I am also getting up there in years and want to preserve the hearing that I have going forward in life . I have a significant loss of hearing from various working environments I was exposed to over the years . I see people wearing headphones with the volume so loud and it takes all my willpower to not tap them on the shoulder and ask them if they are aware of the damage they are doing to their hearing . What a deal on Amazon for these hearing protectors .
5 #### This sports bra is the one if your a C cup or above . I am a DDD and never have I found a sports bra that can hold in the girls during cross fit and running . It is a bit uncomfortable to get on but , once one it is great ! I have bought quite a few online and had to return them all because they just did n't hold up to anything more than walking .
5 #### Please ladies , we have to forget our egos when we buy pantyhose . Determine where you are on height weight chart and go up minimum of one size , best bet is two . I am small ( by some standards , ) 5'3 " 110 lbs wear size 4 - 6 ( most manufacturers , but some as much as 10 ! ) I have always gone up 2 sizes in every manufacturer , leggs , hanes , walgreens , and even in Spanx ...... believe me , if you put them on properly they will fit and you will get many many wearings .. I usually only get a run or snag from " foreign " object or dog . Believe me no one is going to check or ask what size pantyhose you wear , or just say , " a lady never tells " .
5 #### quite pleased with this product , exactly as described in the website was described acorrectly would purchase agaIN WITHOUT MAKING ANY HESITATIOON
5 #### I am very pleased with with my scope . Its everything I exspected and more . It has very good optics and the clatity is amazing .. I 've used scopes of much higher cost and they were no better than this one . I 'm very impressed with this product .
5 #### These shoes are wonderful , the fit is perfect . I have been buying these shoes for thirty years now and the quality remains the same .
3 #### The size 9 I purchased was too large . I think I may return them .
5 #### I wear a size7 1/2 in women i got a size 5.5 in the big kids size and they fit great i love my timbo 's they were shipped as expected and the material is great i will buy a pair for my nephew they are great you guys please get your timbo 's here ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Oh and i m a first time buyer as well
5 #### I bought for my medial epicondylitis ( golfers elbow ) works well takes a little bit to understand how to use but my PT liked the movement . Thought it would speed the healing up .
5 #### I 've had one of these for years for my personal use and I gave one to a buddy of mine for Xmas in which he loves it . The knife holds a sharpness well and goes with any survival bug out bag that you may have . It 's a great addition to your hunting gear or to have around the house .
5 #### I use these with an SKS Sling on a rifle I own . Easy to use . Dependable . Just what the doctor ordered ...
5 #### Works great at the range . I fire 9 mm and 40SW pistols and these really help !
2 #### I did n't care for this because they are made for children and I 'm not a child . I guess for a small child the cap would be fine ; I do n't know but it was much too small for me .
4 #### Wish they had a little more support / cushion , but I love everything else about them !
5 #### Ca n't say anything but positive things about this brand . I also like the flexibility the handles offer . Some have solid handles which make certain hand / arm positions uncomfortable . Blue offers considerably more resistance over the red . Ca n't wait to use it .
3 #### This cooler functions as any cooler should . Keeps ice , has a built in drain plug , and has solid carry handles . My only issue with the cooler is how stiff the lid is . At first I thought " hey maybe it just needs to get broke in " . NOPE . I ve put a 10 lb bag of ice and a 24 pack of Miller in this thing and when I go to open it up the amount of force it takes to get the lid pried open will actually lift the cooler off the ground even with all that weight in it . So I bought a standard pull handle and mounted it to the top of the lid and it would still do it every once in awhile . So I did what any other normal person would do . I mounted an aerator on it and turned it into a decent fishing livewell .
5 #### Great quality t - shirt with a neck that holds its shape and appears it will not stretch . Nice shirt -- just ordered another !
5 #### First time owning white but have owned many black . Nice product . Great look !
2 #### These shoes are poorly constructed and I do n't expect them to last more that one summer . Would not recommend , and will not order another Nike downshifter series again
4 #### Does a great job at shutting out noise . They are deceptively small when they arrive . Almost a little too small for my ears . Fits my wife comfortably . My only concern , in the future they might not " hold " well . The ear pieces will slide up and down with a firm grip , but I feel like that might wear out over time . Good for beginners , but not sure how long they will last . I will update if anything changes .
5 #### Exactly as described . I wear a size 8 women 's and bought a size 6 men 's and they fit perfectly . Love the new chucks !
4 #### This is my first expensive mat , I was tired of the cheaper mat I had not staying in place and needing extra padding under my knees sometimes . This mat is great , but is still slippery after 10 classes , so I may have to try and clean it to see if that gets better . It 's also heavy enough that it stays put and I have n't needed extra padding under my knees yet .
2 #### Small air inlet , not compatible with a pump . Takes too long to inflate and deflate .
5 #### Very nice , very sharp and good size . It feels very balanced like it could be throwable , but I would n't recommend it . This knife just feels good . I have no complaints , especially for the price .
4 #### A little big . I ordered wide but regular would suffice .
5 #### This is a Christmas gift for a 10 yr old girl . I 'm positive she 'll love it .
5 #### My shoes arrived earlier then estimated . the shoe is comfy and well constructed just as I remembered K Swiss to be . I love these brand of shoes and they r no longer carried in all the stores like before , Thank you for the opportunity to buy my favorite shoe and for such great service . I will order from this company again as I did communicate with them and they promptly returned my call twice ; as I did have questions
4 #### My other pair of dickie shorts fit a little tighter and did n't seem quite as long . I am pretty sure they were the same style so maybe I ve changed sizes or something . By somewhat large , I mean just barely , I do n't need to wear a belt , but I usually do .
5 #### Glad I was able to get these converse on sale and they fit exactly as expected . The color is also as bright and cute as the picture . I ordered the pink sapphire in size 3 D(M ) US because normally I am a size 5 in womens shoes .
5 #### I was surprised at how well this was made and how strong it is . I am going to buy several more and lock up everything I own !
5 #### Find a large field , these things will fly ! And your kid ca n't break it . 3 years later .... we still have this thing .
5 #### I was looking for a shade of sheer pantyhose that blend well with my skin without looking like I have on pantyhose . These worked out great . Unfortunately , I ripped them first day out . Would give these another chance though .
3 #### I normally wear a 14D ( M ) US ... However when these shoes get that big , they run about a full size big . So I had to get a size 13 instead .
5 #### I was skeptical to believe this could help my tennis elbow but desperate to try anything with the burning pain I was experiencing . I am shocked and amazed how much it has helped ! ! ! It really relieves the pain . I 'm very glad I gave this a try ! ! !
5 #### The watch looks good and is comfortable . Keeps time well so far . The band is ' Women 's Standard ' whatever that is . I had to remove 4 links to get it to fit but once that was done it was good .
5 #### I drive a zamboni for a living , so I 'm always walking on ice and cold concrete . I needed something to keep my toes from going numb with cold . One issue is my insulated boots do n't breathe well so my feet sweat and get wet , so cotton did poorly . These socks , albeit a bit expensive compared to cheapo bulk pack cotton , are a great sock . I 'll be buying several pairs .
5 #### Not much to say other than it 's a boonie hat and seems to be well made . I like the color , it goes well with my Hazard4 Poncho villa which is why I got it in the first place . A nice combo for wet weather .
5 #### Way thicker than I expected but that 's a plus for me . Put it on a Bell and Carlson A5 fully adjustable stock to replace the thin stock pad and I could n't be happier . It 's a perfect fit . I did have to drill out a hold as I needed a way to get to the adjust screw for the stocks length of pull adjustments , but I did and it works like a charm . Will certainly fit limbsavers on all my other long arms .
5 #### Suffered a stroke . Great support and no shoe laces . Love the quality .
4 #### Very soft- heavy fabric- not really meant for those with a small waist(even with a baby ) and huge breasts . I am a 34F and my breasts basically protrude out of the slit that 's meant for breast feeding .
2 #### Not in women 's sizes . I ordered a size down and I 'm still swimming in them . They 're going back .
5 #### great item for wrists and elbows you can do also the same exercises for a power spring with the thera - band and its a lot safer too
5 #### Nothing fits as well as these . Great comfort , decent price . Watch for sales . They are the most comfortable briefs you can find .
5 #### I 've used this type of Buxton wallet for many years - to the point I buy my purses to accommodate the wallet . It 's not designed for a small purse , but an overly large purse is n't necessary either . They hold up very well , have lots of pockets , have plenty of room for change , check book , register , paper money , hidden compartments and license holder . I purchased the one with the RFID protection as an extra precaution .
5 #### Works like a charm i love the magnetic clip as it wo n't stretch out after multiple uses and it looks nice and very convenient as it slides in my back pocket and is so slim
5 #### Fast shipping , great color , daughter loves , just as expected . Thanks !
5 #### My son loves this . I was nervous about the size being to big but its perfect for my 11 year old . Went together pretty easily , all connectors are labeled . Everything arrived in perfect condition and feels sturdy . We 'll see how it holds up through winter .
5 #### Mine are unbleached white I love the color and think they 're pretty awesome
4 #### I like this bra because I 'm full figured . However it did not give me the lift that I desired . Its fits very well . Also , its great for sleeping and wearing around the house .
5 #### My back is rippling with muscles in large part to this helping me during p90x & hammer & chisel type workouts .
4 #### Do n't have the stretch that I would like to see ... Very tight fit , especially for scoped guns which requires a lot of manhandling to get this to work . Ca n't beat the price though . For unscripted guns it works well .
3 #### The shoes are great and comfortable BUT I received a defective pair . The left rubber toe is bigger than the right . Not nice
5 #### It was PERFECT on my lil angel ! ! she wore this outfit and made it look like a million bucks ! ! great quality , IDK why everyone is saying it is crappy cheap material ? Infact I ordered this thinking I could only get 1 night ( Halloween night specificlly ) out of it , BUT its not as shady put together as sum of these peeps are leading us to believe .. YES its not something she can wear Once per week month after month , BUT it was better than I initially thought it would be ..
5 #### Gorgeous vibrant colors . This was a gift for my husband- he is super happy with these items .
2 #### These are NOT good for the avid hiker IMO , I 'd consider them to be a medium cushion . They stretch too much and your foot slides inside the sock and the sock slides inside the boot . I do n't know what the " other " make up is but it seems to lack wool and have lots of material that stretches and is slick to feel . It might work fine for light use but for hiking , not so much . It seems that good wool hiking socks with a heavy cushion are getting harder to find .
4 #### This bra fits well , is pretty , shapes me nicely and is overall pretty comfortable . As one reviewer noted though the underwire pieces are a bit stiff and every time I move my arms they .... well , they squeak . Never had this happen before so am just hoping they soften up and the squeaking goes away soon . Ca n't really concentrate as I chuckle every time I squeak . Keep wondering if anyone else can hear it and if so , what do they think it is ? ?
1 #### Why are Danner boots all so narrow even in EE width ? Bummer .
3 #### OK but not as good as the heavier compression knee highs in light duty ( not Hanes ) . These do not last long .
3 #### I 've used about 5 double packs and 3 bags out of the 10 were duds . Just hard bags that do n't warm up even if you crumble the inside .
4 #### this is pretty darn good grip spray . i would highly recommend not using a ton of it at a time . One at bat at the end of last season and I ripped a finger on a brand new batting glove .
5 #### Bought this for under my wedding dress ... I wore it around for an entire day to get a feel for it and it holds in place very well ! ! ! Covers just enough to go over my muffin top ( one main reason i needed this ) , but not too far down to where it was digging deep into my hip bone . They are not the comfiest to wear in the first place when sitting or trying to bend over but of course that is expected when wearing a bustier ! ! I would recommend this one to anyone ! After trying 2 other ones this one is my favorite . The boning is very flattering and smooths out the stomach problem areas .
5 #### Nice entry level product from Razor . Surprisingly good quality . It folds to take up very little trunk space . Its getting more use than I hoped .
4 #### I use ankle braces for all court sports ( racquetball , tennis , squash ) & volleyball . Best ankle brace that I have ever used .
4 #### The hip size is somewhat little tight , but overall look ok .
5 #### This bra is the best fitting of any , I have worn this style for over 15 years now . I have a size 32 back with a d cup and can not find anything that supports the chest like this and it is very flattering !
5 #### If you have the Thule bike rack , then you need this lock . Well , maybe not NEED , but it certainly makes securing your equipment easier . I do n't leave my bike rack mounted on my truck , but when I do , I 'm glad I have the lock because the rack was not cheap .
5 #### My daughter will not wear anything else other than Converse for her school uniform attire . She literally wears them out until she needs a new pair .
5 #### I would recommend theses hooks to anyone I 've bought them in the past and just stocked up on my supplies for fishing this year they are great hooks I got them in 8/0 and 7/0 .
5 #### They are chuck taylors what else is there to say . order 1 size smaller then normal .
5 #### I 'm biased to converse because they are all I wear . Great fit & price .
5 #### my son is 165 lbs . and works perfect for his weight range .
5 #### Great starter magic toy for my 4.5 son . My son and his twin sister loved showing each other the disappearing and reappearing rabbit . Gets kids playing for hours . Such a confidence builder . I highly recommend it if your child is interested in magic . I bought it in combination with the " My First Magic Set " .
5 #### Great Product Good Price Quick delivery Am very satisfied with the product very good job will be ordering again next year for other projects
5 #### I 've been a Merrell fan for a long time . These shoes are not only stylish but extremely comfortable . I highly recommend these shoes .
2 #### beautiful bur the quality is median . you only can use inside not outdoor
5 #### This is a great mask with a great seal around the mask , i also use a pair of no fog goggles and i do n't have to waste time trying to see or breath in a dusty loud . Make sure that if you buy a mask it is ment for what you use it for .
4 #### My husband likes the color and really likes the quality . He wears it , but it is too big and looks a little sloppy . I ordered this kind of shirt because I got him one from a store and it was the right size .
5 #### Took a while to figure out how to attach them to shotgun , but U - tube came to the rescue .
5 #### I workout at the local crossfit and find that these shoes help give me good support with my endurance workouts .
5 #### Arrived quickly in a practical yet attractive organizing bag . With 2 sets of these bands I can really tune my workouts . So now it goes like this : 1 . Do as many unassisted pull ups as possible 2 . Cheat on a lot more pull ups and then stop before damaging shoulder and neck 3 . Use bands to get to 100 % failure without a medical emergency The quick connect system is great- super easy to dial the resistance up and down . Seriously- good product- why waste your time at a brick & mortar- just have Amazon deliver these suckers in 48 hours or less !
5 #### Top is comfortable and easy to wear . Product holds up well when washed . It allows for modest nursing and is comfortable . I would buy this top again . Small is a bit large on my approximately size 8 torso .
5 #### Good product for the price . Used very day and no problem .
5 #### I used this grip to wrap the handle on some DIY fat bar dumbbell handles ( see review of 18 " pipe ) . This served its purpose . The grip was easy to apply and has held up to abuse . DB 's are used daily and the grip has no signs of tearing or needing to be replacesd .
4 #### This is a well made boat cover . We have a 17 foot aluminum fishing boat with a center console and it covers it with ease . I must admit the strap situation is a bit awkward , but if you have help , buckling it down is easier . There is no way I would take my boat down the highway with this cover on , there is too much slack in the fabric that would catch wind and send it flying away . Other than that it 's a good sturdy boat cover for the money .
5 #### My little soccer player is super happy to have this . So is this mom who was the one retrieving the ball all of the time ! ! Excellent to have this bounce them back to her . Easy set - up and stores tiny .
5 #### Wore these for travel with tons of walking . Felt comfortable on the street and hiking with these . Very comfortable . Easily slip on and off . Seems like everyone who saw them said they owned a pair and loved them too . I was worried that they would feel hot and be kind of clunky . Neither was true . Good airflow . Toe protection was a plus on the dirty streets and off road for me . Light and cushy sole .
1 #### I bought this from Walmart for the same price as Amazon . On my first use , the cleaning rod broke at the extension point and the plastic handle came off on the other one . I will never buy anything with Outers written on it . I am buying individual parts from Tipton and other reputable manufacturers to make my own cleaning kit .
4 #### Great product . Make sure you wash it a few times before you use it though . Otherwise you 'll have fuzz all over .
5 #### I often swam to the boat to go fishing for a few days . And if the food is not one , be sure to take a hike in the slab . Reliable thing . Taxing on fuel . Having two hot plates is very convenient . At one can boil water for tea , and the other is to cook dinner . And just two burners to cook with a lot more convenient . I put this product 5 stars .
5 #### My favorite solution for tying up my 16 foot Crestliner Fish Hawk ! Its fast and easy and secure . I can keep it attached to the other cleats along the boat when not in use and easily tie up my boat at the dock .
4 #### Handy things to have on hand for emergency , or to make a hot drink in the field when ever you feel like it .
5 #### Fits the shape of my orbits and forehead better than most goggles
5 #### I loved these hose , had wore them before and always well pleased with how they fit , how they wear and wars . The package it came in was tore and the hose almost out of the packing envelope --but the hose were not damaged .
5 #### I wear converse every day , and I love them . One thing I always do when I get a new pair is to get inserts to help with the lack of arch support and overall padding for walking on concrete floors all day . My feet have had arch issues before , so I always take a preventative route !
5 #### So comfortable ! I bought them strictly to wear in the water but they are so comfortable that I wear them walking too . Excellent arch support .
5 #### Just like the ones I bought last year at a better price .
5 #### Definitely feels rugged , but not harsh on the skin . Very good value .
5 #### Good shirt for work . Slightly loose fitting and like all Carhart products the shirt can take a beating
5 #### Cute ! I wear a 6 ordered a 6 and the 6 fits perfectly . Going to be wearing these in the clinic .
2 #### The product arrived on time as expected . However , When I got the product one eye was noticeably larger than the other and the mouth was smaller than expected . Oh well , you get what you pay for .
4 #### The size runs a little small . I wear a 7 3/8 order a 7 1/2 and even it was tight . The hat is well constructed but order at least one size larger than you normally wear .
5 #### This is a great dart board and has been holding up very well . the darts that come with it are n't the best but they work .
5 #### Just replaced the ones my husband has had for years .
5 #### Works great ! ! ! I suggest this to anyone ! It 's a great price as well ! Overall I 'm very happy with the purchase ! !
4 #### Great little knife for my son . Although it is not my pocket knife , the only con is the finish on the wood . I definitely think twice when it comes to a water situation . It could have also done with a little more fine grit finish sanding . But it 's a pocket knife not a table . Satisfied .
5 #### The fit on this was right on . The color is a very light black more like dark gray color . These work great to keep the legs feeling well supported and refreshed all day long . I had washed them and hung dry and all is good . I will probably buy a few more in the same color .
5 #### I love this . My elbows or arms can be hurting and I can exercise with this and it starts getting better right away ! Great investment !
2 #### There is a slight ridge that runs up the back inside center of the heal and I have gotten very significant blisters the first two times that I walked in the shoes for more than 20 minutes requiring days to nurse back to health .
5 #### Absolutely fantastic , comfortable and sized to actually fit ! Hard to beat carhartt for good comfortable working attire . Very happy to recommend .
4 #### I purchased 4 of these to tie off at slips in the marina 's . Works great if they have cleats . If there are not cleats it 's best to tie off with your ropes . Love em when there are cleats .
4 #### Satisfied so far with chucks . The design was simple and nice ( yes I do love this classic chucks design ) , comfortable to use , quality also seems good and I do n't have any issues with it so far . Will just update if I encounter any problems with it .
5 #### this watch is perfect in so many wats , the nice clean dial , the easy to read numbers , nice hands , and black second hand , date,50 m water resistant , very accurate , perfect size for medium width wrists and rests just perfect on your wrist , centered , not off to the left or the right.for large wrists it might be a little small , but for average to medium wrists it is a perfect fit .
5 #### Pretty basic target , but great price . They sell these things for $ 1.25 a piece at the range .
5 #### Very comfortable . Perfect fit . Got it as a nursing shirt and its ecsctkky what I wanted .
5 #### Got this to do the Tyler Twist for tennis elbow . Takes a little while to get the hang of the movement , but once you 've mastered it you can really feel it working the right muscles . Turns out my elbow pain was a bit of triceps tendonitis , not tennis elbow , so this bar was n't a big help for that . But I still do the movements now and then to keep my forearms in shape . A quality piece of equipment .
2 #### These things are not a snug fit ; so if you 're looking for lite - weight no support these are for you . Also , for those of us with smaller feet and shorter legs - the one size fits all is bunk .
4 #### Well made and as expected . I am yet to find googles that do n't fog up as advertised . Not sure why the false advertising regarding anti - fog . Every goggles has the same thing going . So yeah , these do fog up after the initial wear . Yeah , you do have to implement all those tricks to make it not fog up . But this fits well and my wife likes it . Four stars due to the anti fog thing .
5 #### This thing was a complete hit this christmas . After the scooter was charged up , we took it for a spin . The lighter the person , the faster it goes . For an adult ( within its max weight range ) , the scooter is manageable . But for a tiny kid , the jolt from acceleration can be a bit surprising . I was a bit reluctant to order the E100 due to the lower speed , but 10 mph is already a bit ridiculous for a kid scooter . Maybe you can get a normal Razor that fast ... down a hill .. with a breeze ... I could not image what terrible accidents 15 mph would cause . One counterintuitive " feature " is the requirement that you push start the scooter before it starts . Kids find this hard to understand and it does require a bit more speed than I thought would be needed . In a way , I consider this a safety feature . If you are worried about little kids randomly going up to the unit , pressing the accelerator and flipping a wheelie , this might be the one for you . It 's a little heavy to push on it 's own , but it 's not impossible . You could ride or push this scooter home without batteries if needed .
5 #### they are very nice and well made and very sturdy i am impressed with the quality of the suspenders and i like the color
5 #### This is a great , clean , good looking watch that works , and you can see it at night . I have paid many times this amount for watches that do not . That makes this a huge bargain . I may not wear it to a business deal , but perhaps I should . It 's honest , tells the truth , and shines a light .
5 #### Used this thing everyday on my vacation to Iceland in December . Very warm and loved being able to pull it up over my nose and mouth when it was cold and windy outside .
5 #### I 'm 5'-10 " 160 lbs . and they fit really well . Guessing anyone 200 lbs or less same height would fit ok in these nice and warm kept me dry when in the snow for several hours .
2 #### The brim is disproportionately too big to the cap size so it makes it look funny / dorky when wearing it . Returned .
2 #### These shoes came faster than I expected . Very cute . However , there was a thick staple through the bottom of the shoe that poked my toe .
5 #### Gorgeous lure- small and incredibly realistic . The other 8 reviews offer color tips for various fish and water conditions . Really like the light green and ditch colors . This is a really nice small sized bait .
3 #### The wrong size was sent . I walked them down to Walmart and exchanged for proper size . I do not know what the multi use pocket was intended for . I turned it into s single use cell phone pocket . Works good for that . I am not worried by my lack of fashion smarts and I tell those that complain to not worry . You will out grow your infantile judgement .
5 #### Great shoes . Excellent grip on dry or wet surfaces , even light snow . They last for years . Easy on and easy off .
1 #### Love the shoes but Too large not a size 8 women 's . Returning
4 #### Nice watch . Is a gift so not sure how it works yet . Gave it 4 stars as have not actually used yet . It is very pretty and looks much better then the price . An excellant watch for the price .
5 #### man , that 's a lot of targets . Really great for target practice .
5 #### I bought a door gym about a year ago while I was in an Army barracks in S. Korea and found that it would n't fit in the door way so I put it away to wait until I got back stateside . Once I did I could n't find the hardware to assemble it anywhere so I contacted Body Trends about ordering some new hardware . I received a reply a day or so later asking for my address and such and roughly 2 wks later I got the replacement hardware in the mail just like that ! I also have the ab loops and the extended reach bar . I am very happy with both the product and Body Trends customer service !
1 #### When I ordered these jeans , I thought that I would be getting a light weight fabric , but instead , these jeans were heavy and I ended up giving them away to charity .
5 #### I knew that Converse are zero drop shoes and have no arch , I was pleasantly surprised how comfortable they are . I 've been wearing them daily on a trip to Las Vegas , ( anyone who 's ever been here knows how far it it just to get to a place"across the street " ) . And I 've had no problems at all , even with my fallen arches . I love them ! I did buy them the same size I buy my running shoes . I 'm a 10 1/2 , but I wear a 12 running shoe .
5 #### Got this as a gift for my mother . She 's not too adventurous when it comes to color paletter , but this is a nice , deep , neutral red .
4 #### The dust cover is kind of weird but I use it anyway . The jewlery holder still has lots of room in the slot after I place a pair of earrings on each one so I ended up putting 2 or 3 pairs in each slot just to get more use out of it .
5 #### The Granite Gear Toughsack is very affordable , durable and a great overall purchase . I highly recommend it for all outdoor adventurers out there . You will be very satisfied .
5 #### I love these and have them in a light blue too . Very light weight , airy , and comfortable .
5 #### I love shoes ... I could n't wait to get these ... I had them in a few days and their great . I even got a pair for my son . I recomend the shoes and Amazon ! !
5 #### These shoes are amazing . Super sharp , stylish and fit in perfectly here in my professional life in D.C. Actually much more comfortable than I expected . I have tons of Stacy 's but this one is by far the most comfortable . I could n't find these on even the cheapest sites for less than $ 80 so at $ 51 with shipping out the door , this is a no brainer , order now ! !
3 #### These bra is definitely not like the Macy 's store bought . Too tight and straps keep falling off . Waste of money !
2 #### Considering the price I thought I would really like these but they were scratchy and even though I ordered using the sizing chart , they are WAY too short .
5 #### I bought two of these for my kids tae kwon do sparring gear and they work great ! They are much bigger than I thought they would be though , probably better suited for adult but it 's better than being too small !
5 #### The Converse Unisex Chuck Sneakers fit are just as expected and are also very comfortable to wear .
3 #### My son found them a little tight - he is a thin person . The quality is very good - well made .
5 #### I have several of these in different color ( different firmness).Good to use for a minute or two several times a day .
5 #### Extremely comfortable and holds up very well . High quality all around , definitely a great purchase .
5 #### This item fits great , and feels very comfortable , In my opinion works a lot better than the normal cotton ones . I would highly recommend .
5 #### Outstanding ! The fit is dead on ( which I will admit to being worried about based on reviews of other Wrangler styles ) .
5 #### Uh they 're Chucks . Sizing is just right and the color is great .
5 #### It 's great as a range scope . I can easily see .22ll holes at 100 yards . It would be better ( for range shooting ) with a 90 * eye piece optic so I could more easily use it to view my own shots .
5 #### Perfect fit , great price ! I found the same shoe in a store but $ 70 ! ! ! Here was only $ 51 ! I m super happy ! !
5 #### I am a solid believer in Keen products . I always know they will fit and there is no " breaking in " . I own about eight different pairs , from winter boots to strappy sandals and am happy with all of them .
5 #### I was skeptical about purchasing through a 3rd party but incredibly pleased with the free shipping , the fact that I received it two days after ordering , the price , and the product condition ( brand new ) . Back Country will be around for a long time with the kind of service they are providing . I honestly could n't have been more pleased with my purchase experience . Cathy in CA .
4 #### I have another pair of Carhartt coveralls and these seem to fit tighter than the other ones and i am not sure why .
5 #### My 4yr old son used these once at the BMX track but he wanted them taken off because we could n't get them tight enough for his little arms and legs . We 'll keep them for when he is older but will have to seek something smaller for him . There 's nothing wrong with the product . For reference our son is 38 inches tall and weighs 33 pounds .
5 #### Nice option for strengthening and balance . Recently had my knee scoped , and had a longer than expected road to recovery , due to high inflammation and lack of joint dexterity . I used something similar in PT , and this was a nice and affordable option to have at home for my workouts . Would highly recommend .
5 #### So I ordered 1 and got 3 ... I 'm not complaining ! Great lure !
5 #### It 's a SAK ! What more do I need to say ! But they do mean mini ! ! ! Lol
4 #### Bought this product for my old man . He says it fits well , keeps him warm and is of good quality . I can personally attest , have worn one for about five minutes . All in all a good product .
5 #### I love them . well made shirts that last . tall size is great if you are 6'2 . never comes untucked . would buy again !
1 #### Over the course of three uses , it turned an occasional minor twinge into constant pain that forced me to change my workout ,
5 #### Size 8 , but purchased 8.5 for a more comfortable feel , considering shrinkage as a result of perspiration .
5 #### Perfect for impact of shot on difficult to see paper targets .
4 #### I keep a few of these in my fire kit . I was able to boil water for oatmeal and coffee on a rainy morning . I prefer twigs and branches in my ' firebox ' stove though .
5 #### I am giving these shoes a top rating because they fit great , feel great and look very nice . This is my second pair of Merrell shoes ; the other pair are the Olmec slip - ons and are at least as good . Both pairs were an exact fit in my usual 11.5 size . From my two purchases the shoes fit and feel great as soon as I put them on . There is no break - in period for me and the comfort is better than any other dress / casual shoes I own . I have owned lots of GBX and Doc Marten 's and have ventured into Rockports and several other brands of dress shoe , but not a single pair hold a candle to these Merrell 's . I am a diabetic and am very picky about shoes and socks and if these were twenty five a pair instead of ninety plus I would already be trying out several more styles . I intend to purchase more anyway , but only as the budget ( and my wife ) will allow . You get what you pay for and these are worth the money . As an aside , one guy 's review mentioned that there are two " flavors " of these , the crisscross patterned soles or the oval knobs sole and to avoid the crisscross pattern . I did and am very happy with what I got .
4 #### After a few 30 mile rides , they are starting to break and are becoming one of my favorite pair of biking shorts .
3 #### Wish they where larger , looking for sixteen once but these will work in a pinch . Also arrived early making it good . Bill
4 #### I love the TheraBand FlexBar to help with my Tennis Elbow . It 's a great exercise and the right stiffness , and gives you some examples of how best to use it . It does tend to hurt the hand as you twist the bar , but I suppose it 's better than a bad elbow !
3 #### Recib el reloj en perfectas condiciones , me gust . Sin embargo , no es en realidad como se ve en la foto , la correa es de un color claro , no cmo se ve en la fotografa de la propaganda ( un color obscuro acorde con el color de la esfera , que es verde oscuro ) , eso me desepcion , deben revisar la foto y colocar una que se ajuste a la realidad , o mandar un reloj con el color de la correa que se ve en la foto .
4 #### I really do like these ( in Tennessee colors ! ) and my students think I 'm cool !
5 #### I love the shoe and it fit as expected the photos and description are accurate if you 're looking for a shoe that has more cushion or support try a different style but as far as wanting a lightweight and breathable shoe this is it . I am very satisfied with this purchase
5 #### I love it . It 's just what I hope for and I 'm really enjoying wearing it . Had to have some links removed , but I have a small wrist .
4 #### After Hurricane Sandy , I made a point to have several of these in storage to fill with water in case of an emergency .
1 #### If you look at the picture , you see the white converse so I bought it . When the shoes arrived , they came yellow . They should change the picture in order to avoid that confusion . In my case I do not live in USA so I had to settle
5 #### Love the color and fit . I use them to work on at the gym on the treadmill and they are very light and comfortable .
5 #### I 've been buying this model forever , my kid loves them and I like the way they fit . I made a mistake on the size so I had to exchange them for a 1 M size , my kid has just turned 8 , maybe this helps you with the size .
5 #### I wear a 34 waist in everything . I read on other reviews that these run small . I ordered a 36 and it fit great .
3 #### Decent product , but not much luck clipping it to anything . I bought this cigar clip specifically for the golf course and golf carts , and so far I have n't had any luck finding a place on a single golf cart where it actually clips and holds . I 've tried different golf courses and different golf cart manufacturers , and I 've only found one place ( out of dozens ) that the clip had actually worked and stayed attached to where I clipped it . I still somewhat like the product , including the bright color ( so you do n't forget and leave it on the golf cart or some other place for different applications ) , and the price was a little cheaper than other places I 've seen it . And the actual cigar clip piece is the right size and spring tension for multiple cigars widths . But it 's of little use if it wo n't actually stay attached to riding golf carts .
3 #### Very easy to assemble and looks good . The 2 Problems I have are it is so light weight I can move the entire net a few inches with a backhander and close to a foot with a wrist shot . This wo n't be a problem with kids and early teens though . I also do n't like how the plastic material that is attached to the netting touches the ground . It will probably rip the first time it freezes .
5 #### My 6 year old loves his new Razor scooter . He wants to ride this more than his bike now . He is even doing tricks already !
3 #### My 10 year old daughter just grew into a girl 's size 4 shoe . I ordered these in a women 's size 5 expecting them to be a bit big on her but instead they just fit and her toes were up against the edge of the shoe making them almost instantly too small for comfort . Very disappointing that these run so small . They are adorable and well made so we were really disappointed that we had to send them back .
5 #### These are AWESOME . We have a couple . They are the perfect length and neither has lost any elasticity and we are out every weekend on the boat . I recommend these to everyone .
3 #### Should have ordered the beefier version . This one is too weak . My bad .
5 #### This is a great pogo stick . Bought for my 12 year old son , pay attention to the weight range as my son is a little light at 110 lbs . With a 185 lbs adult it works as advertised , and the boy will get bigger .
5 #### This book is filled with adorable hats to make for babies and toddlers . I love how she uses embellishments , textures , and colors to make these cute hats . You wo n't need another baby hat book ever ! If you get Itty Bitty Nursery as well , you 'll be set . What a fun book !
5 #### I was n't sure how well this boat would work . My nephew and niece loved it ! They went out really far in the bay and it held up just fine . I never had to add air to it - it held up great . Awesome product and great price !
5 #### I have used my MC-2 G for about a year and am very impressed , I can not think of any improvements that I would make . To adjust the magnetic declination , the compass is flipped upside down for access to the adjustment screw and for direct reading of the declination scale . The fine green index line was a little difficult to see until I started the adjustment and the line moved away from the red declination marks . Now that I know what it looks like - it is easy to spot . Two of the scales read directly in miles , one scale for maps using 1:24000 ( 1 inch=24000 map inches ) and one scale for maps using 1:62500 ( 1 inch=62500 map inches ) . I believe the scales do not go to the corners of the compass because the corners are rounded , plus the three scales would then overlap . This is my favorite compass .
5 #### Comfortable supportive sandal . Great colors to choose from . Finally found a shoe that makes my feet and knee happy .
4 #### I did n't want to spend a small fortune for a release and this fits the bill perfectly . Works like a charm and it 's easy to attach to your wrist . Trigger is smooth and has no noticeable tightness .
5 #### I have always loved Timex watches as my everyday watch . My last one finally stopped working after 7 years . I replaced it with this one . The battery is supposed to last 7 years , and I 'm sure it will . I picked this one because of the flexible band . I do n't liked clasped watches if I am going to be removing it several times during the day . This one slips on and off so easily . The face is simple to read , and the Indiglo night light works great for a glance at the face at night . I have had it for 2 weeks , and it keeps perfect time . For me , there is no negative . However , I have a thin wrist , so the band fits me well . Since it is not adjustable , it might be tight on a thicker wrist .
5 #### Perfect for kids ! Great way to get their first motor under them and start roaming the neighborhood .
5 #### They look great on my son and it 's unisex do it can be passed in to post kiddos
4 #### So far they work . Just installed on my dock lines Time will tell how they last . Sun exposure , salt air etc . But they are just as described
5 #### love it it is part of what i use as back up
5 #### Great stuff , much better than other liquid and paste / creme compounds . Heat the metal and use 0000 steel wool to apply . Keep polishing with the steel wool until you get the color and depth you are looking for . Was really easy to blend into the factory bluing .
4 #### No son anillos muy altos , segn la mira que utilize no le van a servir , por lo que es mejor comprar otros ms altos para usarlos con diferentes miras , ya que para el 527 el mango del cerrojo choca en la mira , en mi caso una BSA 6x24 y no le sirve tuve que comprar uno ms alto de marca leupold para que funcione
5 #### Love these shorts they are very comfortable fit perfect . Wish I could find them in more colors
1 #### I do not believe what i received were even real timberland boots . They were supposed to be waterproof and they got wet immediately when i wore them in the snow . After that they were trash as the moisture never seemed to dry out and cause fungus to grow in them and on my feet ! I will not recommend ever buying this product to anyone . Terrible . What a waste of money .
5 #### These quirky , almost dorky shoes have been around a long time . If you determine and get the proper size they fit comfortably . The shoes have lasted longer than expected for me , and this model fits in well with many differing situations ( very casual , to fair dressy ) . Even though I sometimes cringe at the ' almost Minnie - mouse ' appearance of the toes , these are my go - to year - round casual shoes .
5 #### Great quality ! Great Fit ! Great Price ! We have several pairs of these and love them all ! They wear well and wash well !
5 #### This is the most adorable costume EVER ! I bought this for my very big 2 year old ( 38 inches and 34 pounds ) and 2 - 3 fit perfectly . I was amazed at how well this is made and the attention to detail .
4 #### I like the cardex very much . I like the color and the quality . I ordered this item because of the number of slots it has . My only negative comment regarding this wallet is that the card slots are a little to small . I hope that with time they will stretch out somewhat .
5 #### Works as expected . Seems to be a quality product . It holds my 12 lb rifle without issue while walking around on hunts .
2 #### have n't used it yet . looks very well made . but it did not come with how to use instructions they want you to buy there dvd at 15 dollars .plus shipping of course . do n't piss on back , then tell me its raining
2 #### This was a very pricey item that was a poor fit . While it was warm , the arms were too long and the material did not hold its shape once it was put on . It just kept stretching .
5 #### Hit the bullseye with this set of pasteable targets . Comes with its own self stick pasters ! Great for sighting in steel BB and pellet air guns . Works for firearms also . 1 target lasts a long time . Will absolutely purchase again ! ! !
3 #### This mat was HEAVY ! Ok , 8 lbs , is not heavy . I 'm not a 150 lb weakling but I do yoga 5 times a week and I did n't feel like lugging this thing around . It was a bit much . I had to return it . I think it would be great if I had my own yoga room where I could leave it out . Plus for the price , I needed to no splurge on such a fancy mat . It also came in a huge box . it was a waste of space . My replacement mat came in a much smaller box .
3 #### Bought these shoes with HIIT in mind , but not too sure how I like the fit on my foot . First time to wear them , not great for running . Maybe after they 're broken in a little they 'll get better . If you just need a comfortable pair of shoes for walking , they 're fine .
5 #### Drove from Chicago to Mt Rushmore , bike rack stayed on the car .... happy
5 #### I have a black colored type of this , and it 's been working great for more than 10 years now , which is amazing . Sometime , i never used for the entire year and left it in a garage , but the battery never died and holds enough power , still . Highly recommended . I bought it at R&I , though .
5 #### I actually used this to improved the grip and comfort of my Cold Steel Ghurka kukri machete handle . It 's soft and comfortable . Has enough for 2 grip uses , would buy again .
3 #### Man , do these things smell . Like a combination of dead fish and cat urine . Absolutely beyond horrible . We tried using them to light a fire after nights of drenching rain , and almost got there - but it would have been a challenge for a blowtorch . No complains really on the functionality , but the smell is just nasty . A fellow hiker had these unwrapped and just sitting in his pack pocket , and we thought something had rotted inside his pack . They work , but KEEP THEM IN THEIR PACKAGE UNTIL YOU NEED THEM . Even then , you can kinda sometimes smell the stink through the foil .
5 #### Love Bali bras . Yes they were a " little " large but I have lost weight and would have ordered a smaller size .
2 #### These only lasted three days on a building floor before they sprung a leak . Disappointing product and would n't order again .
5 #### You can not go wrong with Merrell 's . Excellent shoe at a great price .
5 #### Good product . Doe he job and it was a good price .
5 #### Thankful that I was able to find on Amazon for a great price and even better shipping . Arrived in perfect condition and did exactly what I needed it to . Great purchase and would purchase again .
4 #### Bummed it was only the jacket , head piece , and bowtie . Does not include gloves or the pants . Four stars because we were disappointed about that . Had to use a small beachball to shape the head . It was horribly smashed . But it works after reshaping for a few days .
5 #### Great for salt water fishing . Salt water fish have toothy and powerful mouths . One need to watch out for oyster shells as well .
5 #### Last year my then - husband had severe tennis elbow due to repetitive motion while lifting heavy that render him unable to work . At the advice of his doctor , I bought the red , green , and blue TherBand Flexbars for him . Within a few days of using the Flexbars , starting with the lower resistance red bar and working his way up to the higher resistance blue Flexbar , his tennis elbow pain rapidly lessened and was completely gone within a week or so . He continues to use the bands to prevent a flare up . Recently a friend complained of pain in his elbow that sounded similar to what my husband had from handling his heavy equipment and running his carpet cleaning business . So I recommended he pick up the Flexbars for himself . My friend purchased a set and again , within a few days , he called and said it was a miracle that the pain was gone . Since I got divorced and my ex got the Flexbars in the divorce , I recently purchased a set for myself . I use the Flexbars to relieve elbow pain from being on the computer a lot and carpal tunnel issues . It does n't helps so much for the carpal tunnel ( they do n't advertise as such anyway to my knowledge ) but I do think it helps a little .
4 #### DK 's The Nudes are the best pantyhose ever . They 're like a second skin , making your legs look nicer . Only one issue : they do n't last long .
5 #### EXCELLENT STICK ! Made many a save with this goalie stick . It 's a little heavy and takes a little getting used to but once u break it in its excellent ! Should n't dissapoint !
5 #### I bought a package of these in 4/0 size from a huge department store two years ago . If memory serves correctly , I still have 3 of the five and have caught several 3 - 10 # channels and only lost the two that I had to cut off due to being out witted .
5 #### This is my first pair of converse , and they fit great . I was really confused about the sizes , but I just read the reviews and a majority of people were just recommending purchasing 2 sizes below . So I 'm a women 's 8 and I got these in a 6 and they fit perfectly with or without socks on . Love them and loved the price .
5 #### They do what they are supposed to and as the package states " low profile " which turned out to be to low for me . In any case , they attach securly and are plenty bright .
4 #### Kids are having fun with it . I let them shoot ghastly gum ball we bought that everyone hates so stray shots do n't break windows or anything like that . Accuracy is n't all there yet but that is probably on us . The leather piece where you grab the balls is VERY soft and showing a little wear already , but overall it is a lot of fun for the money .
4 #### I have two of these .. One with normal pull and one with heavy pull .. Ammo holder pretty much a waste for hunting as the ammo rattles around inside and is rather loud .. Ninety percent of the time I do n't use the wrist brace as most of the shooting I do is off handed .. Wrist brace is good for power or long range shots .. Helps to steady the shot .. Aluminum so is light and last for a really long time ..
5 #### It 's always difficult to choose footwear on line . This is the type my granddaughter wanted for her birthday . The price was a bit more than I expected , but it 's been many years since I 've bought skates , so understandable . They came today and I and my granddaughter could n't be happier . These are very high quality skates and roll easily . I 'm super impressed and recommend them to anyone looking to order roller skates .
4 #### This is a very basic sling ; just some nylon straps and a standard pad . That 's a compliment , not a criticism ; fancy slings are good for some things , but for a normal hunting rifle this is ideal . Gel pads have too much bounce when I 'm walking , and too much give to steady offhand aim . I do n't need non - skid backing or elastic loops to hold ammunition . For what I want , this is well - made and economical . By the way , this sling does NOT include swivels . If you do n't have spares , you should consider buying one that does include them , because if you buy them separately that can add $ 10-$15 to the total price of the sling . There are Allen slings on Amazon that have swivels installed for just a few dollars more than this one . This is truly the no - frills model ; what you see is what you get .
5 #### After 2 years of wearing I think my 10 - year old will wear it this winter too . It was somewhat large when purchased , but some thick socks did the trick . Very durable .
5 #### These Carhartt pants are holding up much better than the denim ones I bought on Amazon a while back . You just do n't know with items on Amazon sometimes as I have received the occasional counterfeit product ( which I try to make a stink about so more folks do n't get screwed ) but I think these are legit . They are stiff and will never really get soft which is fine because that 's how these pants are supposed to be , built to work hard and last ! When the welding is done I like wearing them on the motorcycle as they are solidly built and the double fronts bring a little extra in terms of safety .
5 #### Good quality just like all their products . 5 stars Update : almost 2 years in . Grip has held up fantastically good as the day I bought it !
5 #### This product is great for tennis elbow problems and can build - up the strength in your forearms to prevent any further re - injury . Purchase the set , beginning with the easiest and increae the firmness as you gain strength . These can be used to make other arms parts stronger as well because of its flexible design .
2 #### Thus is more a 4 T , will not fit 5/6 it states L / G 4 - 6 but untrue . Also the bow is not sequence , it 's just red . I would recommend hand washing and line dry , otherwise it gets very linty and the coat tails curl under . My son just turned 5 , I bought this 8 months ago , my son was 42 " tall in a size 4 - 5 T and he out grew this months ago .. Definitely a Toddler costume .
4 #### Seems to be a decent toy , about as rugged as could be , considering all children 's toys should be thought of as disposable . We bought it to help the kid with her balance after therapy was prescribed for a vision problem . She likes it . She uses it . Good enough for me .
5 #### Well , so far so good ! I just got these today and my son lives them they are quite large , so if you have a bigger son , these will fit great . As far as construction , the seem as though they are put together quite well . The color is very bright . There is n't much " fluffiness " to these , but my son says they are warm .
3 #### This is a fine , easy to install , and use , basic bicycle computer for a nice price . My only minor issue is that the cold affects it more than my other bicycle computers and the numbers move more slowly in cold conditions , even with a newer batter . But if you want a basic unit for a low price , then this is a good choice .
3 #### I FIND THIS A LITTLE STIFF NOT AS SOFT AS I REMEMBER OTHER BUXTON WALLETS AND A LITTLE HARD TO INSERT CRETIT CARDS
5 #### bought or my six year old daughter , I myself have been using them ever since I was in the Marines and all over the world and in cold weather climates . My daughter loves it and it is a very warm piece that fits great around the neck head and face . people forget that this is a multi purpose piece of cold weather gear that is a neck warmer a head warmer an ear warmer and a head warmer and it keeps the blood warm in the veins that normally would be exposed to cold air . I love this and my daughter is happy and warm and to me my daughter being warm and happy is very very important . plus it comes in pink for her who could not love that . lol ok i m tired of pink but my six year old little girl loves pink and if it makes her happy then I am happy .
5 #### I like these shorts . The material is nice and heavy -- good quality -- and they are well fitting and comfortable . Much better quality than comparables .
3 #### They fit different for some reason , My husband hardly wo n't wear them , because of the way they fit . Around the seat of the jeans do n't look right . He just wears them when he goes 4 - wheeling . Be then it do n't matter how they look .
5 #### Not only does the target present a more realistic training target it ... has vital organs shaded lightly in the diagram . Lets face it , we all hope to never employ a gun in a real defensive situation , but if your going to train this is a great target to train with . If your trying out combat shooting where you 'd rather get 3 shoots to vital organs quickly than a tight grouping slowly then this target will help you " score " your effectiveness . Cost effective and certainly made well for the intended use . I will buy more when my current stock is exhausted .
4 #### For the price you really ca n't beat this watch . It 's simple , looks great and keeps time well . The quality is n't astounding , if you pay more you could certainly get a nicer watch , but its real leather and stainless steel . If you want a good looking , functional watch that you do n't have to freak out about losing this is it .
2 #### This backboard feels flimsy . It looks ok , appears to be well - made , etc ; it just has a lot of flex to it . As a result , when the B - ball hits the backboard , the backboard flexes and this results in an unpredictable rebound . I mounted it to a brick wall using Lifetime 's universal mounting kit and 5/16 " Red - Head masonry anchor bolts . It 's not the mount that 's the problem , it 's the back - board itself . Do n't get me wrong , it 's not a terrible product for the money . But if you can afford something better , and basketball really matters to you , you can do better .
3 #### I normally wear a 36 " waist , these were a little tight around the waist . All my other Dickies ( 36 " ) still fit me comfortably . Not sure if I should try a different style .
4 #### I 've had my Timex T21919 for about a week . It runs well . I especially like the shape and the slim feminine wrist band because I have slender wrists and the strap fits perfectly . However , the inner box was poorly packed & crushed and the watch was off it 's casing . The bubble wrap was not wrapped around the watch to protect it . Instead , a small piece was just tossed in the box The outer delivery box was also crushed & poorly handled . Fortunately , the watch runs and I hope it continues . In summation , the watch is great but the packaging allows a high risk for damage .
5 #### Great as a back up in the backpack for camping .
5 #### The shoes are amazing , very comfortable and fit as expected highly recommended . :)
5 #### I oredered the xlarge based on the reviews I read . These fit well ( I ususally wear a large ) .
5 #### This thing works pretty damn well . Lights up awesome at night . I used it in a terrential downpour with 100 % operational effectiveness . the water resistant feature is honest . The battery does drain rather quickly , after perhaps 4 - 6 hours of use , and I know it is going to be a pain to change , as the battery housing is on there pretty good . I will check back in when i have successfully changed the battery .
5 #### I ordered these shoes for my boyfriend and he absolutely loves them . They look great and are true to size . He said he wishes these shoes had more arch support because he has to wear insoles , but that is typical of this particular shoe .
2 #### Not a fan of how these pads fit ( or rather make me look misshapen . )
5 #### I 've been a Top - Sider wearer for decades . This is my second pair of Billfish ; I just plain wore out the first pair . Like the first , these are a little snug when new but I 'm sure they will stretch out a bit with a little use .
4 #### I bought this cleaning rod to use on my .22LR caliber rifles . It does work okay on them but I think it is really designed to work best with 22 caliber centerfire rifles like .223 or 22 - 250 , etc . It is a tight fit when using it with a .22LR caliber rifle . But it does work and I still use it on my .22LR rifles . I thought the coating on the rod would be great to help protect the bore of the rifles but it seems to chip and scrape off easily on contact with sharp edges so I am not sure the coating is really needed . Other than that it is a good quality cleaning rod that I use often .
5 #### Great deal and excellent balls . I buy this pack every so often and keeps me busy for weeks ...
4 #### 2nd pair . great thin skinned gloves for warm weather . Primos stitching is average , expect a season or two of use before replacement . Good value for the price , I 'll be sticking with these as long as they continue to keep in the line up !
3 #### I always wear 2X Large but this shirt is HUGE and I have to return it for an XL . This is a great heavy weight material shirt that is very well made and very durable otherwise .
3 #### Super light and very comfortable . I 'm a runner and they lack a bit in arch support , so the soles of my feet are a sore . I 'm going to add an insert to try fix the problem .
5 #### Bought as a gift for a hunter , he likes them and says they are a good value .
5 #### My mom loved these breeches . She most likely will be returning these for a 32 , but the overall quality , fit and support was great she reported . FYI , she ordered a Devon - Aire ribbed in the same size and was clearly 1 - 2 " larger and WAY more elasticy & stretchy . My mom wanted a firm feeling pair of breeches , with more body and texture ... the Tuffriders were spot on ! I 'm a college softball player and to me they were more like softball pants , again , not paper thin like the Devon - Aires . In our hot and humid HAWAI'I climate , my mom hopes these breathe , the Devon - Aires looked more breathable because they were lighter ... but mom felt like it was n't a firm fit , she keeps tossing out firm and support ... you horsey people might get that connotation . I did do a side by side and yes , I can tell you that the Tuffrider did look sturdier and better made . Now , I 'm a rough athlete and so is mom , so we both look for that kind of stuff when choosing active wear . Hope this kind of helps . :)
4 #### Good kid bike kick stand especially for the money . A bit tight for little legs to operate .
2 #### These are 1/2 to 1 size too big . The ankle digs in , so if you ever have a problem with ankles rubbing on shoes , these probably will . After adding insoles and thick socks , my heels still slip out even though the rest of the shoe is snug . I have had several pairs of Merrels and love them ... these are not one . I am returning these .
5 #### works great getting some longer ones too as cleats are not always as close as you need them to be . Originally got two 3 ft cords , getting longer ones just in case .
5 #### Probably could have made my own , but this works really well . I have been changing and adjusting string by wrestling the bow the old fashioned way . This stringer is just the ticket . Bite the bullet and buy one if you use your bow a lot . You will keep your string just where you want it with a lot less hassle .
5 #### I RECEIVED THE PRODUCTS WITHOUT PROBLEM no hesitation in recommending I really like and is very useful is excellent product
5 #### Just ca n't beat timex , not fancy , not showy but practicle & durable love it
5 #### I have way too much jewelry . I 've tried a bunch of methods to keep them straight . I have two jewelry boxes and a wall unit of earrings . But I still have more . Maybe I need to stop buying jewelry . Anyway , I had tried putting earrings that I did n't wear often in a craft sorter but then I wore them even less . Well , never actually . So I wanted something that would keep them organized but easy to access . I searched through hundreds of pages on Amazon as well as Pintrest ( there are some fun ways to organize but nothing for jewelry hoarders like me ) . This was my choice and so far I 'm very happy . Make no mistake . This is not a small organizer . It is large and may not fit into many drawers so measure first if you want to tuck it away . The compartments are flocked ( lined with a soft , velvety fuzz ) and come in a variety of sizes . I have room for hanging earrings , short earrings and multiple earring pairs in each spot . There is also room for average ( not thick bands ) rings in the middle . The ' cover ' is really just a thick acetate that is cut to sit on top . Not really a cover in my book but enough to keep dust out and allow for quick access .
4 #### These are just fine . Wish they had a blank label so one could write the item onto the label . Otherwise they are what I expected .
5 #### Gave as a gift , but I got two similar ones for all my little girls and they are fine . The oldest can now tell analog time , and it 's only a matter of time before the 5ers get it too . Needless to say , they are ruthlessly abusive I have stepped on them many times and they have never had to be reset in 13 months .
5 #### The band was too large and I had to have three links removed . All the expansion bands are way too small , so this is as mall price to pay for comfort . I love the indiglo , because it lights up and I can see it in the dark .
5 #### I have had one of these for many years and has performed magnificently . Large enough for two people ( twice the weight means faster and longer travel distance ) but works great alone . Several times we have even strapped a ton of gear to it and used it to travel to a remote cabin . Tough , durable , easy to hang on to , and a good design . Just bought a second one this year for more grandkids . When the cheap ones break or get shredded , this will always be there .
4 #### Got these for friends to use because they 're cheap . I like them , but I prefer the ones I got at walmart ( the walmart ones fold up smaller which is nice ) . But these do what they say they do so I ca n't fault them !
5 #### Fat feet here . 3E fits me great even with thick cotton socks . Glad I went for the wider size .
5 #### These socks were make for hiking and they are perfect for that ! They are super comfortable and just the right amount of cushioning to ease your feet during a long day on the trail . Buy one size larger than normal as they are a bit tight . I normally wear a size 9 - 12 but ordered the extra large and glad i did as even those are slightly snug .
5 #### The Best walking sandals ever ! I love Keen Venice sandals.almost as much as their Newports .
5 #### Very comfortable . Sleeves do n't ride up and it stays tucked in well .
5 #### I always buy 3 star ping pong balls , but this is the first time I bought Joola balls . It wo n't be the last time . I do n't know if they really are that good , or it 's my imagination , but they seem a cut above the 3 star balls I 've bought at local stores .
5 #### With Christmas looming , I ordered these blue Converse Lo Tops . They arrived immediately ! Crisp , new and perfect fit for my daughter . The extra pair of navy shoelaces arrived two weeks later , separately . No problem , we all had a good laugh over the arrival of one pair of shoelaces , amidst all the flurry of Christmas packages . Thank you !
5 #### Arizona is a spectacular state . There is so much to explore , from the Grand Canyon to old mining town of Bisbee . North to south , east to west , this atlas will get you where you want to go . Even in you have a GPS , it helps to have a broader visual back - up . Get yourself an atlas and hit the road . Happy Trails !
5 #### They 're converse , what else is there to say . My daughter loves them .....
3 #### I 'm a shoe size 11 , which means I 'm supposed to be an x - large according to the chart . There is a cinch on the top but the long velco on the overlap is the primary means of attachment around leg and the velco band is n't that wide . Even around my pants , the velcro did n't line up - the x - large was way too big . Given the design , I 'm not sure why shoe length would be the primary sizing indicator . I would suggest buying closer to how you buy clothes , not shoes . My calf ( no pants ) is 14 " at it 's widest and XL is too big when I have pants on . I returned the item so I ca n't comment too much on performance or durability , but these things were built solid . First impression quality score would be 4 or 5 star .
5 #### Used this with our little camp stove . A very reliable fuel source that does not take up a lot of room and is safe to transport . Worked great for our needs of heating water for MREs and heating up food when camping .
4 #### very light weight problems with bill due to the weight
2 #### OK . Not as sticky as smearing pine sap on my dog 's feet , but decent . smells nice .
5 #### Great , silky thigh highs that fit perfectly ... even with my large thighs . The two bands of silicone really hold well not just adequately . They have the feel of an expensive silk stocking , and plenty of quality to go with it ! Very good product !
5 #### I always use Shoot - N - C at the range . The 8 inch version I use for 50 and 100 yards . I also have the six inch version for 25 yards or less .
3 #### I received it for Christmas . Charged it overnight and it wo n't start . Makes a clicking noise but it wo n't get going . Having it replaced at the moment and hopefully new one will work !
5 #### This is my third pair in this style . I love them .
5 #### These shoes last about 9 - 18 on me months depending on use . I have owned many , many of them over the years . If you are a repeat customer like me and you know your size , great . This was cheaper and faster than a trip to the shoe store . If you 're a new buyer , I highly recommend these shoes , but maybe you should try them on in a store first .
5 #### I tried it a few times inside the house . It has a fine sound that can be heard at a distance . It 's a different sound from the silver whistle tht I 'm used to hearing . All in all pple can hear it at a distance . It 's great it comes with an international code Depending on the number of times frm 1 - 3 the whistle is blown/ each blast has a different meaning .
5 #### Good grip on this and one hell of a work out .
4 #### the size runs bigger but I specifically wanted this brand because it was the only brand that did n't need " breaking in " and the shop in our area closed so I was ECSTATIC that I found it on Amazon
5 #### Fits my husband great , but make sure you use the sizing guide before ordering . My husband is a well framed man , but not a big guy and he was a XXL .
5 #### This was a Christmas gift for my husband and he loved it . Fit great and seems to be made with good quality material .
5 #### A challenging Flexbar when you are ready for your strongest resistance .
5 #### Good fit for the extremely lean and tall guy . What 's frustrating is that I used to get the 30x34 size at WalMart for $ 15 and now have to pay double since they do n't carry them in their stores anymore !
5 #### Good visibility and good durability . Great for saltwater application on a level wind reel .
5 #### These pantyhose are sheer , soft , silky and feel great on your legs . Wish they had a suntan color . Note that they are not heavy duty hose ..
5 #### great for soccer balls .. too bad could n't adopt it to baseballs
5 #### These Hot Hand hand Warmers are excellent . I bought a box for my dad who 90 years young and place them into his knitted gloves to keep his hands warm when needed .
5 #### Why do I keep getting the same reviews over again ? They 're Converse , they 're GREAT ! !
4 #### So far so good ( one wearing ) The fit is good . The quality seems to be there . ( still brand new ) Happy with purchase , if anything changes I 'll add to review .
5 #### This is an excellent neck warmer . Too quality fleece and very warm . Will be buying for the entire family . The only thing I would change would maybe be the shape so it can cover the entire neck and go up and cover all of my ears without any gaps . Still love it .
5 #### Carhartt always runs big . Known fact . Good jacket tough jacket ! If you 're normally a large in a hoodie get a medium in Carhartt
3 #### Do yourself a favor and measure , and just get a solid one . My daughter hates it , it 's hard to move , and I already greased it once . The black cap stays on for about 5 seconds before it gets lost .
5 #### MY GREAT GRAND DAUGHTER LOVES IT ... SHE IS FOUR AND A HALF . THANK YOU
5 #### I love them in every color ! ! :) The shoes are simple and perfect ! I have worn them for many years and I will continue to do so ! I highly recommend these !
4 #### I bought this to replace my heavier , bulkier and not that comfortable Marksman slingshot from WalMart . I really like this Trumark folder for it 's lightness and compactness but one of the bands broke at the fork after about + - 100 shots and I replaced it with one of the Walmart bands that has lasted over 2 years of use . I also wrapped the handle with a piece of 1/8 in . foam shipping sheet and Gorilla tape for a non slippery cushioned grip , also used a piece of same thin foam split and rolled to fit into handle under the swing cap with small rubber faucet washer glued to bottom of swing cover , no noise what so ever with steel balls inside now . Will order another band from Trumark Amazon , maybe I just got a bad one .
4 #### When I sprained my knee a couple years ago I spent about 6 weeks in physical therapy trying to get my stability back . As a Marine bad knees can kill a career , so after being restored to full duty I wanted to implement the exercises my physical therapist had me doing into my regular workout to try to prevent future problems . A BOSU balance trainer was something I had never used before this injury , and it was one of the first things I went looking for when I was done with physical therapy . This BOSU is just like the one I used at the PT clinic , and being 6'3 " and 230lbs I made sure I was getting something that would hold up to my weight . Because of my deployments and duty station transfers , this BOSU has spent 2 cold winters and 1 hot summer deflated in storage , and everytime it has pumped back up and been ready for use without any problems . The pump that comes with it is good enough to inflate the BOSU , but it 's cheap and instead of keeping it to use only a couple times a year I threw it away and use my bicycle pump instead .
5 #### This is my second pair of Merrell , I wear daily for work , very comfortable wearing all day .
5 #### Love it ! ! Just what I was looking for to put into the newly converted kid - cave .
5 #### If you need a spring for your heavy bag this will do the trick . It 's very tough and it 's very reasonable priced . I highly recommend this spring .
5 #### Fits on the Savage mkII , I only needed one to mount a red dot on my sons .22 fits the gun and the red dot perfectly and holds zero fine .
5 #### I use these to squat and for running springs fits great no complaints at all . Only problem is that they fit too snug if I wear thick socks but that s on me probably should have gone a 1/2 size larger
4 #### One hole needs to be widened about 1/4 " , then this fits perfect on a Mossberg 500TR , which has a shorter 12.75 " stock . The shape it a perfect match to the factory butt pad .
3 #### Easy to make a noise . Not sure if it sounds much like a squirrel but that just may be the user . The squirrels in mid Missouri have a " rasp " to their barks and this sounds more like a pets squeaky toy .
2 #### I used these balls on the back legs of my Walker . They wore out VERY FAST on the Concrete Walkway outside my house . I have found better balls elsewhere .
5 #### I 'm not one for making a fuss at Halloween , but this costume was low stress and high impact with my students and colleagues . It fit perfectly ( I wear a large ) and was easy to spend the day in . I 'll definitely keep it in my rotation for future celebrations at school .
5 #### Quality as expected for Carhartt shirts . I ordered a larger size and while it will be very comfortable the smaller size would have been a better fit . I will keep the larger - you never know .
5 #### I have been buying Silky Reflection pantyhose for over 20 years ! I love the soft feel on my skin . They fit just as the package fittings recommend .
5 #### Nice big rod , jetty , pierce to offshore fishing . Good price too . 2 pieces detached , I used for jetty fishing . good foam grips .
3 #### The shoe is too large . When you do lunges it hurts the heel . The shoe size from a local store is the size I ordered from Amazon however the size or fitting seems to be large
5 #### Bought for knee exercises after a torn meniscus / arthroscopic surgery . Takes a while to inflate , but has n't seemed to deflate . I used my air compressor which made short work of inflation . Seems well made and happy so far !
4 #### Converse shoes are one of my favorites . Got them for my godson . They fit great . Look great .
5 #### Fits 18 mos to a small 4yr old at least . They are lightweight , they blow up easily .
4 #### Its A Little Too Thin But BF Likes It And He Looked Super Great In It Only Thing I Noticed That Was Missing Was The Rope That I See Around The Neck He Only Recieved One Which Was For The Waist .
5 #### Love love love this shirt ! Great quality , washes up nice , and does n't wrinkle . I do a lot of traveling and always wear this shirt on flights for breastfeeding .
4 #### Well made boot complete with insole . Still , the fit is fairly sloppy so probably best if worn with thicker socks .
4 #### Nice set up ... haven't used it . Worth the money . .. my homemade ones work great . .. this one as I seen on u tube should triple the performance of the homemade ones . .. these stoves out perform gasoline or propane . .. they are more reliable and costs less to use ...
5 #### I do a lot of " over the fire cooking " and weekend camping trips . It is very well made . Simple design and stores away in a small footprint . Heavier than aluminum but you wo n't have to worry about bending or breaking it .
5 #### these sneakers are iconoclasts , if you get them for support you do n't have your thinking cap on .
1 #### I ordered three shirts , all the same size and one of them is small enough I ca n't even get it on . This is the second time this has happened .
4 #### Shorts are great . The material is very soft and comfortable . They do seem to run small . But , I like them that way .
5 #### Tried it out when it arrived and works great . We plan to use it when our power goes off . Heat adjusting knobs are smooth .
4 #### The pans worked great on a weeek long campout . The non stick is just that , and while not full size pans they held their shape and color after a week of continued use .
5 #### I love how protective the Pelican cases are . We have a number of them in different colors and they are durable and protect cameras from the damp environment on our sailboat . This is a much larger case than we normally get but it is much more adaptable and can be set up for multiple purposes . We tried it with multiple variations of cameras and lenses . In the end , we were able to put a 4 x 5 field camera , two light meters , two lenses , and several film holders in this case . This is all safely packed and easy to move around . I love how adjustable the Pelican cases are .
4 #### Wrong color sent . I kept the wrong color because I did n't mind it . Nice mat - but I do slip in my downward dog even though I salted it according to package instructions . Three times .
5 #### I use this product on our winter shoes . It goes on easily and works well . Just make sure you use it in a well ventilated area .
5 #### Just ordered this case of 2000 paintballs . Arrived quickly with ZERO ball breaks ! I fired off about a hundred of them - they shoot very straight . I have n't had any become distorted or warped . Very good quality paintballs . Also , for anyone that cares - they do n't look like the image here on amazon . They were a solid dark blue color with a green filling .
5 #### I tore my left distal bicep tendon in February and I 've been recovering from the surgery . My Physical Therapist has had me working with Thera - band Flexbar when I visit . I lost a lot of rotational strength and grip strength and I 've been slowly gaining it back thanks in part to this tool . The enclosed literature gives several options for for forearm , grip and rotational strength . I talked over the various exercises with my PT and I 've been using my Thera - band Flexbar at work . ( I worked up to the blue after using the medium at the Physical Therapist . ) I 'm still using it daily and I 've noticed that my wrist and grip strength continue to improve . If your looking for a good tool to help with your grip and forearm strength , I would recommend the Thera - band Flexbar .
5 #### Rather expensive but great item . Gives a relatively accurate laser beam without modifying the external dimensions of the gun . Installs easily ( if you actually read the instructions ) . Works very well - new takedown lever is the on / off switch .
5 #### I wear size 7 women , got a 5 men/7 women . They fit and very comfortable .
5 #### As others have said , the one negative to be said of this product is that the leading edge is fairly sharp . There are also a few molding mark , but all of this can be remedied with a sharp knife and some fine sandpaper . The extension greatly increases control of your weapon and gives you a more positive grip . I have big hands , I wear a size xl glove which still is tight and this extension makes the P-11 fit my hand comfortably .
3 #### I ordered a size 9.5 in men 's because that is the size of my work shoes . However , this is over an inch longer than the length of my feet . These are expensive and I 'm using them for a cosplay for one day so I do n't really feel like returning them but I wish I had got a different size .
5 #### Headphones do a great job for protection . Sized for a normal sized head ( baseball hat terms small - large ) . They work great .
3 #### I always wear a 9 in Keen shoes , but these were too short and my toes rubbed the end . I was disappointed and had to return them . Pretty colors , though .
4 #### My boys are 6yrs and 8yrs and both love jumping on this pogo stick . I just did n't realize it had a 60 # wt limit and my oldest is right at that weight . So far it has held up , we have had it for just over a month . I love the grow - to - pro base on it , it gave them the needed confidence to start jumping and now we can take it off and work on their balance . It is a little pricey , but my youngest ordered it with an Amazon gift card he received for his birthday , so it made it an easier purchase .
5 #### Beats a can of fuel . The stove is perfect size for backpacking .
4 #### The costume over all looked great . My husband dressed up as the scarecrow , with me being dorothy and my baby was the lion . I do have to say though , that the costume was just a little small , and my husband is not a big man . He is only 5 ft 5inches tall and i would say that the pants fit him perfect , but the top was a bit awkaward . The hood is sewn onto the top and he needed a little bit more room in that neck area . I almost cut it apart . But it looked good enough so I did n't mess with it . We did win my contest at work !
5 #### After using the Thera - Band for golfer 's elbow , In just 2 weeks , I was able to resume my physical activities with minimal discomfort . If there is alot of swelling it would take some time to heal . I purchased the Blue Thera - Band which has the strongest resistance . I 'm 5'7 " 180 lb . Avid weightlifter . A little bit tought at first , but after golfer 's elbow pain subsides , it 's OK .
4 #### It ran a bit small . Not too much . Used these for a wedding . Worked well and the stockings held up .
5 #### I own this and the larger size Grip . I love them both . This knife is a little smaller and therefore less bulky , but it has still held up to some rough use .
5 #### Just what I was looking for to wear on hot sunny football practice days .
5 #### I bought this as a gift for my mom and she loves it . I would have preferred for the watch face to be bigger but she seems to love it . Also I did n't really pay attention on the glow in the dark option , so that was a plus . It does nt illuminate brightly but it does help see the face in the dark . So yes I recommend it !
5 #### My wife and daughter like this style reel . Theses reels have been durable and trouble free for the last 8 years or so . The drag works and can be adjusted when playing the fish . They are not the least expensive but when we needed another spincast reel we bought another . When a fish is on , I want a good reel there so that they can bring in their catch .
5 #### purchased for daughterin law is lumbar issues and does stocking of shelves at big box store . she is petite and wears a size 8 - 10 . she tells me this fits her perfectly and is glad to be using this product
3 #### It did not last long . The material is of poor quality . It does not stand up against the elements . It is no longer usable .
5 #### The battery is supposed to last 5 years due to no calendar and no second hand ; It 's easier to read the time with no second hand . In bright indoor light or outdoor sunlight , it has a jewel - like shimmering blue / black appearance . In dimmer indoor light , the face looks mainly black . This is probably the thinnest watch made among all watch makers -- you hardly know you 're wearing it . Band contours to your wrist and is very comfortable . Previously I owned the all black model similar to this for 4 years . It still has the original battery and always kept good time . The crystal cracked when it fell off my wrist due to worn / bent clasp pin . I should have replaced the bent pin sooner . I liked it so much I bought this similar model . At $ 76 , it is a great watch .
3 #### Put this on my son 's 16 inch bike . It serves its purpose and adjusted well for his bike . I only give it an okay rating because the kickstand is stiff and my son has issues getting it to come down . Also the black cap on the end keeps falling off . Needs to be glued on .
5 #### spoke to Jeff from the store . He told me that there would be a delay with my order . I asked for a discount since there would be a delay or I would just cancel and order from someone else . He said that a discount would not be a problem so i agreed to not cancel the order . I have just found out that the item was charged to my account and shipped without the discount . I will have no further dealings with this store and would encourage you to avoid it as well . customer service is everything ! If you have any problems with your order please do yourself a service and cancel . Order it from someplace that expects repeat clients .
5 #### Easy to install and open / close . Sturdy . Packaged well and received on time .
5 #### My 8 year old grandson & his friends are having a great time playing street hockey Have purchased other hockey goal and this is awesome strong sturdy well built great price I would recomend this product if you have boys that like to play street hockey Great price ! ! !
5 #### These are THE BEST EVER ! Comfy fit and perfect converse style ! My niece loved them for her christmas present , super fast shipping and a great price !
5 #### When the wind is blowing and the temperature is below 10 * F they make being outside bearable
5 #### LOVE this . It was hard to find a watch for a small girl to help her tell time . Most of the small ones are digital . The regular ones have too big of faces . This is just perfect !
5 #### This compact kit is great and works like a charm . Easy to use and does the job just right . I definetly will recommend this kit to my shooting buddies .
5 #### I had been looking at Wal - Mart and Target for something like these and finally gave up . They 're perfect for working out or doing chores around the house or for sleeping . They are a tad long , but that 's why you can just roll the top .
5 #### Very nice authentic baseball great for practice catching and pitching .
5 #### Excellent buy for the price . No break - in transition time . No soreness after walking . Do n't know how long they 'll last as far as how many miles til they wear out but I 'd buy them again .
2 #### Nice looking shoes except for the stitching is defective and the sole is falling off after only wearing them five times . Also , one shoe has rough spot on inside that is very irritating . I thought they would be more comfortable after a couple wearings but the one shoe is anything but . Hopefully , I can get another pair since they are defective .
5 #### I 've worn this style / brand for several years . Sometimes I pick up something else but am never satisfied with it and always go back to Bali . I love that the straps are n't elastic . The fit is great and they last a long time .
2 #### I 'm 6'2 " and weigh 245lbs . This thing was rolling around on my head like crazy . Way too much open space inside . NO child would be able to wear this and still be able to see out of the eyes . The look is amazing . The fit is horrible . We used it for photos and that is all .
2 #### If you look at the size chart go up in size . My size said C / D would fit . Good luck getting them past your thighs . Waste of $ .
5 #### I mix my own neutral gray gesso , and since gesso only comes in either black or white , I needed a jar in which to store the mixture . These wonderfully take care of the job .
5 #### Came as expected . I and everyone loved this Halloween Costume . Great gag .. seeing that I 'm 6 months pregos . Funny !
1 #### These are not leather . They are made of man made materials . Also they are about a half size larger than my canvas converse .
5 #### This stuff was pretty amazing . It sprays on material like water and you think it will not work . However , when it dries , it is very waterproof .
2 #### Not the high top tennis shoe that I remember wearing in the 50 's . I found this shoe to be cheaply made and uncomfortable to wear . Very poor support and cushion . It is o.k . as far as wearing causally , but not comfortable for extended wear . I was somewhat disappointed , as I was really looking forward to having a good looking and wearing " retro " High Top .
4 #### perfect for children . my boy loved it . the carabineer looks weak so I took it out and put a real one instead ( my 7 year old managed to break even the real one after a week ) .
4 #### This gun is good , its probably the most accurate airsoft gun i have , i have 9 airsoft guns ... You have to setup some parts of the gun like the barrel , and the orange tip on the gun . it has about a 35 round mag and I 'd say 290fps . It comes with about 100bbs , oh and this gun is extremeley light , like 1 - 2lbs and you have to cock it each time to shoot it . The stock folds up underneath the gun by the trigger and the stock is a little loose , nut the gun is heap so what do you expect . For little money , this is decent gun ans I 'd recommend buying it . Hope this review helped -NYPB
5 #### Just because they are white , they do need a washing regularly but I have received many compliments on how pretty these white and pink shoes are . Extremely good Nike quality . Highly recommended .
5 #### The way these are designed at the toe keeps my GD from destroying the toe area on her tennies . I think I will get one in every color.lol
5 #### SO confortable , and cheaper than buying them in a store . I was worried about buying shoes online because the fit could be off , but they were perfect .
5 #### this is my 5th pair and I use them for everything . Great for hiking .
5 #### These are the ' shorts version ' of my most soft , comfortable hoodie . I love them ( purchased a year ago ) and will be getting another . I 'm a 14/16 pant and got the large . Fit perfectly . Soft cotton and perfect length to cover my thighs . Front pockets and one back pocket .
3 #### This is a blow up wings . The strings to wear them are very small for my 3 year old , so I do n't know how someone bigger could use them . Ours has already got a hole in it . It 's cute , and big , but not very durable .
1 #### very flimsy design , it curls inward as you hang it making it almost impossible to shoot at . I woul not buy this product . They could have fixed this design flaw by using thicker paper to keep it from curling excessively .
5 #### Warm , comfortable , and durable . No evidence on any real turtles being used in the manufacture of this product .
5 #### Its hard to say much about a piece of paper with a few lines on it but for my purposes they are great . I paste splatter targets on them to give me more to shoot at . The light color makes them usable for all different color targets .
5 #### Loud and Proud I work at a beach and needed to be heard . This my friends will get the job done extremely loud !
5 #### Both son and husband love their shoes . Fit is true to size .
5 #### Perfect product because it makes my German Shepherd silence and no damages , works every time and size 7 is wonderful for a 70 lbs big dog .
4 #### It is of excellent quality , fits great and lasts as long as any other glove I have ever purchased as well as is one of the most reasonable costs .
4 #### The shoes fit well in the arch area . They are a little wider in the toe area of the shoe , you feel like you have a lot of room . This does not make the shoe uncomfortable , just had to get used to it . Love the shoe .
5 #### Works great , the platform really helps the kids learn to balance before removing it to bounce more like a normal pogo stick .
5 #### Fits much smaller than expected ... just be aware and order a larger size .
5 #### This is the best solid fuel tablet on the market today , period . Used them in rain , snow , high altitude , wind - they always light up and give your money 's worth of heat . This is the most dependable fuel I have ever used - you can store them for years and years , and they will work . Igniting is very easy , eventually scratch the surface , apply fire , and you 're on . Wind protection is essential . Very little residue when burned out . They come individually packed , but you 'll have to put them in a sealed zip - lock bag ( or two ) , else the smell will be very noticeable . 100 % recommended .
3 #### NOT THE BEST COPY QUALITY , NOT THE BEST DETAIL ... IT IS A BIT TOO DARK ..... KIND OF HARD TO SEE INTERNALS EVEN AT READING DISTANCE .... PAPER WEIGHT IT VERY GOOD ... THE PRICE IS GOOD .
5 #### Love these hose . Hope I can always get them . They are very well made . Thanks for having these !
5 #### A little big on the back but other than that good
1 #### Padding is skimpy and sizing is on the large size ( glad I read some of the reviews before ordering ) . My Nashbar Isolation shorts had better padding and was hoping this would be on par if not better . No luck . Material is lighter so good for indoor trainer . Would n't dream of using it for extended rides . Just finished a 90 minute ride yesterday and wish I had used a different shorts . 3/10/2015 - Gave up on the shorts . The pad is not sewn in correctly and bits into the upper hamstring and leaves a bruise after a few minutes of riding . This is the worst short I every had .
5 #### Top quality and US made . Who could ask for more ? This is a highly recommended item for anyone who wants a durable set .
5 #### needed to regroup an old Ping Eye 2 wood I had picked up love these grips
5 #### Old fashioned me was wondering what the heck my granddaughter was thinking when she said these were the ones she wanted cause to me they look like boys ' shoes -- but all the girls had them . So got a fabulous deal in record time for the beginning of school and she loves them ! Thanks Amazon
5 #### I needed something really long and this is it . It comes up to my shoulder . This way i can clean my fish tank without getting my arm wet . Its good size too . Should fit any one .
5 #### These are pretty amazing . Used regularly or as prehab as directed they seem to do an amazing job of preventing tennis elbow . Even within a week I noticed a difference . Definitely helped mine from excessive pullups .
5 #### These held up to me very well . I wore them 3 or 4 times before I ripped them . I ' m kind of rough with hosiery .
5 #### I love these shoes . They fit as expected and they look really nice on . These shoes have a narrow base which I really like . I do n't like the ones that make your foot look wide .
4 #### Good net for the money , placed it over stainless polls and the poles over Garden stakes . No play over the poles as a sleeve . Quick and easy to remove rather then to leave out in bad weather .
5 #### This ball is deal for my six almost seven year old grandson and even my 4 year old grand daughter can handle the ball . It makes the game more enjoyable for them which encourages them to continue to play . The ball itself is well constructed and other than the slightly smaller circumference it is identical to a typical full size adult basketball .
5 #### Love the color , love the many places for cards ( oh , those loyalty cards ) and love the change purse .
4 #### The only thing bad with these converse ... This certainly do not resist much time ... 3 pairs in 3 years .
5 #### Super cute , more appropriate for a 3 year old or maybe 2
5 #### I absolutely love this jacket ! ! My son gets compliments every time he wears it , and his friends are actually jealous of this jacket . I 've bought other faux leather products , and they are generally crap . Not this . And the sherpa really adds to the quality . Great coat ! !
5 #### ( Wife 's review on my account ): I 'm dropping pounds ( and inches ) and bought this one ( an ol favorite ) in hopes to fit it perfectly after more weight loss . So , using an extender , I can wear it now . It 's a little too snug of course ( it 's a 42 , and I 'm still a 44 ) , but the cups fit well and its ' overall fit is as expected . A vintage silhouette is what I wanted , and this bra certainly provides that shape !
5 #### wife really likes these sandals , and keen allways fit even better and are more comfortable than expected of any shoes we purchased
5 #### I really love this gaiter . It is soft and stays " unbunched " on my neck to keep my chin warm . I also purchased the hat and headband in the same beautiful color .
5 #### I use it to exercise at the gym . Very comfortable and fashionable .
5 #### When I asked Amazon customers for suggestions for comfortable , front - close brassieres for an impending breast cancer / reconstruction surgery , they really came through ! Thank you , ladies . This bra was a top suggestion . While no bra will feel good after breast surgery , this one was very comforting . It was thin , light , very soft and did n't rub too much . Good for sleeping . It kept everything in place and did n't mess with the drains . It was easy to put on and remove . It has been great for post op checkups / nurse visits when you have to unveil frequently . I would suggest this bra to anyone who will undergo breast cancer / reconstruction surgery . May I recommend : you might want to consider getting one in black or another dark color to wear in the days immediately after surgery . My white one soon got heavily stained beyond the power of bleach ( which is to be expected , its not the bras fault ! ) . The black ones still look like new after many washings and they are so comfortable I plan to keep wearing them after I fully recover . The only downside of the black bra is that some very fine black cotton lint got stuck to the surgical tape residue and steri strip glue which looked extra gross in between showers . Sometimes you ca nt ca nt win . Healing wishes and good thoughts to anyone who will take this journey !
4 #### This device does a nice job of anchoring my ankle holster on my ankle . I would like to place it just a bit higher but as a cyclist my calves are too thick for the velcro to reach any higher . Maybe I should consider the boot extension .
4 #### Cute Halloween accessory . Note the size - it is not a full size broom , but it is a perfect addition to Halloween decorating decor .
5 #### Fits great . Easy to get on and off . Perfect as a first watch . Supper simple to get sized to the correct , worked better than to size than a typical watch band for smaller wrists .
4 #### I like the brand , it lasts and has a soft sheen - nothing like European brands though . I 'm West Africa but not quite fully dark chocolate . I purchased the gentle brown and the cocoa . I imagine the gentle brown would work on lighter Africans or ( medium ) black Americans it 's brown but a bit creamy ( golden undertones ) . But for me coming off of summer I found the a gentle brown too light . The cocoa was a great darker color without being dark brown but was not a 65 % chocolate . It was a like dutch processed cocoa so it had the strangest reddish highlights on me . If you know your chocolate you know that powdered chocolate is reddish in it 's undertones . I wear it anyway and hope the color would soften in the wash . If you are more of a 65 % milk chocolate kinda girl it 's not a perfect fit . Falk has a perfect dark brown which I wear cause it 's clear that it 's a dark brown without having strange undertones .
5 #### Muy buen producto se ve fantastico , lo uso para ir de caza lo recomiendo 100 % a todos , el camouflaje es muy bonito
5 #### These are hard & look good ! They fit my 6 - year old daughter who is 52 lbs .
1 #### came a a hole in the pocket . will be exchanging this item .
4 #### Great big bag , use it to keep my hunting clothes right out of the drier . Put in some fresh earth cover scent disks and my clothes always have that cover scent when I take them out . Only wish the bag had one of those ziplock zipper closures vs the pinch and slide closure . Sometimes I do n't get it to seal first time .
5 #### These sneakers give me the motivation to workout because they feel so good and are great for any training
5 #### this product is a must have for all shooters ........ canceles out the bang but still allows conversation .... I also keep them by my bed along with my house gun to help with the extra loud bang inside your house but can still hear foot steps and voices ..... if you have ever fired a gun indoors without hearing protection you will be deaf and have a ringing in your ears for over an hour ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! forget about hearing anything after the shot goes off ..................
4 #### One cube did n't actually boil water , but got it hot enough to put on ramen . I think they would heat up stews / soups nicely , just do n't expect them to boil anything . They smell aweful too , but served the purpose I needed them for so I 'd recommend them .
1 #### Scope would n't hold zero mounted on my AR10 .308 . Was n't even able to get the gun completely sighted in before it junked out .
5 #### I love that these shoes run a little smaller . I was able to buy my nine year old them . They are a great price ( on sale ) ! The shoes also look great and are not bulky ! I hate bulky tennis shoes . They are great " around the town " shoes .
5 #### this is a perfect frisbee for the summer . great for the drinking games like CanJam or polish horseshoes , you can never go wrong with a good frisbee ( the actual color was orange which i did n't mind
5 #### I had been wanting another pair of the unbleached Converse Chuck Taylor 's for years . I am so glad that they fit the same as they did years ago . My feet are a little wide . So I order the unisex size and not the women 's shoes , as I find the women 's fit snugger . These are made well and I 'm completely satisfied .
4 #### I like this shirt as an over shirt ( as pictured in the listing ) . Being nylon I found the few times I 've tucked it in it did n't breathe well . As an over shirt , it has a looser fit and allows the vents to work .
4 #### I bought these for my 21 year old son . He only likes Converse , and this is my go to place for them . The only reason I put 4 stars instead of 5 is that their is no arch support . If your feet can handle it , they 're great shoes . They last him about a year , but he 's very hard on his shoes .
5 #### Great looking and fitting jeans , wish there were more colors to choose from . Guys with little or no butts , you need to check these out .
5 #### awesome ! love that I can use it along with other plug ins !
5 #### Keeps things colder than any other cooler I 've owned . I love this one for my pool . I have a cooler float that this fits in and it 's perfect for all day long and then some .
4 #### My son loves playing gaga ball , but this turned out to be different from the balls that were used in his school . However , my son likes this ball a lot . He not only plays with it , but also takes it to the bathtub with him . The ball does absorb water . After squeezing out the water , I dry it with a bath towel . He also likes to hold it when he sleeps and pushes his face against the ball , which is kind of cute ! He also likes to poke the ball with his pencil , which bothers me a little . Anyway , this turned out to be one of his favorite toys .
4 #### The length and waste is perfect , it is just a little wide but it was my choice the relaxed fit , the cloth is very good and also finishing .
4 #### I like these balls . I use them in the Jugs softball pitching machine and they work well . I have had another set for around 10 years and some have cracked but others are still usable . If these new ones stand up as well as the last set then they are great value for money .
5 #### I love this wallet . It has a capacity that rivals the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Alicia - Klein - Wallet - Park - Avenue / dp / B007R2H5SY / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Alicia Klein Wallet " Park Avenue"</a > , and it looks amazing . I think that 's all the more reason to give this wallet a try .
4 #### not a true carpenter cut legs are a little tighter in the thighs that what I had expected otherwise quality is great
5 #### I have this on my keychain every day . It is fairly thin , and has a lot of useful tools for opening packages or doing eyeglasses repair and what have you . I also love Vic Alox tools , I just think they look pretty sharp !
5 #### We bought this for a christmas gift for my 5 year old nephew . He loves it , he loves being batman , so this is a way for him to practice those crime fighting skills in a safe and fun enviornment . Obviously not the best in quality , meaning everlast , but for a kid and what is described for its perfect for it .
3 #### Got runs in the stocking after 3 uses . But great color .
5 #### excellent value . mounted it to a ruger mini 30 . It 's perfect . Bought a second
5 #### Kept me warm on the slopes With a base layer , and this Bib , I was able to ski in - 20 F days . Only two pockets ... Two layers near around the boot area . Outer layer has an zipper for closure . For a big guy like me , 46 waist , it was great , no pinching and plenty of room
3 #### What a cute shoe ! Love it ! The size just does n't fit an adult foot . It is too narrow and a half size too long , the eel is loose and the toe box is narrow . Sigh . Had to return it this pretty shoe .
3 #### Very nice scope . But , I tried a Nikon 20x60 82 and I like it much better , even the Celestron C90 is good ( C90 is not variable but came with a lens doubler = dark view ) . The C90 is very short and lighter weight but is fixed X , and the focus requires turning the whole front lens barrel ( difficult and narrow focus field ) ; though once finally focused on a target you are done . I used this primarily for target practice at the range and it is OK for ' up to ' 100 yards but not good after that . All of these scopes need a good , sturdy , tripod - Amazon Basics , with pistol grip positioner is perfect . The Nikon is good for all and great for 100 - 200 yards , and looks more sporty . I do not recommend this Celestron scope , would not buy again , bought the Nikon Prostaff 20x60 82 mm and already have a C90 , and I hope this helps someone .
5 #### Great watch , large easy to read numbers . Indaglo back light works great at night . stylish wrist band , comfortable and light to ware .
5 #### I purchased this watch sometime back . It has a generous length band and keeps excellent time . I am still using it and have had many compliments on it . I would recommend it to others that might be looking for an economically priced watch that is both attractive and dependable .
5 #### I have a lot of trouble with my feet . And I 've tried so many different shoes , inserts , even podiatrists you name it . Until I remembered a few years ago I had an old pair of Merrell Women 's Jungle Mocs . They were so old , but sooo good , I had to glue gun the sole back on ! So I ordered a brand new pair . From the moment I took them from the box and put them on I was in Heaven ! No ' break - in period ' , either . Merrell Women 's Jungle Mocs are like putting your feet into one of those kitchen gel - mats . Your entire foot is surrounded by comfort ! It 's almost as if they ' fixed ' my feet ... no more pain ! ! From now on it 's Merrells or nothing ! They are worth every penny .
5 #### We love the slingshots . Talk about taking me back to my childhood days . They 're so much fun . Thank you very much .
3 #### Good for non - aerobic workout . Mesh was very comfortable but no support for lateral movrment .
4 #### They look nice , feel good , and the color is perfect for a medium light skin tone .
3 #### Size 9 fits me a tad small , so I purchased the 9.5 . However , the 9.5 is quite too large .
5 #### Great stretching exercise especially for a warm up fast thing in the morning when the elbow is stiff . Low cost , simple , long lasting piece of exercise equipment . Seems to work shoulders a bit when arms are held out straight in front of you .
4 #### These All Stars are good shoes , Great build quality and style . Fit is a little longer than a typical size 12 and if you need arch support you better buy your own inserts ! I am still pleased with my purchase as these all black All Stars look great with a dark pair of jeans or shorts .
5 #### If they are too tight just pull the headpiece a bit so it is not as tight .
2 #### The costume was lousy . The ' utility belt ' is a sash that ties around your child 's waist , the cape is on with velcro , and the one I received had a hole in it near the crotch area . So I had to return it .
2 #### So I was excited to receive these as a throwback to high school days . Much to my dismay , I ordered the wrong size because they are men 's sizing NOT women 's . No way to tell in the description or anything until I received them . I just wish that they were n't listed under Women 's shoes since they are men 's sizing , or just make it absolutely apparent that they are sized in Men 's sizes instead of women 's .
5 #### You can put your lid on this upside down and coals beneath it . Also handy for simply keeping your lid out of the dirt .
5 #### My 11 year old granddaughter asked for these for her birthday . I was happy to find these Converse shoes on Amazon and the price was less than any other site ! She beamed when she opened them and could n't wait to try them on ! They were perfect ! I was so pleased that she liked them and I got to be a big hit with my granddaughter !
5 #### I bought this hat in a size 7 , and for me , a woman , it fits just right . I love it , fits great , and I will wear it when I 'm out in the woods .
5 #### Wife has used these bras for many years . Not disappointed .
5 #### My 2 year old loved it at first sight . Legs just long enough for him to pedal . Started peddling immediately after watching big brother ( 3yrs old ) ride his bike with training wheels and his urgency to ride was well rewarded . I had trouble getting him off of it once he started . Well built and easy to put together and arrived right on time . I just could n't get over how quickly he began to pedal and ride it . Thanks Radio Flyer !
5 #### So comfortable and go well with all my Bronco gear , love them ! ! !
3 #### You have to blow quite hard to get it to make noise
5 #### Used by my three sons for swim team : 14 , 11 . We LOVE the Hydrospex Jr as well for my 7 yo son .
2 #### You get what you pay for . This broke on me as I tried to loosen it from my cleaning rod . I had to use a drill and plenty of patience to take it out without damaging the rod . Sticking with the metal cleaning equipment from now on .
5 #### very good . cheaper than my physical therapy place.you can use several ways to help fine motors .
5 #### Love this watch . Good looking and comfortable . Pearl face is pretty . Like the indiglo function .
5 #### Works great ! Simple substance that helps with grip , no complaints .
4 #### Good quality and comfortable . Great for beginners . The only thing is that we have to spend another $ 20 to sharpen it since it 's new . If I knew this , I would just purchase a pair from store with free sharpening . That 's even cheaper .
2 #### Did not fit well . Was not comfortable . Switched to " Fruit of the loom " . Fruit of the loom are somewhat oversized but fit well and are very comfortable .
5 #### They fit I had a pair of 11 's went with a 12 just in case and they fit really well .
4 #### The shoes are very comfortable , the leather soft and the soul has plenty of that . The shoes are sized little bit narrow as I normally wear a D width , I needed an E for this style .
5 #### This set works fine in my pack . These are small pans made for packs to be light , so be sure and study the measurements to make sure they are right for you . These are titanium and a little expensive as most quality backpack kit is . They come with a net storage bag . If these sizes are what your looking for then these should last a lifetime . I do recommend them .
5 #### Fits great even with a scope mounted , and prevents scratches when getting in / out of the safe .
2 #### Thin and cut like a box . Will be okay for sleeping in the summer .
5 #### It does what it says . Pretty easy ! Great for decorating !
3 #### They would have been prefect if they just would nt of been to big for my son . He s a 10 1/2,but these were just to big .
5 #### Mat does a great job providing firm but supportive protection from floor during yoga . Keeps you from sliding on a smooth surface- also bought a yogitoes mat and it is a wonderful combination .
5 #### This review is really more a response to those trashing the knife . Its hard to have overly high expectations for a inexpensive knife like this . This knife is great for what it is . It 's a $ 30 and your getting AUS-8 . VERY light duty knife primarily developed for fighting . Again , for the money its hard to complain about this little package including the sheath . Its a great knife to use for small tasks , food prep or basic knife needs . This knife is NOT meant to be used for batoning . All you guys using this for that live in a fantasy world created by youtube that says all knives should pass this test . TOTAL bs . This knife was not designed for that so when I read reviews of people actually mad that it broke I say really ? You are mad that the knife broke after you beat it to death when it was n't designed for that ? To be clear , this knife is made in China , so you all can stop getting mad about that . ALL Seal Pups even the Elites are made in China now per SOG 's website . If you get one made in Tawain , great . Only the full size Seals are still listed as Tawain per Sog 's site . The knife is fantastic for what it is . At $ 30 bucks I do n't see how you ca n't like it .
4 #### I used to wear these " back in the day " and I still love em . They have that distinctive Converse look , and style , and are exactly what I expected .
5 #### I usually use these for pistol but since they have a good size to them ill take one to sight in a new rifle at 100 yards every now and again .
5 #### Good quality scooter . No parts to put together . Comes fully assembled . My daughter loves it . I would recommend .
5 #### This item works great and I would recommend to anyone that is outdoors in the cold weather ! It will keep you very warm
3 #### These shoes look really great . However , slightly loose . The problems with lack of support arose when I exercised . It feels like there is little to no support in them . Possibly this is a shoe more geared for an office environment or short walking distances .
3 #### This product is OK . The color is nice . However , the texture is a bit scratchy and wrinkles at my ankle , unless I spend time making sure I conform the foot shape exactly . I will continue to wear them until they run but I would n't purchase them again .
4 #### A little snug , but I hope it will stretch out a little over time .
5 #### I would have like them a little tighter ( I have small hands ) however they are working very well with bow hunting for my grandson and my self .
5 #### My son is 14 years old and fit very nice in him . It is very cute . Estaba bien hecha . Vale la pena
5 #### This is my second pair . I love these shoes . So much that I wore the knobs off the soles on the last pair that I 'm now using as slippers . They are comfortable and durable , and the Nubuck cleans up with a sponge when I get them too dirty .
5 #### I got this for sun protection when swimming outside in the summer . Does exactly what I needed . It is not waterproof so your hair does get wet . But I knew that going in so did n't mind .
5 #### I mounted my heavy bag from the garage ceiling below my bedroom and this spring is a must to absorb most of the shock from the bag
4 #### I wear these for work but I also use a sole insert for more support .
3 #### lightly shapes as it states here , however the top band leaves redness n sort of a mark if there 's any belly bulge .
2 #### I like to change the battery myself and could n't get it closed and broke the crystal . I just threw it away ! It did work great until then !
5 #### I just ordered 1/2 size up and it fit perfect . My husband loves it , I was surprised ! He wears it all the time , so shocked .
5 #### She loves them very comfortable after all day wear and walking .
5 #### Yes , this works really well . But you can find it in local discount stores for usually less than five dollars .
5 #### Nicely made and a comfortable fit . One really nice thing is the brim is well made and does n't have one of those silly plastic rim loops in in so it folds and stores nicely !
5 #### I accidentally ordered this shoe in a women 's size 9.5 and I needed a mens 9.5 so I contacted the seller right after I placed the order explaining what I needed fixed and within 5 minutes I received an email saying my order has been switched to the mens shoe . This shoe is a great shoe . Its my first converse shoe and I love them . Feels like you have nothing on your feet . Lightweight great shoe all in all .
3 #### It looks Okay , but is not very comfortable . My heel hurts after a few hours .
5 #### I 'm surprised at how comfortable this helmet is . I recently started commuting to work on a bike and wanted an inexpensive helmet . It 's very comfortable and seems very solid . I would recommend this helmet to others . Not much else to say - just a good comfortable way to protect your head .
1 #### I had a similar experience as another reviewer . Three months after I bought these , the glue disintegrated . The stitching became exposed . The stitches held but stretched , allowing the sole to be pulled away just a bit . The side looks very iffy now , especially near the stitches , as though it might rip out at any moment . I wore these shoes in a casual shorts and t - shirts office environment in a desert / San Diego . Heh . No rain or water got to them . So it 's unclear why the glue would just fail . I had other Sperry shoes and did n't have much of an issue other than the soles wearing a bit fast . I 'll post photos soon .
5 #### fit as expected sturdy summer work shirt , love all the different colors that carhart puts out .
4 #### It 's worth the buy , however , I think these shirts are getting thinner and thinner and thinner with each year . Carhart once made VERY thick T - shirts that lasted forever . I would 've given this tee 5 stars , but , one less for the garment being too thin . Fit 's true to size . Very quick shipping , thank you !
5 #### What can I say - Converse all the way baby !
5 #### Matches the shirt , more than close in color , good heavy material , relaxed fit is great , only negative if it is one I need a waist size of 39 inch , but only comes in a 40 , tried a 38 it is too tight .
5 #### Great Gift - she loved it ! It 's a nice shoe !
5 #### We took it for camping for 3 times and it worked well with no problems . Lightweight and compact .
5 #### It fit perfect my son is 3years old and about 37pounds . I received the package on time and I purchase a size small which fit him perfect . Material stretches . If u wanted to fit a lil bigger get a medium .
5 #### My 5 year old has two 16 " bikes . One at home , one at grandmas . So I bought 2 of these , and they fit right on , and hold the bike up . They are adjustable and will hold up almost any size bike .
5 #### Carhartt makes good quality , long lasting t - shirts . They fit very well . I have used them for years and they are the only brand that I now buy .
5 #### This is a hockey mask for adults . It is offset from the face by foam pads at the chin and forehead so one size fits a wide range of heads . It is held securely at the rear , is comfortable , and goes on easily . I will use it for protection when I split wood with my electric splitter , which sometimes sends a piece backwards .
5 #### So in love with these , very comfortable , it 's worth every penny , going to see if can find other colors in the leather
4 #### It will drain your vehicle dried if not being careful and we have been conscious enough to disconnect when in park and gone shopping for a while . Everything else it is working so far for a short while purchased so durability is yet to be determined perhaps when it broke ( it is unquestionable that if it will ever be broken ) I will report accodingly . No more icepaks , no more bigger room required for icepaks , no more draining out water , no more hot and cold boxes = hot or cold make your choice and off you go to the event . Obviously , if hot AND cold = must then you might have to get another box but power management will be how extreme you want ... we went with solar kit as part of our survival kit and tailgate essential . Why not just a fridge because it can be used as hot OR cold and use whenever needed and not as a permanent item otherwise Dometic flex fuel fridge would be the CHOICE . We like the product but due to the durability is yet to be determined there are only 4 - stars can be given at this time .
4 #### Nice looking watch , what can I say I always get Timex . I chose this one for the MOP face and Indiglo lighting . I was glad not to have a date window as my last one , the date quit working while the watch still kept time . The stretch band is a bit tight and leaves marks so I deducted one star . I will probably replace the band .
5 #### Very happy with this purchase ! My daughter was happy , they fit nice with room to spare .
2 #### It 's so ugly ! It 's made too long . My husband is tall and it 's still made way over his knees . We donate it right away .
5 #### I 've had these shoes for about a week now and have so far enjoyed using them . Considering the fact that I have wide feet , the shoes are slightly tight . However , it does n't feel uncomfortable nor does it bothers me as I use them throughout my workouts . I know some people personally like when the shoes are a bit tighter or a bit looser so it 's all in personal preference .
5 #### This is a great little waterproof box that has stood up to some decent abuse . Has n't leaked and has n't broken yet with use at work . I have used it in the field for about 1 year so far- I will probaly buy another in the future . My other Pelican clear case has not fared as well as this one . I also like the fact that the entire case ( not just the lid ) is clear .
5 #### I just installed two toilets and two vanity sinks , using this product wherever a seal was desired . In spite of a misalignment of the sink tailpieces and P traps ( switching from offset sink to center sink ) , I experienced no leaks . Not a drop . Too early to address long term performance , but I understand the product does n't dry out , and that would seem to indicate good performance in no / low pressure applications .
5 #### i have been eating this stuff since i was a kid and i am in love with it . it is soooo good and pretty cheap when you buy it on amazon .
3 #### Would have given 5 stars it they fit . Based on reviews I ordered 1/2 smaller but there are still 1/2 to big .
4 #### I really like these . You need to be careful when ordering the size . I ordered a large and I have a 34 " waist . They are pretty tight . I really like that the material is a little thicker that normal compression shorts . I would definitely order another pair . They were also shipped pretty fast .
5 #### I bought a pair at REI a while back so i new i would like them .
4 #### Handle broke but I fixed it with gorilla glue and a dowel . Ill probably replace with rope soon
5 #### My first pair of Merrell shoes . Great for casual wear and walking . I will definitely consider buying other Merrell shoes in the future .
5 #### I have towed this behind the snowmobile a few times and it works great . The load capacity is nice and it is very durable . My son has also used it as a snow sled for packing down his sliding hill . Since it is a bit wider than a normal snow sled , he gets a nice trail packed down using it .
5 #### Love them ! Fit just as I thought . They feel like slippers .
5 #### Love this little scooter ! It 's a well built little scooter . I love the fact that it folds up and can be taken all over . My 3 year old loves it ! I 'm so glad I got this one .
5 #### These are the ones you think you are buying when you buy the bargain ones at Harbor Frieght . No all Magnesium blocks are created equal . These are real G.I. issue . Do n't waste your money on any other Magnesium blocks . Do n't count on any other for your survival .
5 #### The band 's came on time and as described . I have been using the bands 6 days a week for over a month now and did not want to write a review until I had a chance to break the product in . I am impressed at the overall construction of the bands and there are no visible signs of break down of the material even after continual use . I would and actually have recommend these bands to anyone looking to purchase resistance bands . Also , their customer service was outstanding when I called to inquirer about higher resistance bands . Quality product !
5 #### I 'm happy with this watch because it has a classy , understated bezel & band that can straddle casual and dressy . The smaller bezel size also is a better fit for my style compared to the huge watches that seem to be popular nowadays .
5 #### This is great quality and fits great . I was concerned what size to order so I ordered an xlarge and that is what my husband wears . It 's perfect ! Will be great with heavy clothes underneath ! Excellent will buymore ! !
5 #### My 2 - year old loves it . It was easy to put together . Build quality is excellent ! I 'm sure that this tricycle will be enjoyed by my son , my daughter , and several other children after them . No complaints whatsoever .
5 #### Have come to expect excellence and product / style consistency ... Berkshire continues to deliver . The silky style has a reasonable shimmer , smooth texture , and lasting durability . A pair gets me from work to refreational evenings for several wearings .
5 #### Exactly as expected but at a better price and super fast shipping ! I love Amazon !
5 #### I really like my new white classic shoes ! They are very nice . I can wear them with whatever I want !
3 #### Ran small . I had to order additional ones in a larger size .
5 #### I use this hi vis line because my eye sight is n't so great .... i use the 15 to catch catties and ot works great
3 #### it 's ok ... the eye relief is where the extra money matters ! I replaced this with a Vortex and really noticed the difference how easy it is to look through as compared with the Bushnell . Hey , for $ 55 though , it beats a kick in the butt !
3 #### I ordered these for my son as part of his " back to school " shopping . All of his shoes and boots are a size 1 . I guess I was foolish not to try these on him . It 's just now gotten cold enough for them , and i ca nt even get his foot past 1/3 of the way in ! He obviously never got to wear them , and because i ordered them in August the return window is closed . The boots are very nice , i just wish i d known to order a full size bigger than what he wears because now i m out of luck . Would like to get a size 2 but ill hit the stores next time around as i m more apt to try on before purchase . The 3 stars is due to the size discrepancy , not item quality .
5 #### EL PRUDUCTO FUE ENTREGADO CON LAS ESPECIFICACIONES MOSTRADAS , EN EL TIEMPO OPORTUNO Y EN LA FECHA ESTIMADA . RECOMIENDO 100 % . EXCELENTE PRODUCTO ! !
3 #### Leather is not a very good quality and even though they are wide they are still a little narrow .
5 #### I bought these shoes as a Christmas gift for my grown son . He keeps a pair of Converse in his closet at all times . When they wear out , he gets another pair . Same shoe ; different color !
5 #### Carhartt Men 's Double Front Logger Dungaree was a lot more than expected . They are heavy duty and are wearing just great . They are just what I needed .
5 #### I 've only recently been introduced to the alcohol stove but I got ta say I love them . Their pretty simple and do the job of a stove / camp stove very well without all the extra fuss . I bought this particular unit as a back up for my slide in truck camper stove . It packs into my stack of pots and pans do it does n't take up any extra room . I put an extra fire extinguisher bracket in and it holds the .5l bottle of fuel out if the way too . Now if my 15-+ year old stove gets any more tricky to use or I run out of propane I can still cook , heat and/or sterilize water for a good weekend or more .
5 #### What these shoes lack in appearance they definitely make up in comfort . The best arch support I have found in a slip - on with a fantastic heel cup . Nothing better for taking out the trash , knocking around on the weekend or as a rest shoe when hiking or skiing .
4 #### Good quality mats . They seem to be of good construction , fold up easily , and an upgrade from the foam mat i was using before .
3 #### I followed the size instructions , but they are very small . I barely can get them on . But they seem to be very sturdy and look good once they 're on .
3 #### I was was looking for a light weight layer to help me get thru these colder than normal NYC days and this works ok . I would give it another star if it washed well . A word of advice , use the delicate cycle .
3 #### They are OK in a quick pinch , but would recommend something different for long term safety . By all means I am not a locksmith , but have been known to pick a lock here and there , and thought that I would give these locks a quick try . Opened them in less than 5 min with minimal effort . My kids are 8 & 9 years old and I do n't have to worry about them at this point ; these locks should be sufficient for now . I would not ; however , recommend these on semi - automatic weapons as you can easily chamber a round with one of these locks applied , and with pulling hard enough on the lock backwards you can fire the weapon . I can not get this lock to install behind the trigger on my S&W M&P Shield 45 , only in front . I use a wire lock instead .
5 #### So happy to have found these pantyhose on line . Love them .
5 #### I love this watch but the PIN fell out so I 'm having to send it in for a warranty but I 've actually ordered another one to replace this one so maybe when they fix it I 'll have two
5 #### I simple love my converse . I have used them many times since the purchase .
5 #### Loved it - easy to set the date and am partial to all numbers on the watch face
1 #### I exchanged two watches for my daughter and none of them was good . I will not buy again Timex . Not waterproof , BTW .
2 #### Disappointed with this mat . I was expecting much more " stickiness " from a yoga mat . It is really no different than a workout mat I already have . If my hands are anything but completely dry , they slip in downward dog . Since I already had the workout mat , this was a waste of my money .
1 #### The quality one expects to get with the Carhartt brand is not there . I have been a fan of Carharrt for years and still wear their jeans and jacket nearly daily however I am disappointed in the tshirts . The fit and material quality were below standard and the two shirts I bought have since been remaining hung in the closet because it is n't soft comfortable material and no matter if you take it directly out of the dryer it still looks wrinkled and as if you just crawled out of a homeless camp . Save your money and do n't get these .
5 #### These gravity boots have proven themselves to be well worth the price . Not only are they built well , but they are cheaper than the comp . ! I would not pass these up just becuase they look unworthy of your dollar .
5 #### I absolutely love this top , its amazing for nursing ! The material is super soft and comfortable . Its also fairly long which I like and would also be good if you were still pregnant . I m 55 and ordered a small , it hits me about mid thigh and I just had my baby 4 days ago but my tummy is almost completely flat again .
5 #### Great product ! Came on time in excellent condition ! Meet my expectation a hundred % . I m recomending the seler and when i need again i ll use the same one .
5 #### Carhartt never fails , My fiance absolutely loved these , great fit and color . we will be ordering more in other colors as well . great product , just as described .
5 #### I actually have 3 pairs of these trainers . They are very comfortable , there is a neoprene sleeve that goes around your ankle that makes them the most comfortable for me compared to normal athletic shoes . They run a little narrow - for me this is perfect , but you may want to round up on the size or try on in the store first if your feet are on the wider side .
5 #### I loved the color and fit . It 's perfect for wearing to work when I do n't want to wear full on panty hose .
5 #### Big fan of this shoe . Durable , comfortable , stable , and attractive . Great value , great quality . Normally wear a 10.5 but needed an 11 .
2 #### It is not comfortable and I wo n't buy again . Somewhere is too big . Those do n't fit me well at all .
2 #### Goodness , I 'm a tall lady and got the size GH hoping it would fit . It says it should fit someone 210 but I 'm not sure how someone heavier than me could fit into these . They sort of fit after I took them off and stretched them by hand . Material is free of runs at least .
1 #### i love the product line in general and have black , taupe , dark brown , etc . i bought these for summer use with lighter colors pants and clothes . BIG mistake , the get very dirty very fast , show every spot and will not easily clean . this is why i gave it one star . if the light color and easy stain does not bother you , get the product .
5 #### Been wearing Bali Skimp Skamps for years . The best briefs ever .
3 #### Well made product . Fit is OK but not quite right for me . Top puckers a little .
4 #### My experience with Keen has been they run large so I purchased a 8.0 . Since these are sandals , they fit . This style of Keen is more true to size . I probably should have purchased 8.5 . The arch support was not as strong as in my other Keen styles . Too bad .
5 #### Had tried on a different color in store , so knew they would fit . Just want I wanted .
5 #### And she loves it ! She has n't taken it off since getting it a week ago . It seems to be made well and is easy for her to put on / take off by herself . She also thinks it is cute ! Hopefully it helps her learn to tell time too . I recommend it !
5 #### We got this for a boys home and they love it .
5 #### $ 12 a pop for great work jeans . You ca n't beat it . And they have all the sizes you need . If there is one thing I hate , its spending time looking at jeans only to find they do n't have your size . Seems like a no - brainer , you sell out of a product , you order more in the next shipment . Unlike Wal - Mart which is a freaking joke . Went there several times over the course of 6 months trying to get some cheap work jeans . Went every 2 or 3 weeks , even spoke with the manager , and they are always out of the same sizes .
5 #### Y'ever notice the tennis balls in pet stores do n't have much bounce ? These do ! My crazy collie does not play tennis but he and I both highly recommend these tennis balls , the only drawback being we do n't keep very good track of them and have already lost every single one . Maybe a few will show up when the snow thaws . Luckily he likes empty water jugs just as much ...
5 #### the boys love playing with this raft in the pool ! great price for the product you recieve
1 #### it dosent get much worse then these . came in all different shapes . absolutely useless . i gave them away and that guy threw them away . also very suceptable to moisture .
5 #### The shoes were okayed . I had to return the shoes because it was 1 size bigger . My standard size is EU 41 or US 8 or 8.5 . I did not look at the actual sizing . It should be size US 7.5 or EE for the extra width . However , Amazon was kind to accept the return and refund . I did not reorder because the change to a smaller size cost another US$ 20 . I will order again if the price is right--- I ought to because the shipment to Singapore is another US20 .
3 #### They fit as expected . The color was darker than pictured on - line and I preferred a lighter color , but the fit is fine .
5 #### I bought this for my daughter who is going to college in the fall . It 's small enough to tote around to classes , and works well enough to get her there from the dorms . If the handle were just a bit longer , it would be perfect . But it 's pretty close .
5 #### Well designed , sleek , light and easy to adjust . Chin straps are not too thick and does n't feel rough . Back of head adjustor is easy to use to ensure snug fit for any head size . Fair price and comes well packaged . Another great buy via Amazon . Double thumbs up recommended .
4 #### Seem to be well made but the base was machined a little too wide to tighten down on the Weaver base on my Marlin mod . 39TDS , leaving them loose and flopping around . It may be that my base was a Weaver knock - off replaced the base with a real Weaver base and the rings fit great .
5 #### Sometimes simple is attractive ! Nothing " gaudy " about this watch . Push button night light is a great feature without any large buttons to activate .
5 #### Best cushion I 've ever used and I 've used and thrown away a lot ! I sat on this seat turkey hunting for 3 hours without moving . That 's impressive ! Highly recommend this from hunting to stadium seating .
4 #### Decent pants for the money . Waist is a big large , and the legs were pretty long . I m a 32W 32L , ordered a medium . Had to make the legs shorter so i do n't trip over them . Waist is fine with my gun - belt on . We 'll see how well they hold up ...
5 #### I Stax this tray on top of my larger tray . Works perfect for storing my earrings . I like the cover whcih keeps dust off my jewelry .
5 #### The bottom is molded to fit my feet exactly . Easy on , easy off . Comfy and fit just right
5 #### Bought 3 as a gift for my groomsmen . Great looking casual watch , love the leather band and the face is just classic . Kind of reminds me of a gauge on an airplane . They are super happy with it , and they think it cost me more than it did . Score !
5 #### I love the Carhartt t shirts very heavy made lasts a long time in a harsh work environment .
2 #### I 'm giving it 2 stars because the lid does n't stay up . Hits me on the head once I get it opened . It 's suction is way to tight . I 've broken nails on this cooler ladies .
5 #### Great product Delivered on time Great Price These tablets will help get and fire going , provide heat , cooking fire and more . It fits great in a bug out bag .
5 #### We got all 3 kids razors and when the weather cooperates , they are all outside tooling around . Seems to be pretty well put together and surprisingly , we 've had no injuries in the first week .
5 #### I own one - and when purchasing a knife as a gift for my father in law , I thought anything else would be an insult . The quality of these knives is absolute first rate .
5 #### got it for my niece and so far she loves it , she 's not even 5 yet but since she would constantly take my own watch off i decided to get her one as a gift , she can use it for school and feel like a big girl until she is able to tell time .
5 #### We are campers and of course needed the comforts of home in having inflatable mattresses . We bought this pump to replace the first one we bought ten years ago because the battery would not charge any more . After each use , I always fully charge the pump before storing it . We often leave it stored for about 6 months before using it again . It is sturdy and the reverse airflow is handy for deflating mattresses as flat as possible .
3 #### I always wear a womans 9 in Nikes but these are bigger than usual . The right one almost slips off my foot a bit . They are really light and not as sturdy as what I was looking for but over all not bad .
4 #### I did n't see the 4.5 star to click . The shoe fit is goo , this shoe has a relatively high arch which I like even though it seems a bit hard to me . If it were softer or spongier and came in a mesh instead of suede it would definitely be a 5 + . For the price this shoe is hard to beat .
5 #### Love these shoes ! They are easy to get on and off and do n't rub my son 's heels . Red shoes are a great accessory !
5 #### the grip fit perfectly on RIA 45acp , easy to install and feels great . great buy
4 #### Super big and not very insulated , but it kept me dry , that is all I can ask for !
5 #### Very durable and my 3 year old loves this . He thinks he 's a big boy and plays with this often . Great buy
3 #### color rubs off , but great stickiness for traction . thin and easy to carry around
4 #### this helmet rocks , i use it for skiing and it works perfect , its super lite and comfortable , you do n't even know its there after 20 min
5 #### This is a great product . I love the fact they are self adhesive and I do n't need to bring along a heavy staple gun or even tape . Even thought they 're a bit more expensive , they 're worth the extra money . Easy to use , especially if you have a decent spotting scope .
1 #### Poorly made . They started to come apart after the third time my son wore them .
4 #### Pleased with the boots but will be awhile before committing further . Used to wear these in younger years constantly as well as work version and was an avid Justin man . Hoping for the same now !
5 #### These shoes fit as expected and arrived in great shape .
5 #### These work well . I tried one out before I put charcoal on the grill . Pretty cool .
5 #### Probably too long for most practices . I wish there was a middle length between the 71"and 85 "
5 #### Love my new gloves . I wore them with a pair of wool gloves in the cold and these gloves stretched just right for a perfect fit . I also wore them by themselves and they still wore their regular size ! ! Two thumbs up for me ! ! !
5 #### Bought these for camping with teenagers and we are not disappointed ! All the boys are happier about spending a week on the trail with these easy to inflate mattresses . Worth the very thrifty asking price , and durable too ( our boys are not small ) .
2 #### Far too heavy for backpacking , but maybe good for guests at the camp . Seems like it 's nicely constructed .
5 #### This is a great compass for both experienced and novice users . Perfect for orienteering and back - up for those times when GPS wo n't function . Love being able to adjust declination without doing the math .
5 #### Great fit and quality . Perhaps a bit warmer than latex but the wrinkle free handling makes it worth it .
5 #### worked perfectly on my Savage 340B. unlike the weaver , it si centered over the axis of the bore and out of the way of the bolt handle which the weaver is not . also like the feature of a picatinny rail and supplied rings which makes using any type of scope possible . I highly recommend to anyone wanting to scope thier old savage 340 or any of the variants try this base / mount combo a try .
5 #### These bras fit perfectly and give you excellent coverage . The side wire does n't dig into the skin which is a plus . I work long days and this bra holds up and does n't become uncomfortable . They are well made and hold up to repeated washings .
2 #### These targets are made of very thin paper and tear easily . I store and transport the targets in a cardboard tube , but they still shred and tear even with careful use .
5 #### I seen this before years ago and then it seemed like companys stopped making them . I found Four Seasons Survival Tinder - Quik Fire Tab again and look forward to getting more .
5 #### They are Lo Top Chuck Taylor 's what more can I say ? Converse , in general , run a tad big , so I 'd order on the low side of your shoe size . These are awesome everyday shoes . They are made with canvas , so they do n't get very hot . I would n't recommend wearing on a rainy day , but these shoes last a super long time , and only get better as they get roughed up .
3 #### Definitely need two blocks to boil water and does n't work very well with any wind
1 #### Arrived in the mail with a hole in it . Cheap product and my 2 year old was so disappointed it did n't stay inflated
5 #### I purchased these for my Dad 's new model steam engine and they work great . Burn clean for a good amount of time and really gets the piston moving !
5 #### Daughter wanted a simple watch and that is what this is . no frills . She is happy .
5 #### Wore carhartt for years before I retired , still wear then just because comfort and reliability
4 #### fits good on my long guns . great if you do n't want to nick up your guns taking them in - n - out of your safe . also good when used for traveling .
4 #### Good material but it runs big take it to the Taylor
3 #### Fit ok . Maybe a little too long . Runners happen quickly .
3 #### Just received the hat and I wanted to comment to add to the other reviews . I ordered this for my 4 year old based on the good reviews and the fact it 's listed as a kids hat . So I was surprised by how huge it is . Yes it has an adjustable hat band but the overall size of the hat is way beyond child proportions . I saw another reviewer mention it looks like the " mad hatter " . It does . It must be 2 feet tall and at least a foot to 18 inches in diameter . The hat is taller than one of my kid 's 5 t shirts is long . It is enormous on an adult and looks comical . I ca n't imagine how it will fit or stay on my kids small head . Just wanted to let parents know that the picture of the little boy wearing the hat is a bit deceiving . Realize the hat is about twice that size . Huge . With that said , it 's well made and delivery was quick .
5 #### I am very pleased with my new Buxton wallet . It has space for everything I need with plenty of credit card spaces . I also like the coin purse on the back . It is a good size & fits in my handbag just right .
5 #### Easy to assemble . Sturdy , but light . Ideal size ( better than a small goal ) . My 10YO son and his friends enjoy it . Would buy again .
5 #### Have two of these and mine work well with my dutch oven lids , and as trivets . I also have used one to fry with a skillet on it , using charcoal on my Lodge metal cook table .. The center rivet probably will break eventually but replace it with a bolt . One reviewer has a picture of how he did just that . Very useful item .
5 #### INSTALLED NEW PARTS UPON ARRIVAL . TOOK IT TO THE LAKE AND IT PERFORMED LIKE A NEW MOTOR AGAIN . HEADED OUT THIS WEEKEND TO SLAM DOWN SOMEMORE FISH ! ! ! ! ! !
3 #### The clear bag containing the sleeves arrived ripped / opened . Contents were undamaged , but I have no idea if all the 100 sleeves were in the package . The rip was large enough and the sleeves slippery enough that a good amount could have been missing .
5 #### Was very easy to change the string from my crossbow , I know before was very dangerous , to try to change it .
5 #### READ : THEY RUN VERY LARGE Classic shoes , exactly as expected . Only gripe is I usually wear a size 10 , in these I ordered a 9.5 , they were WAY too big , so I reordered an 8.5 and they are still a little large . I 'm going to keep them , but in all honesty , I should probably have an 8 . So remember that when ordering .
4 #### I do n't wear this helmet as much as I should , but when I do , it 's quite comfy , and very light . It breathes well , and does n't get hot at all . The front visor is a little flimsy , but has n't broken off or anything . I like the color , and looks quite stylish for a bicycle helmet . I feel completely protected when wearing it . I even think it would take a bullet for you ... back in Nam , wait what ? Okay , back to reality ... it works , it good quality , so what 's not to love .
4 #### Bought these as camo for my black out back ground ground blind . They blend in well . These are quite slick so gripping things is tricky . They work well with my crossbow as the forearm is a bit rough and is grooved so gripping it is not a problem . Can see if one is trying to handle a rifle with a traditional wooden stock it would be difficult . I will not use them with my rifle but for what I bought them for they work well . The one size fits all worked well for me .
5 #### For that special formal occasion , no wrinkling or sagging through the evening . Have the feel and look of silk stockings
4 #### I bought the RipStik for my child , so these were a great complement . There is nothing fancy about this product , it simply works and it is not too cumbersome or clunky . Ca n't complain .
3 #### They are really nice boots , but if order them make sure you get at least a size smaller than what you normally wear , l should have read the reviews before ordering but l did not .
5 #### Love my shoes . They fit perfectly ( I am a Women 's size 9 normally ) .
4 #### This is the second pair I have owned and I love the way these fit and feel . While they are probably a little too casual for work ( except for maybe casual Fridays ) , they are great for any other time , especially in cold weather .
5 #### These converse was ordered as a gift for a family member . WOW supper fast shipping AWESOME.most important they fit perfectly , and NO defects . THANK YOU ! ! !
5 #### These work well , and it 's nice to have multiple guns on the same key . At least one of the reviews mentioned they opened too easily with essentially anything inserted into the key slot . One day I forgot to bring my keys to the range , and we could n't get these locks open with anything we tried . They work !
5 #### My husband absolutely loves these shoes .............. he has a pair now but wanted to order just in case .................. so that is what we did , and if it makes me happy and his feet happy , it sure makes me happy .
4 #### To be clear , this ProFlex 1650 Back Support Belt is actually an abdominal support ... which can be of help for people with back problems , because if you have weak stomach muscles your chances of having back problems are MUCH greater . I 've had thoracic and lumbar problems for years , and know the importance of strong abdominal muscles . Anyway , my husband wanted me to get this belt , thinking it was a back brace , which it is not . It does not significantly prevent you from bending at the waist . That being said , I 'm giving the product a 4 star rating , as it seems to do well what it was designed to do : help support your stomach muscles . It 's comfortable , adjustable , and seems to be good quality . I wore it several times this Fall while blocking and stacking firewood , and had no spine issues , so it might have helped , I just do n't know for sure . ( My back issues come and go . ) I 'm also 5'8 " and weigh 135 lbs ; results might differ for a big guy with more ... uh ... mass . Overall , I 'm OK with the belt . Oh , and for my body size , the Medium is plenty big , just f.y.i . A size Small would probably fit , also . Also , I 'd like to mention : THIS IS NOT A MAGICAL DEVICE ! * * * TAKE CARE OF YOUR BACK ! * * * DON'T TRY TO LIFT MORE THAN YOU CAN HANDLE ! IT ONLY TAKES ONE LIFTING MISTAKE AND YOU ARE FOREVER SORRY !
5 #### I 've had several grills and wanted a grill that could be also used as just burners and also have the ability to put on a large griddle . I purchased this grill along with a 2 burner griddle and a single burner griddle and it works fantastic ! I now have everyone 's food ready at the same time at the camp site . I even cooked a tri - tip inside the grill box and it worked great ! I highly suggest this . Make sure you get the case that has the rollers on the end so it is easy to get the grill in and out and roll around to where you want to set it up at the camp site .
4 #### These are reasonably priced and very good quality . They 're especially good for kids and for people with narrow or small faces .
5 #### I was surprised at how tasty this item was . Not quite like you 'd get at a restaurant , but pretty darn close . It was filling and satisfying . However , I did have a leakage issue with the pouch . I can say with some certainty that the pouch was n't torn through handling on my end , but there was a pinhole leak at the bottom gusset . I caught it in time and poured the meal into my pot and let it soak in there , so no big deal . If I had n't been paying attention , it might have been an issue . I assume this is an anomaly and would purchase this item again .
4 #### I bought these for my 19 month old son . He currently wears a size 5 which are starting to get too small so I got these in a six but he cries when I put them on him . I think because they are a boot and they are bulky they feel harder on his feet than what he is used too . Its a great shoe though .
4 #### This is not easy to put together , but it is a good little trampoline and my wife uses it to exercise with .
4 #### I 've worn Fantasie bras in the past , so I ordered my current size . The bra is well made from quality material - unfortunately , the cups run large and I was unable to fill them . I returned and will try ordering down a size .
5 #### These are pretty amazing quality for a great price ! The color is perfect ( the ballet pink salmon color ) to match the shoes .
4 #### This uncle mike 's quick detachable super swivel with tri lock blued in 1 1/4 " size works just as it should
5 #### These are the best everyday shoes , because they 're quality made , comfortable , great hiking shoes . Moreover , and importantly , you do n't have to waste time tying your shoelaces . To just walk around town , parks , or trails , this is more than sufficient . The only circumstance where you may want hiking shoes with shoelaces is if you do serious trekking .
5 #### Used at the beach awesome do n't waste money buying it at the beach buy on Amazon
5 #### Bushnell Banner Dusk & Dawn 3 - 9x40 - purchased to go on a Henry .22 cal Mag with a see - thru mount . The optics are very clear from 3 - 9 power . The scope arrived very quickly from Viking Armory . I could n't be more happy and looking forward to trying it out on the range .
3 #### I was somewhat disappointed because the mask fits a little too big for my head .
5 #### The wood sides hold up much better than the shiny plastic ones ; the plastic scratches too easily , even in your pocket with nothing else in it .
5 #### These are my fave type shoes ever . They are always awesome ...
5 #### I have 3 kayaks I move from time to time , and I purchased the Thule kayak carrier to go on my Thule rack . I was using a generic REI strap for one kayak , but I did n't realize how much of a pain it was until I started using these . These are simple , strong , and well designed to securely handle kayaks of all sizes . It 's worth spending a tad more for these
2 #### Good luck keeping these panties up . The elastic is inadequate and the fabric too thin to keep the panties where you want them . Everytime I stood up from sitting , the panties tried to slide down my hips . I was constantly yanking them up .
1 #### As much as I like Hoppes No . 9 solvent , putting it in an aerosol can is a very bad idea . I sprayed some on my rifle , and the cold No . 9 coming out of the can immediately discolored the bluing on the receiver of my rifle . The kit does n't say anything about not spraying directly onto blued parts . I 'll stick to No . 9 in other forms . This should be in a squirt , not aerosol .
5 #### This really helped with my self regulated physical therapy for my elbow . I watched u tube videos and did the exercises with this .
5 #### The tag on the jacket is Zara Kids . My son bought it for a Halloween costume , but he wears it every day . It actually looks really great .
5 #### I 've owned multiple other brand watches ( including Armitron and Casio ) , and I 'm a Timex girl . Sadly , the eyes are getting along in years and the print on ' ladies ' watches was just getting a bit too small . I did n't want a gigantic mans watch , but did want something I could see w/o busting an eyeball , and this is the perfect watch . I love everything about it ( color palette , size , band material , backlighting ) and I 've gotten several compliments , many from women wanting to know where I purchased it from . I do n't forsee killing it anytime soon ( durability is one of the things I love about Timex ) , but if for some reason it did , I would buy it again .
5 #### I do physical therapy weekly for tendonitis in my left arm . I use one of these during those sessions , and so bought one to use at home on off days . It works for me . I did nto start with this BTW . I worked up to it . If you use this under proper guidance form a professional , and as part of a therapeutic regimen , then it can help you . This probably applies to anything medicinal or therapeutic . I read a lot of reviews where people say they bought this and it did not work . I wonder if they just bought this thing like a frying pan or tennis racket and tried to use it on their own without guidance . It did not help them and so they blame the product . This product looks simple and is easy to use . It is how , when , and why you use it that matters .
5 #### I initially bought the Trainer strength ( 100 # ) model , and was quickly humbled by that . It was MUCH harder to close than any of those various plastic grip ones or the GripMaster grippers . I purchased this to function as a warmup for the Trainer , and it 's been a nice halfway point between the Heavy tension GripMaster and the Trainer model CoC Gripper . The texture on these is pretty rough , but at least you know your grip is not going to slip when closing it .
3 #### nothing wrong with the product but i wish it were a little softer material . these days they have all sorts of soft microfiber liners that could have been added to the interior of the product , even if it made it a few dollars more .
5 #### These shoes are my go - to everyday slip - ons . They fit great , they 're durable and can take whatever you throw at them . They 're not work boots , but they are really durable . My last pair lasted me ten years !
3 #### I ordered this lock but received the other version ; the one that goes through and locks on the other side . The one I received works , but is not as secure as this version . I was very disappointed , because I could have purchased the version that was sent to me locally , but ordered this one because I believe it is more secure . On the version I was sent , the lock fastens on the end of the bolt on the other side of the receiver . Problem is there is a small portion of the bolt exposed , and a thief could gain access with a cutting tool . This one ( which I did not receive ) is much more secure , in that no part of the bolt is exposed . I had to use the version I was sent anyway , because I was going on a trip and could n't wait for an exchange . Amazon did not even acknowledge that they made the substitution , so it makes me leery of ordering anything else from them if I 'm in a time crunch .
5 #### Quality made , easy to hand wash . My son finally keeps his shoes on .
5 #### Love this cloth . Use it to clean both wood and metal . Makes your gun look great .
4 #### All the parts were there . Everything looks nice . Will update if there are problems . It will be seeing very heavy usage so it better hold up . 4 stars just cause I have n't hooked it up yet
4 #### I bought these for the gym because the sole is flat for this they are great if you want a shoe with support keep looking that s not what they 're designed for . Other than that I enjoy these sneakers .
5 #### This is a very small bag of Rosin but does the trick as my son is only 8 years old in little league . It 's like the size of a wallet ...
5 #### Soooo much fun . Seems sturdy and flies great . Was hot outside last night when playing but kids did n't want to stop playing !
5 #### Our son - in - law wears Merrells most of the time . This shoe is always a good gift at least a couple times a year !
5 #### Hoy can bought another Helmets , expensive for the brand . But this its exceptional
4 #### Fits the same as another pair of Moc slip - ons that I have . So no worries .
5 #### Classic style , classic feel Love these shoes ! Bought them in black and white and it feels like it takes me back in time when I wear them . Looks great with leggings or jeans - just a little edgy style to make the best outfit and they are wonderfully comfortable !
4 #### Love the shoe but the size runs a bit small ; get half size bigger .
5 #### These are great if you have a T top . Easy to install . looks good and gives the boat more room . Nice to know the life jackets are right there if you ever need them . Great price ! Thank you
5 #### These were a replacement pair . I 've worn these for years everyday for work . I think they are the most comfortable Top - Siders I 've ever worn . I also like the look with the suede leather appearance and the two - tone sole .
5 #### Very happy with this bra , it actually fits better than allot of bras I have owned and is comfortable . Very happy
5 #### A very comfy mat - especially if you need a little extra padding for knees . Easy to hold balance poses on . My only complaint is it 's a little slick at first , but gets better with use .
5 #### We got this as a gift for our 3 year old at his " camping " party because he loves knives ... and clearly we were n't buying the 3 year old a real knife . This one is awesome , he loves all the little tools and feels like a big boy carrying it around . It is large , not the same size as a real Swiss Army knife , it 's about 5 " long but that makes it easier for his small hands to pull out all of the tools .
5 #### These are comfortable and easy to slip on . This is replacement for a pair I bought 3 years ago . a good buy
4 #### My son was happy with them . And I was happy they were new and fresh looking
4 #### I wish I would 've gotten a 5.5 I wear a 7.5 In womens but it 's cool because you have to wear thick socks up north in the winter , The box came totally destroyed but the boots are fine . You 're not getting timbs cheaper than this . Especially once Fall hits so get them while you can .
5 #### These are my favorite walk around shoes ! I can wear them all day and not be in pain ! Love em !
3 #### They are decent bags for the price . After a year of everyday use the zippers break and sometimes the straps go .
5 #### great product , saved my shoulder from the recoil of my shotgun .
4 #### If you have had Chucky T 's in the past - you know what you are getting .
4 #### The shoes are true to size . I am used to wearing running shoes so these have been an adjustment . Overall , the shoe is nice and provides well for my HIIT and Grit classes I take .
5 #### I think this is a nice unit . I have 2 others . With a combined 3000 + miles . I get the batteries from Amazon also for like $ 1 or $ 2
5 #### fits perfectly on my wise boat chair low back ... easy installation .
5 #### My partner loves them . He has use this band for years . Lasts him at least before any wear shows . Must have for him .
5 #### It holds everything from drinks to ice . The build quality is nice , and I have had no issues with my cooler .
1 #### I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and I just threw it out . It is next to impossible to put together , even with two people . You have to stretch apart the two halves to make it one piece and we could not make it happen . Shipping it back would be too much of a hassle . Pay a little more for a well rated trampoline , this one I would never recommend . The seller is welcome to rectify the situation .
5 #### Excelent product , very small and lighting , for adventure race it is the perfect item that you have to buy.the rope work fine when you have to use it but you have to drop hard for it .
5 #### My fiance wanted these pants for his work . He is typically a 32/34 waist and 34 length , so we ordered 34/34 . The waist fits about right , it could go smaller but there is n't really a need . The length was long on him . Again , we think he could have done a 32 length , but then it may have been too short . The length is n't something we ever have to guess on for him , so it came as a surprise . With his work boots , there should be no problem so we did n't think it would bother him too much . The material is nice and we hope they will last at least the duration of this job ( which will be ~two years . )
5 #### this thing shots those darts hard . easy to put together and easy to cock back . pretty accurate and good for the little one that likes to shoot like dad or mom does . my daughter is 7 and she has had some fun with this .
5 #### Item arrived in about 2 weeks . Soft leather . Nice quality . My son loves it . Ordered a size up and it fits perfectly .
4 #### Awesome costume , but would n't buy this for younger than a late 4 yo or 5 yo . My son was on the low end of the should have fit scale and this was enormous ! Had to send it back for a smaller size .
5 #### This shoes are legendary , not really too much to say about them . You know it , I know it , .. They 're back , more than ever .. get yours now . Confy as the most expensive snickers out there .
4 #### I bought these bands a few months ago as a way of diversifying my workout - I 'd been a dumbbells and chin - up bar guy until then . I find the bands to be well - made and sturdy , and I like the design of the clips and removable handle . It means that I 'm dealing with less bulk , of which I 'm always a fan . Plus , because the clips swivel , there 's never an issue with " going against the grain " that I 've felt with other bands . Ultimately , though , these are better for someone needing a lighter workout than I. Thus , my girlfriend loves them , but I have limited use for them . This is probably my own fault , though , so I will get a band of higher resistance from BMP and I think it will have greater utility .
4 #### Fits well . Keeps you warm as a baselayer . My only criticism is that it tends to wear out faster than I like .... generally starts to develop holes after about one season worth of wear .
4 #### Exactly what I needed . Strong breath is required to make a good sound , but it will get every player 's attention . I referee quidditch games and this can stop play in its tracks . The finger grip is n't very customizable , but it fits well on my index and middle finger . I recommend this whistle highly
5 #### Fit 's over scoped rifles and oblong shapes . Definitely a good buy .
5 #### Finally found my favorite pantyhose ! Ever since I gained weight , I could n't find anything that fit in the color I wanted ... seems most plus size are limited to nude , brown or black ( none of which work for me ) . I ordered one each of linen , pale taupe and stone in the 3x-4x ... looking for a soft taupe to go with summer outfits . I 'm 5'8 " and 225 lbs , pear - shaped with heavy hips / thighs ... the 3x/4x were very comfortable . I would n't want them any bigger . The stone is my favorite - a medium gray taupe that goes well with almost any shoe . The pale taupe was definitely more brown - although I can still use it with some outfits . The linen is a lovely lighter gray taupe . Thank - you Berkshire for all these wonderful colors ! It makes such a difference in the total outfit . The weight is perfect - not too sheer , not too thick - and the feel is silky yet with substance .
5 #### I purchased these Chucks for my 11 year old son in a mens size 4.5 and they fit perfectly . They are the same awesome shoes I wore back when I was a wee child ... it 's nice to know that some things in life do n't HAVE to change .
5 #### MADE IN THE USA . Great camp stove ! Runs off white gas or the fuel you use in your vehicle ...
3 #### Kids like it , but the strap is a annoyance . The longer part comes out and irritates my daughter . As a first watch , she is happy to wear it but given the nuisance of the strap , would n't buy again . If you can switch the strap to something else , it would be a good buy .
5 #### As far as first impressions go it seems it was a good purchase , let 's see after a couple washes and uses down the road .
5 #### I am addicted to this stuff . This seller has the best price I 've found and ships quickly . Definitely cheaper to buy it in a 10 pack , especially since it goes so fast .
4 #### Love the old school look had them in the 60s
3 #### The dress itself is great . I love the classic look of it and it fits really well . It is a little short , I am 5'8 and it ends right above my ankles . The hat / horns is very poor quality though , which is why I am only giving it 3 stars . I 'm going to have to purchase brand new ones which is disappointing .
5 #### Super great shoes . One of my favorites . But do n't buy them because I want to be the only one wearing them . :)
5 #### As a woman , I think these are about the most masculine pants a man can wear and think they show off a man 's attributes real nice ;)
5 #### Heard chuck Taylors ran big so went down a half size but should have went down a full size . still love my chucks though & they came right on time .
2 #### After a month of solid use and several scrubbings with a bristle brush , this mat still is not sticky enough to hold a downward dog . I am returning it . I am giving it a star for the pretty color and it does seem to be a fairly sturdy mat . If you are not planning to do yoga , it would probably work out just fine .
5 #### I am not surprised to find this perfect because I just had to discard one I have had and used for over 10 years only because the leather wore behind the snap ! Most clutches sold in shops are wild color combinations and too small for my check book or even bills unfolded or have a plethora of added unnecessary parts . Thank you , Buxton for continuing your fine products .
5 #### It fit my hubby perfectly , and they are made out of a good quality of fabric .
5 #### As the saying goes .. Takes a licking , keeps on ticking .. I 've worn this watch for about 6 months now , nonstop . I wore it on a cruise and into salt water and to the bahama 's .. I wore it down the Panama Canal and into South America , through the jungles of Columbia and Costa Rica and she 's still ticking and keeping time like a charm .. I fell back on this old standby after I could not find another brand that I like with a backlight .. I MUST have a watch with a backlight ! I purchased two Timex .. This two toned one is my favorite . It 's a great little inexpensive time piece . You just ca n't go wrong with a Timex .
2 #### Essentially a huge piece of foam rubber that looks and feels like a sex toy .
5 #### I actually ordered 2 sizes because I was n't sure which would work better ( I have small head , hands , and feet , and children 's accessories often work better than ladies ' ) ; both worked OK because of the velcro at the back for size flexibility . I ride horseback summer and winter , and need ear warmth small enough to wear under a helmet ; these do .
5 #### Bryan takes a slightly different approach here , with some new poses or slightly changed poses which will hit your body in some new ways . I was impressed by the innovations Bryan introduces while still remaining true to the core practice of yoga . I love the original 3 - tape series , and this tape provides a nice , challenging change of pace . If you are a fan of the first three Kest videos , you might be surprised how a little change can stimulate new growth all over again ! And most importantly , it 's still Yoga and it still leaves you feeling great .
5 #### These Limbsaver recoil pads are the best I have used . I was so impressed that I bought one for my Shotgun . They are recommended .
5 #### I ordered this because I have had other Timex watches that last for years and years . But they all had the calendar and sometimes setting the calendar can be a pain . So when I saw this , I knew I had to order it . The description says Water resistant to 99 feet ( 30 M ): withstands rain and splashes of water , but not showering or submersion . I wear this 24/7 , showers , swimming , washing my hands , it is on my wrist what ever I do . My job is very hard on watches , the machines I run usually scratches the cover . But this watch has no scratches and it looks great . If you expect a lot from your watch like I do this is the watch for you .
5 #### Mounted a scope on my Ruger 10/22 with these on a Weaver rail . They came with inserts so you do n't need to lap your scope . No problems at all ! ! ! Perfect height ( not using a cheek riser ) . For my next rifle ( .308 ) will definitely buy these again !
4 #### Okay . So I have had these resistance bands for little over a month now and am really pleased with them . The main thing I like about them is that they are so easy to configure due to the carabiner connectors . While I am not a materials engineer the quality of the bands and the various components is good . The stitching on the ankle and door bits is good . I had no problem using the door attachment . It slid right into the space between the door and frame . I closed the door and was working out within minutes , once I got the right level of resistance I was looking for . Need more just add another band . Need to reduce the resistance just swap out or reduce the number of bands you have attached . Easy as pie . I do recommend paying attention to the warning about wearing protective glasses for your eyes . I have had no slippages but always play it safe when it comes to my eyes . I use my DeWalt goggles that I bought for using with power tools .
4 #### Use of this carrying case sure beats the heck out of carrying your sparing gear duffel , lunch bucket and weapons , as whilst trying to maneuver through registration lines and bleachers and trying not to poke anybody 's eye out !
5 #### No military contract number , but marked " MFD BY DOAN MACHINE & EQUIP CO . INC " , along with their address .
5 #### I wear a 34x30 jeans and these pants are true to size and fit great . They are nice black jeans .
4 #### We have had many of these watches over the course of the last 13 years and 4 kids I LOVE the following : -if they loose it , Timex will replace it -it is analog .... kids need to learn this before going digital .. it 's vital ! -it 's sooo cute -the price ... quality , and it is able get wet so the child does not have to take on and off constantly My only gripe on this watch is the band mechanism to secure the length of the strap . It seems to wiggle over time , or come loose . I wish it was able to hold it a bit " tighter " . We graduate our kids to a Timex Ironman digital once this has ran it 's course .
5 #### These fit better than the 10.5 wides I purchased before . I added gel insoles for my perfect feel .
4 #### This was purchased for emergency use and has performed well on several occasions . Comfortable and inflates easily .
5 #### Looks nice and is a good fit . Recommend from this girl .
4 #### The product works great and generates a ton of heat that lasts 10 - 12 hours in my experience . Would have gotten five stars but it took forever to get here and the company did n't provide tracking info , even though they sent it UPS , so they had tracking info . When I run out I 'll be looking for a different provider or similar product . The shipping was just lousy .
5 #### Brought for my 2 year old . He loves it ! Lanyard is very durable .
5 #### This fit really well , and it does nt struggle . Also the material feels really nice to the touch . A must buy .
5 #### After purchasing and returning two other resistance band products because they did n't even come close to the caliber of product I use as a Certified Trainer at the Wellness Center where I work , it was with a little trepidation that I ordered the Black Mountain Set . From the speed with which it was delivered , to the carry bag and most importantly the " industrial " quality of the product , any fear I held was dismissed . This is simply a great product . I 've built it into the programs that I use with clients ( particularly my " road warriors " who need a small profile exercise equipment set when travelling ) , You have to see the heavy duty guage of the metal clips and feel the stretch / resiliency of the tubes to appreciate just how good this set is . Do n't waste time with the " name brand " or celebrity endorsed products - go with the BMP set .
4 #### This is the he - man bad boy of crush trainers , no doubt . I have a fairly mighty grip for your average Joe of my size , however , I 'm glad I only got the " Trainer " to start out . It 's no piece of cake , and you could hold your head up high starting out even lower than that . But while I 'm sure that some of you cowboys , lumberjacks and handlers of ropes and shovels have callouses enough to squeeze handfuls of thumbtacks while smiling for the camera , I 'm a desk jockey and the only thing approaching rough work my hands see is gripping free - weight bars at the local gym . Which brings me to the next point : By about the tenth rep with this device , my hands are saying , " Whoa , whoa , whoa ! What 's with the 40 - grit sandpaper on the grippers , dude ? " They 're rougher than JJ Watt 's 2 - day beard dipped in molten carbide -- you're not going to frigging slip , that 's for sure . Yes , that kind of whiney carping could well earn a man extra hole punches on his " frequent wimp " card , but I 'm putting it out there anyhow to give people a heads up on what to expect . Will I keep using these ? Heck yeah , what do you take me for ? I plan to make this gripper my female dog , or rip all the flesh off my hands trying .
5 #### Need something to use for the beach and found this one , it is easy to fold , portable and kept the sand away from family , easy to clean too . It is lightweight and was made of durable materials .
5 #### I could n't be happier with this product , price and shipping ! ! excellent buying experience ! !
2 #### Pretty skirt . Much shorter than expected . Very small ... Maybe two sizes smaller than traditional sizing .
5 #### This silk top is just the ticket . Very light weight and nice that is long in length . Perfect base layer . I may try washing by hand .
5 #### Husband very pleased with this one ! Reliable and comfortable to wear . Backlight a nice feature , too .
3 #### The gloves were the thin slick camo material . They fit nice and would be easy to use with a gun or bow and release or a recurve . However , they DO NOT have the black grip on them ( as pictured ) . I was dissapointed in this since , that is the reason I bought them ( the grip ) . However , if you are not concerned with the grip feature , these are the right gloves for you . I would not expect them to keep my hands warm but it will definately work well for a release or gun and to camo your hands .
5 #### I bought several of these for camping . They work well , and the blade is of a good quality . I would buy this item again .
4 #### The product itself was great I just ordered in the wrong size .
2 #### I bought 2 of this for my grandparents as an upgrade to the ones they had from China . I chose this because it had a good price and a decent rating . But after receiving the product , the sensors turned out to be even less accurate than the old ones . I might have just have received defective units so I just simply returned the items with no hassle . Besides the sensors , the device looked nice and the usage was pretty intuitive . My grandparents would have totally liked the device is the main sensor actually worked .
5 #### Very comfortable shoes . I have wide feet with falling arches . These help both and are comfortable enough that I can be in them all day long .
5 #### used them for an hour already and not one fog problem !
5 #### ca n't say anything better about this great , comforable well designed shoe , will get lots of years out of it ! ! And then will buy more of the same ! !
5 #### These shoes are really in with my 11 year old grandson , he loved this color ! ! Great value for a hard playing growing boy
5 #### If you 're looking for inversion boots ... these will do the job . not too bad at all . I have kinda skinny ankles , I think I put something around my ankles when I used them but whatever . I felt safe upside down .... on my pullup bar .
5 #### These earmuffs are amazing . The price is the best on the internet . Do not listen to the other reviewers who claim that it is impossible to install the batteries . Any competent person who reads the directions can do it in 1 minute . As for the complaints regarding the on / off knob , when you take them off and are about to place them in your range bag make sure they are switched to off . These earmuffs work how they are supposed to , they are low profile and look nice and at this price are extremely affordable .
5 #### Have worn this style bra for a lot of years and am very happy with it . Glad to find it on Amazon
5 #### I like these work pants . They should last for some time to come . Thanks Carhartt !
5 #### Very effective in isolating and strengthening forearms to heal my tennis elbow
5 #### The standard for fishing line for many years . I 've been using it for over fourty years myself . Ca n't go wrong
5 #### This crawfish lure turned around a slow day of fishing . After having no luck with my other go - to lures , I decided to try out this crawfish . I maneuvered it around some rocks and was getting hit after hit . The action of this lure is really nice . The color is nice and the hooks are sharp . For the money , I 'm really happy and will be buying more colors soon . Thanks !
5 #### Makes blowing up and deflating air mattresses a breeze . I was skeptical of some of the reviews that said it failed on them , but mine has been working great .
5 #### Good fit , thick cotton , tail length is good after repeated washing ( I 've had problems with other brands shrinking in length ) , prompt shipping . Thanks , Carhartt and Amazon for a solid product !
5 #### My 10 year old anchor line was showing age so I bought this new , shorter and stretchier line that works great . Now if I can only afford a new jet - ski to go with it ...
4 #### good quality boonie . I was impressed with the material quality for the price . after a few good sweats and washes it broke in nicely . ill be buying a few more of these in different patterns .
5 #### I liked them a lot they were just a bit too big
5 #### I got these for ny son , he absolutely love them . I was scared that they would n't fit him , luckily they did .
5 #### This is really much better looking than the picture shows . It is light weight and easy to put on . My favorite color is blue so , for me , this is a no brainer . The price is great and the watch is made in Denmark . Highly recommend .
5 #### This is one tough scope . I mounted it to my CVA Optima V2 pistol . After dialing it in , I shot it a few times to get accustomed to the small sight window . A screw in the scope mount stripped and a screw in one of the scope rings stripped , but the scope itself was unaffected . Probabblythe best value in pistol scopes anywhere .
3 #### It is good for hiking .i just use it for hiking . Not bad not feel hot . So it is good
2 #### It is a lot longer than I anticipated . I will have to have it cut and the hem re - laced .
2 #### The socks are priced Lord & Taylor , and the material is Dollar General . Nothing against either store , but for the money you should expect much better quality . Very thin socks , VERY thin .
5 #### I needed unscented talc to recondition some old camping equipment . The talc is very fine and easy to spread . There is no cornstarch in it , but is slick . Cornstarch can gum things up . It appears that leisurepro has then best price .
5 #### I had a Crosman of this type as a kid and have been looking for one and came across the Benjamin , a bit of a step up . I have been messing with it for a couple of weeks now , and could n't be happier . Revisiting childhood memories , and the tool functions flawlessly .
1 #### The listing does n't make it clear if you are buying men 's or women 's shoes . After a half hour of reading reviews to figure it out , I felt confident I was ordering men 's shoes . Then , women 's shoes arrived ...
5 #### These are a lot of fun , work very well , and kids love them . They are lighter weight so sail well and wo n't break anything they hit .
5 #### Great product . As described . Very good adhesive . No issues in high winds . Ability to patch holes really increases the value of these targets .
5 #### As a yoga teacher I use this mat every day and it has been absolutely perfect . I ordered this item over 18 months ago and it has performed superbly . It remains just as firm and supple as the day I received it . It is also easy to maintain coming clean with simple wipe down with mat cleaner or white vinegar . I absolutely love this mat ! !
5 #### The Peltor 97069 President Hearing Protector is a fantastic solution for your shooting needs . Very good construction and let me tell you , once you put them on , you do n't have to worry about noise . It is very much like being inside your very own tunnel . You can still hear the surroundings around you but in a muffled sort of way . The fit is great and a nice solution . They should be able to fit even the largest ( or smallest ) of noggins ! My wife and my kids can wear them too and they fit perfectly one each of them . My primary use for these is of course shooting . I happen to be a collector of firearms and having the proper hearing protection is a must . An example , firing my Sig 522 is fine without hearing protection . Firing my Glock 22 without it is a mistake . Firing the AR 15 , even with ear plugs will leave you almost deaf ! Seriously ! If you are wearing these ' cans , ' you have nothing to worry about . On a side note , as soon as these arrived , I had a smoke alarm malfunction and had to get up close and personal with the device . Thank god I had these ' cans . ' Seriously !
5 #### Got them for my girlfriend . She loves them . Says it 's like wearing slippers because they are incredibly light .
5 #### Great knife to have ! I use it all the time !
2 #### Too small , & too short . They do n't stay up either , very disappointed .
5 #### Not my first rodeo so I knew what size to buy As always conversr are awesome , I burn through them too quick though
1 #### The fuel cubes were to small to effectively heat my Esbit Stoves water . It took 3 + cubes and 25 minutes to heat my water . It never did get to a full boule .
5 #### Well made , fit perfectly on my Mossberg 464 . Just wish it was sold in pairs .
4 #### decent price for $ 15 ... ( $ 10 savings over normal balls ) ideally you can still get balls for < $ 10 if you look around at discount shops ... but probably ca n't in bulk . a bunch of these " walk away " when other kids start playing with them , so it 's not too expensive to replace .
4 #### Great quality for the price but the paint chips off the shoes the first time you use them .
5 #### My daughter loves them . True to size . Classic chucks with great quality .
5 #### I 've had these for almost a year and they are just now starting to wear out . I wear them everyday at work where I am walking on them for 8hoirs straight , 40 hrs a week . Converse are a favorite of mine . I must say that if you are a size 9.5 or 8.5 get the next size up as converse do not sell in half sizes and the size below will be much too small for you . So if you 're a 9.5 , get a 10 . It will fit fine and wo n't rub your foot raw .
4 #### We recently moved , and my back was starting to hurt a fair amount every night and primarily while moving heavy things . I decided after a couple more days of pain I should do something , as after the move I was going to put in about 100 linear feet of fence by hand . So , I ordered this item . Wearing it has made my back barely hurt at all during the heavy lifting , and my night - time pain went away . Definite 4 stars for that . It would get a 5th star , except for it 's size , which could be a bit tighter . I 'm not large , but not small - about 5'10 and 185lbs . I started with it as tight as it would go , and as I lost a few pounds in the move and fence build , it actually became a bit large for me around the waist / stomach - the second layer of straps could only go so far as they do n't have velcro on both sides as the base layer had . So , I would n't recommend this for anyone that has a body type where they 're skinnier than a 5'10 " 185 lb person .
5 #### The shoes fit perfectly and came within the time frame i was given . Very comfortable , which is needed since my job requires a lot if standing abd walking throughout the day .
5 #### Great pads . Using the elbow for my younger one 's knees .
4 #### came in nicely packaged . correct color and size .. and it fit accordingly . nice pocket and label . should wear and no color fade
4 #### This is smaller than I thought , have one that I purchased locally that is labeled small but somewhat bigger . They are great , easy on the back and hold lots of things .
5 #### This is a must for people with large wrists . I admit I had to do a little altering on it to make it fit otherwise it 's just what I needed for my Suunto watch . Highly recommend the band and seller .
5 #### Finally a knee high that stays up ! I like wearing theses with pants and dress shoes for work so my feet do n't get as cold as they would with no stocking .
5 #### My husband has to work out in the field , and the Carhartt shirts really hold up to a lot of wear and tear .
5 #### Very comfortable ! They fit just like I thought they would :)
5 #### My daughter grew out of her favorite converse and would try every morning to shove them on her feet even though she knew they were too small . I surprised her with a new pair and she loves them ! The seller was great , too - I noticed after I ordered that it said the shoes run a little big , and since I had already ordered a half size large to begin with I contacted the seller to see about switching the size . They responded very quickly and changed the size without issue .
5 #### Works great ! Makes tossing the frisbee at night super fun .
4 #### I ordered large and have 34 inch waist . Standing up straight , It is a bit loose in the behind . Mind you the design of threading is curved , so when I sit forward on my bike in good low riding position , the fit is proper . legs are perfect and has flat drawstring to adjustments . Pad is comfortable on 25 K plus rides . good shorts for money .
5 #### We were tired of having the cloth nets rot in the Arizona sun .. and this chain is working fantastic and will hopefully last longer than the interest of basketball . :)
5 #### It is a gift for my brother in law . He likes these shirts and wears them well .
5 #### My daughter was super excited . They fit perfectly and arrived right on time !
5 #### Best neck gaiter I 've found . Soft , warm and comfortable fit .
4 #### I bought this as a cheap back - up rod and have really enjoyed the smooth casting of the parabolic glass . We 've found that it works best with 5wt WF fly line .
5 #### Great baseball . My husband always likes to have a baseball in his hand - whether sitting on the couch or riding in the car . I decided to get him the MLB official for Father 's Day , especially since he loves the leather smell so much . The case that comes with the ball is good quality also . The price is right for an official ball , cheaper here than in sporting goods stores . Happy with my purchase and so was he .
4 #### These are high quality Chuck Taylor style Converse available in a variety of sizes .
5 #### I bought these tights because my daughter was playing outside after ballet and absolutely ruining her pink tights . Capezio makes durable , quality ballet tights and these are no exception . And they 're black . My daughters ballet teacher may hate me for sending her to ballet in black tights , but I get three times the mileage out of black tights as I do out of pink tights . So I will definitely buy these again .
5 #### We ordered this because my husband is getting tennis elbow ( he is a plumber ) and we are trying to avoid a cortisone shot . We should have done our research a little before buying this . We bought the blue one because my husband is a very strong guy and we figured he would need the biggest one to get the best workout for his elbow . The flexbar came with a pamphlet that detailed the progressive system . As with all workouts you start with the smallest and progress to the biggest . Do n't just match your strength to the biggest and dive in . So we are ordering one of the smaller ones and will work up to this one . Overall I love the flexbar system . He has n't seen any results yet but we are just getting started .
4 #### Seems to be a good product so far . Heavy material , fits over my scoped rifles with sling . Time will tell about the rust protection.should help with a well oiled gun.like how it keeps guns from touching each other . Too many guns in safe !
5 #### I 'm 6'1 " 40 " waist and these fit pretty good for the most part . Because they are snug ( not tight ) the elastics need to be adjusted to a comfortable position on the thigh . I 'm going to buy another pair soon .
5 #### Exactly what I was looking for and fits the bill to everything I wanted ! Comfortable , easily adjustable and even comes with the carry bag , worth it .
1 #### Timex keeps on ticking right ? That 's why I purchased this on July 19 , 2017 . Here it is October 27 and I have just had the battery replaced . I 've worn it about 5 times . New battery and It worked for 10 minutes . And the warranty is lapsed ? Guess I lose . So disappointed .
5 #### First time buying a Merrell shoe . These are very comfortable , color was back as I ordered . The pull tab on the back is strong , but I would have prefer if it matched the black color of the shoe . It 's white , black and red , stands out more than it should . Otherwise great shoe with soles that have a good grip .
5 #### Good fit and comfy . Not so cushiony so definetly better for training and not for running or aerobics . Bought size 8 which is my usual size .
5 #### I bought a Red Band and a Green Band FlexBar and have realized unbelievable results ! I have struggled with Tennis Elbow for YEARS and NOTHING worked until I had the PRP Injection and followed that up with these Bands . Count me as a believer because I am nearing a cure ! Still have some days where it aches but compared to where I was this is nothing ! Try this Band if you have Tennis Elbow , it 's cheap and it works !
5 #### By far the best part of work pants I have ever had I now homage two more pairs . The dubble knee construction saved me on day when I dropped a running grinder . The pants protected me and saved me a trip for stitches .
5 #### Really nice , holds plenty of cards . Coin area is a bit stiff but I think it will be fine in time . Great color !
5 #### Normally I 'm a bit leary of combination sizes , but these fit great and the quality of these panty hose is excellent !
5 #### I love this shirt . My biggest problem with most shirts is how quickly the collar gets stretched out . This one is still nice and tight .
4 #### No arch support is the main reason for purchasing Converse . My granddaughter is flat footed and Converse do n't hurt her feet .
5 #### i love these shirts , most comfortable shirts in the world .
3 #### The price for these compared to leather was what led me to these . The quality is less than expected from a pair of Merrell shoes . The canvas is so thin it reminds of my old ( ' 60 's ) Converse . They are thicker than that old canvas but not by enough to feel the shoes will last for any reasonable time . The soles are another issue with these . On any surface which has any frost or moisture you feel like you 're perched precariously on the bottom of the shoes which provide zero grip although they hang onto mud like a long lost lover . Any mud is also very difficult to remove and once it has you have to wait an eternity for the shoe to be dry enough to wear again . IMO these shoes are Best for low frequency use on dry firm surfaces .
5 #### These bands are awesome . The leg strap and door anchor work well for me . I 'm only using them a couple times a week , but I 'm definitely happy .
5 #### For $ 9-$10 , this hat was a good deal . The hat fits well / correctly , it has the eyelets for breathing , it looks great and appears to be manufactured well . I think you will be pleased with the purchase .
5 #### Thinking of converting to nothing but these socks in my wardrobe . Whenever I wear something else , I miss these . Warm and comfy .
5 #### Awesome old scool militarytool bag . Simple , perfect . Great for comparmentalizing luggage .
5 #### I climb rocks . Me like skin . Saves skin long time .
5 #### Greatly helped relieve pain in my elbow due to tendonitis . Just have to be conscientious about using it .
2 #### These have to be the worst shorts I have ever received . Like wearing ' cardboard ' . I will donate them to a charity .
5 #### Always consistent measurements and quality . The loose fit is great for horseback riding and motorcycle riding where a little extra ballroom is appreciated .
2 #### Color was not at all what i expected . It was more orange then red . Not sure that I am going to keep them .
5 #### Order came very fast . This mat is awesome , I have been using it every week since I got it , Thick , comfortable I really do n't know how I got along without it . Excellent Mat ...
5 #### Excellent Lure in all sizes when cast for Pike in shallow waters , has really nice sinuous action in water when worked with a moderate speed , steady , retreive . Short , 6 - 8inch , lightweight , wire leaders do n't kill action and prevent bite - off . A quality product , thoroughly recommended .
4 #### It would be 5 stars but the fault is mine . The band had to be made smaller but the watch is perfect .
3 #### If you are looking for something closeup these do the trick . But there is very little field of view so just expect to see a bid or something . No scenery around it .
1 #### NOPE .. you will have really achy feet within hours .. These are very thin and offer no support at all .. ! ! !
3 #### Ordered this thinking it had all the accessories and the bucket . Turns out it was just the little pack that you have to fill and strap on the bucket . Ok ... but was hoping for more .
5 #### There is a reason why these issues are classics . They were awesome when I was a kid and now they are awesome for my kids
5 #### Converse All Stars , a classic . Love them . They 're very comfortable and they 're perfect for a night at the movies or just hanging out with the guys . Obviously they do not have much support or cushion ( and I was n't expecting any ) . If I was going to be on my feet all day or doing something real active this is not the shoe I would choose . Tilly 's service was fantastic . I could n't be more pleased .
4 #### I wear Converse for exercise . I love the ones that are different and often buy them from England . This pair fit perfectly and are easier to get on than some of the high tops . Would buy from this seller again .
5 #### This lid stand has come in very handy . Not only can you use it to keep your lid clean when taking it off the dutch oven , but it can be used to hold the lid upside down over coals to be used as a griddle . This item was well made .
5 #### Great tights for running ! I run and off - road bike , so these are perfect for me . They are MINIMALIST , meaning that they are no frills , non - padded , non - compression , non - thermal running shorts . They fit like a glove , stay where they need to be and have a single inside pocket for your key or credit card . They are really great if you wear a hydration pack , since there is no bunching like other shorts . However , I do recommend wearing briefs underneath , just in case ... you know . Otherwise , these are not for you . Hope this helps !
3 #### I had to buy men 's shoes , I am a woman , but the women 's shoes in this brand do not fit me anymore . The cut seems to be too narrow in the area of the shoe where you put your foot in - it does n't have any give - so I bought the same style in the men 's shoe , had to order it two sizes larger than I normally wear in a men 's shoe . I just wanted a slip - on in black , but the only ones that will fit me are the men 's . Not a perfect fit like my prior pair that I had worn out , but I am settling on this . Got tired of ordering women 's shoes , only having to send them back .
5 #### Package of 3 works great for me because I typically land a couple in a tree during each play session with our Golden Retriever . Not only are these fun for the dog , we get a kick out of how far they go and the surprising turns they make in mid - air .
4 #### I bought two sets of long underwear for the season , these in oatmeal heather size medium , both top and bottom , and the Cuddl Duds Women 's Thermal Long Sleeve Top & bottoms . This is a pretty classic set of long Johns . Like them a lot . I wear them under waterproof Patagonia pants out rowing on Gloucester Harbor . I am warm , cozy , and dry in them . I 've already washed and dried them and they did n't seam to shrink . Folks ' reviews complain of their being too thin and running . I am not experiencing that issue with these . They 're supposed to be lightweight . And if yours ran , maybe you 're running something scratchy along them . They should n't run . These are very seathrough . So they 've got a sexy appeal to them too . So if you 're on a little winter holiday getaway with your sweetie , these are kind of sexy in an unexpected kind of way , but maybe only would be considered sexy to folks who love winter outdoor sports and winter indoor recreation by the fireside .
5 #### Perfect gift . Fun to use , great for zapping flies , good conversation piece . Competition between kids and adults to see whose aim was best !
5 #### Product was great . My son loves the sneakers . Great fit . My six year old feet is a 1 and a half and they fit perfectly .
5 #### Great shorts . Great padding . I 'm 5'5 " and have a size 29 waist , but have huge quads . So I tried the Medium . It fit my quads perfectly but was a bit too big everywhere else . But I kept it and still use it anyway . Even though it 's a little big , it 's still really comfortable . The bum pad just snags on the seat sometimes if I get back on the bike . No biggie . I then bought the small and that fit perfect everywhere except the quads . So ... I use the small most of the time and deal with the elastic marks and use the medium sometimes .
5 #### I bought this to haul deadfall and rocks out of my small wood lot . It is tough and heavy duty and so far has hauled loads of up to 200 lbs . Some other people commented about the rope which does seem small in diameter but so far it has done the job . It slides easily over the lumpy and hilly terrain which makes my job easier to do . Much cheaper , quieter and less destructive than an ATV .
5 #### Great pair of shoes . It took a day or two of breaking them in but after that they felt great . I use them at work were I am standing for about 7 + hours so these shoes are great if you 're out and about often .
5 #### Unbelievably comfortable right out of the box . OK they are the ugliest shoe I have ever had , but they are comfortable as slippers and tough as hiking boots , which is why I bought them . If you are fashion conscious , these are not for you . If you want comfort , function , and durability , these are the best I have ever had .
5 #### Bass go crazy for this lure . I get hits on this all the time , especially by the lilly pads .
2 #### Inexpensive , but poor quality optics . I use for birdwatching , and find that the spotting scope only really works at 20X magnification . At higher magnification the image quality can be very bad . Cheap lens covers and case as well . Save your money and buy something a bit better .
5 #### Great all around fixed balde knife . Feels great in tour hand , we 'll balanced . Blade is sharp . Skin clean game , fish or use as a kitchen knife in the outdoors .
3 #### The colors on the flag are vibrant and bright and the design is spot on . However , the fabric is n't fantastic quality and has already started to wear after just a few months . Still worth it for the price I paid and I 'm sure we can get another 6 + months of constant use out of it !
5 #### This grip is a better buy than the ones they sell at the pro shop at the tennis club . Golden .
5 #### I do n't see the difference in men 's converse or women 's , they 're the same thing and they fit really well
5 #### This pin is made with good quality and looks great on . It fastens the same as most standard lapel pins . Go Bolts Go ! Charge !
3 #### They are decent shoes . Material quality is good but the color fades very quickly . Not as black in person as shown .
5 #### I bought this for physical therapy . It is great ! It was only a little bit more than the off brand pad available here on Amazon . I think it is worth it to get the best brand . My physical therapist uses one with all her patients and swears by this brand .
5 #### Perfect companion to my concealed carry pistol on other side of hip .
5 #### Easy to use ! You do n't need to know a single knot to use the rope -- perfect for beginners . They are durable , stretch , and keep boat clutter to a minimum ! Great Buy !
5 #### I have been wearing Saucony Hurricanes for a few years . This version is as good as the others . Great shoe for an overpronator .
5 #### Practical and portable fitness kit . Good variety of resistance bands . Simple to use . Have n't tried to use the piece that can be used with door
4 #### So far , so good . These are really nice socks -- comfortable , warm and the size seems accurate .
5 #### I have an old pair of Jungle Mocs that I wore for 5 years . I put a lot of miles on them . They stood the test of time until I messed them up in a snow storm . The leather held up but some of the stitching stared coming out . I bought the new pair on amazon and they fit like a glove . So comfortable . The leather is almost like suede . Merrell has also put a new tread on the Jungle Moc . Makes me feel more stable , like I 've got a hold on the ground . Good , comfortable , slip - on shoes .
2 #### I do a * lot * of movement in my job and prefer sheer stockings to opaque for the aesthetic . I 'm always on the lookout for a sheer black tight that is resistant to runs and will last me a few wears . This is not that pair . These hose ran on the second wear and were no longer any good to me . I 'm not saying they 're bad -- the reinforced toe is a nice touch and they may last much longer for someone doing office work . But they did not stand up to the extra level of wear and tear challenge as I 'd hope they would .
4 #### NICE , IT DOES THE JOB IT IS SUPPOSE TO DO
4 #### size chart is not correct . You should add a cm or inches measure .
5 #### i said the pants were somewhat large but they are still really nice pants . they are a bit larger than i wanted i got the x large which they list as between 36 - 38 . turns out its more like 38 . but nothing a belt ca nt fix . i 'll still pick up a few more pairs in other colors just a size smaller .
1 #### I wore these shoe one time , from the airport in Omaha , NE to the airport in Phoenix , AZ . When I arrived in Phoenix , the left shoe / sole started squeaking and wo n't stop . I want to return for a refund . Need instructions for returning as no paperwork was in my package when it arrived .
5 #### We now have two , and my son is asking for one for his birthday .
5 #### Clear at 300 yard range . I used a camera tripod and it held pretty steady . Great value for the price .
4 #### Used for my son 's little league practice . Great for shagging/ similating pop flys . It does n't go a far as you would think but its a good tool for kids who are 12 and under .
5 #### These are a cold weather necessity . We camp outdoors when it gets cold and these have been a nice addition to our outside events / trips . I rarely find a dud in the multiple boxes that I have bought . I pick up a box each season now .
5 #### For the price , buy it ! It 's thin and light enough . Makes cooking at camp so much easier . Burner control is good and that fact that you can get spare parts from coleman is a godsend . Other makes have not been as kind in that regard . The liquid fuel stoves work as well , but the cleanliness of the burning propane and ease of refueling seals the deal for this .
5 #### I like the button fly , and the pockets have buttons .
5 #### Use to have the original Crazy Crawler from the 60 & 70s but it was lost when an unexpected Muskie struck the lure and cut the line . This new version works exactly the same , with it 's noisy swimming action and trail of bubbles . In my opinion is still one of the best Top water baits .
5 #### the wigs a bit shabby but overall a nice costume
2 #### Shipped them back and will reorder once I receive credit
5 #### I had one of these that I just replaced after the last one FINALLY started peeling . It lasts about 5 - 6 years in the hot Myrtle Beach sun , definitely worth it , GO COWBOYS !
5 #### Just the right amount of color for my light skin .
4 #### Shirt is of a good quality , but I 'm getting pretty tired of the fattening of America . I 'm 6'1 " and weigh 190 lbs . I also have arms that would put an orangutan to shame . The only way I can get long sleeve shirts to fit me is by ordering " talls " . In the past , I would by XL - T and they would fit just fine . But America got fatter and to make us feel better , today 's XL is what a 3X used to be and the Large is what a 2X used to be . That makes finding shirts that fit a real chore . There is no Medium - Tall option and the L - Tall leaves the shirt too baggy . That is the reason the four stars . So hear it is . America , you need to go on a diet or just get over the fact you are getting fat . Do n't expect clothing manufacturers to change there size standards just so you can live in a fairy tale land where you think your the same size you were in high school :) .
5 #### Of all the organization methods I have tried . The trays work best for me . I really like these .
1 #### I did not order men 's size 7.5 I ordered women 's 7.5 how can I get this resolved
5 #### My kids love their razors . Ride them everywhere and already went through one set . Lasted several years of hard riding and play . Great ! ! ! !
5 #### These are my husband 's favorite shirts . He 's 6'5 " and 320 and they fit perfectly .
1 #### I have Wrangler 40X32 relaxed fit on . They are too loose and too long . This should be the right size but they are not even close to being able to button them .
5 #### Great shoes . Bought them for my 5 year old son , he does n't complain , so I 'm pretty sure his feet are comfortable enough in them .
3 #### Very hard to put all the way on , but makes my 3 year old somewhat happy .
5 #### I feel these run a little big . I went with a small and it fits great . I wear a medium to small dress shirt .
5 #### exactly as described and came really fast ..... even for mexican post office standards . the box was filled with bags to protect the product .
5 #### A gift for a grandson who says they are comfortable .
4 #### Delivery was fast ! Bought for my baby girls xmas ! Ca nt wait for her to wear them ! !
5 #### Great gift for our grandson who could n't wait to put it up in his room .
5 #### I keep these at my office and use them from time to time during long conference calls or WebEx meetings that require me to listen or watch but not actively participate . The combination of bands makes it possible to achieve nearly any reasonable level of resistance for curls , tricep extensions , and deltoid raises . They 're handy in hotel rooms when traveling if the hotel gym is too busy or does n't feature dumbbells .
4 #### Love these cases because they fit perfectly in my veto pro pac without a millimeter to spare . Good quality , 4 Stars because they are very overpriced compared to competitors .
5 #### Good heavy duty shirt . Not flimsy . Stitching is very good
4 #### These are worth the money and are very inexpensive when compared to name brand . The only thing about them that is cheap is the wire cone holder . This broke at the weld as soon as I pulled it out of the box . But i did n't buy it for that , I bought it for the cones . I have had the cones for 2 solid years coach 18yr old boys in soccer . I will buy again , when i need to .
4 #### Great swivels . The plastic nuts may wear over time , we 'll see . But these are the only nickle - colored ones I found , and I 'm using them on a stainless / black synthetic Ruger 10/22 to continue the duo - tone theme , so they seem to be my only choice . Based on other Uncle Mike 's products , I 'm sure they 'll last a long time .
5 #### great wearing and long lasting shirts I have had these last 3 or 4 years
5 #### Please note this product will work on a younger child but I recommend it for a child that has one year of soccer experience and 5 + in age . Slips out of the container and is completely adjustable on the child 's ankle so it provides a perfect fit with no chafing with or without socks . The instructions and visual aids help the adult explain with ease to the child what the objective is and the child can figure out within two or three kicks what the idea behind this product is . It teach ball retrieval , settling to set up the kick , coordination , and is a lot of fun even when it knocks you down .
5 #### My husband loves these . I buy them for him all the time . Since " sport authority " closed I was worried but it actually better , more cost effective and a better buy to get them here
5 #### very good product would buy again ! Love them and would n't trade them for a different kind ! thank you very much
5 #### Great storage coast guard liked the fact the PFDs were ready at hand . Lots of storage pockets available . Set up took some time to get the straps to tuck in right . But once installed looks great and very functional .
3 #### Work OK but the burner control is some what touchy . Ca nt control the flame as good as my other Coleman stove .
5 #### LOVE them ! I have plantar fasciitis and I 'm on my feet all day at work . These offer supreme support and quick recovery . I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend them to anyone with foot issues .
5 #### I ca n't get enough of these . We have been ordering cases like this for years . It is great for the pool , beach and waterparks . It fits a couple of credit cards and few bills . If I am going heavy underwater I put everything in a sandwich bag first .
4 #### Apparently you need to order a 1/2 size smaller , but other then that I like them .
5 #### Bought for my brother . He loved the shirts . They are very nice quality made shirts . The size is right spot on . Color stays on these shirts . The fade mode is unbelievably great . Wished they had more colors .
5 #### My husband is a plumber an these bins fit well an are made well .
5 #### I 've owned several pairs of these . Merrell does n't make very many wide shoes , but these fit really well . Highly recommend them . They 're all - day comfortable , durable and have good traction .
5 #### perfect to use with my slip floats to sink worms
5 #### Excellent and cost - effective way to tone muscle anywhere without too much set up .
5 #### This was a gift for my son . He likes it and wears it well .
5 #### Very Impressed . Great magnification and clarity for the price . I look forward to trying this unit out with my camera someday .
5 #### Pretty good fit . Nice color shades . Best ones I 've found so far !
5 #### I am a woman who had to opt for the men 's version after finding the women 's version to be too narrow . I am a 9.5/10 in most of my shoes . I tried the women 's Newport in a 10.5 and although it was long enough it was too narrow and I found my little toe being squished against the side and sometimes squeezing out the space between the leather strips . The men 's Newport in 9.0 is just right in the width with even some room to wear socks(yes , I 'm that kind of geeky shoe wearer ) . There might be slightly more length than I need but I 'd rather have more than less . Very comfortable and just what I want as the weather gets cooler and need some warmth and coverage , but without having to give up sandals just yet .
4 #### This is a great inexpensive way to get your life jackets on your boat and up and out of the way . The straps are durable and mine had no problems with the zippers as mentioned in other reviews . It is not the highest quality in the world , but I am replacing the exact same model which lasted many years so I ca n't complain . 4 stars only because it is n't top quality . For clarification , this one did not come with the life - vests which were in the picture , they had to be purchased separately .
4 #### I own this and have done for over a year now . I have waited to write a review until now . I use it regularly , about 4 times a week . I weigh 80 , and am 6 ft tall . This machine is very well made and strong . I was really pleased with the build quality and its durability . After owning it 7 months , it did develop a squeaking noise as I worked out , but a little oil seemed to fix it . It gives you a great work out . I am quite fit and was worried that it would n't make me sweat and make my heart pound . But , boy , this thing can work you . The easiest setting is quite mild but you can up the resistance and it can get your heart thumping like a freight train . I do about 35 mins a time . I would strongly recommend this in the price range . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars was because of the stride length . I 'm 6 ft tall and I had to be adjust and be careful of knocking my knee against the front . But , I adjusted and it does n't happen now . If you are as tall a basketball player , you 'll probably want a longer stride length .
5 #### comfortable walking in the woods or trails well as just around town
2 #### I WAS using 10 lb test on spin cast and underspin reels and the line is too stiff for those type reels , it MAY be ok for bait casting reels but I am so displeased with it , I did n't even try . The spool went to trash can .
1 #### If you do n't care what your kid looks like for Halloween then this costume is for you . First of all the material is uncomfortable and if they wear clothes underneath you can see all the creases because the material is so thin . This costume has no shape to it and it makes them look like cheap pajamas .
5 #### Went a half size down like everyone said . Fit fine . Not comfortable enough to do a lot of walking in .
4 #### Daughter loves these shoes and will wear them all summer .
4 #### Very nice comfortable shoe . I normally would wear socks so these are a fine fit .
4 #### Matte black anodized finish , holes line up properly , includes mounting screws . The many slots allow great leeway in scope mounting position / eye relief .
5 #### my girlfriend wears converses all the time so i just grabed a pair of her shoes and bought the same size i bought these as a birthday gift she wears them to work every day
5 #### These were for my granddaughter , she was sooo pleased .. would definitely purchase again when she out grows these ..
4 #### Seems to be well made , only time will tell how well it holds up though . Hopefully it wo n't shrink up to my navel when I wash it .
5 #### I have been throwing these for over 40 years . They will catch just about anything that swims . I broke my last one last spring . I had IT for probably 20 years . Perhaps THE best lure EVER !
3 #### I feel like I forgot they run too large , I use to wear 9 or 9.5 in Nike and Adidas
5 #### I love this undershirt . I bought one ( along with the leggins ) last winter to wear under my XC ski clothing . Next I took it on a 5wk walk across Spain this spring . Although I did n't need to wear it much on the walk I lent it to several of my friends who were walking with me and who needed a little extra warmth ! My sister was one and I promised her one for her birthday ! I found it quite roomy and could have probably bought a medium for myself .... hence I bought the medium for my sister . It can be squished into a ziplock bag taking no space in your pack . It is warm and washes and dries quickly overnight . All in all a very useful item for travelling ! Jenn , BC
5 #### This shoe is all I had hoped it would be .
5 #### Works as it should . Easily adjusts and simple to use .
4 #### runs huge ! I ordered a size small for my 11 year old son . perfect fit !
5 #### I ordered this watch for my brother who only has the use of one hand . The band makes it easy to put on and take off and the big numbers of the dial are also great for making it easy to read the time ! The date indicator is a great feature too .
4 #### Arrived on time . I probably should have gone with a 7.5 instead of an 8 because they do seem a little big , but if I wear thick socks they are fine . Also , they can sometimes make a very annoying squeaky noise when I run on certain surfaces so I 'm trying to get them worn in . Over - all , I am satisfied with my purchase !
5 #### A+ It 's been in production for this long since it works . I 'm sure it is n't made to the standards of days gone by though .
5 #### Perfect size for two bags and accessories . Easy to assemble and setup . Very sturdy and should last for years .
5 #### They are perfect . The exact answer for the what I was looking for .
5 #### Ordered wrong size and need to seed back but great quality
5 #### This was actually purchased by my daughter but she was pleased with it !
4 #### This watch just carried me through a week 's vacation in the Guatemalan rain forest . Sturdy , attractive , water resistant to 50 m. The strap help up well in the humidity & rain and the indiglo lighted face was exceptionally useful at night .
3 #### As others have mentioned the vial was loose when I got it so I super glued it back in place and it has stayed for about 1300 rounds now on my .308 . The bubble does n't separate , it does n't really get in the way of anything , I can see it with my left eye while my right eye is in front of the scope , a drop of loctite and being butted up against the back side of the front ring it has not come loose . It works as well as the ones at twice the price . UPDATE 7/12/14 : Today the little clamp that holds it to the rail broke while shooting . May try another they are so inexpensive .
5 #### They are authentic Converse and a little cheaper than buying them from the Nike website in certain sizes . If you have Prime they will arrive a lot faster than they would from Nike so that 's great .
5 #### 5 stars for these adorable comfy shoes ! Great to wear with any casual outfit . I receive tons of compliments when I wear them with leggings and a big sweater . The shoelaces are a little too long , but I make do with them . You can always buy other fun colors in shorter laces
5 #### Love the bike rack . We went over 600 miles one way through NY City and was no problem for the bike rack . Never had one problem the whole trip . After loading and unloading a few times you start to get the hnag of it . Only thing is , if you have a bike with an oversized frame , mountain bike , kids bikes , you will have to go puchase an add on bar for each bike . They attach from handle bar to under seat and then you raise the seat as high as it can go . Once these add on bars were purchased it was a cinch . But we were dead in the water , until we purchased those . The cradles only fit the regular size tubing or slightly larger of bike frame . Loved it though . Thanks Swagman
5 #### I 've bought this exact model ( 608 ) for years . Best shoe ever . Usually I get them at Sears because once a year they have a really good sale price on them . This year , however , all I could find was the 608 - v2 ( version 2 ) . I tried them on and they felt like crap . I did some research on the web , and apparently New Balance considers the version 2 as an improved model or upgrade . I do n't know how they could be so wrong . Also , basically every review I read on the web said that reviewer hated the upgrade . So , with a little more research I finally found my size of the old model on Amazon . I 'm hoping New Balance sees the error of their ways and reverts to manufacturing the old 608 . Otherwise , a lot of us may be buying Nikes .
5 #### These shoes are great . This is the second pair that I have purchased and I love them .
4 #### Good quality and good feel . My son likes it . We use it for indoor only so I expect it will last a while .
5 #### I use this for my standing desk . It makes standing for long periods of time very comfortable . It 's just the right amount of squishy - comfy to stand on but deep enough to work on balance too .
5 #### this is the real deal . not some harbor freight . do not be fooled by ripoffs !
5 #### I have a few pieces of silver and over time , they begin to tarnish . I ordered the silver polishing cloth and spent just a little time rubbing the tarnished areas and I have brightly polished silver piece again . Not time intensive at all - great results .
5 #### Finding a stylish shoe in size 13 E is generally a task . However , Sebago has recently expanded their line of good quality , stylish men 's shoes to including these larger sizes . I have been looking for this particular shoe for about 6 months and finally got an email alert from Amazon that this item was now available . I am very pleased with the shoe , the fit and comfort are great and I am enjoying them very much . Buy it , you 'll like it .
5 #### was surprise when my son picked black over wheat color . but when this boot arrived , i was amazed at its beauty . thinking of buying the black color for my little girl though she already have wheat color .
5 #### Best lines I have had . Using them on a 14 ft sea doo jet boat . So easy to tie up
5 #### I have been wearing these for 47 years - no other tennis shoe or sneaker . I add arch supports to them .
5 #### Simple to use . Perfect for car camping . We did n't have any problems adjusting the flame .
4 #### Serves the purpose at a reasonable price ( and I do n't need 13 more words to say it does that )
2 #### It definitely holds well once in place , but as others have mentioned , the hooks are a nightmare . This thing gets badly tangled up , and the hooks grab onto everything , each other , the net itself , your clothing . No matter how hard you try to keep it straight , it tangles . If you ever let it get thrown down in a heap , heaven help you . You 'll spend a long time trying to untangle it . I prefer to use several bungee cords , the correct length , and crisscrossed . Much less frustrating .
2 #### I ordered a band size up and cup down like people said and it was totally wrong . The waist was took tight and the cup too big . It also makes your boobs like pointy
5 #### After a short while researches I finally decided to buy this product . This is my first spotting scope . I took it to range next day . I was able to see mosquito size items out there 200 yard pretty clear . I took a picture with my iphone 6 . I will upload the picture as well . This is 458 Yard range on a sunny day . So , let the picture do the talking . Overall I really satisfy with this scope .
3 #### Not bad for a every day watch after all it 's a Timex takes a licking and keeps on ticking
5 #### The price is great . My kids have so much fun scooting around . It 's great for getting out and getting some exercise .
5 #### I tear down my toys everytime I get back from the range . This kit makes it easier to clean my 10/22 . It takes some tugging to get the snake through the barrel ; but , that 's why they supply you with a plastic ' tugger ' tool .
4 #### They are actually pretty nice tights , did n't rip on the first wear like some . But the strange thing is that I fit in the middle of their smallest size measurement category , but they are very tight on the hips . To the point of me noticing elastic threads popping around the seat of the tights after a wash or two . They have plenty of room in the legs , though , so if I go up a size they are going to hang off of me . They look very cute otherwise , just the perfect amount of sheer . Make sure your nails are filed and hands are soft , without handrails , etc . , before you put any tights on , it will prolong their life . I really like Barely Black and Jet colours .
4 #### The boots fit nice , but the black could be a deeper richer color .
2 #### I was really saddened by this . They fit great , and they looked awesome . They ripped on the first wear . There was a run all the way of the left leg within minutes of putting them on . As others mentioned , order a size or two up . I ordered 2 sizes up from my normal size and they fit .
5 #### I 've had a few pair before this order . They work well for working around briars and a little extra protection if you are using sharp tools .
4 #### not bad for what it does and how long they last
5 #### I have been wearing for a solid week during my work outs & they are great for comfort and they are light weight .
5 #### Absolutely awesome spotting scope for the money ! Use it at the shooting range all the time and there is NEVER a shortage of shooters wanting me to spot shots for them to sight in their hunting rifles ! Would HIGHLY recommend the scope for the dollars spent !
3 #### Spent A Little Too Much Should Have Waited Untill Spring And Bought Them At Home Depot Or Lowes On Clearence
3 #### This bag is probably great for those who are using it on boats or off docks or things like that , but I bought it for white water kayaking . I do n't think the rope is strong enough . After completing a swift water rescue course I was left wishing I bought a thicker rope that could be used for a variety of rescue situations like removing a pinned boat or others . Not sure it 's good enough for those uses .
5 #### I choose this rating because I love the style . The bracelet colors are great and the clasp is unique . I love the Indiglow because it is so handy in reading the watch at night . I love my watch because it is a step up from the cheap watches I usually get and it looks good an my wrist , and it keeps good time .
2 #### The pink colored frisbee was advertised and while it said colors may vary , it stated the color pink was chosen as I purchased it . We had lost a pink one and wanted to replace that exact item . My son was very disappointed ! I will shop from a different company next time .
5 #### The watch is plain , simple and does what it 's supposed to----give me the time and the date . Bottom line , not fancy but effective .
5 #### Excellent mid sized cooler . Have used this Igloo for many years . Still made in Texas , USA ! !
5 #### OmG ........ Always , 25 yrs ... New pair like an old friend .... I can buy Chuck Taylor Converse All - star , hi - top or not , site unseen , and it 's like they are cost on made for me . Thank you so much ... Always Sheri
5 #### Purchased these for our teenage daughter . She loves them . For both casual wear and sports .
5 #### their definatly made to last . i ve had 2 pair for 2 or 3 years now and their almost new looking
5 #### I really like these sandals . I 've had a pair for years and they held up very well until I ran over them with the mower . So I went to Amazon to look for another pair of Keen 's . I found the exact pair I wanted but was worried about the size . As I looked at the reviews I found that most people were were saying to buy the next size up or the next half size up . So I ordered a 10.5 which is a half size larger than I normally wear and they fit perfectly . I would recommend ordering a half size larger than what you would normally buy . I worked for me .
3 #### I bought a band size up and a cup size down as suggested . Had I bought my usual size it would * definitely * have been too small around . The cups are a tiny bit small , but not too bad . They are , however , just as pointy as other reviews suggest . For wear with vintage clothing ( ' 30's-50 's ) , this is close to ideal for the short and/or short - waisted , but would probably look funny under any but the baggiest of t - shirts . For average height or taller people , this might be too short in the waist to give the right look for close - fitting vintage styles . If you are about 5 ' this will probably come all the way down to your waist . If you are under 5 ' , or under 5'1 " and short - waisted , this will actually be too long . I 'm 5'2 " and short waisted . With the straps shortened all the way , I can just get away with wearing this . Halfway through the day , I had to pull it up in the back , because the boning in the back / sides started to rub on my backside and sides .
4 #### There are comfy shorts . They have pockets which is not the norm for women 's shorts . The pockets are handy .
5 #### Fits great , size as expected . My favorite bra for many years .
1 #### If I could give it zero stars I would . Not only was it HUGE . The body would fit my three year old .... but the legs would fit my 9 year old . Plus we ordered a SUPERMAN costume . This showed up without a cape and was a " Super Hero " suit . The belt was made from felt and the the details were painted on with bad paint that peeled off , and were not even straight lines . Bad form Amazon for letting this one slip by .
5 #### these jungle mocs are a classic , comfortable , good looking and easy on easy off .
4 #### working as expected , but a bit higher price comparing other similar shoes .
5 #### Heavier fabric than today 's graphic t - shirts . Highly recommended . No frills . Just a great shirt .
5 #### This is a repeat purchase . My husband loves them and swears they are the most comfortable shoes ever ! !
1 #### sizing is off . it says xxxl but fits like xxxxl . do n't know why this is but that 's the way it is . company will exchange though but it wastes your time doing this .
5 #### These sights fit my Mossberg 500 Williams factory sights perfectly . You do need an hex head wrench for the front sight .
4 #### Both my bikes have been hanging out here for about 6 months . It works . I would have liked it to be a bit more substantial ( a little bigger pipe diameter ) but it does what it is supposed to do .
5 #### My grand - daughter looks sooo cute .I think I will order them in several other colors for her !
4 #### This is a minimalistic chair which was what I was looking for . It 's made well but definitely not super padded if that 's what you are looking for . I would say there is about a half inch of padding . You can still feel the hard bleacher but it makes it a little softer and would definitely serve to keep you dry for outside football games . I 'm fairly thin , so for me this chair is a little wide and it does tend to wrap around me a bit but it is n't bothersome . I like that the back is taller than most chairs and the back is the most important part to me . One thing to note is that there are no straps to hold the chair closed when carrying and that would have been nicer for sure .
5 #### We received exactly what we ordered and right size . It arrived quickly !
5 #### This is the best night - time bass fishing lure ever ! Spent the entire night just slaying the bass . You got ta buy yourself a few of these babies .. just stay away from my lake , or at least leave some for me . Going to have a big fish fry this weekend !
5 #### I choose these over flip flops to protect my toes . They run slightly small . I would suggest going up a size . I wear a wide normally and these are perfect . Wonderful construction , beautiful color- excellent .
3 #### These shoes look really great . However , slightly loose . The problems with lack of support arose when I exercised . It feels like there is little to no support in them . Possibly this is a shoe more geared for an office environment or short walking distances .
4 #### The shoes came as I wanted . looks amazing as in the picture . Nice white and really good shade of black really made it pop . only issue is that the show was a weeeebit too small , it cna be worn I do alot just that my toes slitly press agasinst the end of the shoe
3 #### removing the cups to replace the batteries is a royal pain , never buying again
5 #### I bought the grey shoes and they look nice and they are very comfortable . I always receive compliments on them . However , I am reluctant to wear them in wet weather due to other reviews I have read .
5 #### Exactly the size and color my daughter wanted . I used the centimeter sizing rather than the boys / girls sizing to make sure I got the correct size for her . Grabbed an outgrown pair of converse , added a centimeter , and BaBAM ! Middle school girl fashion at it 's finest .
5 #### My wife 's friend Tyrone said they were a better fit .
5 #### I love my new Merrell Jungle Moc slip- ons . Do n't know why I never bought a pair before , but I sure wear these a lot now . Thank you for such a great product ! ! !
5 #### I purchased these shoes for my eleven year old son . The size chart helped perfectly . I 'm glad I read that they run big . He 's usually a mens size 8 and we ordered him the 6 1/2 and they fit perfect ! Thank you !
5 #### I love how these fit and the color looks beautiful on .
5 #### Keen sandals are the most comfortable shoes , you will not be disappointed . I have three different styles of the sandals , each pair fits as expected and come in so many colors .
4 #### Prior to recieving this I could barely shoot a box of 20 .300WM before my shoulder would be killing me . This stock butt pad hardly helps any relief of recoil . Now I can get through 3 boxes , I will still be sore but this is a vast improvement . I m sure once I add a comp it will add further relief and perhaps feel as if I am shooting a 7.62x54R ....
5 #### I always buy hosiery a bit larger than the label suggests , which is why I rated it a bit small . Very nice hose ; the " nude " looks like bare legs , only better .
3 #### Most reviews claimed they run big so I ordered my daughter a half size down . Wrong ! Did n't fit . :(
4 #### The band runs small . Do n't let the stupid date / day setting instructions blow your mind - clockwise for the date 1st - THAN-2nd go counter clock - wise for the date .
5 #### These have been the only bands I 've ever bought . With that in mind , they meet my expectations but wish they'ed last a little longer . My most used band developed nicks after about 18 months . After tempting fate I decided to heed the manufacturers warning and get a new one . They come in any weight range you can imagine . I initially bought a pack of 5 or 6 but since replaced and bought individuals . I do n't have the space for weights and I understand they 'll never be the same but I love the portability and flexibility to do just about any weight lifting exercise .
5 #### I purchased this as a gift and person who I gave it to was very pleased . Very well made .
3 #### You definately get what you pay for with this costume . I bought it for my son and it was cute on him and he had fun being a lion . But it is VERY thin ( I had to put clothes on him underneath the outfit ) and VERY shiny . Cheap material . Three stars out of five because it is not that expensive and gets the job done .
4 #### Love it . We purchased the Bushnell Falcon 133410 Binoculars for amateur bird watching and hopefully for star gazing . And it works wonderfully . The binoculars are little on the heavy side but easy to adjust focus and to use . The case and strap that came with the binoculars are of mediocre quality . It would have been helpful to have a more sturdy case and strap . Furthermore , you will need to attach the strap to the binoculars upon first use . Simply unfasten each of the buckles and slide each each end of the strap through the slots located at the bottom of the binoculars . Then , run them through the buckles twice before adjusting the length . The binoculars also come with a cleaning cloth and 4 lens covers . The lens covers fit easily but not a tight fit and can fall off easily . Hence , one less star based on the above observations for the accessories .
2 #### Sketchy craftsmanship , low - grade materials , junk . They appear much more substantial than they are . Upon arrival you will see that the outside layer of mesh is a form of see - through mesh . The orange dots on the shell are just decor held in place by a paper backing on the inside of the shell . The pads themselves are held on by two elastic / Velcro straps . But , the materials are so loosely put together it makes for a lousy fit that just does n't stay in place . Regarding fit - they fit my 65 pound 7 year old son very well , with room to grow . But I do n't suspect they are going to last very long for him to grow . I got these on a $ 10 special . I 'll let me sons trash them and toss them and maybe they will spare them from a skinned knee or elbow first . Photos are attached for closer looks at the materials used .
5 #### Really impressed by these . When steamed they last just as long if not longer than other regular shuttlecocks . a real bargain for the price .
3 #### Great classic shoe . It fits like a size 14 though , even though it 's a size 12 .
5 #### These are great work pants . For anyone that welds , and other jobs that are hard on light weigh blue jeans.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Carhartt - Men - s - Double - Front - Duck - Utility - Work - Dungaree - B01 - Carhartt - Brown-46 - x-32 / dp / B000FXUXCM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Carhartt Men 's Double Front Duck Utility Work Dungaree B01,Carhartt Brown,46 x 32</a >
5 #### Really great for walking I 'm very glad I got these and the color is fun
3 #### The shoe is too large . When you do lunges it hurts the heel . The shoe size from a local store is the size I ordered from Amazon however the size or fitting seems to be large
3 #### Good thing I read the other postings , ...... these to run small .... I purcharsed one size up ....
2 #### Plastic belt clip .... felt cheap . I sent it back . I recommend something with a more rigid clip , like metal .
5 #### Just finished hemming it for the 5th grader boy who will play the Queen . It is very well designed and put together , completely adequate for our stage performance . I appreciate that it came with everything we need except shoes .
5 #### Great for what we wanted . Very well made . Fits right over our pool table . Paddles are really well made also .
5 #### The first couple of days they really hurt , but once I broke them in they are my new favorite shoes ! ! Great pair of clogs definitely recommend !
5 #### Equipment I bought to go with a bike purchase for my son so that he could prep for a tri . He likes it and says it works great ! It is also very lightweight . Very comfortable .
5 #### First of all , this product is high quality product from Coleman . I researched for weeks trying to find a new Dual Fuel Camping Stove at a reasonable price . I have n't found a cheaper priced one until I came across this one at [ ... ] . My family camps at least once a month . The camp set up has to be like the Hilton for my wife and this product adds to the quality camping experience . I was using propane stove prior to this stove and I hated lugging around all those propane bottles . I 've actually moved to all Dual Fuel camping equipment ie . stove and lanterns . All I bring is a small 2.5 gallon unleaded fuel to run all my camping equipment and it is very convenient . I would highly recommend this product if you and or your family are hard core campers who camp more than 4 times a year . Happy Camping !
4 #### I had researched inexpensive scopes for a long time before purchasing this one . It seems to have great low light capabilities and I like the cross hair pattern . I 'm not sure about accuracy or durability yet though as I have n't had it long . One thing I wish was different was the threads on the adustment screw caps are to many . It takes a looooooong time to unscrew and screw on each cap . I guess most scopes have this though .
5 #### Great set for your toaster oven . Excellent non - stick coating ; this will help keep your oven clean , too .
5 #### Well designed and built ... we'll see how it holds up with the kids .
4 #### My RAA Saiga rifle has 1 - inch sling swivels , and this sling fits them perfectly . It 's a great , low - cost solution and it 's much more comfortable than a plain 1 - inch nylon sling . In fact , I liked the price so much I bought three of them . I 'll probably put one on my SKS in place of the plain military sling . ( For ARs , I 'd prefer 1.5 - inch webbing . )
5 #### Fit perfectly . I bought dark grey , and they did n't fade
4 #### Color wasted expected . Tf shoes arrived very quickly . Nothing to complain about except the fact that I ordered the wrong size .
5 #### Works great , you can adjust size , I think it is exactly like all the more expensive ones . I do n't really use it , but good product for your safety .
5 #### For us , keeping the boat tied up to the dock where the tide can move 3 - 4 feet , these work WONDERFUL . Had to buy another set for a friend of mine . All my guys were impressed .
5 #### My husband will not wear anything but Merrell shoes anymore . He has een wearing them for a number of years now and absolutely loves them
5 #### Does what it 's supposed to do . A little difficult to slide on a rubber freedive belt but not too much of an issue to rate a bad review . Works great !
5 #### This is so much better then the ones that have springs . Easy soft low impact boucing . Sturdy . Takes two people to put together so one can hold the unit down , but we put it together fast without much hassle at all . Nice size too .
5 #### El articulo perfecto . Me gusto bastante . Lo recomiendo 100 % . Es de buena calidad . Si volvera a comprarle a este vendedor .
3 #### Waist was to small , legs were to long . Nice pants though .
5 #### Nothing fancy here . Just a good watch with easy to read numbers , nice dark hands and a night glow feature . Meets all the needs . Good price too .
5 #### Bought it for replacement of batteries in a watch . Used some on car door seals . I figure it will be around for a while , so I do n't contaminate it with fingers .
5 #### If you 're like me and have a difficult time controlling where and how hard to hit the ball during practices using a standard bat or a fungo , this thing is amazing ! It does take a little getting used to , and like swinging a bat , you will be tired after hitting 100 balls at practice . Accuracy is great though for pop flies ! I still go back to a regular bat for grounders . That 's about the only thing that is missing from this , is the " sound " of a ball hitting a bat . Other than that , increases productivity at practice since every ball is a properly hit ball . There 's also a tennis racket style of this sold by another company if you 're considering options .
5 #### A bike helmet is really just a specially shaped piece of foam . The foam is the right design and density to protect your head if you have a serious impact . They 're designed to break ( instead of letting your head break ) . Helmets with a good design have a thin plastic cover to reduce air flow , keep the foam from breaking or having holes poked in it , if you run into branches , and make it look good . Inside is an adjustable set of bands and straps that should keep the helmet secure on your head . This helmet has a dial system to quickly adjust the headband circumference and a sturdy dual - strap system to keep it on . Like many others , it has a visor , but unlike many others , it does a good job of keeping the sun out of your eyes when the helmet is worn properly . All in all , it 's a top - rated helmet with an sharp design . I 've ridden a mountain bike for years , and this is the one I got for my eleven year old to go with his first ' adult ' mountain bike .
4 #### seems like a good deal considering you get three for the price of 2 in store . They are built like tanks , however usually my guns are loaded , no trigger lock and i do n't use them that often
5 #### I keep this polishing cloth in my nightstand and I use it almost every day before putting on my earrings and other jewelry . It works great !
5 #### Was as advertised also take their advice about getting a size smaller I did and they fit perfect on me
5 #### My husband loves these shoes , wears them all day and never has any problems with tired feet !
4 #### Lovely , fits , and the lace pattern is gorgeous . Only 4 stars because I had to bend the underwire in the middle to make it not poke me in the underarm .
5 #### They are the shoe of shoes . I own multiple pair in different colors . They are great shoes and will last you ... Be carful they can rub your skin raw if you do n't properly tighten them . i could wear these shoes for days .
5 #### Very comfortable . The foot bed supports my foot and they are easy to get on and off .
1 #### I ordered a size 9.5 women 's and received a 8.5 . My order clearly states 9.5 . And their is n't enough time to return it and get another before Xmas morning ... so I guess their will be one disappointed girl .
5 #### I did n't know what size to order so I ordered up a size and it is a bit too big but I 'm OK with that . I live in Houston so when the summer heat hits I prefer loose clothing for work . The straps are a little longer than I expected , but I 'm only 5'0 " so that 's fine too . Very pretty , very comfie , very well made . Me gusta !
5 #### The Fox 40 classic has become the gold standard in referee whistles . This cushioned model is my favorite . You do n't notice it until your calling 5 , 6 , 7 , even eight games in a day . Just be sure to rinse it out and wash it Listerine to keep it clean .
5 #### Fantastic . Easy installation and looks impressive when installed . The mechanical advantage of the pulley system is great . Highly recommend this company 's products .
5 #### They work and top water fishing is the most fun .
5 #### I 've ran a few 5k 's with this pack and it 's great ! It easily fits an iPhone , keys , credit cards , etc . It does n't bounce when you run , like you would expect and you hardly notice it 's there . I recommend this , in fact my little sister bought one as well .
5 #### Will pump your inflatables up in a hurry , I use it for air mattress when camping and have passed it around to other people i 've camped with and it usually pays about a 2 beer dividend , it is a goo d inflator . Recommend .
5 #### Great shoes . This is my second pair . When they wear out , I 'll buy a third .
4 #### If you know that converse tend to run big then you should have no problems with this shoe . My son loves them . Unfortunately Converse does not have any arch support .
5 #### This slingshot did exactly what I needed it to do : retrieve an item 70 feet up in a tree . It was able to fire a small 1/2 oz fishing weight attached to 20 lb fishing line up 70 feet ( it could have gone much higher ) , which allowed me to retrieve my small drone which snagged a branch . The slingshot is very basic , but has more than enough power . All of the materials seem to be high quality with the exception of the plastic grip mainly because it 's left hollow for storage of ammunition . It is very sturdy , however , when pulled back to shoot . The ability to carry ammunition inside handle is a convenient function but the trade off seems to be at the expense of durability in workmanship . This folds up somewhat easily and is light enough to carry around in my back pocket . It came packaged securely . Overall , a great find for the price .
5 #### Perfect addition to my 2 year old son Buzz costume !
3 #### I received this frisbee broken . The seller said that it was probably a bad battery so I purchased new batteries for it ( it takes two ) and put them in . Let me tell you that changing the batteries was a pain in the butt and I had to try several combinations before getting it to work since it does n't show which way the batteries go . Now it kind of works , it 'll stay lit while floating in the air but as soon as it hits your hands or the ground the light shut off and you have to play with it to get it lit back up again . I 'm giving it 3 stars because it floats well and flys far but being that it does n't stay lit up it makes it useless for ultimate frisbee nights .
5 #### No , really . It really does blow and it blows well ! I 've used several pumps of this type over the years for rafts , exercise balls , etc ... I bought this to air up my new raft and it work fast and seems to be made of better parts than the previous pumps I 've had .
5 #### I 've had this sled for almost a year . It is a very useful tool , hauls firewood , chainsaws , axes , shovels , chains , ropes , etc behind the atv easily . I was going to get the Shappel Jet sled but opted for this one as for $ 8 in camo paint I could paint the camo on . I use this when duck hunting too . Hauls 2 bags of decoys , dog platform , ammo , gun , a folding chair , blind material , my waders and whatever else I think I need at the time stacked full and secured with bungee cord , all in one trip , how did I get along without it ? One thing , my lab tried climbing in it when it was on the water and I was setting out dekes , she sunk it . I have no doubt it floats with weight in it , it 's just she pulled the edge of the sled over and let water in . For grins I had her sit in it and floated her on the water , no problem and she is a fit 75 lbs .
4 #### This shirt does n't really look all that great on , but it does n't look horrible either . It 's a little bit too big and bulky , but I use it for working out in so it works well for what I need it to do .
5 #### If you wear Nike on the regular , then you should pretty much know your size . I wear only 7 's in Nike , and it fit just as expected . I have many of the trail runner generations , and love them all . they 're my go to sneakers for the gym use , or casual wear . I have a pair I used mostly for casual wear that have lasted about 5 years . Another pair that I used for cross fit / outdoor runs that lasted a little over a year ( very vigorous daily use ) . All in all , these shoes are great for me . They 're lightweight , and comfortable .
1 #### It fit snug on my rail and stayed on when i shot but sometime while transporting my gun and getting it in and out of my case it fell off
5 #### The finish on this camo version was surprisingly great . All tools function great , there 's a satisfying snap feel when pulling any of them completely out . There is n't a lock to hold it in place , just a little extra pressure to close said tools . Really satisfied with it , got one for the wife as well , she loves it .
5 #### My second pair , love the fit , light weight and great support .
5 #### My boyfriend can never find his size in store , and so when we found them on Amazon , it was a huge relief ! They stand up really well , he uses them at work every week . Note to other buyers : It 's normal that they 're pretty stiff . Carhartts need a little wearing in .
5 #### Perfect fit , very comfortable , and a great color . They also fit as expected .
5 #### Seems like a good helmet for the price . Easy to put on and take off with quick snaps .
3 #### Well Made . But they were too big . And they are definitely a dude shoe . Nice and wide and not a women 's look , which would be fine since I was going to wear them to work- in scrubs . I tried sending them back , but the return email with the return label expired before I could print it , and I emailed back several times and no reply . So I am now trying to give them away or sell them . I do n't know if I can get full price for them . Brand new ! Bummer .
5 #### Works great on a 1994 Volvo 850 Wagon . It attaches tightly to the rear hatch . My only concern was that the hatch hinges , which are a bit rusty , would n't hold and the whole thing , 4 bikes , carrier and rear hatch , would drop onto the freeway . Lucky for all those drivers behind us during 6 hours of driving , no such thing happened .
5 #### Great watch for construction work . Handles plenty of abuse . Battery life has been about 2 years . I 've purchased this model multiple times , with the same dependable results .
5 #### I am fat ish 215lbs 5'11 " I have very large muscular legs and thighs from years of power lifting followed by a knee injury that led to having a flat butt that being said these fit a little small in length and height.and are very revealing of my umm man parts .
5 #### Just what I ordered . No problems . Fits exactly , lightweight and very comfortable . Would recommend to others that need an athletic supporter
5 #### They are the best for boating and walking . one pair i walk 500 miles over the course of two years . The color works with everything . Very well made , would recommend .
5 #### Like the length and somewhat trim fit . Have two pairs in this style -- reliable fit . Great for running , floor work and all the other exercises that happen in a bootcamp class .
5 #### great place for the hot lid , works great and pack easy .
5 #### They are a little large , but I wanted them to fit longer . My son loves them . They are so cute and sturdy
3 #### Its all right not really gon na make any difference . Original iron sights are just as good . Better to buy these cheepos and see if this is what you want or not than blow your money on some high end that you do n't like .
4 #### Got this for my 7 year old daughter and she loved it . Only issue with it was the right handle bar was smashed into a oval vice a circle . I had to hammer it into shape . In most cases I would send it back for replacement but since this was from " Santa " I could n't do that . The scooter works great and she rides it daily in and outdoors .
5 #### Carhartt 's are well known with their good qualities . Lasts a long time , and when it gets old , they become better as vintage look .
4 #### i am a ladies size 9 took half a size down and still fits loose .. they are very large .. with socks i can manage to wear ok ..
5 #### These Skimp Skamp Briefs are the most comfortable undies I 've ever worn , and I 've been buying them for a long , long time . They 're perfect for anyone who does n't like bikini or high - rise panties . After three babies , I ca n't wear those things anymore . The fabric moves with you , and they 're practically invisible under clothing . I add Oxi - Clean to the detergent when I wash them , as chlorine bleach does a number on them . Plus I use a hanger with clips to air - dry them on the shower rod , as they last longer that way .
3 #### The leather is not supple . I was expecting higher quality based on a pair I saw in the color black at a local store . That pair , 11 EE , were a bit too small . I ordered 11.5 EE and the ones I now own in brown , are a bit too large . The size of shoes and boots versus proper fit has always been unpredictable . Finding EE width in a store is rare . Wear them before you buy them is hard to do on - line .
4 #### I wear these shoes daily and keep coming back to them . I have however consistently had two problems with them over the years . First , they usually tear out about mid shoe along the top of the sole after about 18 months . Second , the brass grommets have become very sharp and I have cut my shins more than once when one of the grommets became raised of otherwise damaged as a result of wear . I 'm on the boat alot and I 'm sure I 'm hard on the shoes . A third issue worth mentioning is the rubber soles can harden over the years and become very slippery on the boat . Fortunately , I guess , the sides tear out on me or the grommets get too problematic before the soles become an issue . Still , I always have a pair in the kit . I am trying out a Sebago Men 's Clove - hitch II boat shoe this time and so far I love them but it 's too early to tell what issues will arise .
5 #### I really wanted a bag that was mobile and lightweight enough to move if the need arose ; this item fills the bill there , even after I filled it with water . I love the punching surface ; it feels sturdy , but gives just enough that my wrists and hands feel ok after 30 minutes or so of working out some building frustration ( I do wear boxing gloves ) . It is great to have this outlet , though I have traded big frustration for a minor one . The bag moves all over and I feel I have to chase it and move around it to maintain striking distance . This is tricky if I am using a workout DVD or the like , or if I have somewhat limited space , which I do . I tried using door wedges to no avail , perhaps I will try a mat as other reviewers have suggested . But , I guess if I were sparring I would n't have a stationary target either and moving around to hit my target is not a bad thing- real life simulation of sorts . Overall I am quite happy with the bag . My fellow drivers and those living with me are happy with it too . I ca n't wait to go and punch it every day , even multiple times per day .
5 #### Weightlifting caused 18 months of golfers elbow ( inside of elbow , .. , tennis elbow is outside of elbow ) . I tried just about everything to fix it short of cutting my arm off . Nothing worked . Ice , compression straps , bands , rest , you name it ..... It did n't work . Stumbled on a YouTube video of this product . Purchased red ( easier ) , green ( medium ) and blue ( harder ) . Did reverse Tyler twist 2 - 4 times per day , everyday . Worked up from easy to hard . Used it as a warmup to lifting too . Within 8 weeks I was basically cured . No pain . I now use the bars intermittently during the week or as a warmup to lifting . Cured .
5 #### I had worn the same Swiss Army watch for 5 1/2 years . It was a great watch that was a birthday present . It was not cheap and I enjoyed it . I had to replace the strap many times , though , and finally the battery died , so I decided it was time for a new watch . I did not want to spend a lot of money but I wanted something that was stylish yet casual enough to wear everyday . This is that watch . Do not listen to the naysayers who complain that the watch face is too big or the date too small . The face is exactly the right size for a man 's watch and the date , while admittedly small , is readable . The photo on Amazon shows the body of the watch to be gray - it is actually black , though , and looks great . This is the third watch I have purchased on Amazon ( the other two were gifts ) and I am just as pleased with this as with the others . This is my first Timex , but I am sure it wo n't be my last . And for under $ 40.00 !
3 #### Grandchild was terrified of it for some reason .. don't know why ?
5 #### This is my second pair of these shoes . I love the fit and they provide support for walking . I like the way the shoes fit around my ankle , as many shoes are uncomfortable because they come up too high in the back . Try them !
1 #### This is not a " non control top " pair of tights as it still digs into my stomach despite going a size up . These are tighter than some of my other control top tights . Will not be purchasing again .
5 #### 4 year old loves it for swim lessons . Way better than the latex caps .
5 #### This is alot of knife , fits the hand perfectly , the sheath is not bad at all . this thing comes sharp ! like really sharp ! so bear that in mind , i use this in my fire turnout gear in a 5.11 tool organizer with all my other tools fits perfectly in bunker pants . great quality metal and handle
5 #### Worked just like it was supposed to Nice steel rings that hold the scope real well
5 #### I am SO thrilled to find this panty again ! ! Had bought maybe 14 years ago and when I tried to find , recently , there was nothing available . Out of style , I guess , and not made anymore . So , I now have enough panties to last for a long time ! ! thanks very much ! !
4 #### excellent watch the band is a bit small but the watch is great . it has a very readable face sets easy and keeps excellent time
5 #### Great rings at a great price . I use Quad Locks on all my rifles and have never been disappointed . Word .
5 #### This is probably the best dart board I have ever owned . This is great for hanging in the basement and having some friends over or if you own a pub or billiard this would make a great addition . I used to play darts with my family when I was a kid so I was so excited to finally have a board of my own to be able to play with my own children . It is such a great stress reducer and when our little one starts to get upset or throw a fit , I let her throw a couple under close supervision of course and she just seems to forget whatever she is upset about . The corking in the panels seems to be really sturdy and well made . I would say this could definitely withstand whatever strength you put behind your throws . It 's great for a home entertainment and I love the Viper brand . They seem to be a quality made product which is rare these days .
4 #### Pretty good sweet and sour pork . I would let it re hydrate for at least 20 minutes . Pork was still slightly crunchy in places even after 20 minutes .
5 #### Bought some arrows to go with a light fiberglass bow I bought for my nephews . The construction is fine and I would n't hesitate to buy them again .
4 #### The pads could have been bigger . I got scraped because they slipped a little bit .
5 #### I remember converse ever since I was a kid ! These shoes are fun , comfortable and I just love them ! The color is so very true to the website . I will probably order more in different colors ! The size is pretty true also . Maybe a little on the big size since they are for men and women , but still , very comfortable !
5 #### Exactly as advertised . Clean and brand new . Fitting charge accurately depicted sizes .
5 #### My 9 year old son loves this scooter ! He rides it in our unfinished basement and also uses it when I go for walks . I will be buying one for my 4 year old soon as well , since she likes her brother 's scooter too !
4 #### Plenty of people wear these shoes for fashion but in the weight lifting community they are worn for performance . I needed a good pair of squat shoes and I did n't want to spend a lot of money , luckily Chuck Taylor All - Stars are one of , if not the most recommended shoes for squatting ( for back squats not front squats ) . I first bought a pair of the low top shoes and decided that I wanted more ankle support and more style ( I bought red ones which do n't look great on guys ) . I ended up getting the high - tops in blue and I have to say that I am pretty happy now . They look way better so I do n't have to feel embarrassed while wearing them . My squat form is significantly better now that I have a hard , flat sole to press into . The only bad thing is that the toe area is a bit narrow which is weird because the shoes are definitely not too small , if anything they 're a little big . Chuck Taylors are legendary for having bad sizing though so I 'm not surprised . Overall , the shoe is great for squatting but I would never get them for walking around , they would be very uncomfortable .
5 #### I bought these shoes for my daughter and she loves them . They were a very good price and I will probably buy more .
5 #### Actually the jeans are terrific . I 've put on a few pounds but look forward to wearing them more comfortably next month .
5 #### Natural color is perfect for low top Chucks with a pair of jeans
5 #### I bought these for my boyfriend for his birthday . He loved the !
5 #### These are super comfortable and durable . I am very happy with my purchase .
2 #### I was looking for a long lasting quality tag frame to display my alma mater . While the quality is very good the alignment of the lower label was grossly misaligned , so much so that I returned it . I did purchase a different style tag frame from this same company and I 'm pleased to report this tag frame had no imperfections .
4 #### These targets are great ( I back them with cardboard to use them , personally ) . The seller shipped promptly enough ( not ultra - quick , though , like I 'm used to with stuff directly from Amazon ) and they arrived in a big box which contained a much smaller box , which contained the rolled targets . BTW , no signature required . Before ordering , I hesitated due to a prior review ( By Chase , from 18 May 2013 ) saying these targets are not regulation IPSC size . It turns out they are . I think the confusion stems from the fact that there are two IPCS targets ( see the rule book , appendix B < http://www.uspsa.org/rules/2010HandgunRulesProof3web.pdf>)-- The targets for sale here at the IPSC metric target shown in Appendix B2 . I , personally , see this target more frequently . The target is exactly as is shown in the picture , and the A - Zone measures approximately 6 inches wide by 11 inches high ... which is IPSC spec ( converted to inches ) . There is ANOTHER IPSC target ( the so - called " classic " target ) in which the A - Zone is definitely smaller . I think this is what Chase was referring to . So , in terms of dimensions : Look at the picture . If it looks like the target you want , be assured that the dimensions are IPSC standard compliant for this type of target .
3 #### I LOVE the look and comfort of these shoes for style and lifting weights . Super cute and flezable . BUT for running , absolutely not ! ! It might just be my pronation / supnation and these shoes just do not work for my personal stride . I run about 2 - 4 miles every few days . Average of 8 miles a week and then sprints twice a week on a treadmill . Just after running with these 3 times , I am having major back issues that I have never had before . MY STATS and other shoes : I road and trail run . I run on my tip toes on the treadmill and a lot of heal on the road . I am 5'6 169lbs with more muscle than an average runner . Built more like a sprinter than a marathon runner . I LOVE Nike FLEX bottoms . They really give me support and flex needed . I have also used Asics and Puma .
4 #### Bought these and the Esbit stove to use on the trails . We often go out on all day ATV rides and it 's really nice to brew up a fresh cup of coffee on a cold day . One cube and a a few dry twigs boiled 2 cups of water without issue . Some instant coffee and all was good . Nice to have an inexpensive , reliable and easy solution to whip up a cup - o - joe on the trail .
5 #### My second pair , love the fit , light weight and great support .
5 #### This was a Christmas gift for my grandson . He loves it !
5 #### these were for my granddaughter , and it 's the second pair I 've gotten for her .... they are STILL the " in " thing , and she loves them the vendor got them to us quickly ... well packed
2 #### I * * loved * * these shoes when I got them . I 've noticed that the foam inside tends to compress during a workout , though . I 'll lace them tightly enough that they 're nearly cutting off my circulation . 20 minutes later , I 'm sliding out of them while doing sled pushes .
5 #### The Timex Men 's T44921 is a good value for the money . I can easily see the time . The watch is very lightweight . The indiglo light is another positive feature . The date is small , but I think the other features outweigh this shortcoming . I would recommend buying this watch .
3 #### Good standby fuel source . Unpleasant odor . Have not used , so have no idea of duration of heat with each fuel block .
5 #### My 9 yr old daughter loves this watch and wears it every day . It is a soft band and adjustable . If it 's too long once it 's tightened for a small wrist you can just cut off the extra and it does n't fray at all .. It 's been worn in the pool and still works fine . The face has some scratches since it is plastic , but it 's held up surprisingly well for a kids watch .
5 #### Good looking old school tennis shoe . good craftsmanship , thick sole and comfortable .
4 #### My granddaughter was so cute . made her look like a baby doll .
2 #### This lid holder will do what you want it to- hold a lid - but you need to use caution . It is wobbly and easily collapsible .
5 #### Needed these shoes to go with a pair of Aruba blue jeans ... perfect match and look SO cute on . Love them .
3 #### It was okay but way too hot to wear all night and the plastic underlining was a tad uncomfortable . Overall an okay mask , but I would not buy it again
5 #### These shirts are good quality . I 've always owned Carhartt bibs and jackets . I when I found these on Amazon I thought I 'd try them . They are bigger than the sizing leads you to believe . I wear an XL in every brand , but when I ordered XL in this one , it was more like a XXL . The product tag says these are designed for workers to have room to move . I must have overlooked that in the product ad , so it 's on me about the sizing . I 'm always in need of good quality pocket work shirts and these fit the bill perfectly . The are 100 % cotton and are heavy weight material . I should have chosen a lighter colors too . As these tend to be a little hot in the sun . These will be perfect in the winter time . These washed up great without having any issues with the seams or material . They did n't shrink very much , if at all . My wife washed them in warm water as the label instructed .
5 #### It is so cool and fit my foot perfect . But one thing you need to be careful is converse 's shoes are bigger than other shoes in same size .
5 #### Very nice stringer . Easy to use and quite inexpensive . A very good value ! Excalibur rocks the Crossbow market ! I love their quality !
5 #### HOLY COW was my boy happy to see this . This does n't have any lights or anything , but he LOVED it . It was hard getting it off of him , but thankfully we did and I think he 's forgotten about it now . lol
5 #### You get what you pay for OR LESS . In this case , you get MORE than you pay for . Worth every penny . These socks are not only comfortable and durable , but wick moisture well and stay up . What is not to like ?
5 #### Love these but get one size bigger in the waist or it will be extremely tight ! The length is fine
3 #### Not the high quality I expected from Sperry . They seem to be built on European lasts ( narrow in front and wide in back ) . This shape does not fit my feet well . Not sure how they will hold up .
4 #### Arrived on time . I probably should have gone with a 7.5 instead of an 8 because they do seem a little big , but if I wear thick socks they are fine . Also , they can sometimes make a very annoying squeaky noise when I run on certain surfaces so I 'm trying to get them worn in . Over - all , I am satisfied with my purchase !
4 #### The racer tent bed fun alternative for a toddler bed . As the title mentioned Racer tent bed ; I thought it would come with a blow up mattress . The tent has great color and graffics with ventilation mesh . I bought this as an alternative to a raised toddler bed for my 21 month who moves around in his sleep and considering his impact on hardwood floors . My sons face lit up when he saw it and immediately climbed in before I could place his toddler mattress in it . I 'd say its a hit . Quick and easy to assemble . Pros : See above statement . Quick and easy to assemble . The colors are vivid . It 's has proven to be durable with a rough 21 month old and survived movers placing a box on it , it popped right up again . Cons : It would be nice for it to have come with mattress .
5 #### Easy install , works great . Remove old unit , measure that to get correct model .
5 #### Got these for my little brother in law for his birthday , he loves them , they last , and yes they are real converse
5 #### Love the lycra caps , they go on without pulling your hair and fit well . Keeps my hair out of my eyes .
5 #### Sent this to Puerto Rico to a friend for recovery efforts .
5 #### Purchased for my daughter for gym class . She loves them . Very cute and very comfortable .
5 #### Daughter loves it . She says she loves it , despite not actually wearing it for the most part . Really hard to read the " past " and " to " text on the watch face .
1 #### Poor quality . 12"run in back as soon as they were pulled on carefully .
5 #### Comfortable shoes that are easy to slip in and out of and look great ( if you buy the brown or taupe ) with jeans or chinos . I will say that they run half a size large for me . Maybe it 's the width ? I ordered a size 11.5 online ( as I usually wear 11 - 12 depending on brand ) and felt that an 11 would have been a better fit ; however , I 'm not dealing with any heel slippage or issues while walking in them so will keep .
4 #### It jumped around a lot to the point I had to reread or go back to make sure I had n't skipped something .
4 #### I would have given it 5 starts but I have a thin wrist and the band does not start curving soon enough . I like the look and the smaller face . I 'm not into the giant watch style . It is very thin and light .
5 #### Purchased securely fasten my kayak on my existing luggage rack and it has just the right length . Makes it quick and easy to put the kayak on the car and take it off . And while the car is in motion , it stays tight and does n't make any whistling noises in the wind .
5 #### Broncos fans would love this .. actually had to order another for a neighbor who saw it and my floor mats and wanted the same .
5 #### I give five stars because it 's the great quality of dickies . The waist runs small on these . I normally wear a 38 but had to get a 42 in these .
5 #### Hey listen I do n't know what people r using to cook with this stuff but I 'm using my damn titanium cups and all to cook .. I 'll give this more than 5 stars this stuff cooks chicken noodle soup , water , spaghettios ok u get the point I love camping and this stuff will last about 5 mins and will actually make ur food way to hot like I forgot to stir my spaghettios and some of it at the bottom of titanium cup was burnt man this stuff is so effective and really priced good and I love the small fold up stove it comes with or I bought that u see in photo it 's awesome lol anyways thanks for reading and I love blowing my hard earned money on camping stuff and my good old fixed blade knives so good luck on cooking Ps lighting it is easy and a quick way of making cheap non water proof matches water proof is by putting nail polish on them they still light and all look up primitive technology and mr hacker on YouTube peace
4 #### they run large , so buy a half size smaller . I am a true 7.5 in women shoe . I will exchange for a 7 .
5 #### this item is everything you would expect . great gift for a jets fan and a good compliment to a game room .
4 #### These fit as expected , because I expected them to fit small . I always size up by 2 sizes in tights since that makes them last longer . This is the brand I always get since they 're nice and sheer .
3 #### one particular shipper just put these into a plastic mailbag . No clue how they got here without bending . I 'll know after wearing them a while if they are a little bent . we all know how an underwire feels when its slightly pokes into your ribs
3 #### These run very big . I usually wear a men 's 11 , and I ended up in a 9 1/2 .
4 #### Bought the shoe for a friend and he loved it . Exactly as expected . The white is very white . True to size
4 #### Pretty impressive , for the price . That 's the key here - for the price . There is some chromatic aberration especially noticeable at higher magnification that is to be expected at this price point . Eye relief could be a little better as well - but , again - the price is right .
5 #### I only wear Merrell slip ons because they are comfortable . These shoes were no different . They fit well and are comfortable i will buy then again !
5 #### Holy Moly , as soon as I stepped on it my back felt a " letting go of tension " is all I can say . I thought I 'd use it for small bursts at my standing desk , but I do n't think I ever want to get off of this . I have an anti - fatigue mat which I 've been using and thought was doing its job quite well -- was feeling better standing for 7.5 hours a day than sitting , and I 'm 55 years old and had 3 knee surgeries about 24 years ago , so I thought the anti - fatigue mat was just fine -- but I wanted to alternate between that and other mats and/or foot massage balls -- in order to use different muscles so I can feel even better after standing a whole work day . ThisAirex Balance Pad is more comfortable than the anti fatigue mat though , do n't know if I 'll be going back to that :)
5 #### the sign was bigger than i thought it would be great quality
5 #### Love them and so does the little one who is wearing them !
4 #### The pants fit great , but they run a a couple inches long .... the 32 " length seem closer to 34" ... maybe more ? ? Not really an issue when I put on my boots .... These pants are certainly stiff .... i hope they get a tad softer after a few wearings .
4 #### Work well , not the same lure as the original wood 1 's , but good enuff
5 #### The fit is great , they look nice , and they last a while . I tried changing styles , but always come back to these , I ca nt go wrong . I wear them out almost every day and they last me pretty well before I need to replace them for a new pair .
5 #### Worked perfectly for polishing my silver and sterling silver jewelry ! I had many tarnished pieces that looked brand new after I cleaned them with these cloths .
5 #### In todays environment , your Thule bike rack will be stolen if you do n't have this simple very well made steel lock assembly . With this lock , you can mount your rack on your automobile , lock it fast to your trailer hitch , and just forget it - period . Otherwise , you risk losing the rack , the attached bicycles , and the embarrassment of explaining to a cop - provided of course one shows up - why you left the whole shootinmatch unlocked or unsecured . This is an incredible cheap , incredibly secure bike rack locking assembly .
2 #### not a Women 's watch at all . Very , very small . Too small for even our 9 year old granddaughter . When it did n't fit my wife , we thought we might just hand it off , but alas , even too small for her , and she is tiny !
1 #### I m so dissapointed cause i believe that was the original but not you are selling a fake product .
5 #### WOW ! ! ! When I first saw this I was looking for several different tools , not an all in one . This Compass fulfilled all my requirements and I did n't even realize that it would when I bought it . I work on Satellite communications systems and aligning antennae is part of my daily taskings . This compass has a movable bezil ring which makes finding a bearing incredibly simple . It works well in the northern hemisphere . I have not had the opertunity to use it in the southern as of yet . The Clinometer makes it quite simple to get elevation angles nearly perfect . I have also done some hiking with it and I have not become lost as of yet . The literature that comes with the compass is easy to understand .
3 #### I always buy the same size this ones came to large
5 #### Miracle cure for chronic elbow tendonitis . Started with this green one and worked up to blue . Google " elbow tendonitis cure that works " .
5 #### I L - O - V - E ( LOVE ) these briefs . I sometimes have a hard time finding them in department stores so was very glad to be able to buy them on the Internet . They are comfortable . They allow a little forgiveness when you gain a bit here and there without stretching out if you lose a bit ( I wish more often ) . They also wash and wear very easily and simply . I can even throw them in the dryer . What 's not to love ? :)
5 #### I 've been wearing Sperry boat shoes for many years now and have never been disappointed . This is my newest pair and I 'm very happy with them .
5 #### Exactly what I wanted . The changing lights make playing at night super awesome and enjoyable . People may become curious and wonder what is flying in the air but just be careful where you play with it . This way you know if there are any holes , trees or anything that could get you hurt while playing .
4 #### I wanted something my phone and maybe 2 other items would fit . This is just perfect and does not jiggle . My Galaxy S6 is a tight squeeze but still just perfect for my needs . I tried a couple other small stretchy packs but this was just enough bigger that it fit more than one item .
5 #### This pair fits perfect ..... the first pair was wrong size in the right box ..... definitely order again ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Great quality ... fits slightly big ... but that s better than too small .
4 #### Would have got 5 stars if it had a flat part on top of the helmet where I could mount my Gopro .
3 #### Get the ones with removable bands . You ai nt gon na use this one for long .
3 #### The watchbands are a lot stiffer than they used to be , so not as comfortable , but otherwise good quality watch ... been buying them for years .
5 #### These gadgets are great motivational devices and deserve most of the credit for my taking several long walks each week . I started with the fairly pricey Digi - Walker but soon broke the non - spring clip and ended up ordering two more at premium prices . Then I discovered Omrons and Boston Scientifics , but they struck me as overly touchy , not particularly accurate , and overloaded with bells and whistles . The goal is to reach 10,000 steps -- not to time yourself , count your calories , take your pulse , and keep monthly medical records . The more complicated you make the device , the less likely you are to use it . Observing that I was using and breaking pedometers , my family started giving me deluxe models from Sharper Image and Brookstone for Christmas and birthdays -- some had built - in radios and others played canned , silly melodies to match my stride . After a single walk , I was usually tired of them . Even though most of the aforementioned pedometers were 3 - 4 times more expensive than this Sportline Step Counter , they soon went into a desk drawer and became mere collectors ' items . The Sportline , on the other hand , has seen a lot of use . It has a strong spring clip and is quite durable and accurate . It may not be very smart , but it can count .
4 #### It 's OK . The very slender rod lends itself to .17 cal . and .22 cal . bores . Kit quality is OK and it has adapters for ordinary size brass brushes . Beware of the little black plastic tip for patches . It is not slender , but full size and too big to be of used with a patch in a .17 cal . or .22 cal . barrel . I tried , and it snapped off immediately . It was a nuisance to drill the broken - off stub from the socket of the cleaning rod . Use a jag for patches and avoid this . Would I buy it again ? Maybe . The slender rod is a nice feature , otherwise , it is nothing special .
5 #### Wow ! Love this too . It 's so versatile and flattering with a post baby belly . I 'm 5'11 " and it 's plenty long on me . The draping flows nicely and the bow in front or back is really cute . This is my favorite nursing shirt so far . I only wish it came in more colors .
5 #### These American branded work pants from Carhartt are absolutely dead reliable . You can count on them to go the distance- to stretch your word - a - day buck as far as possible . These are as well made and heavy duty as anything out there today . I 've had my pair for almost two years- they are only slightly less stiff than they were when new ! These are serious britches for anyone who takes their work seriously , for anyone who wants to show up looking like a pro . These pants are made of CANVAS- thick , heavy canvas . The front of the legs has TWO LAYERS of it , to down below the knees . They are tough as nails , offer great protection , and look good , too . About the only thing I could possibly say by way of negative commentary is these are made in Mexico- which IMO beats * other * places by a MILE . Carhartt work wear is made all over the place , so you really have to look at what you 're buying . YES , I wish everything was USA made- but these are n't . Still- I give these 5 stars . I LOVE em . I 'll buy Carhartt 's Double Front Work Dungaree Pants again & again . I highly recommend them to all .
5 #### I am 72 years old . This tool helps me tone my core and has made a big difference in my balance .
5 #### I am a female football official for my first year and was scared of an I.W. so I got this to see if I would use it . Though I never really used it , it 's a nice tool in case I decide to try it in the future .
5 #### This basically cured my tennis elbow . It is such a simple concept but it actually worked . I was blown away . I was basically in enough pain to justify getting cortisone shots in my elbows . While that did relieve the pain , it was back in about 5 months . I purchased the flex bar on the recommendation of a friend . It takes a little bit to get used to how to use it but once I had it dialed in , I did the exercise every morning for about 5 minutes . After about 10 days , all my pain was gone and it is still that way .
5 #### I love these briefs because they are lighter than a feather and they do n't show through slacks / shorts , etc . However , next time I will size down from my normal 8 to a 6 .
5 #### I am happy with my purchase . Love the red color and I have space for everything I need to carry .
3 #### Will do the job , and are small . Perfect size to fit in a waterproof match case . However , do not work as well or burn as long as cotton balls soaked in melted petroleum jelly . Worth having ...
3 #### No pockets and huge , the bottom of the pants go over shoes
3 #### These seemed narrow for my husband . After a week , they fit more normally . We use to get custom chucks for him all the time , but it feels like the price is soaring on them and quality is definitely going down . Probably the last chucks I will ever buy him .
4 #### Quality is good . Fit very comfortable . Works well as both undershirt for winter under dress shirt and separate t - shirts . After washing , Very happy with purchase .
5 #### Excellent quality ! Nice choice of colors ! Received item in mail in very short time . Ended up buying 3 total . Love them !
4 #### The jeans are fine , the packaging for shipment was fine . Amazon did publish the retail price in this instance so that I knew what sort of discount I was getting . I have seen a trend with Amazon though where the item , even new , has the retail price deleted so that if their partner vendors are charging a premium , one does n't immediately know it . I 've curtailed buying from Amazon until I 'm convinced they wo n't be doing this any more . They 're only response to the issue was to tell me to return the item to the vendor which is a cost to me - time and money - might as well go to a brick and mortar store if I 'm going to go through that inconvenience .
3 #### These shorts seem to run small and short for " Bermuda " shorts . They seem made well and would be nice if they were a little larger . I have another pair of Danskin shorts in the same size which run much bigger and longer .
5 #### These work great for camping . It is a hit or miss on whether they heat up well when carried around . I found they need a material that is made to retain heat to really warm up . When put in my jeans pocket the heat is minimal but when put in a winter coat pocket , or in gloves , the heat is good . The best use , and why I will continue to buy these , is camping . If you throw 2 - 3 of these in a sleeping back 20 minutes before you go to bed they will turn steamy hot ! This is wondering when it gets down to 30 degrees but you want to stay out and finish your beer , subsequently chilling yourself to the bone ;-) The kids always ask for the hot hands to be put in their sleeping bag before they head to bed .
4 #### Good , basic ' Expedition ' model watch . Water - proof and features " indiglo " lighting , which is a nice bonus . Watch fits well and runs fine , as expected . No concerns with performance , and was just as described in the advertisement .
5 #### I ca n't believe how cheaply priced these headphones are ! Talk about soft and comfortable , and they 're very well built . I bought this pair for my mother , and after trying it on , I feel like an idiot for previously spending $ 20 more for a different brand which I thought would be a " better " set . Do n't waste your money on those expensive models . NO need to !
5 #### This is the watch I wanted . Nice looking . Stainless Steel bracelet . And most of all , the night light . This is really appreciated by me .
1 #### I have purchased different brands and sizes of Knee Highs . My legs are pretty wide at 200 pounds ; but these knee highs are supposed to fit someone much bigger and heavy than I. NOT TRUE . I had to return them and have given up trying to find a pair of stockings / knee highs that I can wear without being tortured . I am very short ( 5 ' ) so it 's impossible to find regular stockings that wo n't choke my waist , and the same goes for the knee highs . I have tried " Q " sizes to no avail , the elastic at the top is always terribly uncomfortable . If you read this and have any ideas , please contact me ? Thanks !
4 #### This is my third pair of Merrill Mocs through the years . Comfortable , warm , sturdy walking shoe but with a flexible sole for distance walking . The construction of this shoe has changed with each pair . This pair are the best of the bunch as far as the elastic goring and comfort . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars is because the treads do n't seem to be as deep as previous versions and therefore a little more slippery than pairs gone by . Best dog walking , errand running winter shoe !
5 #### Excellent taste ! My favorite flavor and easy to pack and carry .
1 #### Very poor quality . Had a pair that I bought from rural king that did n't last but maybe 3 months . The back of the boot tore away from the sole . Called the company and they did n't do anything about it . Very day because Justin 's were my favorite Bertrand until this happened . Sorry but that 's what happens when we ship out jobs to Mexico . I 'm done with Justin 's now
3 #### It 's your standard plastic sled , thick enough to be durable , thin enough to not be too heavy , good shape . Let 's face it - this is n't rocket science . I needed a plastic tub , and the 26 inch width of this sled would work well enough for me ( 26 across the inside would be perfect ) . Well - it is n't 26 inches wide . If you pull on the sides you can stretch it out to 24 inches ( about 22 inside ) - but that 's it . Come on people - either put actual dimensions or do n't list them . So yes it 's a sled , and I guess a decent sled - but I ca n't use it because it 's not wide enough to fill the space I wanted . Oh - mine does have a seat ( just kidding ) .
4 #### Had a small smudge on them when I received them , but I rubbed it out .
5 #### I use these for my Cardio Dance class and they are perfect and very cute . I would definitely recommend . They also cam earlier than expected ! !
5 #### I wanted an easy - to - read poster to give me ideas of pilate moves withough having to watch a video or have papers printed out . This is perfect ! The pictures are crystal clear . The moves it shows are excellent for intermediate pilates . The quality of the poster surprised me because it 's GOOD quality . I have purchased wall charts in the past from other companies , and the material is usually too thin ( cheap ) or too thick ( laminated ) . This is a strong , quality material . I will definitely be purchasing the beginner and advanced charts soon to complete my collection . The only thing I wish is that the seller could possibly make smaller versions of this , as well . How awesome would that be ? !
5 #### I got these shhoes for my father who loves going hiking and he really loves them , he now wears them everyday for the morning walk .
5 #### Everything I have come to expect from the Justin Brand and then some . Fit perfectly , arrived quickly , and no " break " in time . The pictures do n't do them justice . Highly Recommended ! !
4 #### they are very comfortable although somewhat a big size . They look super nice with shorts . Next time i will consider getting them in 8
5 #### Absolutely adorable ! I purchased for my 6 year old granddaughter entry into 1st grade . She is a quick learner . She LOVED it , and , has already learned how to tell time the first day !
5 #### These are awesome ! Our kids love playing frisbee so I decided to give these a try . They are SO much better than a frisbee its not even close . They are easy to catch , super easy to throw and they sail forever . You can get these to fly straight every time you throw them even when playing on a windy day , which we did at the beach .
5 #### These are the best for Breast Cancer Awareness month ! However , the size was just a little large . I just wear thicker socks and everything works out just fine . Love them .
5 #### The comfort of these has improved , even if they 're not the new II editions
5 #### these shoes look good and are very durable . My son loves to wear them .
5 #### I 'm currently going through therapy recovering from a broken wrist . This resistance bar is one of the tools used at my therapist 's office . I find it very useful to have the same tool to use at home . I 'm sure this will speed my recovery time !
5 #### Perfect for a beginners bow . Great product . Made well and has lasted quite awhile . You will definitely be impressed by the quality .
5 #### I love this mat . It is long enough for me ! It was a little slick at first but after breaking it in is much more sticky . A small price to pay considering I have tried many mats and none have come close to this one for me .
1 #### Looked extremely fake , i pushed down on the shoe where it was glued together and the glue was about to come off . I do n't mind spending $ 50 on a shoe that will last but this looked like it was falling apart as soon as i took it out of the box
5 #### The compass I received from this listing has the international scale printed on it ( 1:25000 , 1:50000 , etc . ) , rather than the standard USGS scale ( 1:24000 , etc ) . Not a problem for me since I can do math , but maybe an issue if you were n't ready for it .
5 #### I finally replaced my husband 's black converse which were identical to these new ones . He had worn & loved the old ones so much that they were brown instead of black & wrapped in places in duct tape . The man loves his cons ! ! ! Hopefully I wo n't let these ones get to the same point before replacing them .
4 #### Good mat and I 'm happy with it overall . I guess I 'll need to try the sea salt trick because it is not sticky enough .
3 #### I love the watch band on this watch . It is elastic and fits a child 's wrist really well , but the watch itself would n't keep time . We replaced the batter ( of course ) and it still lost about 30 minutes each day . Eventually my daughter stopped wearing it because it was n't worth having it .
5 #### I have yet to hit the bullseye perfectly , but at least I can see clearly where the target was hit . Great for use especially at distances . The extra black patches come in handy and eliminate the need to start over with a new target for different distances .
4 #### colors are brilliant flag a little smaller than I expected it is also one sided but overall I 'm glad I bought it . Very cute
5 #### I love glow in the dark things for the kids . This Frisbee is of good quality and a good size , unlike another Frisbee I bought last year on amazon . That one was really small .
5 #### Great t shirt for 15 bucks . I usually wear xxl in t shirts but xl fits great in these and shirt has good length . Nice beefy fabric . Probably a touch too warm for summer days outdoors here in the south but great weight for spring and fall .
5 #### Shoes fit perfectly and great arch support . Over time the leather will break in and fit even better .
5 #### Very comfortable boat shoe . I wear them all the time , not just when sailing .
5 #### Love it . Take a little bit of practice to get it down , but it will come back to you . I like the fact that its a pretty good workout disguised and fun . Play boomerang for half an hour and you will get a workout . I 'm always looking for things to do in park near my house . I really look for things that promote physical activity without just being a workout . I bought the boomerang a summer after I bought the Aerobie flying ring . Both would be purchased again if lost or worn out . Great fun !
5 #### Provided the solution I needed while wearing contacts to dive . I can see my dive computer screen easily now . When my prescription changes , these may not even need to change , but if so , much cheaper than new mask inserts .
5 #### I love the fact that these are Made in Germany . Germany means quality . I have n't used them . I just keep buying them a box at a time everytime I order something from Amazon . I 'm stockpiling them in case of the Zombie Apocalypse , or , for when Trump trolls Putin via Twitter and we all get nuked .
5 #### Have n't had the need to use it yet , hopefully I wo n't anytime soon , but this WILL get a fire going in relatively short order . It is basically cotton wrapped tight with some fraying on either end so you can get fire to it . It will work for when SHTF arrives . There are other things that can be used as tinder , but for quick light this will work rather well .
5 #### I love this mat . It is sturdy and thick enough to use on my solid stone floors . It is a little heavy for getting to class , but worth the effort . I think thinking of doing the " salt scrub " on it to help get the coating of , since I feel like it is a little slick .
2 #### My daughter had her previous Razor scooter for about 5 years , and it worked great the entire time . When it became apparent that it was finally too small , we bought her this new one . It was purchased in September of last year and ridden occasionally . Last week , she was riding it at the park , and pieces began coming off . The cotter pin , the bolt thing that goes through it , the spring ... We had to go on a major hunt to locate all the missing pieces . Fortunately my husband was able to repair it - however , for the retail cost of these scooters , I find it inexcusable that they can fall apart so easily !
5 #### As good as a victorinox can be ! I love the wood handle
5 #### Love this bag . Has great pockets and compartments . Not too large & wear it when I 'm walking .
5 #### Colors is amazing same as he 's uniform . He did play pretty good went he wear it .. He 's so happy with it
4 #### Must size down if you want it to be true to size they run big ! ! ! My little one wears a size 11 1/2 - 12 so I first order a 12 and they was extremely big I ended up getting an 11 1/2 so she can still have room to grow and its like its still a whole size bigger . Hope this helps
4 #### Pros : water and wind resistant , warm , good zipper , tough material Cons : stiff as a board Carhartt should really figure something out to make this jacket softer . I understand that they market to a blue collar crowd but there 's no reason why this jacket is able to stand up like there s an invisible man in it . The hood is pretty much useless with it being so stiff and the coat is uncomfortable sitting and driving with it on . All those problems can be fixed by a break in period , but why should I have to do that ?
4 #### Great mats hold up very well . They take a big long to inflate and do n't have any kind of pump . They are cheap though and so I really do enjoy them for the price . They have helped keep us warm and comfortable while camping . I would recommend one with a pump built in , but they can be pricey and these ones are durable enough and do the trick !
4 #### These are fabulous shoes , as expected . I 've had at least one pair of jungle mocs in rotation for at least the last 10 years , and I 'm very pleased with these , except for how much they squeak ! ! ! I narrowed the sound down to something going on with the insoles and used some anti - chafing gel on the bottoms of the insole , which luckily got rid of the squeaking . I do n't think that should be necessary with new shoes ... but otherwise I 'm very happy with them ( as I 've always been with my other jungle mocs ) .
5 #### Fits as expected . Very comfortable . Roll up sleeves adds to shirt 's versatility .
5 #### The navy and black fit so much better and the fabric is stretchy . The other colors purchased in the same size are a bit tight .
4 #### Not a fan of button fly , but they are comfortable and sturdy . Worth the purchase .
5 #### I bought two of these for my twin granddaughters . Went together easily . Well built and they 're very happy with them . I 'd recommend them .
5 #### My son plans to use this to begin " middle school " ( no more cute backpacks w his NAME SEWN IN along with a " dog " or a " whale"!!!:- ) Bwahahaha ! ! ! But this pack is perfect - very high quality- great workmanship & big & sturdy ! ! So many hidden pockets ( hopefully not to lose things ! ) ! ! ! The material is honestly like no other pack i ve seen ! ! ! Its just THAT NICE ! I sure hope it helps him " fit in " a bit better because i now how RUTHLESS middle - school kids can be- YIKES . BOTTOM LINE : GREAT BACKPACK & WORTH EVERY PENNY ! :-) THANK U ! !
1 #### The handle is to small the sheath broke the first time I pulled it out and the blade will not hold an edge I sent it back with in hours
5 #### My mom has a large collection but you can never have too many Chucks , got this and a sweater in the same color for her for Christmas :) They fit great and arrived ahead of schedule !
5 #### Ultra pure greaseno other chemicals to break down rubber gaskets / o - rings over the long term . Very clear and makes for a smooth application . Plus it has a high quality container that seals good and products the product . Highly recommend this product .
4 #### They 're good shoes I just got the wrong size and i would like to change them to a size 7 please if its possible
5 #### It 's a great shoe . Very comfortable . I like the looks and the support . For my feet I typically wear a size 9 but these shoes are slightly loose only at the heel region . Will not return as my feet fit well anteriorly .
3 #### THIS WATCH TICKS REALLY FREAKIN ' LOUD . As in , can be heard over other ambient noises in a household setting . My daughter complained it was keeping her awake at night , which I scoffed at , as she has either a portable fan - type heater or humidifier going in her bedroom every night . But removing it to MY bedroom was a mistake , I had to get up at 2 am to get it out of my room too . She is n't autistic or anything but she wo n't even wear it to school on days when she has to take tests because it distracts her too much . Plus the battery that came from the factory lasted less than 6 months , which is pretty bad even for a cheap watch , IMO .
4 #### I really lov the design of this watch , but this is my second try and the band is still large . I am keeping this one , because of the light up feature and design , but I do wish they had a smaller band ...
5 #### Great for just hanging out in the summer . Great length and fit .
4 #### My daughter likes this scooter , it works as expected and should last for a while . I am pleased with this purchase .
4 #### I bought this for cold weather running and it works great ! It tucks into my shirt well and does n't move while I 'm running . It is easy to slip on and off .
5 #### This thing fixed my tennis elbow . OK , it took roughly 9 months to fix . But , it you do it regularly , it 's a great exercise for forearm muscles and relieving elbow pain . Oh , go see a physio first .
4 #### A tiny bit narrow but I knew that . Very classic tennis shoe .
5 #### Fits my son 's face well . Keeps the water out while swimming . Good quality .
3 #### Perfect color but they ripped as soon as I put them on . I 'm a 3x normally and I bought a 7x and they barely fit . Were not comfortable at all !
5 #### Exactly as described . Priced affordable and excellent quality . Shipping was fast despite the inclement weather .
5 #### These bolt right on . I bought two packs because I needed 3 wheels for the Ezyroller and now I have one spare wheel . I am sure I will need it eventually .
4 #### I love these and they are great as " cheaters " for your mask . I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because they do n't stick on as well as I had hoped -- they tend to come loose when rinsing your mask even if you set the lenses in place 24 hours ahead as advised . You just have to be a little more careful but it 's no big deal . I would highly recommend these and am very satisfied with them overall .
5 #### I LOVE MY PACKS ! Both are in great condition and are just what I need for my Bug Out Bags !
1 #### This shirt is very uncomfortable in temperatures above 75 degrees F and average humidity . I do n't know whether it is the type of cotton or the cotton finish , or small amounts of synthetic material in it , but this shirt does not work for me .
5 #### I do n't know why there would be any negative comments about this costume . It was very affordable , a HUGE hit with my 4 year old and has already been 3 worn on more than one occasion . Seriously , how can you go wrong helping your child to pretend they are one of their heros for such an affordable price Thanks ! ! ! !
4 #### Converse are a staple at our house , worn by all . These high tops are consistent in size with other brands of shoes . They are not the most durable shoe . In our experience , the soles may lose their tread or the canvas may split away from the bottom rubber before the rest of the shoe wears down . The plus is that these shoes are easily washable and very versatile when pairing with clothing .
5 #### I Love my shoes , but apparently so did my teenage daughter because she took them after the first day . She loves them and wears them all the time . I found them in other colors before but she really likes the original colors as these because they go with everything .
5 #### Kickstand was a cinch to install , did it in a couple of minutes . It is well made , adjustable . Only complaint is that it 's a bit hard for my five year old to put up and down on his own , but he 's managing ok .
5 #### These are incredible socks . I love them for hiking , but also started to wearing them around town during the winter . They 're super comfortable and keep you warm .
3 #### I love these watches . This is my second one . But the clasp broke on this one and I had to fix it my self . Maybe just bad luck . For me
5 #### Well , I love them ... I've been through several pair in the last several years . This is the first pair my husband has had . He has chilblains in the winter and his toes blister etc . For years I have tried to get him to wear warmer shoes . One of the many benefits of these shoes ( to me ) is that they hold your body heat in , and after a while your feet warm up . So I finally insisted that he try these . So far , so good . I ordered a size 11.5 ; they are a little too long but not enough to trade them for a smaller size ; maybe next pair we 'll order an 11 .
5 #### I needed a watch that was not ultra sensitive , and yet attractive and reasonably priced . This met all my criteria !
4 #### Good for a cheap pair of binoculars . I use them deer hunting .
5 #### Perfect 5 panel hat . The skateboarding companies are putting out cheaper quality hats than this for way higher prices . If you do n't give a fart about logos and just want a perfect five panel with a leather strap then this is your hat .
4 #### I like this stove but my cousin has another model that is a bit better ... they look almost exactly the same so i accidentally ordered this one .
5 #### Great bag , use it all the time for various activities . Very spacious design , can fit a good bit of stuff in it . Very sturdy material , have not tried it through thick bush , so ca n't tell you how it holds up , but looks like it will . External pockets are great . Love the drawstring design , lets you really stuff it full . Quality made . Did n't see any poor stitching or defects . Comfortable to wear around if you load it correctly . Not really big enough for a 2 + day hike , but if you 're on a day or day +1 night trip , should be adequate . Keep in mind , not water proof in the slightest . My only complaint is the buckles and what not are made of plastic , not metal . They 're definitely not cheap feeling , but I would have preferred metal . That 's really my only complaint , but I 'm not hung up on it at all .
5 #### My Sandler of choice ! Had surgery on my feet need to keep toes covered .
5 #### love my watch . Just the right size nd the band tits . My wrists are small
5 #### Excellent product ! We just got a family pool and I chose not to enroll my kids in swim classes this summer . I purchased two of these swim bars and after a week or so my five year old daughter is able to swim ( doggie paddle , swim under water , and swim from one side of the pool to the other ) with such confidence and tenacity . She no longer wears a floatie in the water . My husband and I are always in the water with them and I can relax a bit now with her . My son is four and I plan on working with him next . I highly recommend this product !
5 #### I have used this product since it 's inception and as far as I 'm concerned this is the best monofilament fishing line on the market .
5 #### In the hot , humid summer weather of Atlanta this grip is my favorite for my tennis racket as I tend to sweat a lot . I almost did n't buy this grip due to several reviews that mentioned how " tacky " it was because I had recently tried the Tourna Mega Tac grip and it was way too tacky for me . This Yonex Super Grap grip only seems only slightly tacky to me , which I prefer . Easy to put on and take off . I 'm playing a few times a week and I find myself changing the grip every 2 - 3 weeks , and I have absolutely no problem with that . Very glad I tried the Super Grap and will buy again . BTW , I recommend a good racquetball glove for heavy sweaters like myself - it 's been a huge help .
4 #### Only problem is that I would prefer darker hands , for older eyes . Also how many years is it good for ? Thank you very much for the Timex product .
5 #### For 10 yr old , loves it . super easy for throwing straight . It 's held up really well for several months . Brings it to school often , too .
5 #### Great vest . I use it for photo shooting and at my gun club for shooting . Lotsa places to put things . And very well made .
2 #### Lasted about an hour of normal play . While it was alive , kids had a ball , er . disk , with it . If only it was made out of one of those high - tech materials from NASA that they use to survive re - entry . Now , that would be a good toy .
4 #### This is my first pair of binoculars , so take this review with that precaution in mine . That being said , I purchased these to use while hunting . I have yet to test them in anything but good conditions , and I will update my review accordingly if need be . The item is bigger than expected , and heavier too . It is comfortable to look through and has a very nice focus adjustment positioned perfectly for on the fly focusing without changing hand position . The binoculars came with a nice strap to carry around the next and a decent case with covers for both ends of the lens . I would have given a 5 star review if the unit was a little smaller and lighter , but overall I ca n't complain . I tested up to about 350 ft with incredible clarity .
5 #### Just what we were looking for , will keep hair out of my daughter 's face but not hurt her head !
5 #### White room = white balls not so good for fast paced play . These bounce really well and were a good price .
3 #### Make sure you tighten the bolt that adjusts the stand regularly as it can shake lose over time , and then you have to hunt for a replacement .
5 #### These are a great safety mechanism for any gun . I use them all the time on my two rifles and shotgun and they are easy to get on and off and the gun can still be stored in the original case .
4 #### These definitely fit on the smaller side . Nice charcoal color , nice pocket . Crotch stitching came a bit undone within a few uses but did n't ruin the integrity of the breeches .
5 #### Just like the one he has .... but I see it is still sitting on the counter .... waiting for the other to completely fail .
5 #### These well made Carhartts keeps my farmer husband warm on cold blustery days while feeding and working the cows . This is the second pair we have purchased
5 #### This was for our son for Christmas . He lives in Colorado , so loves the warmth and durability of this jacket . We also got his a Carhartt Hoodie , Watch Cap and Gloves . He loves it all !
5 #### They wear well but always run a little big - order a size down . They also run on the narrow side .
5 #### Nice little cooler I use to store ice for beverages .
5 #### Purchased for use for keys . Does the job , Seems very sturdy . Would buy again .
5 #### These go far and tend to have a curve toward the end . The kids enjoyed them .
5 #### Quick delivery and perfect fit . :-) I 've always been wary of buying shoes online , but these were such a great price and seemed reliable from what I read on the other reviews . Thankfully , the shoes came in very quickly and fit beautifully . I did n't have to do any returns or exchanges . Would definitely recommend !
5 #### This is the first time I have worn these briefs .. I love them ! Soft , snug and stays put , no riding up . The briefs I wore before these were discontinued and I had to find a different brand . I 'm so glad I found these .
4 #### my grandson loves this tricycle . We sent to Italy and received when scheduled . It was his Christmas present , one he will carry with him all over Europe .
5 #### I have used these daily for six months . The handles may chip , but this is a good product at a great price .
5 #### Would n't want to garden in a Wisconsin summer without them ! ! !
5 #### I am a big fan of wigwam socks . I wear their work socks everyday . I just tried these for my hiking week where I hike for four days with my freshmen class . This week would always leave my feet with huge popping blisters and shredded socks . This year , after using a new pair of these socks for each of the four days , I only had one small non - popping blister that was much more tolerable , and my feet were much more comfortable ! I could definitely tell the difference !
4 #### So far just what I needed . Do n't know how long they will last as ordered large & sometimes get in way but worth to keep bugs off .
1 #### Piece of junk , Colemans pride in workmanship has went to the dogs ... very dissapointed ! Box had been opened & taped shut , discovered that lid latch had been bent beyond use , lid & one side had serious dents , had no automatic spark ignition , entire construction was very thin metal & regulator with feeder tube were missing . Got so pissed I throwed the thing in the junk ... do n't buy any more Coleman products unless you can inspect them before you make purchase .
5 #### My son used his amazon card to buy these for baseball games this summer . When we got them we were very impressed . My husband could n't believe our son got them so inexpensively . Now he wants a pair too
5 #### We have larger throw bags that we take white water rafting but got this one for our drift boat after an experience in BC reminded us you do n't have to be in white water to get into a pickle ! It 's a convenient no - hassle safety tool
4 #### You ca n't go wrong with a Timex - keeps great time . Great wearing for causal and dress down day at the job - weekends . Wish the leather strap was a little longer .
1 #### I will have to return this . this blanket is not washable . the grooves in between will catch all the sand and dust ,
1 #### Uncomfortable , too big , bulky , ill - fitting with inserts . I did n't care for this bra at all .
4 #### I wear size 6 , ordered medium . They fit great , soft and comfortable Only minor complaint is that pockets do gape a bit after several hours of wear .
5 #### Pants are great but a little longer . Get a size shorter .
5 #### This is a gorgeous clutch wallet . I got it for my Mother as hers was old and worn and the zipper broke on it . I have always gotten Buxton wallets in the past and find that the quality is awesome and they seem to last forever . Great product !
5 #### Great mat . Good quality . I got the 84 " and love the extra length .
5 #### 5'8 , 120 lbs , fit as expected . Perfect nude color for very white legs . A bit more pricey than I would 've liked but seem to be decent quality , will post updates after further use .
5 #### Just like most boonie hats . its awesome and well made . Size is correct , I will by other patterns soon . Desert Digital Looks Great
5 #### Came as expected on time and fit and finish is excellent . Great boots for the money . I would order again for sure .
5 #### Quality Product ... Just outfitted my husband business with this line and we are very happy so far .
5 #### We went with a superhero theme for our family this year and this costume was the one my son decided to go with . It looked a bit cheap so I was n't expecting much , but it actually looked really nice on him and it held up very well . The cape was a bit annoying to him and the velcro was rubbing on his neck so he did take some issue with that . He decided to have a wrestling match with his cousins after trick - or - treating and ended up with grass stains , I figured they would n't come out but again I was surprised when they did . All in All great costume and the size fit my 6 almost 7 year old perfectly , he normally wears a 7/8 .
5 #### Seems like a simple but durable and useful . Use it all the time for my tennis elbow exercise .
5 #### I have several of these knives and have found them very well suited for the myriad of tasks that I perform in the yard and for other uses . The handy carrying pouch holds the blades for the box cutter and you can quickly changed them when needed . The knife itself is fairly robust and will need sharpening before you use it . The blade locks firmly into place in both resting and opened positions . The unit is a handful and the side panels afford a good grip when the hands are slippery . A safety feature does not allow you to open the blade when the box cutter blade is deployed and also prevents you from activating the box cutter blade when the knife blade is extended . The pouch is well made and keeps everything in place while carried on the belt . This would be a good unit to keep in the Bug - Out - Bag ( BUG ) , tool box , or wherever you need a good utility tool available .
5 #### I guess the best review I can give the Merrill shoe is to say that this is my second pair ... first pair is about 10 years old .... love them , bought another same size / color .
5 #### My husband loved this gift ! I would recommend it to anybody .
3 #### was awesome until it broke after about a week . Kind of pissed . Did n't think it would be possible for the battery piece to just fall off . Its located in the center underneath . You just press the button to turn on / off . one day i just noticed the button cover and battery were gone . Also i have the same weighted frisbee as this one and the regular one flies a lot farther . is a very cool frisbee though when it worked . Very fun at night .
2 #### It fit really strangely- One leg fit fine and the other leg had a tight " ring " around it that I could n't get rid of . It ripped and had runs the first time I wore it ( within maybe an hour or two ) . I even made sure to cut and file my toe nails down and be extremely careful putting them on , and they still ran ! I would not recommend these and I wo n't be buying them again .
5 #### I have not installed these on my .243 barrel yet , but I expect them to work very well .
5 #### 100 % recommended . No scuffs , marks , or scratches in my binders , came brand new and securely safe .
5 #### I have neuropathy making it hard to close my left hand . I began using a pair of cheaper plastic grips . I soon was squeezing 200 reps and bought these to improve my grip . The are very tough to close and I warm up with the easier ones then proceed to these . My grip has dramatically improved and I no longer drop things . I am now able to completely close them at 60 years of age .
5 #### Took this on a cruise , went swimming with it . It protected my cigs and passport just fine . It floats while around my neck , not too big . With a 100 's cig pack , lighter , Visa card and passport it was maxed out , but all was dry though I was in the water for over an hour . Very pleased with the product !
5 #### My kid love this shoe and its color . It fits as expected and we recommend this shoe to everyone . We 'll buy it again !
1 #### This is not a good bra do n't purchase the sizes are so off .
5 #### Fits on my ATI FX Titan no problem . Just really like the feel of these if I do n't happen to have front strap checkering .
5 #### Keeps my Fitbit dry in the pool . Can wear it like a necklace AND clip it on so it does n't flop around .
5 #### Have been wearing these for many years . Always fit fine .
4 #### I love the look of the shoe ! i wear saucony all the time and my normal size 11 was too big .
5 #### I really like this knife and , unlike other reviewers , I have n't had any trouble with the sheath . I like the powder coating , and the blade is strong . This has replaced a heavier knife I used to keep in my get - home bag . The glass handle feels nice in the hand and it really takes a beating . The blade could have been a little sharper right out of the box , but I do n't mind putting my own edge on a new knife . It was still quite sharp , but it could have been a little sharper . Overall , I 'd say this is a knife I 'll have for a VERY long time .
4 #### I really love these shoes . It took me a while to do some research and make sure I get the correct size , and I 'm glad I did . Love the colour ! Looks very funky , and I can wear them on almost anything . Only two points of criticism : 1 . They do n't provide arch support , and my arch is pretty high . So I 'm using insoles from my " Woz ? " shoes in them , and they 're more comfy now . 2 . The base of the shoe is not very light , but overall it 's ok since the rest of the shoes are . Overall , love them , they make me so happy !
3 #### Was not what I was looking so I returned it . The two flaps were exactly the same - nothing wrong with it . I just did n't care for it and it was n't what I was looking for .
5 #### Granddaughter wore these immediately and was so happy with the color and the fit . No complaints . A+ transaction ! I am happy that I was able to get these quickly on Amazon for her September birthday !
5 #### My daughter LOVES these high tops and they are much cuter than I expected .
5 #### Awesome discs , anyone who does n't know how to throw can still play with these without any trouble !
5 #### the shoes are perfect ! they fit exactly how i wanted them to :)
5 #### Exactly what I 'd hoped and dreamed . Could n't remember my reg size and glad I guessed 13 " inseam instead of 15 " . I normally wash them a few times before wearing . Helps soften up and not feel like poster board
3 #### Very low cut heel so if you training and pushing sleds - I ran right out of shoes ! Although the traction on toe and heel are great
5 #### the best sneakers by far ! I had never owned a pair of Nike sneakers , and I went solely on the reviews by others ... And I absolutely loved them ! !
4 #### They were a tad large .After they are washed and dried they will be fine . The 3 T - shirts I ordered came as 3 different orders and I payed shipping on each one . I thought they would all come from Amazon in one order .I will be more careful next time .
5 #### I 've tried a lot of expensive pantyhose and these hose compare with the best of them . They look and feel fantastic and fit like a dream , feels like my legs are dipped in nylon ... very luxurious and sexy . These pantyhose say more than feminine , these pantyhose say female . ..
5 #### I have been wearing these ( same pair for years now ) nothing more to say
3 #### I really like these but , it took me a time wearing them to realize that the left shoe is somewhat malformed . I have a few pair of Chuck Taylor and these are my least favorite .. I just wish the material used with these was much thicker ... but these are still great shoes and I wear them every day . I hope I have helped .
5 #### Upgrade from the Green bar to this one when the Green is n't giving you that burn in the forearms . Using this to prevent tennis / golf elbow in both arms after using the red one to cure Tennis Elbow .
5 #### Great comfy IWB for the price , perfect fit for my 2 " S&W J Frame . While it does require 2 handed re - holstering due to the non - reinforced top , it does help in keeping it thinner for better concealment and comfort , and comfortable it is as I often forget I 'm even wearing it . I covers just enough of the hammer to keep it from digging into my side and/or snagging my shirt and the closed bottom design helps keep dirt and dust out of the barrel . Printing is extremely minimal with a fitted tee and it vanishes with an over - shirt or something a little more loose . I initially got this as a temporary holster so I could take my time shopping for a nice custom one , but I 've decided to stick with this based on the price and overall performance of it .
5 #### Finally a medium shirt that fits after washing . This is a heavy shirt , not really soft , but I love the fit . Impressive choice of colors .
5 #### After talking to my friend about wrestling gear , I realized this one would be a guard my son can use for a few years . I like that since I am a bit frugal when I can be , as long as I am not sacrificing quality .
5 #### We use this bag to store our jugs bulldog softballs . It works great ... lets the balls dry out , where as our old ball bag - the black garbage bag got a little funky from time to time . Well priced and own 2 of these , 1 orange and 1 purple .
5 #### My wife mows the lawn and she says these are great . I do n't know if they are adjustable because they fit without adjustment .
5 #### I find yoga mats to be terrible for doing abdominal exercises at home . There 's just not much support . After doing some searching , I came across this awesome mat by Everlast at a very affordable price . It is the perfect size , and since it is thicker , it offers a more cushioned support . I am incredibly glad I purchased this !
5 #### Strong elastomer , and the snaps are of a nice strong grade , too . Good item to use with divers and the value of this snubber is right on the button .
2 #### It 's a rope in a bag , that should be useful in an emergency . But what if it 's not where you put it because the nylon strap had rotted away and it had fallen overboard ? I used the attached nylon / velcro strap to attach to my stern rail , and when I was showing the safety features to our guests it was gone ! Not stolen but fallen off the stern rail because of deterioration in the sun . This was 60 days in the Virginia summer sun . Surely it should last more than two months ? The bag itself and the rope are fine , and I 'll sew a cord on it to make it work , but it might as easily wound up in the drink and had a 2 month lifetime .
5 #### Excellent set of bands . All of the connections are quality , and the individual components are sturdy . The bands are distinctly graduated in resistance , with even the " lightest " being a great staring point for my rotator cuff rehabilitation .
5 #### I was told that if I could fall in love with my mat , that I would always want to be on it . THIS is that mat . It is thick and feels great on my knees . ( I had to use a blanket with other mats . ) I 'm 5 foot 7 and decided to get the extra long . I 'm glad I did . It is heavier than other mats , but that does n't interfere with my toting it from class to class . ( My purse is worse ! ) As far as the " breaking in " process goes , it was n't THAT big of a deal . I followed a YouTube instructional video of a salt bath , and then put it out in the sun . Those , plus daily use have broken it in quite nicely .
5 #### This sling is quality manufactured in the U.S.A. and represents a very innovative design that 's been around for a few years ... but only recently discovered by myself . Installation of the sling is relatively easy . Making adjustments in length with Outdoor Connection 's Super Sling is a simple and quick process . The sling also arrived with Talon 's superb metal swivels already attached ... so what 's not to like about this !
5 #### My granddaughter loved this mask for a comic con eveny
3 #### Was a little flimsier than I was expecting but my nephew seemed to like it .
3 #### Meh , felt very comfortable but provided no support . Seem like a good option for walking around in the summer but not for aerobics or lateral movements
4 #### I wear a size 10.5 and I ordered the same size as what I wear . In hindsight I probably should have bought size 10 and it would 've been perfect .
4 #### I brought this Tee for me as a work shirt ... I do a lot of lifting and handle dirty machines sometimes ..... these are thicker than the womens tees durable and easy to wash ........ no bleeding colors ...... great for gardening , , a day at the ball park & very sturdy ... the longer cut ... no worries about showing the rear
4 #### These are stylish but rather uncomfortable for very wide feet so after a while the back of the shoe began to chaffe my heel . Still love them all the same I blame my discomfort on my feet size rather than the pair of shoes made from canvass .
2 #### They were just not the right shoes for the person .
5 #### Soy de Caracas - Venezuela y Recomiendo ampliamente a esta vendedor , Muy Buena Calidad , Putualidad en la entrega , Recomendable 100 % , Felicitaciones
5 #### I have purchased Hanes Absolutely Ultra Sheer Control pantyhose for many years and have always been satisfied with the fit and color choices .
5 #### Fits good and does n't ride up and show plumber 's you know what !
4 #### The reason I highlight " handgun " is because they are too bulky for use with a rifle , kind of interfere with your attempts at a " cheek weld " . Otherwise , perfect product at a fair price , would buy again
5 #### I like the quality of the handles . The stretch is good . The only thing I would prefer if it were a little longer .
5 #### I brought this product for my son and myself as we are both doing martial arts . For my son I purchased to help him keep his legs straight when he stretches and to help him with his kicks . For me I wanted to improve my kicks and streching exercises . I have noticed a difference in using the device . It 's a little akward but it works . I also like the fact that it does n't take up a lot of room . You just have to make sure that you do n't use the device on a hardwood floor because the nut / screw that keeps the device together will scratch your floor . I use it on our basement floor which is carpeted so it 's not a big deal for us . Overall I think it 's worth the money .
5 #### I am very happy with this stove . We are having some work done in our kitchen so this is the only thing I have to cook on . The propane lasts a surprisingly long time . I have cooked at least seven dinners using both burners at once and I am still using the the first tank . No , it 's not like using a kitchen range , but it 's a good substitute when you have no other options . It is difficult to get the burners to stay low which can be annoying . But it does light without matches which is a real plus . You need to use this stove outside or you need a lot of ventilation . I have a temporary kitchen set up in my garage and always make sure I have a garage door partially open when the stove is going . This stove is great and I am very happy I bought it !
2 #### One of the pumps ( I bought two ) broke after the second balloon . I 'm really disappointed in this purchase . I did n't try both of them out before the return by date , just one , and it worked then , and now I 'm stuck with a pump that simply wo n't work . I recommend the electric balloon pump that I purchased just in time . It 's not really THAT much more expensive and it 's wonderful .
5 #### VEry nice product . Exactly as shown . Bought it for my wife and she loves it ... and that 's unusual ? Worth the price .
5 #### For my teenaged daughter who is super picky about what she wears ... she LOVES these Converse Hi - tops ! ! ! She 's worn them every day to school . Big hit ! ! !
5 #### My 3 year - old had a magician come to his preschool and since then , loves to play magician . I bought this for Christmas not too sure what I would get . It 's beautiful . It 's nicely sewn with soft black velour . The little rabbit is nice quality as well and the ' magic ' pouch he goes into is easy to access and I 'm sure my son will have no problem manipulating it . You are also able to adjust the size to fit your kids head . A great find and I ca n't wait to see his face Christmas morning ! You wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### Love this shirt for slightly cool summer evenings ! Fits great . Durable fabric as you would expect from Columbia
5 #### I 've been dealing with insane tennis elbow for over a month . The pain was getting progressively worse . My friend heard about treating tennis elbow with the flex band on an NPR radio interview and told me I should check this out . $ 11.00 and some change later , which has been a day and a half since I received it in the mail , and my pain is completely gone and now it 's so mild I do n't think I can consider it pain anymore . I 'm blown away . At first the exercises seemed a little awkward , but between the instructions that came with it , including the link to the video posted on the instructions , and with some practice I got it down . I 've done the exercises a total of 5 times now and I can swear by this product . It seriously works . I purchased the red one and I am 39 , 112 lbs , and I am a certified fitness instructor and I do a fitness bootcamp 5 days a week . The red one was suffcient to help cure my tennis elbow . I am very impressed . I had tennis elbow in both arms so I just did the exercise on both arms . If you 're dealing with this pain , buy this product now ! !
5 #### otterbox is a great product.this dry box closes firmly keeps items dry . I use it on the boat to keep my wallet and phone in during rough seas !
2 #### If you ur over 250lbs . , DO NOT BUY THESE ! ! ! They run small and are not accurate to the sizing chart . As far as style : they are silky smooth and pretty sturdy .
3 #### Some of these balls are perfect . Some have smudges , or the printing is not centered . I bought two for autograph . One came perfect , and the other one had a small red ink smudge on it and the printing was not centered perfect . So be careful , it seems to be a gamble if you will get a good ball or one that is slightly off . I will use the bad one to play catch with.(still a good ball though . you get what you pay for )
5 #### Item arrived when it was expected and was exactly what I Was looking fora a present . My Kids loved it .
5 #### Sleek , slim , elegant , and eye - catching without being flashy . A nice every day watch . He loves it . I love it , too .
4 #### Nice looking boat shoes but a little uncomfortable without socks .
1 #### Owned this scope for 2 seasons . Mounted on my RRA AR15 . I was initially please with this scope . Made in Korea , zoomed smoothly , versatile , stayed tight on the mounts and consistently accurate . After putting about 500rds through it I was amazed that the crosshairs fell apart . That 's right . The crosshairs literally fell apart . The lens were fine , scope was never dropped or abused . Looking through the lens the crosshairs simply scattered . Weird . I liked the scope I paid $ 79.99 retail , and it appeared to be top quality . It held up well . I guess too many rounds went through it . Pretty disastrous failure if your'e hunting for food . Maybe pay more and get something rated for more use .
5 #### sure helped my wife with her tennis elbow better than any meds she tried
4 #### Great for beach walking . Wish they did n't cut my feet in places , but I do put lots of miles on them .
5 #### I WAS VERY HAPPY TO SEE THAT BUXTON STILL MAKES THIS WALLET , IT HAS EVERYTHING I LOVE AND NEED IN A WALLET . I BOUGHT THE SAME ONE 30 YEARS AGO AND IT SPEAKS FOR ITSELF , IT WILL LAST A LONG TIME AND IT LOOKS GREAT . THANK YOU BUXTON , KEEP ON MAKING A GREAT PRODUCT ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I ALWAYS BUY THIS BRAND AT EVERY OCCASION .
5 #### Had not tried this style before , but was not disappointed . Ordered navy but seems more like a denim color . Seems to go with almost everything .
5 #### I have not had to use this in an emergancy but it worked great for towing a capsized kayak to shore . It dries and repacks easily .
5 #### Favorite Nike shoe ever ! The flex sole is excellent for someone like me who loves the free feeling of sandals or being barefoot . These move effortlessly with the bend of my foot . I 've worn these for multiple activities and I 've had no foot or ankle pain . The white / green / dark grey color goes with so many outfits and the mesh breathes perfectly on hot summer days . Highly recommend !
5 #### Delighted to find a half slip that fits me well . Used the size chart and ordered the 2XL . Fits perfectly at my waist . Pleasant surprise to discover elastic is n't exposed . It 's covered by the tricot , so no irritation . Was looking for something longer , with a loose flare to go under peasant skirts . Straight cut slips tend to twist and ride up over the bottom for me . This just floats over . Does exactly what I need . If you 're looking for something close to the body , this probably is n't your slip . Was going to order black , but not available in my size .
3 #### The left shoe is fine , the right shoe grips me on the right side middle where the tread rises a bit tight ! I have never had shoes fit in a mismatch manner .
5 #### Great Support , I have tried other brands but come Back to Bali Every time ... they wear well and support well .... only problem is they have used to have all metal strap adjusters and now have plastic strap adjusters .... I have only had 1 bra that developed a broken plastic ring out of the 20 years i have purchased this brand , but at the time ... it was a bummer . These otherwise wear well and come at Very Reasonable Price .
4 #### The only knocks I can put on this watch are these two : 1 . There are no decipherable instructions on how to set the day ( not date , That 's pretty intuitive for anyone who 's owned a Timex before ) . Day - of - week is a whole different story . I was finally able to set my day , but no thanks to the instructions I received from Timex . The instructions must have been translated into English from some Asian language that has a completely different grammatic structure . 2 . The expansion band is a bit tight for me , and I 'm a skinny old man . It is barely acceptable for me , but I think it would be too small for a normal adult , male or female . Of course , there is no way to make an expansion band larger .
5 #### The shooting range charges $ 1 - 1.50 each . Do the math it sure beats buying them at the range . They are life size and show vital organs at close inspection .
5 #### Has not cured my tennis elbow but has drastically improved it . PT helped get me to around 60 % better from my initial elbow tendinitis . I would say this put me at about 85 % . And I started feeling results within 4 days of using ! Watch the 2 minute video showing the extremely quick and easy daily exercise ( 3 sets of 15 will take you all of about 5 minutes a day ) . I started with the green flexbar ( 15 LBS ) and moved onto this blue ( 25 LBS ) after I felt the green was too easy . This continued to improve my elbow . Highly recommend . I have given the green bar to a friend who also has tennis elbow and he 's satisfied as well .
5 #### Great shoes - was looking for something to replace my barefeet so I can wear orthotics while kickboxing . These are light weight , hug my feet comfortably and have a thinner upper so I can still feel the bag when I kick AND they have good lateral stability . My feet are on the narrow side so it 's hard to find shoes that are snug enough . These are perfect . Oh , and they are really cute too .
5 #### Husband loves these Sperrys . He is a teacher and we have bought some every year because they are so comfortable he wears them pretty much everyday until they are falling apart . He has many different colors and styles , all which fit his size 15 wide foot very well .
5 #### I 've added these to my home workout equipment and I love how they 're stackable , but also fit in the bag to be neatly put out of the way . Very durable . Input quite a beating on them daily and have been using them for almost 90 days and have n't experienceseen any tears or snags . The handles are comfortable as well .
5 #### These wick away the sweat during long hikes and mountaineering . I even bought some to wear during normal days because they are so good .
3 #### Limited sizes available and sizing chart was n't very helpful . They were too large , but return was simple and easy .
5 #### One never knows what to expect when buying things like this online , but I will tell You that I 'm told they are an Excellent Value and very well made too . They fit skin tight & Are very comfortable to wear without any scratching and No roll - down . How do they launder ? As yet they have n't been washed yet , but are expected to be Fine . They are well worth the price .
5 #### A gift for my husband , and he loves them . I am actually replacing his old pair . He can wear them with anything .
5 #### Received quick , great quality , working well in machine once used , would highly recommend for jugs machine use .
4 #### Have always loved Movado designs and when I lost my watch a few weeks ago was very tempted to indulge . However , the more I looked online , the chunkier the Movado bands seemed to be . My boyfriend had a very elegant Skagen a few years ago and I began to look at Skagen . Finally settled on this one and am delighted . The design is elegant and clean . I too have a small wrist but was able to move the clasp fairly easily .
5 #### This fits the exact size of the pool table . Not large and cumbersome . It is also very lightweight compared to the actual ping pong table top we were using .
5 #### I bought this for a size 10 boy who was getting a rash from soccer shin guards . Fits well and elimated the rash . Stretch would allow it to work with a bit smaller or much bigger kids . The package has 2 pairs , which is nice when you have alot of practices .
5 #### OMG - I LOVE this little purse ! It has a ton of card slots as well as two ID slots . I attend college full time and either have to carry a purse and a book bag , or remember to grab my wallet from my purse and stick it in with my books . If I do that and end up stopping at the store I have to carry my wallet in my hand , which means I run the risk of losing something or laying it down to look at something and forgetting to pick it up . This purse is the perfect size to act as a small purse , or to fit into my larger purse / book bag . It also is large enough to hold my ZTE ZMAX cell phone , a lipstick and my gift card holder .
5 #### I bought this for my son for Halloween . He just turned 2 about 1.5 months ago , and is bordering between size 2 T and 3T. I decided to buy this a little big ( rather than small ) , and I 'm glad I did . This is a size 3T-4 T , and it just fits about right . The ears are WAY too small , though . I may have to buy a headband with ears instead . The costume itself is really adorable , and he loves it - just go for a slightly bigger size and plan on buying separate ears .
5 #### Nice mocs , I 've been wearing them for years . Fit like a glove . Slide off and on easily but stay snug to your feet .
4 #### Simple replacement for ones I 've had since high school . It was time . hahaha .
5 #### Price was great for an authentic Acme Thunderer . I bought mine to go on an A-2 flight jacket , WW2 style , by attaching it to the clip at the top of the jacket 's collar . I told my reenactor friends about it and they 're ordering some , too .
5 #### Excellent , comfortable shoe . No break in required . Outstanding for going through airport security . This is 4th pair I have bought . Still wearing the first pair around the house 7 years later ! How 's that for durability !
5 #### These shoes are very comfortable , I wear them all the time ! They do n't look cheap , and seem to hold together really well . I am very happy I bought these since I 've been wanting shoes like these since forever .
5 #### This is my 3rd pair of Chuck 's . The color is a nice khaki color and will pair nicely with a casual dress or skinny jeans .
2 #### This mattress takes forever to blow up by mouth . It has the valve that you have to squeeze while blowing into like a pool toy . While it seems pretty sturdy and held my weight well when I tried it out , this will not work for me for backpacking which is what I was hoping to use it for .
5 #### great fire starter for quick use only very few minutes
5 #### This is a great scooter . My children love it . It is easily folded , and it has a built in brake to slow it down . It looks very sleek and strong wheels . It is not big and bulky . I recommend this scooter , your kids and even you will love it .
5 #### Classic shoe , great fit . This is my second time purchasing these ... just in different sizes . Awesome shoe .
1 #### I really liked this watch when I first got it about a year and a half ago , until the first time I took it swimming . It got condensation under the face , and I worried this was the beginning of the end for my watch . It continued to get that condensation under the face everytime I went into the water . Yesterday I went for a casual swim , and there was the condensation under the face again . About an hour later the watch totally died . Not much for an Ironman watch- does n't that event include a swim ? My casio that I had as a kid was tougher than this watch . Bummer , since I liked the count - down feature for alternating running sets , but I love being on the water so waterproofing , especially when it is listed as such , is important . Save your money- the life of this watch was only a year and a half .
1 #### Do n't Bother - Avoid the Insanity I have had my heart broken by too many of these styles of ironman watch . The watch itself is Good , but the wristband does not last longer than a year . Then you are stuck with a watch that works but is un - wearable because there is no way to replace this type of band . NO Band Available . I know because I have 5 watches ( so obviously I liked the watch mechanism ) - At first I thought it was just a fluke that the wristbands broke . But I finally remembered - a definition of insanity is repeating the same action over and over and expecting different results . Now some of my watches are still ticking away in a drawer because there are No replacement wrist bands . It does n't matter how great the watch I s- if you ca n't wear it
5 #### Finally got the shirt that fits well and is a great quality .
3 #### It was very difficult to select a color - I had wanted a ' nude ' so it would not look as if I was wearing stockings . These are a bit darker than that , but appear to be nice stockings .
5 #### These shoes are stylish , comfortable and functional . They can be worn for anything and look great spring , summer or fall . Amazon made the purchase easy and shipped fast !
4 #### Great size for my kid it 's a bit big but he will grow into them and have them for a long time and get many wear out of them . I highly recommend this to anyone with kids who are rough on sneakers like my son !
5 #### Buy pants for work pants , and the results have exceeded the expected , the material is extremely good quality pants leaves no room for doubt , and ultimately the pants for any cowboy .
3 #### Kind of big for short - legged people . Any bigger and it would be " knee - to - ankle " size . Should have paid closer attention to the measurements I suppose . It is my fault .
5 #### Perfect simple thin shirt to keep warm on slightly cool days . Keeps the sun off my aging skin LOL ! Will be buying more !
5 #### Just what you 'd expect , a MLB ball . Comes in original packaging with the hologram seal . Perfect . If you 're looking to purchase an MLB ball without the cube case , this is what you want .
1 #### already falling apart . Have had the same problem with other shoes tool What are they doing ? Using another sort of Glue that is Environmentally fruiendly , but not Glue for a shoe worthy ?
4 #### Wife likes them . She says fit is good . The one thing I 'd say and this might be related to the larger size she wears but this bra is a little bit " pointy " . She calls them the Pointer Sisters when she 's wearing it .
5 #### Getting these in white was n't that easy , had to wait a couple of weeks for the price and size and color options to be right . But finally got them and my girlfriend was pretty happy ! The fit just right .
5 #### Great for keeping the gaskets on your dive gear supple .
4 #### Why do you sell a kids bike without a bike stand , i do n't know . But at least this part was cheap and easy to add on .
5 #### I used this as a halloween costume ! The wig was perfect ! It had breathing room and you could bring your own hair up from the wig via open slots if you wish . I will use this for other costumes ! Love it ! ! ! Fits great , stays on without moving around ... just a great great product ! ! ! ! It 's VERY VERY Bright reddish / orangish .
5 #### RemOil is good too , but Hoppe 's is the stuff . You ca n't go wrong . Bore snakes are the way to go unless you want to screw up your muzzle . They make cleaning fun ! ... or something .
5 #### You get exactly what you pay for . These are full sized targets . The paper is not heavy , but it does not need to be . They come rolled up individually in cardboard box which works well for storage .
5 #### Best Mono for surf water surfcasting , I use 30 lb test , casts very well
5 #### Its a Year old today .... and Its a great Goal worthe price . I would recommend using Zip ties the Velcro wears out . I am surprised that the next is still holding up , even with all the sun light on it . It has held up well . I am impressed . Very little rust for now .
5 #### I do not use these for cooking , they are too small to be practical . The larger ones do work , but are not the best option for cooking . However , these are awesome for tinder in starting fires . If crumbled , they will take a spark and light . They do not lose their volatility over time as some tinders do . The small ones are perfect for small survival kits . You will not ignite large logs with them , but they will get your kindling going very well , even in wet conditions .
4 #### bought dozens of these in different colors and weights , casts very far
5 #### Excellent casting distance . Great movement in the water . Very easy to manipulate the retrieve . Worth the money and a must have in every fisherman 's tackle box . Pricey but worth it .
5 #### Purchased these for my daughter because I love the way K - Swiss look on little girls ! Her shoe size ranges between a 11 & 12 , depending on the shoe . I got her a 11 1/2 and it 's a good fit ! She 'll be able to wear them for awhile before I have to purchase more ! This is her 2nd pair .
5 #### Grand kids love it . Had it out the other night . Seems pretty sturdy ... time will tell . I would recommend
4 #### This was my first pair of converse and I was super happy with them . It 's really all about the style , and these shoes went with everything I wore . It was only until I started wearing this shoes to work in college ( at a deli ) and they got tooorrreee TF up ! I still wear them on occasion to festivals or somewhere I do n't care if they get dirty , but they 're starting to get holes in the sides where the food bends at the front .
5 #### Got these for my husband for Christmas - he loved them and they fit perfectly . He 's normally a 13/14 , so we were nervous these would n't fit - but they fit great and were in excellent condition .
5 #### Exactly what you 'd expect from Bianchi ; great quality and performance . The spring steel belt clip holds firmly onto your belt and allows a smooth draw . The Amazon vendor that sent it was very fast on shipping time , and I loved being able to track the order as it shipped .
3 #### I 'd have to say , this works , so that 's good . It 's long enough for a man of average height but , not much longer than that . It 's quite narrow , however ; if you 're thinking of rolling over during the night , forget about it , you 'll go right off the side . I 've picked up much larger air mattresses for less at a local store . Of course , they do n't deliver . The mattress also lacks a large opening for quick inflation and deflation , having only the tiny little nozzle you might find on a beach ball . If you 're hoping to use a pump to inflate it , let 's hope you 've got an appropriate adapter . Fortunately , it 's small enough that you can reasonably expect to inflate it without a pump , it 'll just take a bit .
3 #### I bought two of these for my daughters . It was a bit narrower than I would have liked , and the hole where you blow it up with is rather small . It is not a bad air mattress though , and works for what it is needed .
1 #### I was so impressed with the color and cute look at first but regret so much for buying it because it tips over so easily . If I have another chance , I would look for something that is more balance , wide and low . I will give this toy away soon .
5 #### They are Chucks , if you have ever owned a pair you already know what it is ,
3 #### the jeans are ok I just need a little more room like a size 39 but they do n't have that size .
1 #### Sleeve ripped 2 months after purchase after 3 - 4 wears . Do n't bother !
5 #### Clear at every distance and zooms easily while staying in focus . It 's compact design makes it possible to carry in a backpack and still have room for the rest of your necessities . Focus knob is well positioned even with a scope cover .
4 #### shoe feels narrower than expected and size is large for the number .
4 #### For the price this was a great purchase ! I had been needing a pair of converse for a while and these were perfect . They are a little bit bigger than I thought they 'd be , but too bad .
5 #### They 're great . Exactly what I wanted . If you 're wondering about sizing , on the Converse site it says to order a half size down for this style of shoe , so I went down a half size and hoped that they 'd fit when I got them in the mail . I 'm glad I did cause they 're perfect .
5 #### This is my second one . Liked my dressy black one so much I had to have another . Wonderful watch . And so thin . No more bulky watches !
5 #### Perfect for my feet and sensibilities . I have 3 pairs and love them !
4 #### helmet fits just , I have adjusted for maximum size , my head diameter is 23inches
4 #### nice product , just do not fit me right . I had rubbing on my little toe , and the arch was uncomfortable for me
5 #### I has been my go gun care wipe for years . Last forever it seems . No other brand will do for me .
5 #### Fits well , looks good . Great work apparel for working in a game studio A little narrower than I 'm used to . Fit is nicer though .
5 #### For the price this is one great bench . The Phoenix logo on the board is removable if you do n't want it . The vinyl is very good , nice soft leather feel to it , 2 inch thick foam . Not really a heavy duty leg extension / curl but I need it to handle 150lbs the most . Comparably I had a heavy duty bench , the weight of this bench is lighter but pretty much the same dimensions . The tubes are thinner and also the paint is very thin layered . It scratched easy during assembly , but it 's okay , I love to see scars on my equipment . Overall I still have to give it a 5 star rating due to price , movability , function and capacity . Quality really depends on how much you are paying for , I had a 200 + bench but its hard to move it around . This one is on my garage with the power rack that I usually slide around if I need the space .
5 #### If you get past the smell they work great . If you use a wind screen to get the full contact of the flame to the cooking pot , they work great . If you 're too incompotent to be playing with fire , they do not work so great .
1 #### REPEATED TIMES ARE SENDING ME A WOMAN SIZE SIZE WHEN A MAN ASK . IN THIS CASE I NEED A NUMBER SIZE US12 . PLEASE MAKE EVERY EFFORT SEND THE CORRECT SIZE . EMIT PURCHASES ALWAYS THE MAN IN THE AIR . PLEASE SEND THE TENNIS WITH THE CORRECT SIZE . Offsetting DEMAND AN ALL MY CASES ESPECIALLY THIS
5 #### The Jeans were shipped on time and fit very well . I read some reviews that stated the Jeans are a bit small but I felt they fit very well and are very comfortable . Very nice for casual occasions do n't think they would work well for work type jeans but they are perfect for going out to a bar , restaurant and casual every day type events .
5 #### You simply can not go wrong with a classic like the Buxton Heiress Double Cardex Wallet . Timeless , always in style and so well thought out .
4 #### This is our 2nd Classic stove ; the 1st one was lent out and returned in such poor shape we bought a new one for a camp - out last weekend . Ca n't beat the price ! Simple , reliable functionality . Would be 5 stars but this new one has the same problem as many who 've posted reviews : the burner refuses to remain at anything lower than full blast . I ended up wedging a couple of wooden match sticks ( sans heads ) under the knob . Our older Classic never had that issue .
5 #### You 'll love it after you get it but in the mean time check out rollingbaby.com for all your baby stroller info !
4 #### I got this for a summer 3 week vacation at the beach . It is huge which I like , so I can put 2 people and a cooler on it . I also set it under a pop up tent and it worked great . My only complaint is that after just 3 weeks , it is stretching and tearing a little at the seams . I was hoping to use this for many seasons . I like that it folds right back up easily and has carrying handles . Was very convenient to carry .
5 #### I bought this gun case for duck hunting and it has worked great . It seems to be of good quality . I really like being able to undo the Velcro and open it up when I get home to let the inside dry out .
5 #### This is my 3rd pair . I keep them for years , until they are worn out because the more you where them , the more comfortable they become . Being a diabetic , I put prescription insoles into all of my shoes , except for these . They seem to mold to my foot as I wear them .
5 #### I love these shoes , i bought them for my grandson . I ordered i size 3 infant , fit him perfectly with a little room for growth . They are of high quality , look really nice . Everyone comments on how cute they are , they really are super adorable and cheaper price than on zappos .
5 #### It 's cute on my daughter . It 's a Timex , what else is there to say but keeps on ticking !
4 #### It was very difficult to write a review for this product . On one hand , it performs well and is well worth its price . On the other hand , it has a cheap feel to it and it is a bit clumsy ( inconvenient ) to use . Bottom line : I wish I had paid the few extra dollars for the Omron HJ-112 , which probably would have met my expectations better .
2 #### I bought this for my husband , first one snap by the handle almost injuring him . when I contact seller they send the replacement right away ( great service ) . Unfortunately replacement broke too exact same way . I could not return it since it passed 30 day period . I would not buy this product or recommend it to anyone .
5 #### This is a great stove to keep in your bug out bag or hiking pack ! Lightweight and works great . Works better with two tablets than one . :)
1 #### WTF Merrell ! Learn US shoe sizes . I 'm a 9.5 in sneakers and dress shoes , always have been since being an adult . But I order 9.5 and they are way too small without socks . I send them back and order 10s . Now I can barely get into them with socks on ! No room ! ! ! Keeping them since , I 'd tired of the hassel and they just barely fit , maybe they will loosen up on break in . What 's the issue with the getting shoe sizes correct ? ! ! !
5 #### Great mat . Be sure to clean it after use and air it out or else it 'll smell stinky .
5 #### My son has played with this boat non stop since it came . If we do n't get anymore use out of it I 'll still be happy . It does take a lot of air , so a pump is nice , we used the one from our mattress . Great little toy for pool
5 #### Awesome watch for learning to tell time . Only confusion is it stops at 30 then goes back to 5 . Zoom in .
5 #### Well made product . Eliminates the need to use a 15 foot dock line when you only need a few feet .
3 #### received the item and after close inspection the rod had some cosmetic blemishes . nothing that would warrant sending it back . now to see how it does in the catching of fish department ...
3 #### I was shocked at how small these shoes were , not true at all to size , and I own multiple shoes in this brand . The quality could have been better , in my opinion -- very little support from the upper .
4 #### They look and feel great , but the leg portion is a little short . I 'm 5'6 " , and the crotch fits a little lower than I 'd like . Next time I will purchase a tall size .
5 #### Whoever designed this at Rubbermaid needs to be promoted or at least rewarded . The design is a perfect solution to tight space behind the seat of your car or truck . Why ? A. It is simple . B. Rubbermaid resisted the urge ( I 'm guessing here ) to install a drain plug . A drain plug would only be one more thing to break . This cooler is light enough and ergonomic enough to enable one to pick it up and pour out the water while holding back the ice with their hand . C. It is essentially , an insulated rectangular bucket with a lid . D. Oh and by the way .. the lids are well designed too . Why ? Well , there are two lids , side by side . So one can be opened by the person in the beach chair or passenger car seat without needing to open the entire lid to reach for a beverage or baby 's milk . E. The keeper is a good design as well because it can be used to secure the lids in place . Then , after use I use the keeper to hold open the two lids to dry out the cooler . It insulates well . I have been surprised of the need to dump ice after a two day trip in the mountains . This cooler is never out of my Toyota Tacoma Access Cab .
5 #### Bought these for a specific reason . Wore them once . They look cute on . The color is slightly darker than I expected but overall I like the shoes .
4 #### Most of these are just a little long . But good overalls .
5 #### Lightweight & smooth casting & retrieval . Changed to right grand retrieve in less than five minutes .
5 #### This is a lot cheper than the targets at the range . I like using white paper cause the background at the range is black and it 's a lot easier to see where you are landing
5 #### I 've used other resistance bands , and after about 3 months they typically snap . These have been going strong 2 - 3 times a week for 6 months and no breaks . Good assortment of weights and combinations , ca n't go wrong .
5 #### The size of this knife makes it a great boot or belt self - defense dagger . Great backup knife . If you want it to pull out of the sheath easier , just sand each rubber finger safety knob , which is what locks into the sheath . You ca n't beat this for the price . I have the small Timber Wolf dagger and this is worth spending a couple extra dollars . This is a little shorter than the Timber Wolf , but it is 440c steel .... very durable . This will be my back up knife or for when I do n't want to carry a larger knife . I like of a couple types of these cheap knives , as they do serve a purpose . I have more expensive knives like the Sog Daggert 2 and a couple of custom made 01 steel knives . I would still carry this knife in many situations as a back - up . I am also a fan of modern daggers for self defense and I usually do n't like a knife to show .
4 #### I am 6'6 " and the tall Carhartt shirts are too long on my torso . The standard XL is what I wear day after day . These shirts last and wear well .
5 #### I suppose I 'll buy and wear these for as long as they are produced . With the exception of winter boots for deep snow , and running shoes for running , these have been my go to , all purpose footwear for decades . The simplicity and style fit my needs , and I just do n't forsee that changing for the remainder of my days spent upright .
4 #### Great fit , not thin material , very pleased . I will be ordering more .
4 #### 4 stars because for the first time in a long while I did n't run these nylons which is amazing . However based on the size chart I order the correct size but when I tried them on , they just did n't fit right in the thighs . If you are tall and have thick legs / thighs like myself , I would suggest getting a size bigger than what the size chart suggests just to make sure they fit correctly .
4 #### Like my converse shoes . The price is right . Last time I wore this she s was about 30 years ago and I love it
5 #### Love these shoes . I 've been buying Nikes for years now . I bought this pair for work and everyday wear and another pair for working out and active wear . They also last a long time in my opinion , especially if you take care of them .
5 #### I really like them . Thank so so much . I would love to buy another pair or more next time xo
5 #### Husband loves these . They are just as you 'd expect from Chucks . Ships quickly in original box .
4 #### I love my new slip ons . They are comfortable and much safer than laces , which kept coming untied , and tripping me . My only quibble is that the Nubuck waterproof version does not come in black -- only brown , which I also purchased .
5 #### it fits good , is exactly as described , I do wish it had the old school snaps , but for this price I have no complaints and I know I will get lots of use out of it .
5 #### I 'm 62 years old and have been shooting and hunting since I was old enough to hold a gun . In those years I have owned and used scopes including Zeiss , Leupold , Redfield , Burris , Nikon , Bausch and Lomb , Weaver , Unertyl , Kahles and pretty much all others , through the years I have discoved that the Tasco line of scopes is very durable and as fine of a scope as you can own . The " zero " on my Tasco scopes have never failedd me , they are clear annd bright and are an easy scope to use . I have 2 World Class scopes , one with a mil dot reticle and one with a standard duplex reticle and I love them both . For the money there is no better scope on the market and for much more money you will get no better scope . Yes the best scopes have better light gathering abilities but forhunting and general use these World Class Tascos are world class and are as good as it gets .
5 #### The hat fits true to size . Nice quality , as well . My son really likes the hat . I 'm sure he 'll get tons of use out of it .
5 #### My niece used this when she stayed with us . Takes a while to inflate . Do n't think I would want to manually inflate this . It held firm through her 5 day stay and we did n't have to re inflate . Its narrow and I did read the dimensions just did n't think this narrow when inflated but still not a problem . Good buy and will enjoy us g it next time she comes .
5 #### It 's nice to have three keyd alike ... I bought 3 of these , 9 locks total for use in my gun cabinet when guests come over . I color coded locks to match a color on the key . They fit everything from my .38 revolver to side by side shotguns . Snug fit .
4 #### It 's just me , but I seem to like the regular Venice better than the H2 . I think the H2 is hotter , live in Florida , and the fit is just a little off . I do really like this shoe . It 's very comfortable and has that Keen style . Can walk long with them . Very good arch support , and you can wash them in the machine . Pretty darn good .
3 #### I probably made this mistake and bought this item too big , but I think I could fit 3 other people with me in this thing . I normally wear a size 6 - 8 dress , but the size 8 underwear are enormous ! Shapewear always seems to run weird , and I have bought items too small in the past , but this is not shapewear , just huge black underwear .
5 #### Sneakers were a gift for son - in - law . That 's the kind he likes . He 's happy .
4 #### Nice to have for Bug out Bag , work well and age well , kind of stinky .
4 #### Nice wallet , just wish the credit card slots were n't so tight .
5 #### I ve am a woman size 7.5 to 8 shoe . I ve been wearing this style for years & do n't ever have to try them on . A boys size 6 fits me perfectly & last for years of every day use .
5 #### I love these resistance band so much I bought a second set . I have worked out most of my adult life ( 53 yrs old ) primarily with weights . The past 10 yrs found weights hurt my joints . Real bummer . I was not sure how good a workout I would get with resistance bands , but have found the resistance bands allow me to get a great workout without the joint pain . The quality of the bands are quite good . Thanks Black Mountain . Staying fit without the joint pain .
4 #### Shoes are very comfortable . I was able to wear them all day with out my feet hurting like they do when I wear other sandals . I love them .
5 #### Great ! Everyone knows how converse fit , shoes run big xo
5 #### This is a fantastic pump ! It 's easy to use and takes the strain out of inflating pools , boats , etc .
5 #### Fits like all converse half size too big . Love the all black .
3 #### They only work well if the length between your vessel 's cleat and the dock or other connection point are perfect . Would not advise use in rough water conditions .
5 #### These shoes are absolutely awesome . You should know going in that they are hard to keep clean , but that 's just the name of the game for white shoes . They are very flat , but you can fit orthodic arch supports in them . In terms of size , I wear a size 12 for Nike Free , size 11.5 for Vans , and size 11 for Sperry . I ordered these in a size 10.5 and they fit perfectly . Thought it might be helpful to give some references .
4 #### 4 of 5 because it took me two returns to finally get the right size -They run big- , but in the end I normally wear a 13 , so this 12 mens wound up perfect .
5 #### I have purchased many soccer balls over the years . This ball has held up nicely and has not gone flat like all of the prior balls I have purchased . I would definitely buy another one .
5 #### This is the ring set I use on all my CZ rimfire rifles .
2 #### Three of us , two competent adult women and a 17 year old teenager - looking like a sweaty game of Twister - could n't put this together . A month later it 's still in the back seat of my car , awaiting the simultaneous availability of at least two tall friends with substantial girth , and very long arms ... I suspect it will be very sturdy once it 's finally completed , but there 's got to be a better , injury free way , to ship this to customers .
5 #### Children are also pleased I purchased as a birthday present to children . Because it is a birthday once a year , children and me happily , I now also feel happy
1 #### I bought there and recently pull them out ( cold weather is coming in ) the inside of the shoe tag is n't right . Missing logos , stamp is n't crisp and not in the right place . I can go on . But other then that you really have to look to see it 's a fake .
3 #### This Timex watch is accurate and easy to read . But it 's has to be one of the loudest tickers you could pick to wear . Mass produced movement is somewhat audible . Not stylish but functional .
4 #### Have n't used is for hunting yet butt feels pretty goo in my computer chair .
2 #### This line did ok until i got half way down the spool and now it has so much memory after 1 trip it needs to be changed . I contacted Hi Seas via email and did n't get a response . I wo n't be buying anymore of this line , stay with the proven products
4 #### I like these boots , I normally take a 9 1/2 in practically every kind of foot wear , but according to the fit guidelines I needed a 10 . That turned out to be correct .
5 #### Product was purchased as a group of organizers for a homemade woodworking project . They look nice and really organized her stuff well . I shopped a long time to find this best deal .
1 #### Looks like a average size lunchbox ... inside is about 2.5 - 3 inches tall . Maybe you can fit a single sandwich inside . Was not for me and will be going back .
5 #### Great quality , wonderful for taller men . No coming out of the pants when bending down .
5 #### Super soft and as warm as a scarf , but without the bulk of a scarf . When I wore it in the cold yesterday I did n't feel the wind at all , which is wonderful .
3 #### Overall it 's a great sock but the elastic on the calf Is too tight .
5 #### Great scope for the price . I could clearly see the holes in the target at 100 yards from my AR 15 . Very pleased with the high amount of light too .
5 #### Weeks great for adult . Bike store confirmed . Do n't waste money on more expensive helmets . This one looks and fits great
2 #### I have had Timex watches since I was a child and the have been great ... until now . Setting the time and date was easy , but setting the day of the week was a pain in the a * * ! I tried multiple times and gave up . My wife finally got it to work after 10 or 15 minutes ! No more Timex with the day and date for me !
1 #### I wore these shoe one time , from the airport in Omaha , NE to the airport in Phoenix , AZ . When I arrived in Phoenix , the left shoe / sole started squeaking and wo n't stop . I want to return for a refund . Need instructions for returning as no paperwork was in my package when it arrived .
5 #### I LOVEEEEEEE my new converse , I own a pair of all black and all white ones that I bought from the store and they look slightly different , so I start questioning whether they were authentic . But apparently converse has a slightly new look . .. check out the official converse website and Google converse authentication . They fit great they do n't run a size bigger or smaller . .if you know your true converse size
5 #### I bought several of these to wear post breast reconstruction surgery . They are very comfortable , and the support is great . In fact , my plastic surgeon says they are great . Recommended !
2 #### I have tried fitting this mirror on several sun glasses and ca n't quite get the area behind me and the bicycle rear area of interest . It 's tough to find sun glasses that have hinged area , beyond ears and head , to mount the mirror with good rear views . I now use mirrors that attach to a bike helmet and extend well beyond ears , head and helmet . This requires less head twisting to see cars tailing me on the road than Cycleware mirrors .
5 #### Hello ! I received the product in damaged and opened packaging . I do understand that this can happen in transport . However , in all my ordering time this is the first time receiving something in this condition . The actual product box was also banged up but the scooter itself is OK . I use it to keep up with my kids and it takes me down the path just fine . I do love the ease and convience of Amazon ! Kristi
5 #### I bought these shoes as a requirement for my daughters hip hop dance class . She loves 'em . I had to be careful and pay attention to the sizing , but other than that , a nice pair of shoes she will be able to wear when class is over .
5 #### I like the two tone it goes with anything just thought the the face was a little bigger . sometimes it is a little hard to read the date . but nice watch
5 #### I 've used hand grippers before ; what I would call the ' usual ' ones you get at sporting goods stores . I 'm usually able to ( easily ) do 50 + reps with those things and I literally broke the last pair I had . So , I read the reviews for this gripper and thought " surely the level 1 would be fine " ... dude ... I can barely close this gripper all the way ! and I 'm like " this is only level 1 ! ! ! ? ? " So , ya , I think the Captains of Crush is the real deal . and , I ca n't imagine this thing ever breaking ; it 's solid iron .. like the grip .. I ca n't wait to build up strength to graduate to level 2 ! !
5 #### Perfect size for camping . Fits both of my cast iron skillets at the same time . I just bought the carrying case and that was a great addition to this as you can store two propane cans in the sides to make transport easier !
5 #### I purchased this suit not really knowing what to expect , but I am very pleased in all areas but the size , and that was my fault for not purchasing a small instead of going with the more bulky medium . I am a woman , 5'7 but slim at 110 pounds . I did want some wiggle room in the suit though and that I got . I live in the Pacific Northwest where it can be rainy and cold and this insulated suit is nothing more than awesome in keeping me warm and dry . The Medium fits me perfect in size from neck to ankles , just bulky in the midsection and legs . The length of the arms and legs are yet again , perfect . I did read that some purchasers are receiving wind up the legs which I can see could occur . I wear biker boots that come up to my knees so I tuck in the pants and have not problems with the wind . The same with my gloves which are long up my forearms , so I just tuck in the sleeves which leads to no wind . The torso and legs are too roomy , but that just means I can wear long underwear or pants underneath the suit and I am fine . This is a very warm suit that takes a huge rain beating and I am kept dry and comfortable . I am extremely happy with this purchase .
4 #### Carhartt seems to size small . I wear a 33 " but orders these in 34"and they fit fine . Other manufactures 33 " usually fits fine .
4 #### I have some other Smartwool socks that I only wear sometimes . But when I do I wonder why I do n't wear them all the time . These are a little heavier than the other pair so need cool weather for wear these but I do like them !
5 #### Great for the price . They work great . Fast shipping . I recommend them . I have been using them for over 6 months . Still in good condition .
5 #### I ordered two mattresses . They arrived quickly in good condition . My wife and I use these air mattresses to augment our folding futon couch , one on each side of the fold and the are working out very well and comfortable . We use them daily and they have held their air for over 2 weeks . Great value .
1 #### they came with glue all over them so i had to return them
5 #### Not the most environmentally sound approach to keeping hands warm , but we find them pretty much a necessity when we 're out in the field engaged in photography here in Alaska . They keep indefinitely as they do n't begin working till the plastic is open and the ingredients interact with oxygen . Once they begin working , they last for hours . Tucked inside a goo pair of mittens , these will keep you in the field fishing , hunting , photographing or just enjoying the outdoors .
1 #### Buyer beware ! ! I 'm a avid outdoorsman , camp all at least twice a month . Got this product because it popped up as a suggestive item while searching for trioxane . This product is not like trioxane , I attempted to light it with a striker to know avail . I held a lighter to it and it did not light . The cube was fresh out of the package , we proceeded to try to light all the cubes none of them . You 'll have a better chance lighting a rock on fire .
5 #### This is my first Case purchase . Wow , now this a true example of " you get what you pay for " . Had never wanted to spend that much money on a knife , but after this purchase will definitely not think twice . The edge is very sharp out of the box , construction is solid , finish is awesome . Exactly what i wanted in fixed blade . Can not go wrong with Case .
5 #### Worth every penny ! Very well made . True red color . When I pull it out of my purse , I am always complimented on it and asked where I got it . Highly recommend . ( I got it on sale )
5 #### This is the most durable , well - made Halloween costume I 've ever seen . It 's also very authentic looking and cute ! My son won a neighborhood " best costume " contest with this one this year . I also loved the fact that it 's very well suited for the cold Halloweens we have in Minnesota . It 's easy to put warm clothes underneath and not compromise the costume 's look . The pants are adjustable ( it has suspenders ) , however as other reviewers noted it does run quite large . My son is a couple months ' shy of 4 years old , and he 's small for his age . I was n't sure which size to buy -- I chose the 4 - 6 size so that he could wear it for a number of years . I kind of wish they had more sizing options cause neither one seemed like the right call for my 3 - year old . It turned out OK , though . It was clearly a little bit big on him , but not to the point that he was swimming in it . The reflective stripes were great in the dark for safety purposes . And the sleeves go down around the thumb ( so it 's kind of like partial mittens ) . It helps keep the coat in place . My son thought that was really cool .
3 #### It keeps things good and cool , but the darn thing is almost impossible to open !
5 #### It is the best watch for younger kids learning to tell time .
4 #### I like that I wo n't have to replace the net each year since it 's made of galvanized steel . I like the sound it makes when a ball goes through the net . There are a couple extra loops where it attaches to the hoop but I just doubled them up and it was good to go . Daughter loves the net .
5 #### It is strong , sturdy and friendly . I love that it has the storage lip on the front . I put the pencil , the reed case , the mouthpiece cover , and the mouthpiece brush . on it and I am not constantly searching for any of them . I bought the feet covers because I have hardwood floors and I think that is a wise addition .
5 #### A little snug at first but after wearing a little while they fit as expected . ( These are comments by my husband , who actually is wearing the shoes ! )
5 #### I got these for my 15 year old sister and she loves them and wears them often . Great price !
5 #### I got these for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loves them ! She says they fit perfectly and they look really good on her . She wears them everywhere !
5 #### Much heavier , tougher material than another ball that I have . Does not lose air over time . Just seems more rugged and " professional grade " , like the ones my PT has . My son loves playing with it !
5 #### I got this for a Denver fan and it is the perfect size to be propped up on his desk and show his Denver love . It 's nice to have the holes already in place if decides to take it home & put it in his man cave .
5 #### This is a great bait bucket keeps them alive for a long time ...
3 #### I purchased the Manduka Black Mat Pro 85 - Inch Yoga & Pilates Mat on January 8 , 2013 - I was so excited to get the mat .... it took about two days to received it by UPS . I knew It was going to be some what slippery the first time I used the mat ... but iT seems that after a month later the mat is still slippery I am trying to give it some time to brake in but it is very hard when you are doing a class and you keep sliding ... it makes it very hard to hold to psition
4 #### I bought the Yakima Landing Pads ( # 6 ) so that I could attach existing Yakima Control Towers and bars to a new camper shell . There is no alternative if you wish to stay compatible . They fit perfectly with the old Control Towers . Installation was relatively easy . The main problem is that the bolts supplied with the kit were not long enough to reach through roof of the camper shell . Most camper shells now feature a thicker roof for strength and insulation purposes . The supplied bolts are only 1.5 " in length . I went to a hardware store and bought eight 2 " stainless steel bolts for about $ 8 that worked fine for installing the landing pads on the thicker roof . I tested the landing pads by hauling two kayaks on top of the camper shell .. and I did not loose them on the road !
5 #### Great mat . Thick enough on a wood floor to be comfortable , with enough tackiness to hold you . I mainly use it for stretching . Easy to clean , and roll and store .
3 #### I 've always come from using weights and to be honest ... these seem like good bands ? But I just do n't think I like bands .
5 #### Love these shoes ! Needed new running shoes and these are perfect . Light weight and fit great !
5 #### I tried these on a whim and they were absolutely perfect . I 'd call these almost - opaque ; they 're slightly more see - through than leggings ( and so a little dressier / sexier in my opinion ) but they 're close enough to opaque that you could totally get away with not shaving your legs . I 'm 5'11 , a size 8 / M , and I ordered the tall even though I weigh slightly less than what the chart says . It was the right choice . I personally would n't want them any tighter , but they 're tight enough to reign my butt in a little . The length is awesome -- I love that they come up high on the waist ( no muffin top at all since they come up to what is actually the smallest part of my waist ) . There are no sagging crotch nightmares , no getting - them - on nightmares , no drooping around the knees / ankles at the end of the day , etc . Perfect . I 've already worn them several times with absolutely no snags , and I 've brushed up against enough things to think they 've been tested . Highly , highly recommend , especially if you 're tall . UPDATE : on my second pair , my toe broke through the very first wear , which was unexpected after the first pair was so durable ( I wore them countless times over the course of a year or so before they finally snagged ) . I 'm reordering to see which was the fluke : the durable pair or the not - durable pair . I 'll report back .
5 #### Perfect for dock lines . Nicely made and length very adequate .
3 #### So far so good , works as expected . It 's not a top of the line scope , but what do expect for the price . I can see the bullet holes at 100yrds on a cloudy day . I 'll have to report back when i try it on a 200yrd range , the eye relief could be better , i have to position myself just right in order to see the image .
3 #### Battery is supposed to be good for 10 years but simething syops working after 3 years . But I like it , this my 3rd one .
5 #### My biggest fear was that they would arrive flat . Mope ! Great balls .
4 #### This has been the only thing that has helped my tennis elbow .
5 #### My son and hubby had one of these . Been using then for about 3 years and the velcro still works great !
2 #### I ve owned 2 of these and you have to be very careful if a less experienced person throws it and it happens to glance off a tree chances are the solid internal plastic ring snapped . It is very cool while it works but is very delicate I wish they made a more sturdy version .
5 #### I kept scarring my girlfriend with it until she broke up with me ... well worth it
2 #### to big and that 's the size I wear smh .
4 #### The shoes are made of a leather material which is what I need for work ... They run big off the bat and will stretch out after some wearing . They also do you not have much support , if wearing these for several hours invest in some dr . Scholls
5 #### just like the name says.i kill the schoolie stripers . please catch and release .
3 #### Merrell shoes certainly are not the quality they once were , sad to say ....
3 #### Too big for my hands and makes it hard to manipulate things under water . I end up just using my hand without the gloves . They need to be a little more snug and the fingers definitely need to fit better .
4 #### My daughter loves this watch . Only complaint would be that the lens seemed to scratch up pretty quickly . I guess kids will be kids .
5 #### Hey it 's simple , it 's rugged , it 's cheap , and it 's comfy . What more do you want ?
5 #### These are the best shoes I have ever use for my workouts ! ! ! I love them and buy them in bulk ! ! ! LOL
5 #### What great sleeves at a great price ! My grandson loves these because they are glossy clear .
5 #### Precisely what I was expecting . Rugged , fit as intended , and long enough for me ( a bonus for a 6'9 " fella ) . Color fade and wear has been very good even after months of use .
5 #### Nice sturdy work pants for my husband . Size as expected and fast delivery .
5 #### I consider this knife one of the best fixed blades that Buck ever manufactured . It is aesthetically beautiful , as well as completely functional . The blade retains it 's sharpness after much use for skinning game . It is easy to sharpen . KUDOS to Buck !
5 #### put this on my 2000 toyota rav4 . work greats . it is very solid . great design . the rack is two pieces : one that stays on the rav4 all the time and the other that screws on very quickly to the permanent part so when you are not carrying bikes you can quickly remove the rack portion and put the tire cover back on ... very clever . this is an industrial strength rack . it is worth the money .
5 #### Perfect fit , I like the way they look on me .
4 #### Keeps great time and looks good . I think it is a tad cheaply made but you get what you pay for , and this is not an expensive watch . All in all I can not complain .
4 #### We have 3 children in different grades who play soccer and all 3 seem to have different sizes . We have a couple of nets in the back yard , which is really great for them to practice a game they love . But we also have several balls of different sizes . I think it is really funny that they use all the balls to practice . It seems like it makes a perfect practice . They laugh a lot . This is the size our 5th grader used . It is exactly like several I have purchased from our sporting goods store except that it is n't scuffed up . Yet .
5 #### I bought this to help rebuild the strength up in my shoulder . I got the red which is medium which is n't that strong . I wish I would of got a heavier weight one .
5 #### Very comfortable , from the 1st time I put them on . They seem a little loose around the heel , but I think the next size down would be a little too small . So far , very pleased with the look and feel of the shoes .
5 #### I 've been using one for two weeks and definitely noticed a difference in strength in the forearm . I play tennis but have had golfer 's elbow due to strength - training and using the flexbar has allowed me to continue weight training without pain . I think that there are benefits to tennis as well , particularly if you use the ATP - style forehand . The recommended usage is 3 sets of 15 reps per day . I started out doing three but am just doing one set per day . It can be a little rough on your skin as you use it . I am thinking of buying the Blue one at some point as the green one is n't that hard anymore .
5 #### Works very well , reliable and does n't leak at the cap / nozzle .
3 #### The handles are plastic and it seems a little fragile , good for the price . Not the best , also pretty long . The door attachment is crap
5 #### Ok , Hogue . The name says it all . Any true shooter uses hogue grips . Got this grip for my Kimber Tactical Ultra ll Officers model . The 3 F 's , it passes with flying colors . Fit , Feel , and Functions perfectley . I have hogue grips on all my guns , nothing is it 's equal . Thanks , my 2cents .
5 #### May be made in China but the hat is outstanding in quality and sewing . The hat is cool to wear and provides shade to my ears and receding hair line when outside doing yard work .
5 #### Replaced my old net with this and I love it . Sounds great when the ball goes through . Have to use some plyers to clamp the connections onto the goal , not too hard .
5 #### I have many pairs of Keen shoes . I wear them for any activity where I want to keep cool but protect my feet . I love them . I have several styles . This one is a little heavier than the Whisper , but has more support . The bungee adjustment makes them fit my wide and different sized feet . You ca n't go wrong with Keen shoes .
5 #### Have used it several times and found the distress call very useful ! It has several different calls all in one unit . My first try using a call , but am well pleased with this one .
5 #### I like this sporty , yet ladylike watch for everyday use . My eyes are not that great anymore and I like a bigger face , which this is a bit small . However , the backlight really helps . Worth the price .
5 #### These are relatively economical , very serviceable knee - highs . Wear them fall , winter and spring .
5 #### Used these hooks on our past 2 catfishing trips and they worked fantastic . We caught numerous 3 to 4 pound catfish and most were hooked right in the corner of the mouth . I have included a pic of our last trip and all 8 of these were caught on Gamakatsu Octopus 2/0 circle hooks .
5 #### Love these pantyhose ! I do not like waring shoes with socks or hose and these pantyhose are great . Strong and comfortable . They will last a long time .
4 #### Very comfortable sock . Began to pill with first washing but otherwise appears to be durable .
5 #### This thing is well built , does n't rattle around like metal and make noise , easy to operate and sturdy to hold fish and easy to clean . I would buy this again in a minute .
5 #### Great durable product for PT work . I love that it came with excercises , although links to videos would be even better .
5 #### Usually a size 5.5 - 6 is women 's . Size 3 fit perfectly ! Luckily I have small feet ! Wear them all the time !
3 #### Ordered toddler boots and got young men sized boots , other than that they were great but had to go elsewhere to buy them for my toddler
5 #### This is perfect for practicing or playing soccer . It was super easy to set up and works great .
5 #### Buen producto , por el precio excelente , envi&oacute ; oportuno , en empaque adecuado , recomendable ! ! Buen producto , por el precio excelente , envi&oacute ; oportuno , en empaque adecuado , recomendable ! !
5 #### Converse has been making great shoes for a long time and they 're still at it !
5 #### I really love this lid holder ... I bought it for our fire pit dutch oven cookouts . I use cast iron all the time , in fact , threw away all my other pots and pans except for a few stainless steel pieces . I 've used this lid holder in my kitchen as a trivet , holding my cast iron pots , pans and lids . I have n't even taken it outside yet . Think I 'll get another other for outdoor use and just keep this one in the house . Can be used for dutch oven cooking , just set your pan on top and coals underneath . Can put your dutch oven lid on it and fry up some bacon while you 're cooking eggs in the dutch oven . Excellent price . Have fun both inside and outside using your cast iron products !
5 #### I 've worn Skimp Skamps for years . They 're the perfect panties for me and I got them at a good price on Amazon !
4 #### Excelente producto original , en buen estado y buen precio , llego bien a mi pais , en la caja original y en el tiempo estimado
5 #### Got mine a day ago and have been using non - stop . I plan to keep it in my car for work commute . It is the perfect tension for training and built with durability in mind . Great price point so no excuse not to have one !
5 #### Fantastic action . Enough weight to cast , dives very shallow on trolling and realistic action on slow reeling . Caught a 19 inch large mouth badd on first cast with this lure . 5 fish total first day ! ! Get one asap . I 'm using it in a weedy bittom pond .
5 #### I like its old fashioned looks and its sturdy , hefty feel . The expansion band is great for my very thick wrist . The watch is durable , and its crystal resists scratches . The watch has even survived going through the washer and dryer . Although I 've bought " better " more expensive watches , I always return to Timex . The indiglo feature is excellent and I love being able to read the day of the week and the date so easily .
2 #### I ordered the all white leather converse in size 10 women/8 mens . The reason why I 'm giving the product 2 stars is because they fit too big ! :( I have skinny narrow feet , Idk what to do they were expensive to begin with so I probably wo n't go through the hassle of returning them . I 'm 5'8 so I 'll just try to pull them off either way UGH MAN I wanna say size down but what if they 're too small ? ? I 'm going to go buy fat socks now ... :(
5 #### Love my chucks ! Would n't recommend them for people with any kind of foot issues as they do n't really have much support . But they are my long term wear anywhere shoe . I just recently had to retire a pair and bought these to replace . My only concern with the new pair is longevity . My old pair lasted FOREVER maybe 10 years , of course by the time I finally got rid of them the bottom had no tread and the rubber was so cracked it was starting to peel off and they were no longer black but some sort of light gray color . Still they were perfectly conformed to my foot and the most comfortable shoes I owned . Hopefully the new ones will hold up as well . I was slightly disappointed in how much they cost . I could have bought them in a store for half the cost , but they never have my size in stock , and it seems like this is the average price online .
5 #### I bought these rings so that I could detach my scope when traveling through airports . I put the scope in my carry on to protect it from harsh handling . I have a Remington 700 sps tactical , and a Vortex diamondback 4 - 12x40 scope , and these rings fit both well , but they are such a good fit that there is n't enough space between the barrel and the front lens to put the scope cap back on . If you do n't have the thick bull barrel on your rifle I do n't think you 'll have that problem .
1 #### I thought these would be like the old style Converse from my younger days but these are very cheap with little to no support . they 're like wearing nothing .
5 #### Great fit for my teen daughter . She loves them , they fit her perfectly
5 #### This is a very loud whistle ! You will be noticed with minimal efforts . Sturdy construction and a reputable brand . Highly recommend for camping and survival !
5 #### Same classic Fox 40 we all know and love . Great for directing traffic , can be heard inside cars even with the windows up .
3 #### They look great but the back scrapes my heal too much regardless of socks or not . Hopefully I can work it out as I really like them other than that .
4 #### Wish they had half sizes . Other than that great little shoes .
4 #### As an Amazon Prime member , I am more than satisfied with the completeness of your product lines , and 1 - click purchases are a real time saver . Whe I have had to return products , the process has always gone smoothly .
5 #### My husband loves these . They are a little big for him but the waist is easily adjusted and they do an excellent job at keeping the bugs off .
4 #### These shoes are a classic and are very comfortable , but , you have to be careful or they will rip . mine ripped in the first month
3 #### so these are the real thing from what i can tell , genuine converse shoes . but they came in with this little leftover sticker chunk from who knows what , and when i gently rubbed the sticker off with some oil on a q - tip , there was a dent left under it . and i was very careful to not like , dig into the rubber or anything . then the toe was half shiny , half matte , when the toe of the other shoe was all matte . its not something i m super upset about but its a bummer to pay full price for a shoe and have it arrive with a defect .
2 #### These nylons seem to have shorter legs , as they kept sliding down , therefore they were very uncomfortable . I have a 31 " leg length .
5 #### Bought these for my daughter and she loved them ! Also , fit perfectly . Will buy again for sure
5 #### My granddaughter was thrilled with these shoes that are all the rage at her school !
4 #### Super comfortable . I joined Cross Fit and this is the perfect shoe .
4 #### Fit true to size . Not much arch support , just like the Whisper , but the Whisper is a lot prettier . The color was boring too . Returned it .
4 #### I bought these to use while tent camping . I have not used them doing that yet . I have several Intex air mattresses already . This pad is made of similar material . The material is heavy duty but the seams are made more like an inflatable pool float except that they are made a lot bigger . My daughter played on it for a few minutes and she liked the comfort . Now inflating and deflating . I have a special tool for inflating pool floats with a bike pump . Using my large flow bike pump , it still took a very long time to inflate with my daughter and I swapping out every few minutes . We tired of the pump . Deflating was easier by just sitting and folding with the valve open . It went quickly . Rolling up for storage was a snap . Roll smooth side in towards the valve . Smooth and compact . I did have to use a dryer sheet to wipe off the fuzz and cat hair from the floor I bought 3 at a good sale price and am very happy .
5 #### Holds about 60 pounds of my weights as well as my wife and very sturdy . Appears durable and has held up to our first 3 - 4 scuba trips . Very happy with purchase .
5 #### Lightweight , decent arch support and comfortably to wear all day doing regular activity and sprinting .
4 #### These fit great ! The description said leather , but the are canvas , so wo n't last as long but also have great traction . Will be good for camping ! Overall great shoe and very light weight .
4 #### I love these shoes but i had one area on the shoes that were rubbing my foot wrong ( i was able to fix it with mole skin ) , with the correction i can wear the shoes all day and i really enjoy being able to use these as water shoes . The also have good traction on the bottom . I would recommend these shoes , I think i just got a pair with a defect and i was willing to fix it my self instead of sending them back .
4 #### Good shoes but they ran too large for my foot - had to return them
1 #### Unfortunately , this Flex Supreme does NOT have enough support over the toe and ankle are for my requirements . Returning for credit . Thanks anyway .
5 #### I love it . It 's tough and good construction . Makes tying up to the dock a snap .
5 #### I bought one and then two more after trying on my flats boat . I use one on my push pole when staking out and one on my anchor looped to my bow cleat . It really smooths out the wave action when at anchor or staked out .
5 #### It does what it says , it burns hot and smokeless . It 'll start a fire pretty quick too . Just make sure you have a lighter or some good matches cause you wo n't get this light with a flint steel , or any other way .
5 #### Loved these shoes ! ! ! I am a size 7 in women 's and I ordered a size 5 in men and it fits perfect !
5 #### My entire family have turned into murderers . Murderers of flies ! Everyone has a blast dining around shooting flies with this fun . It 's very accurate too ! What a fun way to control the nasty bugs . Get one for your whole family to enjoy .
5 #### wow these are the most comfortable , light weight shoes . I love them ! !
5 #### Used to play this all the time as a kid with my Dad . Continuing the tradition with our grandkids . Fun , and cheaper than a pool table and takes up less space !
5 #### These are essenstial for surviving , if you work outside in sub - freezing temps . You can reuse them by placing them in a sealed plastic bag , for a day or two , just take them out of the bag and shake em up again and they heat right up
4 #### This product is good ... Nice price ... But not GREAT ... It does the job ... I had a previous set of these resistance bands and I can say that after a while ( 1 Year Or Less ) ... If you are n't careful with the bands ... Some of them could break a lot before ... So be careful ... It 's a good product if you know how to use them ... I 've bought a new set two weeks ago .
5 #### Having a Zeagle meant a quick release weight system that did n't give you the ability to just pull them out and hand them up to the DM . Skiff diving means not walking out with your vest on . Now , with these pouches , I can easily unzip and hand them out . And they fit great . I use soft weights preferably ... and the balance seems better with the pouches I highly recommend them . I have 2 rigs in two places and I have pouches for both Zeagles . I also recommend you put a large key ring type ring on your BC zipper so it is easy to find and grasp ... cheap at any key counter , and stainless .
5 #### Looked big when I opened the box , but they fit HIM perfectly !
5 #### Once again , Case delivers with this classic drop point skinner style knife . A razor sharp edge , beautiful rosewood handle , and a nice lanyard hole all deliver the quality Case is famous for . Very happy with purchase .
5 #### These were bought for my husband . They replaced an older pair . He wears them all day . He has high arches , and they are comfortable for him .
5 #### Love these shoes ! Nice looking with slacks for work and wear well for long walks .
5 #### When I find a brand of pants that can hang with my work , I stick with them . From construction to moving Locomotives , this brand has been slapped on my skin from the beginning and I trust nothing other then Carhartt . Come at me !
5 #### Love these , they did need to be broken on for sure , but after that sooooo comfortable
5 #### Exactly the quality I expect from Merrell . Perfect fit ; great support .
5 #### Great buy for my grandkids Works well for summer and winter here in Minnesota
3 #### ( Size Large c / d ) I bought this to use as a sleep bra . The bra is well made and I like the cotton fabric . I do not need the pockets , but they serve a useful purpose as a smooth lining which covers the dart seam in the bottom of the cup . I measured using the instructions and sizing chart at amoena.com , which led me to purchase a larger size than I normally wear / measure . In this larger size , the bra does not fit as well as I would like . The band is slightly loose , while the cups are slightly tight , and the bra 's overall length is a bit short . It 's OK to sleep in , but I would not use it for day wear .
3 #### Well , quality looks fine but has not caught a fish yet . I totally acknowledge that this could be my own doing but hey ...
5 #### Enjoy wearing this shirt , although just a little too long . I 'm 6 ft . The shirt is great .
5 #### Love it . Good fit , good quality , and perfectly packable to keep in a pack to help keep rain\sun out of my face . Ca n't go wrong for the price
5 #### This was my third time purchasing these Jungle moc 's . I love them . They are practically the only shoe I 've been wearing for the last 9 years . Very comfortable , lightweight , and they hold up well too .
5 #### Ca n't wait to start wearing these this summer . They fit perfectly and look so cute
1 #### I loved these shoes ... that is until after about an hour of wear , the green inserts on the sole of the right show began falling off . The wear was in my home , on smooth floors . I can only assume they were defective .
5 #### I think everyone in my house has a pair now !
5 #### Fit very well over a variety of rifles and shotguns . Product appears to be very durable and put together very well . My wife was very glad I purchase them since she had volunteered to make me a dozen and then realized the work involved . Excellent product and an excellent price .
5 #### Reading through some of the reviews , I got worried that the shoes would n't fit , but ( at least in a size 7 ) they fit just like all the other Merrells . They seem made for someone with a high arch so I 'll have to see if I 'll easily slip out of them , but length- and widthwise , they fit great .
4 #### This is a good overall book I would recommend for those individuals looking to understand disaster prepping and doing so on a restricted budget .
5 #### Fits well , non - reflective surface , good for both bikes and skis . Good value .
3 #### I purchased these for a friend . We are still friends , so I guess he liked them .
5 #### A great buy for sure , bought these for hunting and hiking , and they also fit nicely into my bike bag , nice sharp , clear view .
5 #### This was purchased for my son who loves the Patriots . He loved this and has it hanging in his Man Cave . Looks great on the wall . Would purchase again . Very reasonably priced and was received in a timely manner . Thanks
5 #### This stuff is great ! Other oils will spill out the sides and openings and/or dry up or gum up over time but this stuff stays where you want it and makes the action feel like butter . Cycling is so much smoother too . Very thick oil and very high quality . I will probably never buy any other kind again . You only need a drop or two at a time because of the quality so this one bottle should last for years .
4 #### I love my new timberlands . They are soooo cute and I have gotten lots of compliments . I usually wear a women 's size 7 and I ordered a size 5 in this and it fit me good . It was just a tad big . But still wearable . So I decided to keep them :)
5 #### The color pattern and fit is what I liked the most what I liked the least is that they are not easy to clean and stains do not come out very easy or at all
3 #### its ok for the price . only it takes some extra efforts to deflate it .
4 #### Nice and soft . Right amount of stretch . Darker blue it looks in picture . Go for a size smaller then you normally wear . Let them stretch a little for a nice look and feel .
4 #### Look more of a blue color rather than a gray
5 #### perfect for my daughter 's Wicked Witch of the West costume !
5 #### Back to basics with this old school style Chuck Taylor low - cut sneaker . Compared to most cross - fit training shoes and running shoes these provide a very stable close - to - the - ground feel which is the reason for the purchase - the shoes are very stable when lifting weights in a standing position and also are useful when performing deadlifts or other standing rowing exercises . They look kinda retro snappy as well . Great shoes .
4 #### I ordered a 3.5 and I should have ordered a 3 . But I still love them .
5 #### I ordered these for my eight - year old he . I ordered him a size 2.6 and it was spot on to what he normally wears . They have extremely comfortable !
3 #### This bra is getting better with every wash , but it 's still pretty scratchy .
4 #### Good scope for the money . I put this scope on my cva optima 50 cal muzzleloader . It 's not a Burris , Nikon , or leupold but it does n't have 250 plus price tag either . Scope is clear and easy to site in . I do n't regret buying this scope
5 #### Great waterproof case ! 1 . Good construction - hard plastic has endured hot and cold extremes here without cracking 2 . Waterproof seal - the latch does n't pull down tight , but it does n't come ajar easily and it does seal the case well ; survived several waterproofing tests including soaking in the sink and sitting in the dishwasher though all cycles . 3 . Plenty of room for all the items I placed in it . 4 . Ring could be a little more solid , but it works 5 . Standard aluminum caribiner is sufficient for hooking to molle webbing or belt strap Very good case ; highly recommended . Note : I base my reviews on a ) the functionality of all parts of the product based on its manufacturer intended use [ not what I want or expect it to be able to do ] , and b ) the usefulness of the product for my intended use [ which I tend to base off the manufacturer intended use ] .
5 #### great pair of shoes , I wear them all the time . Perfect fit , color , and fit , How could you ask for more ?
4 #### Like the shorts but like the others said , they do run a size small
5 #### I got this for a good friend and he loved it i think because he said he was going to hang it up on his door .. Very nice sign .. I would have taken it if he did not want it
5 #### Worn for years same quality love the neutral - no color of travel buff . Great wearability and reinforced toe is great . Silky !
4 #### # 24 fits the savage mark ii - F .22lr ( $ 147 walmart gun ) verry nice mount . ! ! ! ! ! ! YOU ONLY GET ONE MOUNT ! ! ! ! Not the 2 you need to mount your scope . Order 2 of them .
3 #### The wallet seems to be made with quality leather and stitching but it is easily the thickest front pocket wallet I have ever seen . The magnetic clip is the reason . It is poorly designed in that the entire clip is made separately using 6 magnets and 2 pieces of leather , then stitched onto the outside of the wallet . This makes the outer layer the thickness of 5 pieces of leather and the magnets . That small detail makes this wallet twice as thick as my previous , even though it has one less pocket then that one did . Summery : +5 stars for construction , -2 stars for thickness .
5 #### been using on a cornerman bag rack with a 80 lb . bag had no problems with either . both are performing better than expected . been using for over a year .
2 #### I know there is a great deal of confusion about sizing so I 'm going to try to help with that . In expensive dress shoes and tennis shoes , I almost always wear a size 9 1/2 ..... never a 9 but sometimes a 10 . I ordered a size 9 in these shoes and they looked like ' clown shoes ' on my feet . I returned them and ordered a size 8 and they are just about perfect although ever so slightly larger than my usual shoes . I ca n't imagine why they use such unusual sizing but I hope this information will be helpful . If you order a size and a half smaller than usual , I feel sure they will be right ... or very close . Now ...... the not so good part . I am 66 years old and grew up wearing Converse tennis shoes all through the 1960s ; they were great shoes in every respect . If your experience is similar , you will immediately realize that these shoes are in almost no way , comparable . These look similar but they wear more quickly and are n't nearly as comfortable ; even the laces are of very poor quality .
5 #### I have avoided purchasing control top for fear of them being too tight or not going up over my stomach . I appreciate the fit of these pantyhose , when pulled up they fit almost to my bra and I just pull to the waist . Better a bit to big than too small .
5 #### You can not beat the price of this helmet for what you get . It 's very comfortable and I have no complaints about it . Very well worth the investment to potentially save you from serious injury or worse .
5 #### Nice full wig . Shipping was fast . Color is exactly as pictured . Perfect for my cosplay .
4 #### The pants are first rate even for being slightly used , as I use them for camping and backpacking . The material sheds briars well .
4 #### It 's been a long time since I 've bought this kind of hearing protection ( as opposed to ear plugs ) , so I have no way of knowing how this stacks up against the competition , comfort - wise , hence the four stars . I have no complaints . Many years ago , I worked for a company that produced threaded products and other objects on automatic screw machines . One of the machines was a Davenport multi spindle . Very loud . So I bought a pair of shooting muffs . Not only did they reduce the sound level , but they had a profound relaxing effect on me . So if you work in a noisy environment , consider wearing these , not only for hearing protection , but also for stress reduction .
5 #### Great tool yo finally get over your tennis elbow . I have been using it daily for a few weeks . I opened a badly stuck soda cap by hand without pain for the first time in eight months .
5 #### Nice quality , and easy to use . The Velcro is sturdy and does n't separate or roll . The suspenders are easy to remove . The way the belt is made allows for a wide variation of tension .
5 #### This watch is exactly as pictured , so no surprises . I 've had Timex watches in the past , so I know this Brand will give me good service . Great price , too !
5 #### I love that it 's straps can be adjusted in the front - not the back
4 #### Good silicon impregnated gun sock , does the job . Will probably buy more .
5 #### Purchased for my daughter for gym class . She loves them . Very cute and very comfortable .
5 #### This is great for my wrist and forearm pain / strengthening , my orthobionomist swears by it .
5 #### Very comfortable and durable . The cushioning is just perfect . It also absorbs moisture really well . They 're hands down the best hiking socks I 've ever worn and the price is right .
5 #### I am rating this on previous experience as the shipper failed to get it to me in time for the hunting season . I love this product and think it works great . While deer hunting I have had a fox completely circle my location twice and twice cross my trail . It showed no signs that it was even aware of me . I feel that a foxes sense of smell is even better than a deer .
2 #### As most exercise products , these were used a few times , and stored away in the bag for a few months . I took them out to start using them again after a car accident has kept me off the free weights , and the bands are starting to discolor and fade . Makes me nervous that the integrity of the rubber is weakening ...
1 #### These are very comfortable socks and provide excellent cushioning . Unfortunately , they fell apart after 3 months of wearing them a few times per week . There is literally a giant missing patch of fabric and a hole starting in the bottom of both of the socks . Again , 3 months of wearing a few times per week . They were not washed more than maybe 10 times during this period .
5 #### Its the quality you 'd expect from RCBS . There are other brands out there but with the reputation they have established , there 's no reason to look at others .
5 #### This Schwinn installed very easily , is quick to set up , and yields useful information when riding . I like the + - symbols that show whether you 're exceeding or falling below your average speed . The display is easy to read , and this just bike computer just works . Take care in setting your wheel circumference in metric units ; I found a good conversion table on [ ... ] ( in his Bike Computer section ) , which lists various wheel sizes and their circumference . I had to read the instructions in order to learn how to reset the trip totals properly -- change display to distance ( NOT odometer ) , then hold the left button for two seconds .
5 #### It 's a seat cover you put on top of your bucket - you would think there is nothing to say on the topic . However , there are good features on this product . The surface is contoured for a more comfortable seat , the 4 grooves on the surface make it flex better and allow air to circulate ( keeps you from sweatting down there ) . The fit on a standard bucket is good - not too tight to prevent binding and hard removal and not too loose so it does n't move around when you are working . Overall a good product , good design and works as expected . Very nice .
5 #### A great scooter for kids My daughter has been wanting one ever since she saw the neighbor kids on theirs so we finally got one for her and at a great price . Love the color for her and easy to ride seems to be able take a beating as well being dropped all time . Love that it can just be folded up tucked in car or any place really easy to adjust and a great warranty also . My daughter is age 7 and still thinks it is just best thing ever right now .
3 #### The sole split on the bottom of the last two pairs of these I 've had , compared to the pair that lasted nearly 6 years 15 years ago .
5 #### Well made . Excellent length for my purpose . A good buy for me
5 #### MY Granddaughter loved this watch She just turned 6 and she will not take it off
5 #### Arrived on time , and fit perfectly ! I am a size 3 in kids ( 5 in women sizes are a little too big for me ) and it fits great . I wear two or three pairs of socks with them and walk through the snow and do n't feel a thing . I also asked earlier if they were fireproof because of a video I saw and they are ! [ Yes , I did test them the first day I got them . ] They are extremely lightweight which was surprising because they are incredibly durable . I wear them almost every day and it 's been a month and there 's no visible signs of wear and tear ; besides the fact that the laces are coming apart a little bit . The only thing that sucks is that you have to unlace the entire thing and relace the entire thing to take them on and off . But they are totally worth it ! If you 're on the fence about deciding , I can say that they are a great investment .
5 #### These things were almost $ 200 20 years ago . Super compact when folded . Every kid should have one at this price .
5 #### I ve owned several benchmade knives , most were almost double the price of the mini griptilian . This knife is becoming my favorite edc knife and I ve prefer the 3 " blade size for everyday carry use . I m pretty much a spyderco fan but I will say I love this knife , one thing I would like to see is benchmade come out with g-10 scales for this knife ... that would= perfection ! The axis locking system is awesome for total one hand operation and is very strong . This knife also came VERY sharp right out of the box , the knife DOES NOT feel cheap either ! That was one concern I had before I purchased but after holding the knife for the first time my worries were gone , the knife definately has a solid feel to it with the steel liners inside .
5 #### Purchased this for my Steeler Fan daughter . She was very happy with this cover . This product has held up to the weather .
4 #### My biggest beef with most jeans nowadays is the material . It 's almost impossible to find jeans made of real denim anymore instead of the stretchy , cheap - feeling crap . These are a good weight of real old - fashioned denim . Very comfortable . The " finish " looks exactly as pictured which is also rare these days . My only issue is that i think , being " relaxed fit " , they could have a tiny bit more room in the buns for sitting down comfort . That would make them 5 stars for me . Also , I wish they came in 28 inseam ( I 'm built like a Hobbit , but that 's not Wrangler 's fault , it 's my parents ) .
5 #### Got this as a Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it , works very well . The color is awesome , quality is great and its all around fancy . The clip works very well and holds all his important cards . I would recommend this to anyone . :-)
5 #### I have not had a chance to use but it fits my head nicely
5 #### The E100 scooter is perfect for kids , especially families with younger kids . All my kids , ranging from 3 to 12 , absolutely love this scooter . It 's easy to get going and can go for quite a while before needing a charge . After the initial 18 hour charge , it usually will charge in a few hours . We usually let it go over night so it 's ready for the kids the next day . It has a relatively low weight limit at around 125lbs , so most adults and bigger kids may not be able to ride it . Overall our kids have loved riding this scooter around the neighborhood .
3 #### Was a little disappointed in this . It was large for a youth basketball and did n't retain it 's bounce long . A little hard to tell what you are getting .
5 #### Item as promised . Keeping excellent time . Would buy from seller again .
5 #### Simple , comfortable and lightweight shoes . Dense fabric . Good quality rubber , soft sole . I hope that will be pleasantly worn . Delivered in a timely manner . I 'm quite happy .
4 #### The fit is good . The elastic around the waist is very snug , though . I am a small woman and I like high - waisted panties for a smooth line under skirts and dresses . These cut in just enough ( waist size = 25 inches ) that I do n't get a nice smooth line , so I keep these for under pajamas or sweats or lounge - y clothes -- stuff where a smooth silhouette does n't matter .
5 #### You can not go wrong with Chuck Taylor 's . They are exactly what I wanted . A great relaxing weekend shoe . Also there are many different choices of colors to choose from so you can find the perfect color to go with your outfit . Although , Converse always run a little big though . So just make sure to get a half size smaller than what you normally wear .
5 #### The black / black / lava shoes are great , however they are Converse All Star Counter Climate shoes not Classic Chuck Taylor All Stars . The only difference is the tongue of the shoe is sewn in to the shoe to help keep water out and the canvas is water repellent . For people with wide feet the tongue being sewn in , can constrict the feet a little . Otherwise a great shoe !
5 #### Great unit for the price , optics are nice and clear zoom and fine adjust are good
5 #### This is a great deal ! Being able to get 30 Shoot - N - C ( 8 inch ) targets for this price is amazing . I seriously do n't think that a better deal will be found anywhere else . The targets are really cool as well , and I 've been using this brand for years . Very easy to see where your bullets are hitting , because it turns florescent green around the bullet impact . The targets are also self - adhesive , which makes it really convenient to just paste them wherever you want .
5 #### Resistance bands training DOES WORK folks , look at the results I 'm getting ... If I CAN DO IT , so CAN YOU ... Make 2018 the year you look good ... Wishing everyone the best , let me keep you motivated !
3 #### There was nothing wrong with the product but my feet are very wide relative to their length and these shoes are too long and narrow for me .
2 #### Did not keep the water from seeping into my golf shoes .
3 #### My husband loves his Keens . I bought these for a trip to HI and had high hopes for them . The shoe is very sturdy and has a great tread . However , the hard foot bed hurt my feet after walking in them for an hour or so . Hopefully , I can resell them as they were hardly used .
5 #### Perfect for my grandson for school . Great price , nicely packaged .
5 #### My pink - obsessed daughter loves this watch , and I love that because of its strap , she can slip it on and off herself .
4 #### That 's about it , its cute and its loud . People will hear your little one coming . Its easy to use , my daughter got it at 3 and has no problem getting it going , and keeping it going !
5 #### Bought my wife her first pair for her birthday , She loves them . I always described them as a " durable sock " . That 's how they feel .
5 #### I have used this on several contender barrels from 22 to 44 with no problems .
5 #### I have two pairs of these shorts . They last forever . They are comfortable and look pretty decent too . It 's a good purchase .
4 #### I ca n't fault the jeans themselves for being too small . I had a pair of older jeans that were size 34 that fit pretty well and expected these new jeans to do the same . They did n't . They were just a bit snug . It will just give me some incentive to lose a few pounds . My complaint is not specifically about these jeans but the fact that I need a length of 27 and the shortest length available in this waist size is 29 . Wrangler jeans have always worn well for me and I expect nothing less from these , once I get them hemmed to fit me .
5 #### Normally , the Executive would n't be a knife I 'd buy new or used on its own . Recently , I acquired a lot of used Swiss Army Knives all with advertising or a person 's name for a bargain basement price ( less than $ 3 each ) . In them was this Executive . After pulling it from the box , I noticed it was the perfect size -- small , but not too small ( like 58 mm Victorinox knives ) . Tools . Two blades -- a large and pen blade . The main blade is a usable size , unlike on the Classic and other 58 mm series Victorinox knives . Pen blade good for detail work . Orange peeler with flat head screwdriver -- haven't had a chance to use the orange peeler , but the screwdriver ( which fits no . 2 ) Phillips ca n't have torque put behind it . Nail file with nail cleaner -- this is the only nailfile Victorinox makes that still has a cut ( metal file ) style surface . It files metal and nails equally well -- which is excellently . Nail cleaner does n't work as well as on the 58 mm series , but is an excellent No . 1 Phillips screwdriver . Scissors -- as to be expected with Victorinox scissors , they 're excellent . They 're also a bit larger , making them easier to use . PS -- if you get a Swiss Army Knife 74 mm with advertising , and the advertising is on the side of the blades , reverse the tools if you 've removed them from cleaning and are used to the tweezers being on the cross side . The advertising SAKs often have the scales reversed , with the cross on the wrong side .
5 #### Loved them ! And once you click buy , you can contact the seller and ask for whichever color you want ! ( as long as they 're available ) as for the product , they are the best I use them as an equalizer at the end of the route ( I do n't remember the name for it in english ) , with three miners , and it 's awesome ! totally recommend it !
5 #### I am very new to yoga , but after a few classes on my cheap - o mat , I knew something had to change . I splurged on the extra - long Manduka mat because I 'm 5'11 . I love this mat ! The extra length is totally worth it . I can go from pose to pose without constantly repositioning myself on the mat , I can do an extra - deep lunge and still be entirely on the mat , it 's thick enough to be comfortable when kneeling , and it 's very sticky . I did still purchase a yogitoes towel because I just sweat a lot through my hands and feet when doing yoga , but generally speaking , the stickiness is more than sufficient on this mat . For those who complain about the weight ..... unless you 're carrying it on your back while riding a bicycle or hiking across three states , there 's nothing to complain about . Yes , it 's heavier than most mats . I bought a bag and carry it to class 2 - 3 times a week just fine . Most school backpacks , carry - on luggage ( and quite frankly , many women 's purses ! ) weigh more than this does . I did wash it in water and vinegar before using . As others have said , for the cost , you would think Manduka would pre - wash it for you , but oh well ! Worth every penny and I would absolutely buy it again .
5 #### I love these shoes . No they are not traditional boat shoes as the bottom and part of the side suggests a sneaker like version of most traditional Sperry 's but all in all its a comfortable shoe that has some style . Pro 's Versus Traditional Boat Shoes - Laces are n't leather ( which where horrible about un - tieing themselves - More ground support with a rubber sole ( included cool colors on certain models ) - Vented sides ( my feet get very hot so having so air flow helps - Comes in wide sizes which was nice because I needed a 11.5 Wide .
5 #### Works great , I think ? I got tennis elbow for some reason and I could n't hold any amount of weight out fully extended for nearly . Year . Started using this and nearly the next day I noticed a huge difference ... And yes I had pain the day I used it and much less the following day . It seems to really stretch the joint out and makes it feel much better .
5 #### Great Sock- ( would like 60 wool blend ) . I will buy again .
4 #### Okay , folks , there is something you need to keep in mind when buying shorts or trousers . Most companies label a waist size as two to four inches smaller than your actual waist size . That is , your waist may be 40 inches , but when you go to Old Navy , their size 38 or even 36 may be what fits you . It makes you feel better about shopping there , because it makes you feel thin . Dickies , though , makes clothing for work uniforms , so an HR rep will take a worker 's measurements and then order clothing accordingly . So when you buy these shorts , take your actual waist measurement OR order two to four inches bigger . I ordered four inches larger than the jeans I bought from Old Navy , and these shorts are a PERFECT fit . Wonderful . A bit baggy , which is cool with me , and they 're really sharp looking . The colors are deeply saturated and vibrant , and the fabric , while stiff , is soft on my legs . It 's not a bad idea to get yourself a Dickies belt , either , because a lot of belts designed for jeans wo n't fit through the Dickies belt loops . The Dickies belt also helps to keep the waistband from folding down . Also , I was sceptical of the cell phone pocket , but it really is quite useful . In short ( no pun intended ) I give my wholehearted endorsement to these shorts . I bought three pairs !
5 #### Fit well . I have a small to normal -sized head ( female ) and these are the best swim goggles I own . Water does n't seep in , allowing me to swim many laps without stopping . These would be good for a woman with an inter - ocular distance on the smaller side .
4 #### Quality built . Should easily last the season and hopefully a few more .
5 #### Love converse all stars ! ! Comfy and never goes out of style .
4 #### This broom was adorable and matched the costume perfectly . The only thing is a bit of a tap and some of the straw would break or fall off . It was not an issue of it completely falling off , but the bit that did was a little concerning for longevity if used past the initial night .
5 #### Good work jean . Tough and durable with a slightly looser fit . Great value for the money
4 #### By mistake my new watch was part of a load of wash . I found it at the end of the cycle . It was " foggy " and even stopped for two hours later in the day , but then started again and lost the fog . It is good as new , though did get a bit scratched up ..... and VERY clean .
5 #### This is a darling little set . I ca n't say how it 's going to wear tomorrow anything about it really because I bought it for my great - grandson to be . Bought it in a larger size so he would have a something besides newborn clothes that she already had many of those coming in . Bought him several things from Amazon have a big box to send to him sometime in March .
2 #### When ordering this belt was expecting a little more . The webbing is not very substantial the buckle does not adjust easily and the measurement was off by about 6 inches . Not highly recommending it .
5 #### Sky blue.get lot of compliments on style and color .. fits and wears great .. will be getting another pair soon ...
5 #### This has been my choice for the past 10 years . Nothing fits better .
5 #### No cons ; seriously . Pros : Lightweight , very thin , colorful , does n't rip out arm hairs , able to fit on a skinny guy 's wrist without having to keep " pushing " the watch back up your wrist . Fits under french cuffs or regular cuffs with no problem . I receive more compliments with this watch than from any other watch I 've ever owned . Can go with business or casual attire .
5 #### Perfect for keeping my cigar off the ground while I play golf .
5 #### The product came as described . This product works well for my 10 year old who is just now learning archery .
5 #### Ordered a size down after reading reviews that they ran big , and they fit perfect ! My daughter and I both love them , and she 's gotten a lot of compliments for having matching shoes like mommy ! :)
4 #### These are good shoes for doing squats , dead lifts , and for weight training in general . But I would recommend purchasing these in a shoe size probably 1/2 smaller than your normal shoe size .
1 #### Started to lint on day 1 . By day 2 there were pills all over my collar line & face when I took warmer off . Believe the polyester version is better choice .
5 #### Very fast arrival , and is perfect . My original watch band lasted over five years but just gave up the ghost a few weeks ago . This one is just right . I saved the loop from the old one and added it so I have two on this band to hold the tail down better . Saved the pins too , but doubt I 'll ever need them -- they were in perfect condition still . Installation was a breeze -- a very small straight ( - ) screwdriver quickly unscrewed the pin end . With my fingernails , removed the old pin and the band came away readily . Suunto did a fabulous design on this wristband , no wonder it lasted so long , and would never become unattached from the watch . Jim
5 #### Keen backed up there product and replaced one that had torn with a brand new shoe I could pick out . Good company ! love my Keens !
5 #### I would not know any better frankly , but this was recommended by a friend for cleaning , and it seems to work well after puting several hundred rounds through my target rifle .
1 #### does not have any way to adjust the straps , I returned this product
5 #### I got these based on the good reviews . They 're comfortable and warm . Yes they are expensive for a sock .. but they 're worth it !
4 #### Solid seat . Hard to remove lid if you want inside he bucket .
5 #### We got this because we have family coming over and not enough beds . It was a blessing , even thought you need a pump to fill it up it was n't too much work . We try a foot pump and it was doing nothing . I did n't slept on it but my kid did n't complained . We have used a couple of times now .
5 #### My son loves wearing costumes around the house so I figured this would be a great one got on time if a great will buy again from the seller was super excited when he saw it where is it all time .
5 #### Exactly what I was looking for . Occasionally I try another product , but always come back to this one . It fits perfectly , is comfortable and well made . And with Amazon , I do n't have to go to a store to buy it .
2 #### Hat is sized small . A 7.25 size should be at least 7.75 , to fit correctly . Boonies should fit a little loose even after several washings . This wo n't do it . Hat is stiff and not comfortable . Cost to send back not worth it and they know it .
5 #### Works well . I 've used this to not only sharpen my knives but my moms knives as well .
5 #### MY SON LOVES THESE . HIGH QUALITY , NICE LOOKING , , AND DURABLE . THANK YOU !
5 #### As usual another great product from Carhartt . Long enough to keep from feeling the draft when bending over ...
4 #### They look cool , but they are rough on the feet for the first 15 hours or so of wear .
1 #### Should publish that these are in men 's sizes . Wanted a 5.5 in women 's and was given a 7.5 . Way to large . Will need to return .
4 #### Great boots but dug into my sons leg and caused a blister .
2 #### My knife just arrived today , and is about the size I was expecting it to be . Great build quality and weight balance , also came sharp . No offense to SOG , but I just do n't see how this knife can go for $ 100 + . I would not buy this at full market price . Update as of 5 - 12 - 15 : I hadcarrying this knife every day since I received it , until a couple of days ago I discovered the thumb stud had loosened and fallen off of the knife . Not sure why this happened and I expect better from a company that sells products of " tactical / military " quality . I had not been using this knife for anything other than daily cutting tasks , and if it failed for me it would most certainly fail in a combat scenario when someone needs it . I had considered sending a few of these to my friends in the Army and Navy , but am glad I did n't . As previously stated , I would not buy this knife at full market value considering the poor quality control and lack of durability .
5 #### I 'm a big , big , big fan of Pelican cases . I know there are cheaper alternatives out there , but Pelican works . Always . I 'm a photographer and have been using Pelican cases for years . They have never failed me . Ever . They 're tough , durable and water - tight . I recently got into shooting guns and just bought this case for a Ruger 22/45 Mark III Hunter ( 5.5 " barrel ) and a handful of accessories . The pick ' n pluck foam works wonderfully and I now have a custom case for my gun . If you 're protecting valuable electronic or mechanical gear , there is no other . Get Pelican and you 'll be satisfied .
5 #### These are great basic jeans in hard to find sizes . My long and lanky teen is hard to fit , so we are glad these are available . They have been washed and dried repeatedly and have held up well .
3 #### It 's pretty thin and therefore , get 's blown around A LOT outside . My neighbors can barely make out the flag on my front lawn . Some sort of weigh at the bottom would make this purchase more appealing .
5 #### These things are fun , nearly bullet proof , and my boy loves it !
4 #### Definitely helpful for hand grip strength . I placed these in my vehicles and get a couple sets in when I 'm driving . I saw an improvement in my BJJ grips when grabbing the Gi lapel . Be sure to select the correct number grip , for the No . 1.5 seemed extra tough for my weak hands .
5 #### Dickies usually fit about 1 inch too small . But they are great . Fit exactly like I expected
1 #### it said it was 16 " but it was only 15 " and would not fit my truck steering wheel
5 #### My old school Uncle was getting busted in his tree stand over and over again and could n't figure it out . He said his camo 's were near new , the wind was at his face and almost everytime the deer would see him in the tree and run away . I told him to use this product because it will eliminate the UV rays in his clothing thus becoming invisible to the deer and if he gets busted it 's his fault . With hesitation and skeptisism he washed his clothes with the Atsko wash and sprayed it with UV killer . Well what do you know , he did n't get busted the next time out . He said the deer would walk by or come to his mineral lick and never notice him . He 's now a believer . Do the research on deer vision . If you do n't believe it , well , keep doing what you 're doing , but what if you 're wrong ? It could cost you a nice buck .
3 #### I ordered my exact head size and the hat was a little snug . When I received the hat on the Inside was a label suggesting a loose fit for comfort . A little late for this bit of information . Should have been mentioned beforehand as part of the description . When the hat is washed it may not fit at all .
4 #### It is what it is . Received as advertised . Burners are somewhat susceptible to the wind .
5 #### Most home gym equipment is poorly designed and poor quality . I am happy to say that this Body Solid gym machine is the exception . Well made and well designed . This unit operates smoothly in every function and has the feel of a professional machine . No need to reconfigure it for the different exercises . The only thing you need to change is the pin position to set the weight load . I ca n't use it these days due to back trouble , but I wo n't part with it . This is a great machine for anyone who wants to exercise at home and has limited space .
5 #### These are the briefs I buy over and over again . I started wearing these years ago when I discovered them in a department store , but Amazon is more convenient and the price is right . They are so comfortable and smoothing . There are no seam lines showing through shorts or pants , so I wear them often . I machine wash them on gentle cycle and hang to dry . They deserve that extra special care .
5 #### This helps my son with the noise on the bus .
5 #### Very durable mat , a touch heavy for taking to the gym every week but I 'd rather build a little more muscle than wearing out another mat . The thickness is great , comfortable and plenty of support . * * Update Oct 20 , 2015 : I 've had the mat for more than a year , and it has held up great . I use it 1 - 2 times a week , and the mat shows _ zero _ signs of wear . Every other mat I 've had would start to have some crumblies by now , this one still looks new . I do n't have any issues with my hands slipping on the mat . I 've even forgotten this mat is a little heavier than most . If you 're not sure whether you want to spend a hundred bucks on a mat , stop worrying . Just get it . You ca n't afford not to . Buy once , cry once .
5 #### Flies long and straight just like I remember as a kid . A bit smaller than the original but just as much fun to throw .
5 #### Cute , sturdy , and well made . Definitely run big , but at least we have room to grow !
5 #### Does a good job warming your hands or feet if you put them in your socks works for a few hours
3 #### Boots are really nice but for some reason they run rather larger than normal I had to buy them a whole size smaller for myself n a half size smaller for my daughter .
5 #### We now own three of these . They are just a good as I remember and so easy to catch !
5 #### Bought for my granddaughter , they are too cute . ca nt wait to see her to give them to her . They are really cute and the color is perfect
4 #### Functions as advertized . Provided the resistance needed to help with wrist and hand strengthening and flexibility . Good product for this purpose
5 #### perfect timing to plant , we received a lot of rain and this product just took off
5 #### I bought these shoes as a birthday present for my husband . He was a professional dancer in his youth . As you can imagine , when DWTS is on he is ' glued to the TV ' . He points out every professional dancer who wears CCTAS and gives me all the reasons CCTAS is the perfect dancing shoe . My husband is very difficult to get a response from when giving him a gift ... so , I decided to get him where his heart is :) Needless to say , I got quite a response when he opened the package . He immediately put the shoes on and starting ' striking a pose ' ! He danced all thru the house with the biggest smile I have ever seen . The best part of all is the expected delivery date was the 11th but they arrived on his birthday ... the 10th ! So , thank you for offering the best price on a fantastic shoe with fast delivery .
5 #### They are perfect . So comfortable . Did a lot of walking in these . Feet felt great . I will only wear Keen .
3 #### good quality - not tacky enough even after several washes .
3 #### My problem with this product : Have been unable , recently , to order the " cubes . " I get the tiny " sticks " instead . One whole package ( it 's a little box actually ) was an irritating pile of crumbs . They worked , but ... I ordered another brand and they are working much more conveniently . I will buy this again when I can get the cubes . Not sure about the packaging , maybe that 's why I got a box of crumbs . Shipping excellent .
5 #### These goggles were a gift for a boy who just learned to swim . Now he has a whole new world since he can open his eyes in the water . This was a big hit .
1 #### Which this listing did not include ! . I was so excited for this product , until I broke out in hives ! . Uncool !
2 #### The Rebel Crickhopper is a quality constructed and visually appealing lure , which is about as real looking as you could make a lure other than a tied fly . It is the size of a large grasshopper so in that regard it is more than could fit in the mouth of a smaller trout or bluegill . It probably would work best for largemouth bass . I can get trout and sunnies to follow it , but they never take it . I would not purchase again , but your experience may be better . When I hook my first fish on one of these , I 'll change my review . Like a lot of artificial baits , this one catches fishermen , not fish !
1 #### This rod is inexpensive , but not durable . It suffers from inherent weakness and has corrosion issues . Despite washing it after each saltwater trip and storing it inside , the guides corroded and two broke from corrosion early in its second season . The final nail in the coffin was when the rod snapped when pulling in a small ( less than 1 pound ) croaker . I am looking for better options to replace it .
5 #### The Saucony Jazz Vegan are super comfortable - great walking shoes . They are funky , retro - looking and fit true to size .
5 #### My granddaughter is learning to tell time and loves this watch ! She loves that it says " to " and " after " on the face . She kept getting confused with that but now the watch tells her which it is .
5 #### Wish they made them in beige , as my boss told me they were not to dress code .
5 #### Beautiful stockings , however they are more like tights . Great fit and comfortable .
5 #### Great goggles for me ! I 'm a small adult , but I do n't let my sons wear these . I just use them to swim a limited number of laps in our backyard pool . The water stays out and that 's all I care about ! I do n't have to redo my eye makeup when I use these ! :-)
5 #### So far , I love this release . It works and feels as good as any I have ever used . For the price , it ca n't be beat .
5 #### Chuck are Chucks , and these fight great . Size is spot on and they are comfortable and Chucks can be .
4 #### Screwed up my hip ! ... But I think that 's a defect in me . I would just say be careful when using and do n't go gung ho . They work ... but not the most comfortable things in the world . Then again hanging 180lbs upside down from the ceiling is n't comfortable ( for the person who is hanging ) . Other wise no complains . I 'd also recommend wearing boots while using !
5 #### Update : This is still my sons favorite thing ! He rides it daily . The battery lasts for several hours and charges overnight . I rode it also and it is a blast ! Got this for my son for Christmas . He loves it ! The battery lasts for quite awhile too . Very fun for a 9 year old !
5 #### Went pier fishing in Cedar Key , Florida and first time using one of these I caught a perfect ( i.e. keeping - size ) red drum aka redfish , about 23.5 " long and maybe 8 lbs . Despite a lot of resistance , I maintained tension on the line and the hook held , fish did n't toss it . Anecdotal evidence sure , but hey , either the fish gods were smiling up upon me that evening or this hook really does the job .
3 #### The length was a little long . It seemed quite longer that my other XL short sleeve shirts
4 #### I had an issue with the sheath sliding out of the clip early on . I used superglue to reattach the clip to the sheath only to find out that there is nothing between the actual clip and the blade ... so superglue got all over my blade . I just sanded it off as I do n't carry the knife for cosmetics , but be aware of this if you plan on fixing the clip issue . Just put the glue on the side away from the blade . The knife is sharp , easily concealed , and has helped me more than once .
4 #### My " normal " shoe size is 9.5 I ordered a converse 8.5 and fit perfectly !
4 #### Works fine . Wish someone made one that squeeked when you walked away from the cart so that you would n't leave the stupid thing behind .
1 #### I purchased this wheel from Amazon thinking I 'd be getting the highest quality ab roller available . What I got was a device that does not roll smoothly ; it sticks at several points in it 's rotation ( and lubricating it does not help ) . The wheel also possesses a few small rust spots . Since I order from Canada and pick up in the US returns are a massive hassle for me so I still have it and it sits useless in the corner while a cheaper ab wheel I had before gets used . Not recommended .
5 #### Great grill , performs well and it cooks food up super fast . I have to keep the dial on the lowest setting because its so strong .
5 #### It does everything that is advertised and does it well . My sister has one and I 've been eyeing it with envy for some time . I decided to buy one to supplement my refrigerator space when I have an overflow crowd at my lake home . It was especially handy over the Christmas holiday . When my large , extended family came together for holiday meals , we put hot food in my sister 's box that we had set up as warmer , and cold dishes went in my box that was set up as a cooler . All the food stayed at a perfect temperature until we were ready to put it on the table . I left it a my Mother 's house for a few days to hold all the overflow leftovers that would not fit in her frig . I also use it to carry food from back and forth for the 2 hour trip from my city home to my lake home . It is so nice not to have to deal with ice ! ! !
5 #### My 7yr old daughter just started soccer and we thought this would be great for her to learn . She is in love with this net . It does a great job rebounding the ball to her . My husband and I even use it and have n't had any problems with it . All the neighborhood kids love coming over to take turns using it . A must buy !
5 #### This is my second watch same model . Missed placed first one . Great watch , tough and reliable simple easy to read , and I have used the built in light many times to find key holes , light switches , toilet without turning on a bright lite .
5 #### I bought this for a float down a river and this was perfect . It stayed inflated , the oars worked well and did n't fall out during use , and it was pretty comfy . I 've only used it once so I ca n't say anything about longevity .
5 #### Great watch . I was needing a semi - dress watch and this one fit the bill . easy to read . It is a little loud with its click , but only to me . Meaning , others can not hear it .
2 #### This shirt is way off in the sizing . Bought a Large Tall and my husband usually wears a large but he is very tall so I was glad I could find a tall . This could fit 2 of him in it . The reason why I gave it 2 stars is the fabric is really thick and nice .
5 #### Has worked well on a carry - on bag that I use for work . I have not taken it in heavy rain but it 's definitely helped as I see the water bead on it . While I did not do a great job applying since I could see globs of spray , I did not have issues with a patchy final look . I did read the reviews of others and remembered to shake the can often . I did two coats and tried my best to keep the spray a fine mist . It 's just hard to judge when it will spray out a few big globs vs. a fine mist . My biggest issue was that there was a lite wind in my area and a jumping dog distracting me . Despite my failure to keep a fine mist at all times , so far , no discoloration on the black travel bag . It 's been in use 2 months , both outdoors and indoors . I let it vent outdoors for 2 days and even after this , there was a slight odor that took another day to fully go away . I do n't think it made the bag water proof but it has helped . I certainly did n't soak it at the seams or at the zippers .
5 #### This is a great high quality pair of shoes . The canvas is high quality and the stitching looks good . The inside of the shoes are also great . Buy chucks here for $ 20 ish less than at other places . Also make sure to buy a half or a full size smaller than what you normally wear . If you get these in the correct size you wo n't be dissapointed ! If you found this review helpful please make sure to hit the helpful button to help others see this too . Thanks !
5 #### These shoes are very comfortable , I love them and can wear all day , except they do provide some arch support . This is my 4th pair .
5 #### These boots are so comfortable I order them for my daughter and now I should order one for me .
4 #### These seem to be tighter than any other keen sandals I have purchased in the past ( 2 to date ) but are breaking in effectively and I anticipate the comfort level to be as good or better than the previous pairs .
5 #### We live on a busy part of a lake so our boat is constantly being rocked by waves . We replaced our standard ties with these and love the way the boat is being held in place . Wish they made them with hooks on one end for the Seadoos .
1 #### I definitely messed up on buying this . This device is NOT padded where it goes over the door frame , and therefore , it will dent or scratch the door frame with every pull - up . I bought it to take it with me overseas , and will not have time to return it . Instead , I have to tie around it two thick wool socks , so as not to damage my bedroom door . Since then , I have seen similar brands for this device that run for $ 18 at TJ Max or Big 5 and they seem to be better designed to protect your door frame . Avoid this brand .
4 #### Just a bit snug as new shoes tend to be .... will be just fine after a week or so .
5 #### This neck warmer makes you feel as if you were in bed with the covers pulled up on a cold winters night . Very warm and cozy .
4 #### I 've always owned a pair and picked these up because my previous pair was falling apart after many well - worn years . Comfortable , easy , and cool -- do n't expect anything less .
5 #### Just the best . Have these for years and continue to buy them .
5 #### My son loves this net . It seems to hold off pretty well and seems sturdy . and the sound is actually not annoying . I like it better than the original net .
4 #### have to wait on this one but looks worth the money .will hold enough backing and fly line to catch a Salmon
3 #### This was n't a good lure for me . The fish just looked at it .
5 #### Very cool shoes , decent price and a very quick shipper . what more could you ask for ?
5 #### Nice fit , looks like the picture . Delivered promptly , price was excellent . No issues at all would recommend to others . thanks
5 #### This watch is pretty enough to wear to work and has all the functions I need . Goes equally well for casual wear . Keeps time well and I can wear it in the shower . Very happy with it .
5 #### Love this shoes so comfy and great very everyday use . Runs big
5 #### This is my favorite shoe . They last long & look good only if they 're properly waterproofed . I 've worn this brand for years , so I know my size , and am comfortable with the arch feel . Great shoe .
2 #### I needed a woman 's 7 , so I ordered a mens size 5 as per instructions and it was huge . I returned them . I will try them out in the store next time before I order . Too confusing for this sizing .
5 #### Opened the package and used it for the first time . One shot one kill . The only bad thing is that I do n't have any more fly to kill !
2 #### Foil / metallic finish peeled off in 2 days . Now my kid has regular teal chucks . Stick with regular chucks , fancy finish does n't last ! ! !
4 #### The boots ran a little tight and small in the toe - box . Very nice boots though ! Easy - peezy returns- thank you !
5 #### I got these boots for my lil cousin and she loved them !
5 #### MUCH cheaper than similar nets at the big chain sporting good stores . Not overly huge , but that 's ok , our outdoor rink in our yard is small . Metal frame wo n't break in the cold . Durable netting wo n't fall apart in the snow / ice . Shelf on top for the ever - important Gatorade bottle . What more could you ask for ?
5 #### lovely colour , great fit as usual . Ca n't go wrong with Keen really , they are consistently excellent and consistent in fit too .
5 #### Who ever invented this is a genious . This is a great addition to my winter must have items . Easy to put on and keeps neck and face warm .
5 #### I broke my Rebel Bumble Bee after a year of fishing and ordered the hornet , they both fish all day ! bass love them and sun fish . I have many lures but this seem to be the go to for me . I did add a larger treble hook on the rear of my bumble bee because I was missing some hook sets , but have had good luck on the hornet so not sure I 'll put one on it .
5 #### love this wallet . It 's perfect . Now I have everything ( credit cards , cash , changes and checkbook all in one with plenty of pocket space .
3 #### I always get a half size up in my tennis shoes . For some reason these feel to big in the heel area and wide .
5 #### This was delicious as i backpacked chile - and was the perfect mix of sweet and hearty when i was craving a sweeter meal . just add hot water , stir , wait a few ( 3 ? ) minutes , and you 're ready to eat !
5 #### only place I was able to purchase size and colors I wanted
1 #### This is a cute little watch but the packing was .. well , there was n't any . Watch came loose from its plastic holder and was banging around inside the shipping box when I opened it . Needless to say watch did not function properly .
5 #### When I was a young lady ( am now 90 ) , Buxton was a very good name . It has n't changed today , in my estimation , and I am quite pleased with the wallet I purchased .
5 #### I love it so much ! They are my new baby 's I wear them all the time !
3 #### like the watch but why did they make the hands white on a white background ? Much too hard to read . Specially with these mid century eyes .
2 #### Shoe has a very rubbery bottom , which may be good for some , but not what I expected on a dress shoe . Leather has some imperfections that look like scratches . Would n't order again .
4 #### Kids loved them ! Held up great . Make sure to have life vest . :)
4 #### I like it a lot . Only complaints I have is that it can be a bit slippery when my palm become sweaty . Not easy to do downward - dog asana with slippery palm .
5 #### This is a great idea for kids . It 's especially fun since it glows in the dark . I bought it for my grandson , and he 's having a great time with it . The price was right , and the shipping was very fast !
5 #### Good buy shoes came a day later but i do n't mind if your patient like me . At first they were hard to put on because its a high top but you ll get used to it once you wear them more , i like these specifficaly because they 're old fashioned and simple and also because they match with anything you wear . Great product that i have bought before and still recommend them to anyone .
4 #### Glad to have a bag of balls ! Just as described bag of quality baseballs .
3 #### Good color . The reviews and charts are really confusing . I wear a size 20 pants and ordered the 5x/6x in city beige . They immediately ripped right at the crotch / thigh and I did n't even have them all the way up . I think the color was ok . But I m throwing them away and I did n't even get to wear them .
4 #### Yes , machined brass contains lead . No , this should not be a concern if you 're already dealing with guns and ammunition . High quality hammer , well finished handle . Gets -1 star for some tooling marks , but honestly it wo n't effect anything during use . Grace has just spoiled me with their other superb products .
4 #### Good fit , appears safe , and great price . The shell has come off for no reason , which required me to super glue it back , but no big deal
5 #### Gamakatsu always make a quality hook and it is very sharp . If your looking to fish for big fish in the 5 to 50 pound range , this is the hook to use .
2 #### Disappointing ... the stitching on the cuff of both sleeves came apart within weeks
5 #### Love this ! ! ! Great quality and even came with oats !
5 #### Best shoe I 've ever wore ! Came across in 2000 when my feet wore so sore from standing on concrete all day & diabetes neuropathy ! Took pain away within mins ! I HIGHLY recommend ! Brand ! This size in mens is highly recommended as well for a woman 's wide foot !
5 #### Purchased these shoes for work and am very pleased with them . The fit is great and they are very comfortable . My legs do n't ache or feel tired at the end of the day . Would definitely purchase another pair
4 #### Have used the Delorme Gazetteers for years . Needed this for Arizona as I plan to travel there .
4 #### Shoes feel great , just be sure to order a half size smaller than what you normally wear . The shoes run big , but once you find the right size , they fit great .
4 #### Good jacket but it does run large . I 'm a XXL usually and the jacket has A LOT of space .
5 #### It is hard to find Chuck Taylor shoes in half sizes in any store . I normally wear a men 's size 11 , but the 11s are too big and the 10s and just a touch too small . I went with the 10.5 and they are perfect . These are the real deal , classic Converse Chuck Taylor shoes .
3 #### It arrived with dents in the cover - I hope they come out by Christmas . Otherwise it will do what I want it to do for my grandson .
5 #### Fulfilled all my simplistic needs . Nylon velcro watch band , analog face , push - crown for Indiglo action and priced very affordably . Strong recommendation .
5 #### My husband loves these shoes . He has them in black too and they are super comfortable and stylish .
5 #### These were for a newborn baby gift . I 've always loved Cons and wanted to start the little guy out right . His parents loved them . Shipped on time .
5 #### These shorts are great for work , very durable ! The only complaint I have is the belt loops are really small and it 's hard to get my belt through them .
5 #### Put together really well and super easy to wash off dirt . Buy a second set so younger children can play without getting hurt by a hard puck . Sod ball is sturdy yet gentle . Even if they get really wild I doubt they d hurt one another with the soft padded sticks . Lightweight for travel in an RV so perfect for camping trips when it rains and grandchildren are stuck inside . ( That can be a nightmare without good active play toys ) . I do n't see any sharp pointed areas etc . Encourage a love of hockey at a young age .
5 #### I love them . They make me feel like I 'm 10 again . The only problem is the backs keep flopping over , but I 'm getting use to it . I 'm no longer 10 .
4 #### I am pleased with these shoes , very comfortable and easy to wear
5 #### I loved this nursing dress so well , I ordered 2 more . It fit as expected . It 's soft and although I have n't washed them very much yet they seem to wash well .
5 #### This is just what I was looking for . I do wish it was available in other colors , plum or black . But it 's delicate and fits well , for an inner layer .
5 #### Love this wallet - although I would probably just buy a separate card holder rather than the tri - fold next time as the wallet gets kind of fat . Well constructed and looks nice and neat . Typical Buxton quality .
3 #### Great shoes but they run a half size large . I m a womens 7.5 and I ended up giving those to a friend and ordering the size 7 , which fit my 7.5 feet absolutely perfect . Not much arch support but my orthotic fits inside .
5 #### I love this product . I lost one years ago in a move , so I bought two . light weight , good seal and latch . great for keys , license , money etc .... while boating and fishing .
5 #### its a benchmade do i need to say more ? came sealed in factory box
5 #### It 's a gift for my niece , who loves converse sneakers . I know the fit will be perfect since it 's the size of all her other colors .
5 #### This product was delivered fast . The band width is too large for my tiny wrists though but it can be adjusted . Apart from that , it is a nice looking with Indigo .
5 #### This mat is thick and perfect for anyone with injuries . It 's made well and there is nothing cheap about the workmanship . The mat does NOT smell like chemicals or rubber . I use this on a hardwood floor and do n't feel the floor . I do stretching exercises and light / beginning yoga on this mat without pain from the hardwood and would purchase again without hesitation .
4 #### Made for a slim or Norrow foot . These shoes do not bend like a flip flop . M size is for 8 - 9 women 's shoe . Do not get these wet . I bought the Japanese socks , so it would not hurt my feet later . There is a small plastic tub like , in between toe area .
5 #### These have kept me warm , dry and comfortable down to zero degrees f. blowing / shoveling snow . Not sure about periods of time over an hour or so , but they have been excellent in my use .
5 #### Made it work but do n't think it was the right fit for mountain bike . the space given was n't quite right but we made it work and it does the trick !
4 #### Product is waterproof . I tested in the sink with a piece or napkin in it . Passed with flying colors ! Fits a few cards with room for money . Aesthetics could be improved , but you get what you pay for . I 'm not complaining .
5 #### I bought this for motorcycle rides and it works great . I wear a full face helmet . The warmer tucks up under the bottom of the helmet and blocks the cold air . I would highly recommend . In addition I just got back from a ride up to 7000 ft with snow on the road . This was comfortable and warm .
3 #### Great but while working out they start slipping off you ankles no matter how tight you put them on
5 #### Compared to the absolute junk most cleaning rods are , this one gets a 5 . If you can afford a Tipton or a Dewey , by all means get it . Otherwise this one will do .
5 #### I had three pairs of these as a teenager . Bought them for my daughter ( at her request ! ) . They fit perfectly . Chucks are a classic that will always come back around each generation .
4 #### It 's a nice quality shirt . I use it for running and so far it has n't fallen apart . Purchased Dec 2012
3 #### I wanted to order a replacement just like I had in the past . The photo and description did n't match the colors of the mat at all . Not even close . It 's not worth it to return it , but I 'm not real happy with it .
1 #### These were waaaay to big - my son ca n't wear them . Very disappointed .
5 #### I like using this on my jewelry . Need to use pretty regularly but is fast and easy to use .
5 #### I have really bad arthritis in both knees and both hips and at times ( like walking on grass ) I really need to make sure I plant my fee correctly . I have to distribute my weight carefully so as not to fall or " tweak " one of my knees . Many sneakers do not " give " and you literally have to step the way the stiff shoes / insoles dictate ! Enter Converse Hi - tops ! I " LOVE " them ! The soles and instep are very pliable and I no longer have to worry about not being able to plant my feet the way I want . I now own 9 pairs in various colors and I purchased the black ones to complete my color choices . :)
5 #### We bought this as a backup ball for the F50 to keep at our cabin , but my son likes it more than the F50 . Great ball for the price .
5 #### Arrived today . And I love it ! I usually wear 7.5 size so got me size 5 in men ( 7woman ) just fits perfect
5 #### Fit as expected and true to the color as shown in the picture .
4 #### A little tough to put on but once it is on it is very secure . They supply you 4 different sizes . The one that fit my gun happened to have the red sight in it . I easily swapped it out for a green one . It makes it much easier to pick up that front sight but it did n't make a sharp shooter out of me on the trap line .
2 #### Too small , & too short . They do n't stay up either , very disappointed .
4 #### These are really nice work shirts . I would have gave them 5 stars but they are a little pricey for a work shirt . They are good quality though .
3 #### Bought a couple of these to have out on hunts with my kids , but after opening them and testing , the pitch is all wrong . Sounds more like a spastic duck than a squirrel ! ! I will give them a try , but I am thinking I would be better off making my own and using the billows off these . If I had n't already opened one and lost the packaging , I would return both . Return policy wo n't allow me to just return one of them .
5 #### Bought for my 23 yr . old son . He 's worn Chuck Taylor 's for several years and loves them .
5 #### These are hit & miss in the stores , so can buy in bulk on Amazon & keep them in good supply . They last all day & are great for travelling also .
4 #### Classic shoe , but does n't feel the same as the ones I had growing up .
5 #### seems to have a lot of storage space , and everything is durrable enough for outdoors use . seems like it will last a long time
3 #### Ok when you get the hang of it also does not float .
5 #### These are perfectly comfortable , I have had these boots before , so I knew I could not go wrong and the price was within my budget . I wear a ladies 5.5 - 6 and the 4.5 big kids fit great !
5 #### I 've been using this mat for 4.5 months now and completely love it , it has changed my yoga practice . I read a lot of reviews before ordering , so I was concerned about the negative reviews saying it is slippery and heavy . I use this mat for both regular and heated classes . When dry it is very sticky . Yes , it becomes slippery in hot yoga when I start sweating , but then I roll out a towel and problem solved . I originally ordered the standard length mat but found it was too small for me ( I 'm 5'11 " ) . I returned it and ordered the longer size and am very glad that I did . The longer mat weighs just about 10 lbs and is much heavier than my previous mats , but I really like the weight and thickness . It 's a serious mat . It does n't absorb sweat so it 's much easier to keep clean than my former sponge - like mats . I like to roll it out and wipe down both sides after practice to keep it fresh and aired out . I use a mixture of soap and essential oils like tea tree or eucalyptus to sanitize and deodorize . I 'm surprised this mat has negative reviews . For me it 's been perfect .
5 #### the boots fit very very well and look so smart with a low price , i'm very glad to buy this item
5 #### This cute watch and nice price . I was buy this product many time . This is just very nice gift all kids i bought it for them . Thay just love it and i still continue to buy it for them everytime when i go to Thailand .
5 #### Works ! Smells strong but not offensive and even asthma / allergies are not irritated by the scent . I would n't wear and then walk in to a building , like stopping for dinner on the way home may not be an option but at least you wo n't smell as bad as the smokers .... or those people who think their dog is allowed everywhere .... it is a dog , it smells and it does not need to be a in a store or restaurant , that is just gross ... it may be a your friend but it 's still an animal - not a person . This seems to work well for everything except horse flies , they do n't bite but fly around and are annoying . I am not sure about ticks , but we did n't get any one us , so I assume it repels them . Also , it clearly works better when applied every 2 hours , around 3 - 4 hours it seems to not be effective for us .
4 #### I 've worn these shoes for years , multiple colors and multiple sizes . Amazon 's the best place to buy them , thanks to free 2 - day shipping for Prime members . The shoes are comfortable , what else can I say ? I get about 8 months ' use per pair , wearing them all day , every day .
4 #### Got these as a gift for my niece . She loved them .
5 #### This is my most comfortable bra and I keep meaning to buy more of it . Bali makes a great bra .
5 #### I ordered this from Reiss Innovations , LLC and received a genuine Doan product , just as I 'd expected . Doan is the company that makes the military firestarters , so quality is top notch . Beware of cheaper imported products that may or may not be of similar quality . If you want the original Doan product , Reiss Innovations is one place to get it . Free shipping through Amazon is available as well from Reiss , at least as of this point in time .
5 #### This is a replacement . Exactly what I was looking for .
5 #### These pants are the best workwear I can find , period . I work as a machinist , welder , and fabricator and nothing else seems to hold up very well . The double front ( second layer of fabric covering the entire front of the pants from waistband to mid - calf ) significantly increases the durability . I also like the leg side pockets , which I use to hold pens , pencils , scribers , and a 6 ' folding rule . They work alot better than a shirt pocket because things do n't fall out when I bend over . The sizing is generous where it counts , particularly in the lower leg ( fits great over tall boots ) . I will continue to buy Carhartt clothing exclusively .
4 #### Cool little cooler . No pun intended . I give it 4/5 stars ( and not 5/5 stars ) because it 's relatively expensive compared with others of similar interior volume . But I 'd say it 's the nicest cooler I 've bought in years . It 's American - made . The wheels seem sturdy - enough ( you wo n't be rolling over gravel with much ease , but it 'll roll on carpet , asphalt , concrete , and packed dirt ) and they have a slight tackiness to them ( they are not rubber , but they have a coating that aids in traction ) . The extendable handle locks in ( or out of ) place , which is very nice . I really like the white color . And my favorite feature is the hinged lid ( it actually has a mechanical hinge designed - in , rather than two pieces of thin plastic that are constantly being folded-- like on many coolers ) .
5 #### How can you go wrong with a pair of classic black Chuck Taylor 's . Just keep in mind that the shoe sizes run BIGGER . I wear and 11 and ordered a pair of 11s . A whole size to big for me . I do n't mind returning , but just keep that in mind .
5 #### I do like the back of the head support of this thing . Its fairly streamlined so it wo n't be cutting down on your aerodynamics .
5 #### My husband actually ordered this pad for his rifle . He says it is great ! It is very comfortable and it is so much better than the one that came with the rifle .
5 #### Simply helmet - just what I needed for doing some biking around my city without fear of getting my head smooshed .
4 #### I 've worn these to work out for 5 days in a row now . Initially , my arches ached but over time the discomfort subsided entirely . I 've done everything from bootcamps , resistance training , running and Zumba . So yeah .. , they are truly crosstrainers ;-)
1 #### deception is written that a lot of cotton and it is very little one synthetics . Instead of the declared 65 percent of 35 percent . unpleasant for such deception
5 #### Good for working those muscles when you ca n't get out to the gym . Bought for my sister who is primarily home bound and in a wheel chair so she can so some muscle strengthening workouts .
5 #### Wranglers are quality jeans and these did n't disappoint . My husband loves them !
5 #### I was thrilled when I found this wallet on Amazon . It is identical to the one I carried for years . It is made well . It fits nicely in my purse , has a lot of storage space , and the change area is big enough to get my fingers into it . It comes in 16 colors . I guess I 'm boring because I ended up ordering it in the same Mahogany color that I had before . It is very attractive . To me it 's a no brainer . If it works , stick with it ! I know it will hold up for many years . I definitely recommend this wallet .
5 #### Love love love SmartWool socks ! I 'll buy them as long as they make them because they really keep my feet warm above all others . My feet do n't sweat either which is vital in keeping your feet warm .
5 #### This was a gift to my husband and he really loves it . It 's stylish yet outdoorsy which is appropriate for him since he is an outdoors guy .
2 #### I so far am impressed to the quality of this mattress , it is more heavy than I thought it would be and more durable , was thinking it would be more of a floatation device type mattress but I was wrong it is much more durable than that . It takes about 15 to 20 minuets to blow up by mouth with rest in between breaths . next time I blow up i will count the # of breaths it takes . Edited review : after using 4 times in more that ideal conditions it sprang a unfixable leak .
2 #### it was to heavy and baggy for me but it was made well I m 5/11 and 190
1 #### got mens 9 needed womans 9 now stuck with these for months ugh !
5 #### Converse are always amazing ! I use them as canvasses for my artwork !
5 #### I thought the color would be a bit brighter but they ended up being a perfect pink .
4 #### I have used around 20 of these on our outdoor range . I have attached them to insulation board to keep them flat ( 3 m spray glue ) and they work great outside ... even in 5 - 10 mile winds . I will order more when I get low . My wife and I have improved our aim with these targets . The paper is of good quality for target shooting ( .40 cal and .22 cal ) . The " kill shots " are hard to see but that helps with shot placement . Will buy again .
5 #### Like butter ! Comfy right out the box ! More please ! I think they come in a ga - jillion colors ! I am a happy girl .
1 #### When i ordered these , I ordered based on the photo shown.a simple black shoe . What I received was a black shoe with multi colors on the toe . I screen shot the ones I thought I was getting . Definitely not what I received . Returning these asap .
5 #### Great product for what it is . Would purchase again also recommend to others great to have in hunting pack or Go - Bag .
5 #### These things are great ! We have 5 of them , abused almost daily , all are going strong . Ca n't beat them . Wheels go out first , there are good replacement wheels on Amazon . Folds down small , light , easy to store , hours of outdoor fun for the kids . EXCELLENT
4 #### Great socks but I imagine anyone with a wider calf would find them to be too tight . Also , if you wear full length boots ( e.g. Sorel 1964s ) the socks are a little too short .
5 #### Easy to install . Works great ! It 's been up all winter and no rust so far . Highly recommended for outdoor rims .
5 #### My husband and I have both been using these cords for about a month . We both love them as they are so easy to use and you can bring them anywhere . He did a workout at a trailhead the other day . We have purchased a couple of videos to learn more exercises . There are very good but basic ones described in the enclosed booklet to get you started . They look well made , but I think you should inspect them periodically to make sure your shoes have n't damaged them during workouts . We camp a lot during the summer and these will definately go along on every trip . You can do stretching , strength training and use them in an aerobic routine and feel them working . Ca n't go wrong with these !
1 #### I specifically ordered Size 15 Mens , 2E Width . What I got was Size 15 Mens , D Width . I would be fine if they gave me a smaller length size , but the width is what counts , and they screwed that up . I am highly interested in a FREE Replacement , or if none are available , then at least a refund . I would highly recommend buying something else since these boots are unworthy of purchase .
1 #### not at all worth the price . i could have found something of this material and quality at wallmart for a fraction of the price
5 #### I purchased a set of these after much research . The " broiler " style pan and grate are excellent and the quality unsurpassed . Amazon has the best price for these to replace the " tin " trays that come with your toaster oven . These are heavy weight and deep enough for a roast or other larger items . I use mine in a Black & Decker single grate oven and they work perfectly . I was AMAZED when I made some nachos in the pan , the cheese dripped and burned onto the bottom of the pan and NOTHING STICKS ! Great value , great quality , and you wo n't be disappointed .
4 #### Great fit a little light on the material side , hope it lasts .
5 #### Carhartt Men 's Double Front Work Dungaree Pant B01 , Brown , 38 x 34 best pair i ever owned will buy again
5 #### Great shoe ! Outside arch is kind of high , but I 'm still breaking them in . So I 'm sure that will work it 's way out . I originally ordered a 9 , my regular size , and it was a tad too big . Returned and ordered an 8.5 and it fits perfect !
5 #### My regular gun cleaning kit is the size of a foot locker and too bulky to take on trips in a small car . So I wanted something more transportable . This is a nice kit , it 's got everything the average shooter would need with multiple calibers . There 's even a couple spots inside for other things . One holds Hoppes # 9 quite well but I ca n't get the bottle of gun oil to fit in it . Still I would recommend this for home or travel .
5 #### I ordered these for my Mother . She has been wearing this brand for years . They are prefect for her !
5 #### Great for the money . If you want to start camping with the family on the cheap , load up on these . We bought on speacial to get units for my wife and two kids 7 + 9 . Works well in NC with days in the 60 - 70 and nights in the low 40s . The mummy style can help hold in heat well or open up to be a simple cover in warmer weather . Do n't think I would use for low 20s or worse but that 's not a good idea with the wife and kids anyways .
5 #### Well , I had this bra before I ordered it from here . For larger breast it 's a perfect fit . It has 4 or 5 hooks on the back , the straps are n't so narrow . It 's very comfortable and pretty .
5 #### This works perfect . Only wished I would have gotten one of these a long time ago . Will be ordering more .
5 #### Bought it as emergency stove for hurricane season . Have assembled and tested it , works fine out the box , hope I never have to use it .
5 #### works fine for me . I am out of shape and not strong
5 #### Very satisfied with the shopping , although the shoes a little larger , but not affect the wear , the style is very good - looking , and jeans is build , buy such products in this price , I am very satisfied .
3 #### These are probably great sandals if you understand there purpose . I wore them walking in Yosemite , only one day . I was pulling rocks out of my sandals all day . Even walking through water , the rocks got under my foot . I will continue wearing them to water aerobics but do not see any use for the otherwise . Keen is a great product , just the style of shoe had no purpose for me .
5 #### Brought these for my daughter she loves them he wears them just about everyday . Looks like I will be buying another pair soon
5 #### Grace USA makes some great stuff . I sent them an email asking about the naming conventions on their screw drivers , and received a personal answer back from the president after hours . As it turns out , he did n't know either - it was some internal numbers they had been using forever . I 'm very happy with this brass hammer - it is well made and does the job well .
5 #### I love these shoes for what they are and of course know to order a size down , but they are almost purely for looks . And for that , they earn 5 stars . These are my second pair and I it appears that the build might vary slightly from different sweatshops . These came from India and are of higher quality than the previous ones I bought ( which were fabricated in Indonesia ) .
5 #### GREAT set of park shoes ! I can already tell these will stand the test of time and not breakdown like a lot of shoes do . My little boy is a climber , jumper , runner through mud and puddles etc .
5 #### Beautiful mens shoe . I ordered these for my husband as an everyday I love you gift and they went over very well ! He loves them and has pretty much worn them daily since . They are a beautiful rich brown color that go great with everything . He says they are comfortable and likes the style . I like the three hole lace for him better that the other styles that only have two because he wears a size 11 it really helps break up the long look of the shoe . Some of them just look silly in the front and make a mens foot look like a long bill . These are much younger looking than the original style , but are still classy ! Great purchase and I know he will have them for a very long time .
5 #### I bought this to give my shoes a little more grip . It works exactly as I hoped it would .
1 #### I just received a second watch . First one did n't work . This one does n't work either . How frustrating and what a waste of time . I was really looking forward to giving this to my daughter ! ( 4 days ago ) !
5 #### I find the Berkshire Plus - Size pantyhose to be the best on the market . I have been wearing them for years and have not found any other brand to be as comfortable or durable . For everyday wear , I particularly like style # 4489 , which has a reinforced toe and a control top . The control top is functional , but not uncomfortable . The extra panel in the panty is what makes the fit so comfortable . I do find that I need to purchase a size larger than what the chart says I need , so I think that they run a little small . Interestingly , when I buy the ultra - sheer style # 4411 , those I find fit true to size , and I buy the size the package recommends based on my height and weight .
1 #### Packing this back up to return it , we have tried now for almost 2 hours to get this thing open . It 's proved far more frustrating than it 's worth . Smells good , and if I bought it to use an an air freshener , then this would be a different review . As far as a shoe valet - it is unusable . I was unsure after seeing it was made in China but was hopeful . I 'm guessing these are produced too quickly to pay a lot attention to detail - I should have thought that through a little more carefully . I 'll hit the local auctions and find one that is older and American made .
2 #### Very Expensive and non functional in the daylight at over 10 yards . Perhaps the green works better , but I shall not take the chance with another $ 300 .
3 #### It was a little large , but it still looks good in general . Pretty flattering on a post - pregnancy body even when it is slightly large .
4 #### Barely There is for brown - skinned women . They look like nothing 's there on me . I 'm African American and have bought them in Target - this shade has a black woman on the package ( at least the ones they sell to Target do ) . Too bad there 's no indication on the site to tell people that beforehand . Hope this helps someone .
2 #### I purchased my first pair of white Converse 2 years ago & they have always been my favorite shoes . I 've worn them so much that it was time to get another pair ! However , I am not sure that these white Converse are the same ... they feel really big and bulky and the rubber toe piece looks shorter . The canvas material is also much stiffer and scratchy . I am worried that these are knock - off in some way and may be returning .
4 #### Stayed at a KOA just to give these a test run . They started our fire just fine though conditions were prime . We 'll be seeing how they work in less than prime conditions soon .
5 #### great caps if you do n't mind your hair getting wet when you swim ..... I only want to keep the hair out of my face while I swim .
5 #### My sons love Sperry 's . Shoes are excellent quality and stand up to daily wear . Just please , please , please , for the love of God do n't wear them without socks ! Ever ....
5 #### Love it . Absent the pliers , this tool rivals my leatherman sidekick and much less than half the weight . I chose this one in particular because it has tools I will use . A corkscrew is pretty much useless to me but , a phillips screwdriver is probably most used . A good saw blade is very useful . Aside from trips to the woods , I have n't broken the habit of reaching for the leatherman or knife I carry . Perhaps in time I 'll get tired of the extra weight . Victorinox seems to have a style for everyone .
5 #### Very bright red and they worked well for my cosplay . They were a little big , but that also might be my own error in ordering .
5 #### Great shoes . Bought for 9 year old daughter and she loves them . Fit a bit big but all converse normal do .
4 #### These resistance bands work well , come in a handy carry bag , and have well built attachments . Good Purchase .
5 #### While I usually scoff at the gymnasts / dancers who do floor routines for competitions but you ca n't deny that playing with one is tons of fun ! I got one for my niece and she loved it !
5 #### I have worn Timex almost since they first came on the market . I like the appearance of this one as it is more distincrive than the white face . In the past I have twice had no luck with the date / day features but this one is working fine .
5 #### Targets are just as described and better in person . They are better , in my opinion , then the standard silhouette type . These are more realistic , while still have a faint view of the vital organs from within ! They came neat and quick , with no folds . Each target is real to size and hangs completely flat and ready to take fire . I highly recommend this target and seller .
4 #### I love wearing it around the house and lounging . It 's definitely very feminine and well made . Comfortable and well made .
4 #### Fortunately Have not tested it , but seem like a good helmet . The top part came off ... ( the plasticy thing ) ... Bad glueing I guess ... but I think after a year . I still use it anyway .
1 #### Grill has one major flaw . while the value to turn it on rotates a full 360 degrees , the stove goers from off to full power on about the first 5 degrees . making it very hard to do any actual cooking . I do n't own this stove , been using it on a 10 day camping trip through Alaska and rented it . I would not but one because of this . You need to be able to cook real food car camping not just boil water .
5 #### it was a gift for grandson and he is very happy . Size of costume ran smaller than what a 4 - 6X usually does .
1 #### Not so rugged . Seam came partly unseen in rear . I was surprised . I always thought Wrangler was less fashionable , but more sturdy . Brett Farve commercial , I guess . Fit is good .
5 #### Best shoe ever . Our son can not take them off on his own . The black shoe is great for any occasion .
5 #### Good quality . Could n't be without one now . Fishing , Golfing and just relaxing --- it 's handy
5 #### Thank goodness . My husband wo n't wear anything else ! These shoes hold up really well and look good after washing over and over .
5 #### The M16 - A4 is n't too bad for a spring action my Friend and family love this gun for some reason very powerful it shoot up to 290 with .12 an a good 240fps with .20 I guess I 'll be pick up one more .... But I 'm going too pay my phone bill first
3 #### the material is very thick and heavy for a short
5 #### Have worn the Bali Skimp Scamp Brief for a long time and happy to be able to purchase them through Amazon as the stores usually do n't have what I 'm looking for .
4 #### I have worn these bras for over 10 years . They have the best fit of any I have tried .
4 #### This is a great tee for the money , fabric is heavy and the shirt is well constructed . For me the shirt is a bit long , sizing seemed a bit smaller than I would prefer .
1 #### I thought this was advertised with the utensils . I did n't get them . This is what I had as a Boy Scout 45 years ago . There 's better on the market now .
2 #### Was not specific on sizing . They were too large . The shipping was more expensive to send them back
4 #### The uppers are some weird type of material , not sure if it is real leather or not . Very comfortable .
5 #### I love these and have them in a light blue too . Very light weight , airy , and comfortable .
4 #### Awesome just what I was looking for since I ride a bicycle year round .
5 #### Installation was a snap , and the specifications are a bit optimistic if you think you 're going to fit that many skis in here , but as long as you do n't try to reach the max limit , then these work great !
5 #### Delete that market review , Sorry , was writing under wrong product . Arrived on time . Packaged nicely . Fit as expected . Color was just as seen on my screen at least .
5 #### Got these on a deal of the day for $ 13 each . Bought a few since I 've never owned Wrangler 's before . Glad I did . Nice fit and finish . Fit like most other jeans today . Not too tight or too loose . Sizing is accurate . Perfect for any kind of country western event or real work out on the range .
4 #### comfy shorts for running , working out , lounging . my only complaint is the pockets stick out and make them seem ever so slightly dumpy .
1 #### The " hat " ears would maybe have fit an infant . I ordered a 3 T and it fit , but barely . The ears did n't fit at all .
1 #### Works intermittently . Not what I 've come to expect of Timex .
4 #### Took 5 mins to install . Works fine , only once in a while it snaps back and requires another yank before it will stand properly .
1 #### Way too small . This is not a proper women 's sized watch .
4 #### The band was fine .. cup too small but still works
5 #### I ordered the Charcoal color in the Large size . I liked the choice of colors ; the Charcoal is a nice contemporary color . The Large fits my size 10 foot great . The socks are thicker and more snug than most every day type socks but still comfortable . I recommend these for everyday use with boots in cold weather .
5 #### I 've been wearing this brand since the late sixties , so they were perfect as usual . I especially love this brand because they do n't run .
1 #### Hard as a rock after just a few min . of sitting waiting for opportunity on Black Bear .
2 #### I 'm not sure I was shipped the correct style . The ones I received are a lot clunkier than I expected , although the quality is fine .
5 #### This is THE item to have if you spend time in a wilderness situation . A carbon steel sparker should be with it . I like " gardening " knives . A tough no non sense design . A large heavy gauge trash bag helps a lot too ! A filter straw , a bottle and some iodine for safe water . Wear sturdy clothes , boots and a field jacket . Have a hat of some kind . The point is with a few well chosen things you can increase your chances of living ... June 7 2012 Edit : Not all steel spark makers will work with this . My Mauser Swiss army knife does as does a Folding Saw that I have . Alas the Mora Robust Knife does not spark ! Bummer ! Test this device before you commit to it ! The object here is to create a SMALL Match like fire that ignites your main fire . SMALL amounts of tender with the SMALL amounts of Magnesium and shower of sparks does the trick !
1 #### I do not recommend this item .... this item is not good to deal with any long - term operating in the cold extreme cold weather does not keep hands warm how do you several of them at one time
4 #### Loved the way these used to feel -- they changed the material to a thinner material . Still not bad , but I prefer the way it used to be .
4 #### The quality it 's GREAAAAT but it 's a little too tight .. before purchasing , I took a look at the reviews .. Many people said " order a size up " and I did n't so they are sort of small ( lol ) . The thing is , order a size up if you want them to fit you perfect ! Example : you 're a 9 ( girls size ) order a 9 1/2 .
5 #### I have enjoyed this slingshot . It is high quality and works very well . My grand kids and me enjoy shooting with them .
5 #### Love it . It is very difficult to find a wallet that accommodates checks and checkbook that is not huge . This one accommodates all my notes , appointment cards , etc . checks and checkbook in one nice looking wallet . I like the two sides that makes it easier to find things .
4 #### women size 9 fit as expected . I was just looking for a different color green
5 #### I use these for my heavy squats and deadlifts . Love it !
3 #### The inside of this wallet is man made materials . Not all leather as advertised .
5 #### Bought this tent for our grandson and it 's the first gift that he wanted to play with Christmas Eve . Very easy to set up and roomy inside accommodating two adults and a child . It is also easy to attach to the bed and has many mesh windows to look out of .
5 #### I bought the home version about 2 months ago to improve my balance . I have had no problems with the Bosu itself . I use it about three or four days a week for approximately 15 - 20 , maybe up to 25 , minutes a shot . Feels longer and , trust me , it feels like a long time . The Bosu has considerably aided in improving my balance with the exercises I was given ( not in the booklet , have n't looked on the DVD ) . This is obvious not only from my exercise progression but from my bike handling on descents . Not much else to say other than I plan on continuing using it and hope to have my range of exercises extended . ---------------------------- Know who Nerlens Noel is ? He 's the most commonly projected # 1 pick in the upcoming 2013 NBA draft . He 's currently rehabbing from a torn ACL . I came across a picture of him during his rehab and guess what he 's using . Right , a Bosu . Standing one - legged , flat side up , in the center of a room . I do this too , only I place myself in a hallway .
4 #### I usually wear a 9 to 9.5 . I ordered a 9.5 and they are too small . I will exchanging them for a larger size .
2 #### As with the other reviews the cup size is way off . Mine were too big . No time to exchange . Disappointed .
3 #### Does its job , but can easily crush a cigar over time .
5 #### Wore these for the first time hiking the bluffs . Not the best traction on well worn rocks , but super comfy . No blisters , no achilles pain like with other shoes . Will continue to purchase Nike shoes , because my feet love them for all activities ! ( except my home workouts , they drag pretty hard on the carpet )
5 #### My husband loves these sandals . Fit perfectly - very comfortable ! This is his third pair ! Very durable ! !
2 #### Love the shoes but they are way too big and I 'm not having any luck exchanging them at this point .... or even returning them ... maybe this will be resolved , I hope so .
5 #### Very pleased with this watch . The strap was thinner acrossed than it appeared in the picture which made me love it more . Very dainty !
5 #### These are easy to fit and stick on your face . I have used these in one race and they worked great . So far so good .
5 #### Forget propane . In a real world long term crisis or emergency , propane will quickly be hard to come by . This stove uses Coleman Premium Fuel OR regular unleaded gasoline . Those supplies will last much longer . This thing will boil water in a flash or let you cook anything from stew to heavy game entrees . Rugged , compact and wind proof - I strongly recommend this product for your emergency preparedness supplies .
2 #### The only reason I gave it two stars is that it 's cheap and magnesium is probably fun to play with . The description says Government issue ? I hope not for survival . I teach survival and know that a match or lighter has everything built in and takes seconds to get a flame , this takes minutes . Water proof matches weigh far less and work better in the wind , in fact nearly ever fire lighter weighs less . It is also tricky to get the pile to stay put while you strike , striking properly is a skill you need to learn especially in a cold wet environment . I am a fan of something that takes minimal effort and can preferably be used with one hand ( I use the mini bic lighter or waterproof liquid fuel lighter ) . The magnesium takes effort to shave , it also takes allot out of your knife , add the fact that you may be shivering makes it harder . When you do strike and the magnesium catches , it burns really fast so you still need kindling and small sticks , so no real gain there . Fire steel is fun to play with and use if you have a cabin with a gas or alcohol stove , it will last long and is reliable , but I would not suggest it , not if survival is at stake .
4 #### I really like the size and style of this watch . I have had a number of them , they hold up well , are comfortable to wear and dependable .
4 #### It 's a pretty nice net and fairly easy to put together ; however , the ad has false advertisement because the " silver " one is actually not silver ; it has a white frame . The white paint will invariably chip off ( especially where the tubes slide together ) and my concern is that it will rust easily , whereas the silver one would likely have been galvanized or aluminum or something that would n't rust . We 'll see .
5 #### Love the color . Great wallet . Ca n't always find in store .
5 #### Great cigar holder . It fits on the golf cart roof support and easily holds the thickest or thinnest cigars . I 've used it many times and it has n't fallen off yet . My biggest problem is remembering to take it with me when the round is over .
5 #### It is well made , very light , comfortable and has plenty of vents and sun visor . Also it is adjustable , so it fit perfectly .
5 #### Call me strange but I have n't even worn them yet . I did try them on and they fit perfectly ! ! ! When we were kids , there were 2 Main brands , Converse and Pro Keds . There kicks bring back some ........ memories ! ! ! ! I do n't want them to get dirty , not yet anyway .
5 #### If you wear Nike on the regular , then you should pretty much know your size . I wear only 7 's in Nike , and it fit just as expected . I have many of the trail runner generations , and love them all . they 're my go to sneakers for the gym use , or casual wear . I have a pair I used mostly for casual wear that have lasted about 5 years . Another pair that I used for cross fit / outdoor runs that lasted a little over a year ( very vigorous daily use ) . All in all , these shoes are great for me . They 're lightweight , and comfortable .
4 #### It is 2 " too long for a 16 " kids bike . I cut it down and just epoxied the stopper back on . Still giving 3 stars because it really is well made and priced extremely competitively .
3 #### These are great comfortable shoes ... However we bought them 3/28/16 and they are already falling apart . :( The product listing states " will last for years to come " . We have bought these before and got years out of them ... Not these ones however .
3 #### Nice shorts , 13 inch inseam too long . Replaced by Amazon with the 11 inch seam , fit perfectly ! Great shorts for bartenders .
5 #### As with any of the converse shoes I have ever worn these are a great fit and I have lots of others wishing they were wearing the great Chuck Taylor converse shoes !
1 #### ... noticed 2 months and 2 days after delivery date is stuck on ' 22' ... will not advance manually ( cycling through hour by hour , stem all the way out ) or via date function ( stem out to first stop); ... watch not worn every day ... watch not dropped ... updated 20mar17 : unfortunately , the return period has expired , and , according to the warranty , i am expected to pay postage to and from timex , which would most likely equal or exceed 25 % of what was paid for the item ... not so sure i wish to spend that much in excess of original cost ...
5 #### Bought them for my daughter 's FLO costume , but she loves to wear them to school now . Nice call on that one !
5 #### Baseballs cost more than any of us would like , right ? But having a few dozen balls makes it a lot more fun to play , even if I 'm just out with my kids . After buying Rawlings synthetic balls , the ( excellent ) MaGregor 79 leather balls , and a few others , THESE are the pick of the litter . The leather is just right , and has worn well . Synthetic balls wear really nasty . There were a couple balls in my bucket that had little spots of raised leather that were enough to notice . I looked at a brand new bucket of leather Rawlings balls today and almost all of the balls were this way -- and they were n't sold as blemished . The bucket is nice enough . If you can get the balls cheaper without the bucket I 'd do that , but it 's nice to have .
5 #### We have been buying this shoe for years . It comes in a size 14 . ~hard to find~. It is well made , comfortable and looks nice .
5 #### This whistle is very loud , every hiker and kayaker should have one for safety reasons . If lost or in trouble a good whistle is worth it 's weight in gold !
5 #### This belt is almost identical to the one I received during deployment issue at Fort Drum . It is a few inches shorter and has an elastic strip in which to hold the excess close to the waist . These are sturdy belts , probably the same material used in ratchet straps . My original is 5 years old and other than being stained from deployments shows no signs of breaking or fraying of any kind . Great work belt . There are no notches ; it is a slide buckle . The length is 44 " so should fit a waist of around 40 " with some excess . This belt was out - of - stock when my order was filled . The company found a belt and shipped my entire order to me promptly , instead of the additional 9 days it might have taken for them to get another belt . Great service .
4 #### I sent this to my son at college . He plays ton of soccer so he has seen many soccer balls since age 5 . His review , " This soccer ball seems very cheap . I would advise buying this ball for a young child or someone who is not fully committed to the sport . This ball seems as if it will lose air often and could perhaps burst . This is not a high quality product but a great buy for casual players . " - So perhaps this ball is best for younger kids and beginning soccer players . Acceptable , but look for something higher quality for anyone playing professional or heavy duty soccer fans .
5 #### If you are like me and you would like to travel ' on the go ' and you find it difficult , pack this little item in your bag and give yourself some options in your hotel room . Although many hotels have gyms , this gives you some additional exercises you can do right in the privacy of your room and it 's easy to pack without taking up too much space . I am very happy with this purchase .
5 #### Fairly easy to set up , and seems durable ennough for my 9 yr . old boy . When my son hits the target the ball bounces back to his feet , allowing him to work on his trapping skills . The training net allow kids to work and develop both the left and right foot . Works best when standing about 10 - 15 feet away from the target .
5 #### I previously had a Thor SA gripper from years ago . I had picked it up again and started using it . I quickly realized I needed something a bit tougher . I could n't find where to get the same brand again , so I read around on what are good grippers and saw Captains of Crush . I remembered the name from years ago , and they were available on Amazon , so I went for it . The No . 1.5 I got is tough enough for me , but not so tough that I ca n't close it . I also got a No . 2 that I ca n't yet close . The handles feel better than the old gripper I have . The knurling feels good in my hand . Not too rough , but enough that I do n't need to use chalk or anything before using this . All in all , great gripper and I will definitely purchase again .
5 #### I have been buying these for years , pretty much all I wear for a shoe unless I 'm exercising or have to get dressed up .
5 #### I 've been looking for a good watch that is comfortable , easy to read , has a day calander and will light up in the dark . Yay , I finally found the perfect watch , with this one . It 's easy to read and even with small wrists like mine , it 's just the right size . For being such a sturdy watch , it 's suprisingly lightweight . I love the light on this as well , since it 's not indiglo and lights up in the dark ( which can get very distracting ) , but rather the light can be easily pushed on and lights up the whole face of the watch . The only problem with this at all , was that the band was too big , which is common for a small wristed person . Since I buy watches frequently , for others as well as myself , I decided to invest in the link remover tool that is also sold here . < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Professional - Watch - Band - Link - Pin - Remover - Tool - with-3 - Extra - Pins - Adjust - Watchbands - Links - Repair / dp / B000X1XP3A / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Professional Watch Band Link Pin Remover Tool with 3 Extra Pins - Adjust Watchbands Links Repair</a > This is a fantastic tool and worked perfectly in removing the excess pins . Just make sure that you push the pins out in the right direction , but this shows you how in the instructions that come with the watch ( there 's also arrows on the band itself ) .
5 #### Chicago Metallic is a well - known bakeware manufacturer . Their products are known for excellent quality and the only pans I would consider . These are a good weight and sure to last a pretty long time . I 'll leave the accolades to the other 5 star reviews . I 'm just here to say they just barely fit my Cuisanart Toaster - Convection oven with .6 cubic interior , especially the wall - to - wall muffin tin . With baking and roasting one needs sufficient space for the heat to circulate . So although these are fabulous pans , I 'm not deducting stars just because they do n't exactly fit my particular needs . I would recommend taking interior measurements before buying . If they fit , count yourself lucky . These are the best .
5 #### Great shoes and the box came in great . Just wrong size
3 #### I went with recommendations that these should be purchased a size smaller than you usually wear , and I did so , and it fits well . However , they are not really that comfortable of a shoe . I purchased them as a cheap lifting shoe , and they serve decently at that , as they have little heel . I would never purchase these as a regular everyday shoe though .
4 #### It is comfortable and fits well . The past reviews that this is a little bigger than it says is correct . But 4 stars because the padding is quite thin and small .
5 #### They fit perfectly . These shoes are great for walking - so very comfortable . Love them .
5 #### My husband is a brewer , and these are the ONLY pants that hold up to his work for any length of time . They 're well reinforced , and wash surprisingly well in our lame HE top loader with hard water . They do take a long time to dry after washing , as expected with any heavy material .
4 #### I love these sneaks & have them in a couple different colors . The footbed is great for me , i have flat feet & high arches in shoes only make my feet hurt more . These are well cushioned but flat on the bottom which works well for me . One thing i noticed about them though is that the length & width are good for me & they feel great on initially , but they are a bit snug in the way they fit on top of my foot . So after a couple hours i feel the pressure and want to take them off . I have other Saucony shoes that do not feel this way , it 's just this model that feels a little snug across the top .
5 #### Always buy a pair at Christmas for my son - in - law . He loves the fit . Had to buy early this year : The new puppy needed a chew toy .
5 #### Perfect fit , very comfortable . Excelent quality . You will not be disappointed . Take care from oil stains .
1 #### When my husband wears these , the crotch hangs down to his knees . He only wore them once & I have used them to patch his other Dickies pants
5 #### Works as advertised . Well priced and adds a measure of security to the rack .
5 #### I bought the 4XL ( XXXXL ) size . I have a 56 " waist and a 60 " stomach and this size is perfect for me , almost too large . Fit is good , support is good . Great product at a great price . This is affordable enough , if I lose weight I will buy another smaller one .
5 #### I wear these everyday . Short sleeve in the summer and long sleeve in the winter . They are better than all the rest . period .
5 #### I have tried other brands of silver polish cloths , but Connoisseurs is the best . I like that it does n't leave a film on your hands after polishing an item .
5 #### They are perfect . Our granddaughter LOVES them . She said " you got me my sneakers , your the best Grandma ever " ! Thanks for helping us get her at least gift she just loves .
5 #### I got a pair of these last year and fell in love with them . I have problem feet and usually can only wear tennis shoes . I decided to try these because tennis shoes are just too hot in the summer . I am so glad I did . I now have a berry pair from last year and these blue ones . I would have every color if I could afford them . These were half the price of the newer ones . Must have been left overs from last year , but who cares . Easy to clean and waterproof too . Ca n't get any better than that . I would recommend these to anybody who wants comfortable footwear . They look good too .
5 #### I own multiple converse high tops and always get 0.5 size smaller than my Nike size . There was one pair , however , that I got in my actual size and it fit perfectly , so I decided to go with women 's 7.5 with these white low tops . They 're a little large , but I love them and they are n't critically larger than my feet which is why I did n't bother exchanging them . But 7 's would probably fit perfectly :)
5 #### I love this shoes ! I now have them in a couple different colors ( just the K - Swiss icon has the color , the rest is white ) . This helps me know which ones I use for certain activities . They are so comfortable !
5 #### Seats exactly as advertised , they are a little stiff but feels like they will break in . The back does does not lean back very far so they sit straight up . There is a way to adjust the distance the back leans but it only helps a little . I do concur with the other reviews on the weight issue . I weigh 180 and I can see it being a problem if you are anywhere near the 250 max . They do come with a nice warranty . Overall it 's not a bad replacement seat and I will update if they do not hold up or any other problems come up .
5 #### A friend of mine told me about Hanes panty hose and I am glad she did . The hose are very silky and the control top is very slimming .
4 #### Converse is always a 5 but the shipping was a bit slow . These run big , so definitely get one full size larger
5 #### I 'm 6'1 " 240lbs and they support me with no problem . One piece of advice is to tie a rope or a belt up to the bar your hanging from to make it easier to get back up though .
5 #### It looks and feels solid , not a cheap piece of plastic . I have it in my edc bag ( just in case ) ... :-)
5 #### Pelican cases are great . When you need something protected well , it 's always the go to brand with all shapes and sizes . I got a small orange one for a newly purchased thermal camera since it did n't come with a case . The pluck out foam made it easy to designa layout for all the things I needed . Definitely worth the price if you have anything you really need protected .
5 #### Chucks are always a favorite of mine , but the fit was just a little bigger than expected . They were a really nice blue .
5 #### Very nice shirt . Fits well . Light weight and cheaper than buying it at the store .
5 #### My daughter wore this for her first Halloween , and it could not have been cuter . I got the bigger size because she is very tall for her age , and it fit just fine . She was 10 months old on Halloween . I guess the only comment I would make is that she , of course , did not want to leave the ears alone so many of our pictures did not feature the cute ears on top .
4 #### I have Skimp Skamps that are several years old , and they are still in good condition . Just wanted to add to my collection . I have noticed that the newer skimp skamps seem to be made of a different ( thicker ) fabric ; maybe my old ones have gotten thin with age ! , As other reviewers have mentioned , fit thru the crotch seems a little wide but not enough of a problem to not purchase again . They are all wonderful , old ones and new ones .
5 #### These offered a great color and the size was much better than I expected . The comfort was the same that you 'd expect from any pantyhose but they had a great control top that helped with that .
5 #### The mask fits well and keeps my face warm , even in the midst of Chiberia . It also covers my neck .
5 #### good paintballs to waste them ... you can also go to walmart and find them two bucks cheaper or almost the same without having to wait for delivery . Also your near paintball shop carrys them cheap too ...
5 #### I purchased this as a singlet for weightlifting competitions . I 'm 5 ' 7 " and compete in the 69 kg class and a medium fits well . Very similar in fit to a basic medium Adidas weightlifting singlet and the measurements are all very close ( leg opening , inseam , total length , etc ) . And the best part of all ... made in the USA !
5 #### After over a year these things still last . I sock my rifles when traveling by air or to shooting events constantly removing them . The seem durable for the amount of use and have not lost elasticity . They are only good for traditional non scoped rifles . It did squeeze a pistol gripped shotgun into this once but it was beyond snug .
2 #### My son has worn Converse for years , so we expected ZERO arch support or comfort without good quality support / cushion orthotic inserts . No problem . But for what ever reason , this pair is NOT holding up well . After 4 months of use , the fabric has torn away from the outside top edge of the white rubber sole in several spots - not come unglued , ( which we might e able to fix ) but actually torn . His other pairs of Converse each lasted a year or more until the bottom soles wore out - which is as expected .
4 #### Lights up at night , has calendar date , and tells time , but a little expensive at $ 41 . Good quality metal thought .
1 #### Received two different size shoes and they are both for the right foot ... total fail . I 'll consider changing my review pending the return / exchange process .
5 #### I bought these for defensive practice at the range . I 'd prefer IDPA targets , as the scoring zones are a little more accurate to where you want to shoot defensively , however these are $ 0.30 per target and the cheapest I 've found the same type of target in IDPA design is $ 0.55 per target ( it adds up ) . The shoulder width is just right for an adult male . These come rolled in a box that is a convenient size for storing them . They do n't hold the roll either , so they 're easy to staple up as soon as you pull one out of the box . These will be my training target of choice until I can afford IDPA steel targets one day .
5 #### It 's chalk . It works . Keeps my fingers from getting slippery on those little crimps .
1 #### Both shoes were scuffed and damaged on the top of the shoe . I attempted to return but would be to late to send back and reorder before Christmas . Thanks .
4 #### Individually packed fuel pellets for use outdoors . I used mine with a compact esbit stove and it managed to boil 2 cups of water and fry 2 eggs . Not bad but lost a lot of heat while cooking eggs . Great for weekend minimal backpack trips , and/or bug out bags .
5 #### No more soggy wet cotton briefs for this guy . Was wearing a pair the other day , it was warm out and I was riding my motorcycle in stop and go city traffic for two hours . Usually when riding that long in warm weather sweat gets trapped between me and the motorcycle seat and soaks cotton sport briefs . After the ride if I ca n't change right away , the cotton feels like I am wearing a wet sock and I am uncomfortable the rest of the day . Not with the stretch nylon Skimp Skamp Brief . The nylon dries fast and the wide gusset gives great support . A suggestion : loose the frilly trim and market these for guys and Bali will make a mint .
3 #### I got this cap to keep the tropical sun reflecting off my large bald dome from blinding others . It fits ; not too tight , not too loose . Easy to put on & take off . Stays on in the water . It works as it should !
5 #### I'v had 5 pairs of these shoes . I love them . I work at a hospital the floors are hard and this puts some padding between the bottom of my foot and the hard floors . I like them and they look great with scrubs .
5 #### To me they were probably half size bigger that 's no problem they were awesome as expected , the box was beat to sh#t and falling apart it was still in a bag though
5 #### Just a great stove . Ca n't go wrong , got it here a lot cheaper than in the store .
5 #### My son wanted a workout set that did n't take up too much space in the dorm . He goes to the gym but wanted to have options for hours when the gym is n't open . This set is great and is very compact , yet offers a good variety of resistance settings .
5 #### Normally I would give clothes 4 star ( because there usually is at least 1 tiny thing to bother me ) , but there is really nothing to complain about these . The fit as I expected , very comfortable , and the denim is nice and thick .
5 #### These work as promised . Stay warm as long as you expect . Best slipped inside a pair of light gloves .
5 #### I do Paintless Dent Repair and I am frequently working outside on car lots . This hat is PERFECT for me . Before getting this , I had been using one of those baseball cap style sun hats that has the flap around the back and sides . It kept the sun off of me , but the brim of the hat was large and it got in the way because of the type of work I do and how I 'm often looking up with my eyes while my head is down / sideways / etc . This booniw hat keeps the sun off of my head but does n't get in my way . Plus it is cooler ( temperature ) than the flap hat is .
5 #### Nice , thick , and a good quality shirt . Washes well without shrinking . Will definitely be buying more .
2 #### Not a huge fan because it 's not totally secure . I 'll do more test rides but so far I do n't feel I can leave my watch on .
5 #### I LOVE CHUCKS . Have them in many colors and styles ! Have been buying them for years , and know what to expect . Sizing differences can be handled if you pick one size , usually one half a shoe size for tie ups , and one shoe size for slip ons .
4 #### The advantage this tube has over others it that the ending on the tube keeps the handle in place and the handle stays in the correct shape . I use other tubes ( heavier ) in other workouts ; the handles change shape , requiring that I concentrate on keeping the handle square . Left poor feedback for shipping , though . It took 10 days from shipping to travel less than a thousand miles .
4 #### Casting distance is cut but accuracy goes up . Really fun to catch bream with .
3 #### Should have believed all the reviews . I was stubborn and bought the same size I have in red . But it turned out I was wrong and they were about a half size too big like most of the reviews said they would be . Planning to return and exchange for a smaller size .
3 #### I got a hot spot on the bottom of my foot the first day I wore them .
5 #### I absolutely LOVE Converse shoes . Probably my favorite shoes to wear , which is why I have so many colors . However , all of those who have worn Converse know there is no arch support . Although they are the perfect shoe for inserts if that is something you need .
5 #### If I were reviewing these as athletic shoes I would have to give them two or three stars . However , these are for fashion . As such , they are comfortable , wear well and break in quickly . These shoes look good worn to death and are comfortable for fashion shoes .
5 #### These look great and fit all my guns . Even the magnum rifles with scopes no problem . Definitely recommended !
5 #### This is the 6th pair of Keen shoes I have owned but my first pair of sandals . I love them . I tried on all the different styles in the store and these were the most comfortable . They are great for walking in the summer because they offer comfort and support but are vented more than sneakers and IMO look better with shorts . I wore these to Sleeping Bear Dunes on our vacation last week ( big mistake ) and sand got pretty heavily imbedded in the foot beds . I took a toothbrush to them when we got home and it all came out pretty effortlessly . I love that they are machine washable too . Another great thing about Keens is that they come in size 10.5 ! Most brands skip 10.5 and go right to 11 . I am a 10.5 and these run true to size . 11 would be too big . I love these every bit as much as the shoes I 've purchased . I wear out every pair I get , I use them so much .
5 #### I bought three different knives and ended up liking them all . They all are boot knives , and depending on which pair of boots I wear is to which knife I take . So it could be work ( in an industrial plant environment ) , work at home on farm , hunting and hiking , I have the " go to " knife for which ever application I am doing at the time . Love Smith & Wesson !
5 #### I like t - shirts , especially pocket Ts and this is the best one ever . Nice thick material , roomy proportions , longer tail ... much better shirt than the old Hanes Beefy Ts which were pretty good but vanished long ago . Duluth Trading CO gear is pretty comparable , but $ 5 more a shirt . Nice color selection now too .
1 #### The cut on these shorts was very odd , and high , like old man pants . I returned them and got the same shorts from Proper that were much better in fit and quality .
4 #### The Weaver K4 is a legendary rifle scope . It has been around for years and the other K - series Weaver scopes are just as sound and dependable . With a .30 - 30 single shot H&R rifle and the new ammunition one can get today , this is a proven combination . The .30 - 30 if good for deer and like sized game and has probably been responsible for the harvesting of more deer than any other caliber in the history of America . The K4 , although not a variable power scope , goes with the .30 - 30 like bread with butter , like toast with jam , like bacon and eggs . The glass is good and clear . It holds zero forever and is not affected by the recoil of the .30 - 30 and will hold zero with the zero of a .308 and .30 - 06 , too . It is almost indestructible . It is dependable as the sun rise . And the price is good from Amazon.com . I will buy another one if I need to .
1 #### sheds , even after washing,,,would be good if you lived in Alaska !
4 #### Not a bad hat it fits good its comfortable to wear . I did n't like the fact it was made over seas .
5 #### We have used this for about half a year and it is still going strong . Heavy Duty Frisbee that lights up well at night using LED lights . The best I have used thus far .
3 #### I have always worn the medium weight hikers year round for work and recreation . My old socks are nearing the end of their life cycle and am looking for reasonably priced updates . I have tried a pair of Smartwool PHD's(not so reasonably priced ) and some Darn Tough socks recently . I bought these because of my loyalty to Wigwam . Well these fit very well , but I think I have been spoiled by the Smartwool and Darn Tough socks . They just felt so much better on my feet and did a better job of keeping my feet comfortable all day at work . ( I walk a lot at work . ) Have not taken any of the above out on the trail yet , so will update if there is a change in my opinion .
5 #### Terrific value & style ... 5 Stars for this one ... I bought one to try & very impressed with styling , quality & pricing availability from different vendors . I purchased 4 more in various colors as well as short sleeve .. love em ! Order your exact size as manufactured on the fuller size ..
3 #### These are comfortable and appear to be well built so far . No problems except the soles are not a good gripping surface . They appear to be good and feel like they would be good to the touch , but they are certainly slick on wet black top or wood . I just slipped and fell hard going down my steps this past Saturday .
1 #### These are offset hooks . If you do n't know the difference , please look it up . Circle hooks are designed to not deep hook fish as easily as regular hooks . If you catch and release fish such as stripers , then circle hooks are the way to go . Fewer injured fish .
5 #### I have worn k - Swiss for years and love the comfort and support
5 #### Good quality , but go up a size or two in the waist .
5 #### I think this shorts are great to wear in spring and summer time and if your like me wearing the camo of U.S. Military wear out of respect for them or you just like how the shorts look buy them .
4 #### Ordered a small and it turned out to be longer than the regular small t - shirt . But other than that , the shirt looks great .
5 #### My 18 year old is 6'5 " tall . It 's next to impossible to find pants long enough for him . I decided to take a chance and order some online . I 'm glad I did . They fit him perfectly ! There 's even a little extra length , in case he grows a little more . He feels better when he leaves out in the morning ( he 's a Freshman in college ) . And he looks awesome ! I 'll be ordering more from this site ... thank you .
1 #### I am returning these . I did n't even take them out of the package . One look and feel told me that these pantyhose were way too thin and fragile . I was afraid they would snag and/or run the first time I wore them . I need something a little more durable . I will be looking for something else .
5 #### I never thought that a wired bra would fit so well and stay put without stretching and rising throughout the day . This is the bra that does it all for me : stays put , fits very well , looks feminine and pretty , and supports my natural curves . What else surprises me ? I do n't even feel the wire part of the bra . Typically I would , so I stay away from them , except with this bra . In fact , I hardly know I 'm even wearing a bra . Thank you Bali . Your best bra yet , from my experience .
2 #### These are made of a really unattractive ribbed fabric . Even though they are affordable breeches , I could n't get past the fabric and returned them .
4 #### Wish they had a little more support / cushion , but I love everything else about them !
2 #### I bought this for my son and after 3 wears the section around the eyes is coming apart and I am going to have to sew it .
5 #### Really cuts down on teh noise when using riding lawn tractor . My BIG regret is not using these things 30 years ago . Too late now but hopefully can keep what hearing I have from deteriorating even more . Do your ears a big favor and buy these muffs today !
5 #### This is made of the same fabric and Velcro as the Ankle Glove Holster that is supplements . The vertical strap that connects to the Ankle Glove holster is sewn to the wider fabric that goes around the upper calf area . It has ample Velcro and length to go through the strap on the Ankle Glove and adjust to most leg lengths . The Velcro holds strong and secure . The calf band has a minimal stretch and is of sufficient length to go around all but the biggest calves . Placed correctly on the upper leg and firmly adjusted to hold the Ankle Glove , it will keep the weapon from pulling the Ankle Glove down . I suspect this would not be a necessary item for a weapon under 10 ounces but that is a personal comfort choice . This is a must - have with the Ankle Glove for active carriers , those who wear boots ( I do n't ) and those with heavier weapons . Like the Ankle Glove , you will need to experiment for the most comfortable placement for you . This should be done before you wear it out in public for any length of time .
3 #### Meh , felt very comfortable but provided no support . Seem like a good option for walking around in the summer but not for aerobics or lateral movements
3 #### It fits ok but it 's a little bit too large for me .
4 #### Very comfortable sneakers and I also like the way it fits .
5 #### Beautiful , black on black on black . They go nice with just about everything .
3 #### This bra is comfortable to wear , but it does not work for high impact exercises . If this bra had adjustable straps it would be perfect . I wear a 38 g and there was just too much bounce .
4 #### I had to return the first pair and buy a 1/2 size smaller . First time I 've had to buy smaller for Nike .
1 #### I ordered 18"/45 cm and what I received was over 3 " smaller than its supposed to be . I ordered another one and it was still 2 " smaller . I returned both .
5 #### Best work pants out . Ca nt wear anything else . Comfort and classic styling keep me coming back for more when they eventually wear out . I get about 18 - 24 months out of a pair . I own a Landscaping construction company and they have become part of our ' uniform ' . Wish they would bring back the green color though .
5 #### Bought for husband for Christmas . He really likes the gift set , but the weather has not allowed him to use it ..
4 #### I really like these Bungee Docklines from Airhead . I have them in a few sizes , they are all identical in every way except the length . They make tying up the boat to the dock for some lunch or gas so much easier then having to tie ropes and much quicker . This is really helpful when you are working alone and there is a current and is especially helpful when you have help and they do n't know how to tie dock lines . These are intended for personal watercraft , but I am using them on my 17 foot center console boat . I have been using them for about 2 months now and the only complaints I have are about the rope itself . The rope is already starting to fray in some spots a little and the color is starting to fade . These are only used on the weekends and are not left out in the sun otherwise . I suspect they will be good for a season or two , but for the price I plan on replacing them with the same product as needed . Overall still much better then rope for short term docking .
4 #### I purchased this for my son to practice with in the back yard . The bases are well made and will easily hold up over time .
1 #### I already own converse shoes and the fit was way off for these . They also were two different shapes in the toebox . Definitely not the quality I would 've expected .
4 #### This product was recommended to me for massaging my foot arches , and it has worked much better for that than other products I have tried .
5 #### Nice quality - not too thin . I love that they have pockets . Great pair of shorts for days handing out at home .
5 #### if you coach or play in backyard these are sweet .
5 #### These hold up nicely . They are as comfortable as pantyhose can be .
5 #### My husband is impossible to please when it comes to work boots . He likes these . That 's all I can say .... RELIEF .
5 #### I own 3 pairs of these in different colors . Wide toe area is very helpful to me . Good arch support , I always order at least a half size up in Keens as they seem to run small , but not an issue for as I have many pairs and know what to order . Wish Keen would make nearly the same sandal with fine mesh in holes for people who like to paddle and could wear them without getting rocks and pebbles in them under foot .
5 #### I made this into a mash tun for home brewing beer . It works great in that application . Less than two degrees drop in temp in one hour .
4 #### I had NO idea how large these would really be . I ordered the same size ( 34 x 34 ) as my motorcycle pants thinking they 'd be good . The waist fix perfect but they were WAY WAY WAY too long . The legs could fit a powerlifter ( I 'm chicken legged ) , not sure who these are made for but whoever it is must have HUGE legs . I 'm sending the 34 x 34 back and ordering a 34x 32 . Hopefully they 'll fit better . I do love the construction , I 'm sure I 'll be able to wear them ( baggy :( ) and all for years .
5 #### matches freya sizing perfectly . have n't tried to wear it for an occasion yet but it 's comfortable & pretty .
5 #### I got this for a 300 Win Mag and it works well to reduce the recoil of the 195 grain rounds I fire in it . Very happy .
5 #### This is a great deal for this knife ! I own several SOG knives some made in the USA , some in Taiwan and some in China . They 're all quality knives with the US being the highest and most expensive of the bunch and Taiwan running a close second . This is a nice size to carry for almost any occasion . It has a full tang & comes with a nice sharp edge ... It is not however a full - size military fighting blade . That is why they call it the " pup " ... But it can do the job if called upon to do so ... it has a very serviceable sheath as well . It 's a good all - around size and will fit most any occasion .
3 #### Although Inge appear to be sturdy , the bases had to be screwed down on the Ruger 10/22 rail with a very high level of torque to keep the bases from rocking in the slots . The 10/22 slots are Weaver in size - do n't know why they require such severe tighteing
4 #### I liked the shoes a lot , but they did n't work for me . I have a high arch and the shoe was too tight on the top of my foot . Returned .
5 #### Very well made and fits perfectly . I was not sure if ordering this item on line was a good idea . I 'm glad I did and will probably order again . I purchased both the white and black . Both were just fine .
5 #### What a fun invention ! This ' fly swatter ' is very well constructed and so much fun to use , you 'll want to purchase several to give as gifts . The device works on the principal that when a fly takes off from a surface to fly , it takes a split second for it to be able to begin to fly forward , away from you . This spring - loaded swatter acts like a dart gun , with a swatter in place of the end of the dart , to slap the fly right out of the air ! You will be amazed at your accuracy . If the kids are needing something to do at a picnic , pull out several of these bug guns , and let them swat away . My 97 - year - old auntie uses hers with deadly accuracy , whereas she is n't able to swat with a regular fly swatter quickly enough to do any damage to pesky flies in the summertime . Easy to re - load the swatter by pressing the rod into the handle of the device for use , over and over . The swatter - dart is connected to the handle by a string , so you never have to go hunt the swatter . A tiny broom should be included to sweep the victims out the door ! Remember , get more than one , or yours will soon disappear .
5 #### Wear everyday to feed horses and do ranch chores . Even done some hikes for like 30 min at lunch and super comfy .
2 #### I recently bought two 10 ' Tundra combos . One has turned out to be OK so far after three 7 - hour or so pier fishing sessions . The other 's largest guide insert shattered within a few hours of the first trip 's start . I sent that back for an exchange . The replacement rod 's reel seat was missing large chunks of plastic , which I found in the bottom of the box , and have super glued back in place ( not going to bother with a second return ) . Given how unbelievably cheap these combos are ( about $ 38 shipped for the 10 ' ) , I 'm not surprised they 're not durable . I just did n't expect them to be this flimsy . Surprisingly , the tops and bottoms of the pole are not interchangeable between the two poles . One did n't fit the other at all . I put a little nail polish to distinguish between them , problem solved . Also what other folks are saying about needing a light ( very light ) sanding and some lube between the pieces is spot on . And yes , they are quite heavy in use . On the pier where we fish , overhead/ sidearm casting is not allowed ; underhand casting this thing for 7 hours will give your forearms one heck of a workout . I was considering getting the 13 for surfcasting , but after seeing what other folks are saying about the weight just going up , I 'm going to find something else ...
4 #### Before you read on , know that this got rave reviews from all , including our son , who absolutely loved wearing it . It also made for excellent pictures . For these reasons , it got a four , though it likely deserved a three . Having said that , we bought this in the 2 - 4 toddler size for a slightly - tall two - year - old , and there was no room to spare , especially when we put some pajama - like clothes under the costume for warmth . The length was n't the problem . It was the other dimensions that were pushing it , and he 's on the slim side . The stitching over his back was already coming loose when we put it on the first time , and the velcro holding the neck together of the uniform itself did n't make it through the third wearing ( busy Halloween ) , so a safety pin was needed . The cape 's velcro is about to go , too . Just an FYI , the picture makes it look like the uniform goes over the shoes , which it does in a way . The bottom of the feet are open with straps that go under the shoes . That worked really well , actually , and looked pretty convincing . It was helpful when we went to a place that required that we take our shoes off . So , all in all , it 's an adorable costume , but do n't expect it to last very long .
3 #### My husband says there 's not much padding in the insole and so he can not wear them but for short periods of time and when he does n't have to do much standing or walking .
1 #### I hate these . I do n't know if it is a brand issue or an alcohol fuel issue . I bought these thinking I was saving money on the Appalachian Trail . I ended up in a hotel contemplating murdering these tabs , live , on camera . If you wish to know what it is like cooking by alcohol fuel stove ( and tabs ) the below is from a post I made while on the AT . The stove struggle is real . It 's also ' fine ' if you your meal timeline is ' sometime later ' without specifying which day . Ugh . After burning a thumb ( and yes , thumbnails smell when on fire ) trying to light the Esbit , wait . Wait . Wait Still there ? Wait . Teensy bubbles . SIKE ! Fire out . Light again . Wait . Wait . Real tiny bubbles . Hope . Progress . Buahahaha Light 2nd cube . Have a child threaten to walk back to Texas . Hope . Wait . There it is . Add rice / pasta etc . Curse three made up words . Noooooowwwwww eat . At a later date I may or may not be willing to admit slight user error for using a lighter and not waterproof matches , but not today . If this post makes you claw your eyeballs then wrinkle your nose and snarl at this stove section as you skip with glee to canisters and JetBoil . If it does n't make you want to do that , then my patience was allotted to you
5 #### These are really cute and fun . I 've bought them for both my kids . My four year old learned to tell time with one . I 've bought them as gifts and highly recommend this product .
3 #### The fit was more snug than expected but conforms to standard Dickies styling and cut . Well constructed and a nice red , not too bright or orange .
4 #### The fit is a little snug . Hopefully they will stretch to my feet over time . Do n't like the adjustment clips as well as my previous pair . The old pair wore extremely well , have had them for about eight years . Time will tell if the new ones are as well made .
3 #### Your picture shows a line and a dock holder or clet , and i only got the line , please add a statement to picture to tell people that only the line is what u get .
5 #### My 5th pair in 10 years , so I like what I like .
2 #### These panty hose were great and all with quality and fit , but the colors are disappointing .... they do n't match the picture as shown even after stretching them thinner , the colors are way darker . I ordered the soft taupe color because I 'm pretty pale but what I got was a brownish mauve color .... Despite the nice quality I 'll have to send them back for a refund because even this light color is too dark for my skin personally .
4 #### Great for riding in the 32 - 50 degree range . It 's not windproof , so I could not recommend this product for sub - freezing temps .
2 #### I love the way these look and they are very sturdy , but both of my boys ( one little , one big ) complain about them being uncomfortable . Even for the sale price , the price is hard to swallow if your kid does n't want to wear them .
5 #### My son felt like a real superhero although i would have preferred it if the belt was a velcro belt instead of having to tie it at the back and also the bands that go under the feet should have been bigger because they kept coming off .
5 #### Had golf - related chronic tendonitis for years and finally decided to try this on the recommendation of a co - worker . Seems to really work , in addition to the stretches and other exercises that are recommended in the instructions . Would recommend this product .
4 #### This was a lot smaller than I thought it would be . I wish I would have ordered the bigger one but for what it is , it 's a good product .
5 #### I sent the first one back ; the day would n't roll past Sunday . It worked the rest of the week , but come Monday , it still said " Sunday " . But the second one works fine . Nice - looking watch . The band is a little bit cheap . It 's not made as well as a real Twist - O - Flex , but for the price I do n't mind upgrading to a nice band . UPDATE : The longer I have this watch ( three years now , I think ) the better I like it . The Sherman Tank of watches .
5 #### I did n't get my belt I order all but this one no sign of it Just got it thanks what a relief for my back wow
2 #### So , I really loved this- until I washed it . Unfortunately , I had purchased this , a headband , and a hat from Turtle Fur , and all three of them came out of the washing machine destroyed the first time I washed them . I washed them alone because I did n't want to risk dying my other clothing if the colors bled , and when they came out of the washer they were covered in pulls , fuzz , and generally looked like I had been wearing them for years . Generally I might have thought that something else in the load had caused it , but nope , only these were washed together . SUPER bummed because these were really warm and comfortable for all of the few days I got to wear them . Now I ca n't wear them anywhere in public because they look horrible , and I did n't purchase cold weather gear at this price point to be worn around the house .
5 #### Lost my old one . Would not be without it . Just too pricey .
5 #### I wear these sandals 5 times a week for water walking and aerobics . They give me traction and just do n't seem to be affected by the water . Very comfortable . Best water shoes I have tried , even the pool chemicals do n't harm them . Easy to put on and to adjust .
5 #### Great product .. just as described .. arrived quickly .. great price ... packaged well .. will continue aid me in my recovery .... very pleased
2 #### By anyone else 's standard , this shirt would be a XX at a minimum . I guess they really do grow them larger on the farm . It is a nice quality shirt , but will end up going in a donate bin as it is way too large for me .
5 #### There were so many different options for practice baseballs I was concerned I 'd get something that was not good . These baseballs are perfect . My son is 13 and these are similar to the one 's he used on his high school team . All of them were in very good condition ( individually wrapped ) when they arrived . I use most of them for hitting , but I set aside 5 or so to practice his pitching with non scuffed balls . This is a good set if you are looking for a baseball similar to what is used in leagues for 12 years old through high school .
5 #### I bought these for my husband for work and they fit exactly how they are suppose to . They fit according to size he 's a 32 and they fit just like all the other 32s . He and I like them b / c they are sturdy and casual to wear .
5 #### The pearl on the one that came was great and with the indiglo it is so priced right ! love this timex and it made a great gift .
1 #### The Sneakers were great but I receive them in the wrong color . When I placed the order I chosed the Black on Black . When I receive my order the converse I receive were the regular Black & white my 9 yearold daughter was unhappy .
5 #### I got my boots from the seller " why pay more And fast shipping " . The boots were Authentic and in great condition . I was a little bit skeptical given the low price , but I spoke to someone from the seller mentioned above and they reassured me that the boots were authentic . Very pleased with my purchase . I 'd say they are true to size . This Bronx Native is happy with her purchase . Ca n't live in New York and NOT have a pair of Timbs .
5 #### Wow is this thing warm ... I used it for snowmobiling and kept warm the whole time ... quality is good and the zippers on the legs makes it easy to take on and off
3 #### Really nice material and very soft but fits smaller than expected . Unfortunately , in the chaos of having my first baby preemie I lost track of the days and can no longer return it but maybe with baby number two I can fit into it . Highly doubtful but maybe .
5 #### The kids really love this pogo stick . One will get on the others shoulders and the other on the handles and jump and do flips on the trampoline . Pretty cool to watch .
4 #### Well made , the only problem is that they did not open enough to fit my muzzle loader without some modification to the width of the swivel holes on the stock .
4 #### Works well for its intended use as a light summer jacket . Good Value
5 #### Only shoes I 'll wear , and I do n't wear shoes often . Will buy again .
5 #### Works well . It looses tension after extended use , so plan on replacement but it is a natural thing to happen .
5 #### I purchased for my grand daughter and Gosh she looks very cute wearing these . They fit well and arrived on time
2 #### I really like this style of Jockey 's - which is the only reason I have put up with their lack of uniformity in sizing for many years . With Jockey , sometimes a size 7 is cut like a 5 , other times like a 9 . A clerk in Macy 's told me years ago this is a common complaint with them . She recommended always checking them after buying so they could still be returned . Unfortunately , this time I was too trusting . Now I 'm stuck with 6 pairs of tiny pants that I ca n't return .
5 #### PERFECT for my farsighted eyeballs . Cleaned mask with softscrub and hot water rinse 3 - 5 times . Let dry then installed per directions . I can see said the blind man .
5 #### This is a great place to set the lid down on this lid stand . What is left to say ? Maybe you could even use this to lift the lid and set it on a rock ? Lodge has great things . Well made . If it was n't , I would say .
4 #### These shorts are so comfy ! I 've worn them hiking in hot weather and they were perfectly comfortable . They are also nice to lounge around the house in . If I bought again I would probably go a size smaller .
5 #### I am interested in this for toning , it 's not really designed to replace dumbbells , so if you 're looking for that go another route . Being that I like to lift weights , I wanted a band to help tone my arms a little more . In that respect it works great , I would say that when standing on this band with both feet , it gives you about 25 - 35(at top)lbs . of resistance on each arm with a bicep curl . Obviously this is n't for building huge arms or anything , but it is very convenient and portable nonetheless . The band itself is built really solid too , so I expect this to last a long time . As far as instructions go , I already knew how to properly use bands , but in case you do n't look it up on the Internet .
5 #### bought as a gift for my son who is living in Maine . he loves it .
5 #### This shirt fits great and is very comfortable . Thick and made well . Have bought these before and liked them then , and like this one too .
3 #### I ve had this jacket for a while now and it is just way too short , it is very big around the body , just super short when it comes to the waist .
4 #### What 's to love ? These fuel cubes work as expected , and better than other brands . Ready - to - go fuel for my Esbit stove when I 'm out of denatured alcohol . Great fuel source for bug - out bags and stoves , too .
4 #### agift for my brother . have ordered before and he liked it
2 #### I do n't like the dry molly as much as I like a wet Molly . Like STP and a good synthetic motor oil mixed .
5 #### Great walleye plugs in rocky areas . they do not get snagged near as much as Shad Raps .
5 #### I took this on it 's first trip this weekend . We hiked to a isolated lake inside of an island in Michigan . This was about a 5 mile hike . The boat is pretty lightweight , I had no issue rolling and strapping it to my backpack . The pump took a good amount of time to get the raft nice and inflated , but it held air for the remainder of the trip . I fished out of the raft for 4 days . I constantly had hooks rubbing against the rubber and never once did it puncture . I was pretty rough against the paddle - holders and they held up nicely . The boat moved through the water rather well for an inflatable raft , no complaints there . This is good for one grown adult and maybe a child . This fit myself and my fishing gear pretty comfortably . We used the explorer 300 for two adults , and that worked well .
5 #### Fits OK , but would like to have a 7 - 3/8 , but not available . Wear it out doors to protect from sun and rain when I walk the dog .
5 #### The bench was purchased for an at home work out , it was easy to put together . It is also very sturdy . The padding is much better than expected . For the price of someone getting started , what it affords you to do , it 's awesome ! You can change the bench from lying to sitting very quickly . I am pleasantly surprised how nice this bench is for the price I paid . Nine incline adjustments from flat to military and everything you need in between . I feel completely stable on the bench , and the leg attachment although not great , is as good as any of this type of equipment . And the seat angle adjustment is definitely a bonus . . I would recommend the bench to everyone .
5 #### Awesome product . All species love it . I caught many panfish and bass with it .
3 #### I have my shorts on now . I have some old Made in the USA shorts . The first thing I noticed about the Made in China version is the cloth . It is not nearly as thick or nice as the old USA shorts . They also seem a little large for size xl . I looked at the tag for Xl that was on shorts and it says waist 39 " to 43 " . I can only imagine what the XXL would have been like . Hopefully they will hold up and last like my USA shorts . Update on shorts : 5 Feb 2016 After having wore these shorts for quite awhile and having bought more , they are decent shorts . I have two issues and both have to do with Quality Control . I have had two pair with the rear pockets not sewn completely , they were sewn but part of the seams were missed . The other are the buttons for the fly . After wearing a few times going thru the wash the buttons will fall off or begin to fall off . It would be nice if the buttons were sewn more securely . With my recent purchase the first thing I did was sew the fly buttons so I would not get surprised later with a missing button . Overall I am satisfied with these shorts , just wish I did not have to do any sewing .
5 #### These Merrells are an excellent fit , hugging my foot extremely well !
5 #### works great took to wilderness in alaska was reliable and perfomed its task flawlessly
5 #### served it purpose wonderfully . got the attention needed without putting yourself in danger . will order another when the other runs out
5 #### No . But after checking it out it"s quality of design came through . This is a very well made knife . Smooth design and function is what it 's all about . Oh , did I forget , it came razor sharp .
5 #### I 'm a bigger dude . Wear a 44 waist which does n't really come up to my waist . I get these in 2x and it covers my crack pretty good and stays up with a belt . Very comfy and holds up super well . I 've had two pairs now . Picked up a pair in khaki with a zipper as well . They fit the same .
5 #### Well worth the money . This is an embroidered / appliqued banner . It 's not just a stamped - on picture . High quality & well made . Has held up well through two seasons so far .
5 #### Fast shipping , soft and warm . High quality at a moderate price . Fits snug and color is rich . 5 of 5
5 #### Love it , its is simply awesome , works and is as described ! you ca nt go wrong in this product , in my opinion . FACT I would buy again
5 #### I love my new converse . They fit very perfectly . Shipping was vwry fast .
5 #### Super comfortable and fit my small feet perfectly . I have flat feet so a lot of shoes are not comfortable for long periods of time . I can wear the shoe all day long and they are super comfortable . They are light colored so any dirt will be seen right away , but they are easy to clean compared to other shoes I ve had . Would definitely buy another pair in a different color .
3 #### Bare minimum of features , which is what I like . I like the . Night light a lot . Leather watch band is too thick and bulky . The watch is also larger than expected . This makes it a bit of a misfit on my small wrist . Good product , but not quite what I expected .
5 #### I bought this for my husband because he had been using watches that were decades old and had fallen apart . I bought him a " cheapie " one which broke right away . Since I have a Timex , I decided to get this one for him .... best decision to make . It is perfect . It looks great , has the indiglo feature ( great for low light ) , and fits him to a tee . You ca n't go wrong with the Timex name and quality . Great buy !
3 #### This is a nice watch and I quite like it , but it so hard to set . The time is not that difficult to set but I could not get the date set . The day would simply not change . But I like the way the way time is displayed so I will keep it . In the meantime will try and get the watch I like to get repaired .
5 #### This is the third pair of these shoes I 've bought . I do put insoles in them , but I love the way they fit and they work really well if you 're working on your feet .
4 #### Purchased this for my husband for his b - day and ordered an XL . The sizing is big and wide for an XL ( Hanes 's XL 's are n't this big ) and my husband was fairly swimming it but when we put it through the laundry it shrunk up enough to fit perfectly . Will order more in the future as it is a nice well - made shirt .
5 #### Very nice knife . Typical Case high quality , love the olive handles , recommend .
5 #### This is my second one I have had in the past five years . I love the style . Thank you
5 #### My daughter loves these and wears them all the time .
4 #### For the price --- this is a pretty decent spotting scope . It has performed flawlessly , so far ; and it has been very easy to use . I have yet to try it in a low light environment ; so , I will have to wait to evaluate that aspect of this scope . Worth the money , IMHO !
5 #### You might want to buy a set of replacement strings but other than that they are perfect ! Love converse .
5 #### Great addition to my field bag , just in case . A+
1 #### Really confused on the size selection . Post makes it seem like these are women 's sizes yet once ordered I got a men 's 10.5 . So now I have to send back and order an 8.5 and hope that this time it does n't come in women 's size 8.5 .
5 #### Gorgeous vibrant colors . This was a gift for my husband- he is super happy with these items .
1 #### adhesive does n't stick , and the way it 's made it will give you very limited visual range and it 's a eye safety hazard
1 #### Cheap material zipper came off just in one . Not happy with purchase
5 #### I love these shoes ! They 're extremely comfortable the second you lace them up ! I 'm planning on buying more in varying colors ! !
2 #### This ball has not held up under playground play . It may be fine for home use , but after two weeks of 4 - square play , at 15 minutes a day , it began going flat . Kids loved the size , but it wo n't hold up through even 15 min of play now .
5 #### I have been wearing these all my life . They are perfect under pants .
4 #### Bought the sleeves to allow me to get a tighter packing density in my gun safe . It 's hard to have one size that fits all .
5 #### This cloth is the only thing that gets the very tarnished look off of my stainless steel . I even bought the liquid jewelry cleaner and that did n't get the black off . This cloth is amazing with the cleaning side and the polishing on the other side .
3 #### Ordered these jeans & a pair of Dickie jeans . Returned the Wrangler & ordered three more Dickies . The Wrangler seemed smaller in the waist than a 42 .
5 #### Carhartt work pants .. Fit well , Name says the rest ..... In 10 years when I need a new pair , I 'll buy same thing !
1 #### The back snapped off during a arrest and not only did I loose the holster I lost my $ 80.00 Surefire
5 #### I am a person that has had a lot of foot issues , especially with sandals . I bought these Keen 's in the hope that they would support my foot better so that I had less pain from wearing the wrong kind of shoe . These have provided excellent support and are so comfortable to wear . They are heavier than you typical sandal style shoe but couldent ask for a better fit . I would order these shoes again and again . I 've been recomending them to all of my friends and family .
4 #### product is wholesome , quality chrome and nylon gasket but does not come with any stainless steel screws .... but i still would buy another , price is right ...
5 #### I use this shoe to lift weights . The hard rubber sole is a great platform to squat and deadlift with . This shoe fits as expected and has held up with use for the 5 months I 've owned it .
5 #### Some of the nicest T 's for the money . Period . These are becoming my standard for everyday wear . They hold their shape . They are tough . They clean up well . In addition , where I live you are judged by clothes or car and not character . I feel much better with the Carhart logo than the little Polo horsey one . Robs rating Get three of them at least !
5 #### I do n't have a lot of experience with bags . In fact I hate carrying them at all because I tend to leave them on the backs of chairs wherever I go . I needed a bag for my vacation to Europe . I needed one that would hold my full size Ipad . This bag is perfect ! It was comfortable to wear and has plenty of room for my electronics . I highly recommend this bag .
5 #### I love these shoes . I exercise in them as well as just take them on longer walks . Feels good , looks GREAT ! !
4 #### Fit perfectly , exactly what I expected . Shipping was pretty fast .
3 #### Followed the size chart , but they were not long enough
4 #### Bought this for a gift for my Daughter who was traveling to Central America to study abroad . She loves the set but her one complaint was it was a little too bulky . Still she carries it daily so very much worth the price
3 #### I bought them for my 10Yrs daughter who plays Tennis 3 times a week . They were very flat on the arch and very much heavy , so she could not bounce to the ball ... it felt she was dragging her legs on the court ...
5 #### Like the title says this knife is the perfect EDC blade . Lets start with size . The knife having a 2.91 " blade makes it perfectly legal in most jurisdictions . This knife fits very well in hand . I first thought it would be to small , but after having it for a few months I have noticed the size is perfect . Second blade steel . I have found 154CM to be an excellent steel . It takes a very sharp edge and I have found it to be easy enough to sharpen . I have only had to sharpen this blade twice in two months and I use this knife a lot . Third the lock . The axis lock is pure perfection . Fourth the weight . This thing is a featherweight making it a pleasure to carry every day . Last is the speed of deployment . This is so fast sometimes I think its an assisted model . Overall I think this is simply the best knife you can purchase for the money . I know the price seems steep , but you get what you pay for .
5 #### I recently had my old Weaver 4x scope break through contamination of the gases inside . It was over 40 years old . I could not find another Marksman model scope like it . Thought of this Bushnell loved the price it turned out to be a bigger better looking scope more stock features . Came with scope mounts , I am a big fan of Kwik - site Corporations see thru iron site mounting systems that was on my rifle . Do n't know what I will do with the mounts that came with the scope . My Kwik - site 's do n't match the scope perfectly but I only use the scope to spot squirrels in the trees and drop my eye to the iron sights to make clean shots anyway .
5 #### Shirt fits perfectly and is very comfortable . I will continue to order more shirts through Russell here on Amazon .
5 #### This was my third Nite Ize Flashflight LED disc . The other ones got beat up from using them over and over and over and leaving it out in the yard in the elements . I wish they had different modes other than on / off . Sometimes I want a solid color , sometimes I want the disco mode . Nite Ize , please give us some options !
5 #### I love K - Swiss , and of course the classic white K - Swiss tennis shoe is a must have in any women 's closet . I 'm so afraid to wear these sometimes because I do n't want to get them dirty , other then that , I love them . Very comfortable and super sleek . Classic in every sense of the word . Goes with practically any outfit . Cute with a dress and jean jacket , or jeans and a t - shirt . Love my K - Swiss .
5 #### Great shoes purchased by a 88 year old who needs to wear special shoes recommended by my podiatrist . The brand of Merrell has never let me down . Thank you ! Great shoes .
5 #### This is my second pair of these shoes . I love the fit and they provide support for walking . I like the way the shoes fit around my ankle , as many shoes are uncomfortable because they come up too high in the back . Try them !
5 #### This is one of those weird tools that , combined with the proper excercise , really made a difference for me . I had been suffering from something similar to tennis elbow for the better part of a year . I 'm not completely over it , but this thing really made a difference and very likely put me over the hump .
5 #### I have been looking for jewelry box that accommodates my variety of jewelry , to no avail until now ! I have purchased four of these in total - all different to create my perfect jewelry box !
5 #### The sling shot is pretty good and accurate . The draw is not very hard and the accuracy is good . Exactly what I was expecting from it .
5 #### This is my 3rd Rothco boonie . All fit true to size and all great quality . This midnight camo color is unique . I 'll buy more if these wear out !
5 #### This is a great goal from Franklin for back - yard use . We also have the Franklin 9 ft rebounder . It 's been outside in Vermont winters now for 5 years , and it is still in great shape . We just needed to add some zip - ties this year ( available cheaply at any hardware store ) to more securely attach the net to the frame . Bottom line - very good . I 'd buy again .
5 #### I have used smartwool hiking socks for years in dress , tennis and hiking boots . Even stroll around the house in sock feet and fine . Wear nearly forever . Not inexpensive but I get so much .
4 #### It 's a good quality , heavier nylon reenforced knee and butt area . Size runs big , my tall almost 10 yr old usually size14/16 Old Navy / Forever21 / Target , shoe size 7 , fits perfectly in size M. Waist 26~30 " adjustable , inseam 25 " .
5 #### The watch is durable holding up to the test of an active girl . She loves the cheery purple color with pink flowers and especially how the face lights up with the indiglo light . It fits her small wrist , but has elastic band for easy on and off . Love how the small hand & big hand has ' hours ' and ' minutes ' on it to help teach clock reading , but the style is something she can grow with ... until eventually lost . Liked it so much , bought another to replace the lost one .
5 #### Fast shipping . Seem like a quality product , pretty thick material . Long enough for my shotgun . Much easier to transport my over / under already assembled , instead in the hard case , which has to broken down to it in the case . The sock is cheaper than a padded shotgun case . Only draw back , must be careful when transporting , not much padded protection .
5 #### The U shaped crotch really does make a difference , more comfortable than Lee . I know some people swear by one brand or the other , I do n't . I want comfort and durability these have both .
5 #### I bought these to use in a pool for aquatic therapy ( including building leg strength ) . These things work quite well . They are n't uncomfortable for the 45 minutes I 'm in the water . I 've used them at home , too , when I ca n't make it to the pool . I needed something to make my workouts more difficult ; these fit the bill .
5 #### Cool print Chuck 's , not much more to say . Fast service even during holiday season .
4 #### Does what it 's supposed to do . Described and is exactly as planned . Works fine . Worth a look .
5 #### Carharrt is a little large get a size smaller but great shirt
4 #### This mask fits well with little to no leaking . The lenses are very close to your eyes . This makes the view great but the lenses will fog up fast if you do n't use some anti fog spray . They will fog up fast without it . The mask is a little smaller than my other masks but the view is just as good . I use them for snorkeling . The quality is very good . Made in Italy .
5 #### Classic Carhartts . So far so good . They fit a bit wider at the boot than in the picture , which is what I was hoping for .
5 #### Just like I remember from 10 years ago when I used to wear these daily ! Seem to run a little big though . Still as soft and classic as they used to be .
5 #### Favorite Nikes ever . I already owned this style and was ready for a new pair so I went with these . Love the color and they fit great .
5 #### Great and comes with me during my travel , helps when can not find much time or a gym .
5 #### Their Wranglers . Not sure what else to say . If you know your size and what style you like you wo n't be disappointed
4 #### A nicely made jacket that does run very big , and yes the buttons will need to be resewn . Overall a winner .
5 #### I ordered these to go into my glove liners , with pockets for these warmers . I put some in my socks too . After skiing in Utah all day 9 - 5 , with temperature in the teens , my hands and feet were warm all day . They really do last 10 hours . Very happy with purchase !
1 #### do not like the way these swim , weightless they will barely be under the surface , very light
5 #### Great shoe . I 've had Nike 's before and have always been pleased with the comfort , performance , and quality . Though I will say this was the first time I ordered a pair online without trying them on first , so I was nervous . But this turned out to be a great choice . Breathable , lightweight but sturdy , and comfortable during all my workouts . The built - in arch support is great and I 've had no discomfort after 2 weeks of use . As far as the sole thickness and cushioning goes , I would consider these a ' medium ' build ( not thin , not overly thick ) so if you 're into heavy running outdoors then take that into consideration . Everyone is different in their preference for cushioning , but I think for light runs on a treadmill they would be sufficient . Love these , highly recommend !
1 #### This would 've been perfect if not for the red underwear part . It is shaped like a thong ... and looks weird on my son who usually wears a 3T. The costume overall fits him but the undewear part comes so high on the sides and is somewhat narrow . Sending this back .
3 #### Lovely watch , big numbers make it easy to read the numbers . In our case , the band is too small .
5 #### I was a little skeptical seeing the price of these , but I was really surprised with the quality of the whole kit . Nothing feels like it will break , and it all stows away in its case , which is perfect for living in a cramped apartment . The handles rotated easily , and it is ridiculously easy to setup for your next exercise . I 'm 5'10 " , and it did n't feel like it was over stretching when standing on the bands . Pros -Great for small places like apartments where a machine is n't feasible to own -Good value -Comes with workout card to show you all the exercises you can do Cons -While everything feels durable and well built , it will take time to see how long the bands last , but you ca n't really count it as a con Will update after more time spent with this kit !
5 #### Good product . US Men 's 7.5 D(M ) / US Women 's size 9.5 B(M ) ...
5 #### Very comfortable . I wear them on " leg days " Great for squats .
5 #### They fit perfectly . These shoes are great for walking - so very comfortable . Love them .
5 #### Always just what I need . You can dress them up or down . Always perfect .
5 #### I have pretty high arches and my calves always hurt at the gym with other shoes . I have been on the hunt for a good cross trainer that I can use to lift , take gym classes , and lightly jog / run on the treadmill . These have been wonderful ! I do n't ever have any pain in my calves or my feet when wearing these and they fit like a glove . Highly recommend !
5 #### Love this piece of equipment ; it is great quality ! The DVD and other information that came with it has inspired my own workouts , as well as my clients ' !
5 #### I am glad I splurged for the higher end hoist . Quality is top notch and appears it will last a lifetime . I purchased 2 of these . I have a 12 ' and 10 ' kayak . I installed in my barn and each kayak has paddle , tackle box , anchors , and other kit on them adding to the weight . These hoists worked perfectly and install while complicated went fine after following the instructions .
5 #### my shoes was as I expected love them . will recommend them to others & amazon is the place to shop where you can get what you want for good prices .
4 #### Once installed it works fine . Minor issue getting it placed properly but no problems since installation .
3 #### It 's too wide so I had to wear thick socks with this in order to help my feet from moving around .
5 #### Super comfortable and easy on and off . I go through one set of boots per year on the ranch . These are by far the most comfortable and the cheapest by a long shot . Hope they hold up to wear , great traction in slick lamb pens . Made it through lambing season without a bout of plantar fasciitis , no more bogs or muck boots for me .
4 #### This thing works ! But it takes a long time to figure out how to use it right . I 'm not a clumsy person and it took me an hour of chasing errant throws to do it right once . But that 's not the boomerang 's fault . The real problem is it gets boring . Not the company 's fault , but on the other hand , I kind of ca n't recommend buying it . Just a personal opinion .
5 #### Best cold weather coat for work . Two others confirmed not feeling freezing weather through this coat !
4 #### I hate my eyes getting old and nowhere was it more evident than when I was spearfishing . Fine adjustments on the gun were guesswork . Adding these to my mask cured that . Take care about washing them out of the mask .
5 #### Came as described , on time , and at a great price . Remember , green is medium strength -- so make sure you 're ordering the color you need for your type of therapy .
5 #### Solid and holds up to washing . The pocket is essential for cigars .
5 #### This is my third pair of Jungle Mocs . They are great for casual wear around the house or for neighborhood errands . I actually use one pair as slippers . They 're easy - on , easy off . Did I mention that they are extremely comfortable ? Rugged . Gripping the surface . All good . I will definitely buy additional pairs in the future .
5 #### Product works excellent . Easy assembly and comfortable in your hand . I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys fitness .
3 #### this blower is very loud , it works great , just very loud , i think it maybe defective , my nephew has 1 and its not this loud
5 #### these things are awesome - once you buy a set you 'll throw away all the other ropes you 've been using . Keeps the boat nice and centered in the dock slip and is the rope ends are the perfect size for all your boat and dock cleats .
4 #### This mylec net is a fun and cheap alternative to buying a metal version . The net is good quality and the only downside I 've experienced is a quick wrist shot or slapshot will dislodge the bottom pipes and do so regularly . This can be fixed with the glue / apoxy that is commonly used with PVC but you 'd lose the folding aspect of the net .
4 #### One of the lips was a little tattered , but honestly not that noticeable . Everything else was great .
2 #### Very unimpressed with this lock . If someone were to go out of their way to design a hitch lock that could easily be whacked off with a hammer , this is it .
3 #### You need to inflate it every night . Using it on a cot while out in the field . The built in pilow is eh I would buy one without the pillow
5 #### Ordered 2 sets for my personal training studio to use normally and for a homemade functional training rig ! They are awesome ! I like the metal clips on the end . It allows you to change handles and you can buy other types of handles to use with the bands !
5 #### A bit pricey compared to the other cotton briefs available but well worth it . The fabric is thicker , better quality than the cheaper ones ; the seams wo n't tear apart easily ; and the colors are neutral and wo n't show . Good product .
5 #### Bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son for Halloween . Fits great and the straps did not fall off his shoulder . At the end of the night , my husband put the wings on our Schnauzer dog and English Mastiff ... fit them too ! Next year , one of our dogs will be Buzz Lightyear !
5 #### Been using this the past week at work and it is great ! It is loud and clear . Perfect ! It also looks exactly like the picture posted above .
5 #### All you need to protect your head . Easy to fit , lower profile is nice .
3 #### I usually wear 11 in men 's , by reading the reviews I ordered an 11.5 , the shipping was great . The downfall is they fit big , with jeans they look fairly good because the back half is covered , with shorts they look like clown feet . I can only wear jeans with these white chuck 's which is depressing to me . I 'm more of a shorts , T - shirt guy . My suggestion is to order your REGULAR SHOE SIZE .
5 #### This is an extremely comfortable ' low volume ' scuba / snorkeling mask . I want to emphasize comfort , because it fits beautifully on the face ( even my large one ) . The seal does not let any water and comfortably sits and seals around the eyes . The outer shell and strap is silicone , as well as the nose seat . Low volume means that the lenses sit closer to your face than a typical snorkel mask , and that can be a good or bad thing . If you sweat the lenses get more foggy , if you do n't you feel closer to the water . For me , I prefer the lower volume as if feels more that you are swimming without any headgear on . Simplistic , well made and comfortable .
5 #### My daughter loves the converse brand she was very happy when she got another pair !
5 #### It appears real good and I kove it cuz it is the best converse .
5 #### It 's a big dense piece of rubber . No visible flaws or defects that lead me to believe it wo n't last for years . It 's heavy , you can probably bludgeon a man to death with it . If used properly it 's a great forearm workout . If used improperly , you wo n't see much benefit from it . It 's like people who think the ab wheel is a piece of cake , until they are taught how to properly use it . Would recommend and buy again .
5 #### Great shirt . Great brand . Durable . I own several of these .
5 #### I love this watch ... it can be casual or dressy . Did have to have 2 links removed to fit , but that 's no big deal . Love the Indiglo feature . Very happy with this purchase .
5 #### This pair of pants are very durable , Love the vintage Vietnam war tiger stripes . Adjustable sizer on each side can adjust waist size up or down to cover weight gain or weight loss .
5 #### the only bra i wear . fits great and stays great
1 #### This is not the old Coleman products we all knew from past camping . fishing etc . The metal side wind shields are made cheap and one of the brads holding one side on was already broken when received . The other side and any similar fasteners would not have lasted either . Sorry to say can not recommend and sorry to see a great name fall to this sort of manufacturing . Returned to Amazon .
5 #### My lil girl ( 8yrs ) was so excited when she received this watch as a Christmas gift . She has n't taken it off since putting it on . She runs around the house telling people what time it is all day long . Great watch and great design ! Highly recommend this for anyone with a little one eager to grow up .
4 #### I prefer W but it is n't made in this gray color . Because of the elastic goring the shoe can expand to be wide enough .
5 #### These are the most comfortable shoes I 've used for working out . Extremely light weight and flexible . Loved them so much I purchased two more pair in different colors .
4 #### Great band especially for tennis elbow . I use this when I get my first sign of tennis elbow after playing a lot of tennis . It definitely make it feel better .
4 #### I bought this for my niece for her birthday , and we had loads of fun with it . Not too big so if you only have 3 adults you can still get the effect of the chute . Kids love playing and running under it while it falls .
5 #### Just got them a week or so ago , but so far they are a great shoe . My husband has had issues with the bottom wearing away from the side of the shoe with other brands , but I am hopeful that wo n't happen with the Sperrys .
5 #### Perfect for little league and the padded seat is a bonus ..
5 #### I 've had this mat for 5 years , and thought I should put in my two cents . It 's a perfect exercise mat , much better than exercising on carpet and likely much better than those thin roll - up things . We even took it to a party at a campground to be sure we 'd have something comfortable to sit on . I keep it propped against a wall in the hallway , and the handles make it convenient and easy to carry . It 's the perfect size and I am completely satisfied with this purchase .
4 #### it was very good , just a little big on me.it arrived on time , i love my chucks , i m not sure if its just my issue but you should try ordering something a little smaller on your usual size , mine ca n't go any lower since i 'm a size 5 unless i order in the kids section
5 #### Incredibly comfortable even when damp . Hiking over my entire vacation and I am so happy I bought these two pairs .
4 #### Good light weight shoe ... had to add insole for more support .
1 #### I wanted this for Xmas 2013 for traveling and kicking around in . The battery died 4 months after I got it . I had to take it to 3 jeweler 's before I found one that could get the back on it after changeling the battery . Now I have had it for 8 months and either the battery has died AGAIN or the watch has . I also was not happy with the quality of the band . I am not a particularly picky person about stuff like this but this watch has been a total pain . I realize it was very inexpensive but not if you face the batteries every 4 months !
5 #### Rugged and good looking ..... why wear an expensive watch when you can get this good looking little workhorse that shines in the dark ?
5 #### This is my second Suunto watch , Everything is as I expected . This time I bought the watch with the metal case ; smaller than the previous watch , but the numbers are large enough to see at night with the back light with out my glasses . All in all ; I am very pleased with my choice and the product . ub
5 #### These are great skates . Both of my daughters have them , and I even have a pair . I 'm getting ready to order another pair for my youngest because she has outgrown hers .
5 #### This works great ! I used it for 2 camping trips . The only thing about it that I do n't like is it is difficult to maintain a low flame . I turn it down and it turns itself back up . I will find it handy during power outages too .
5 #### Perfect for my 5 year old to shoot with her bow .
2 #### What I wanted was the queen size knee - highs . There was no place to order that .
5 #### I now own an igloo playmate mini , pal and the elite . I was once confused bout the sizes but I 'll explain the difference and review this product the elite . The mini is the smallest and is fine for small lunches and daily use . The pal is a little bit bigger and is good for a big meal for one person or maybe 2 people . Now this product the ELITE is big enough to fit either of the other two inside of itself . I have a large family ( 2 adults 4 kids ) and last summer we went on a vacation where we brought lunch food and had to carry a days worth of food for six people daily . We had a huge cooler that was too much to pack everyday and way too big for daily use . I bought our elite at Wal - Mart for $ 11.00 and my fide loves it ! ! We can back 8 - 12 sandwiches , fruit , water , juices cookies and more . It kept every thing cool despite the 90 - degree weather . We did n't even have a lot of ice in it , just cold water bottles and one blue ice pack and everything was great . I 'm very happy with mine !
4 #### I really liked my older timex watch better but since you no longer have it this was the next best thing . It looks very nice but too big for me . I have very small wrists .
5 #### I bought these for my wife . She saw them in the store but did not have their size so i ordered on amazon . She loves them . She already had for a couple of months and no complains at all . One of her favorites shoes for running or for her job since she walks a lot in the warehouse . Now she loves me more . :)
5 #### What else needs to be said ? Superior stitching , heavy grade cotton , chest pocket , dark , solid color . NOTE : Carhartt , like Dickies , runs their sizes a little larger than printed . So for me the XL was PERFECT as I generally wear XXL from other brands ...
4 #### he loved it . he wears it all the time ... i believe everyday.he wrks at Papa Johns and was getting the flour it it so he had to clean it but loved it .
5 #### I had a healthy back bag years ago . I wore it out and moved on to buying purses that were just OK . When I found the Healthly Back purses on Amazon , I was very happy . I 'm glad they have different sizes , my original purse was a bit large . The smaller size is just perfect and the fabric is great . Will definitely buy another one just to have several colors to use throughout the year .
5 #### This was a fine shoe and not some cheap knock off . Would buy them agian
4 #### I used this reel this past spring and caught quite a few fish with it , mostly bass in the 2 - 4 lb range . It held up very well and I plan on using it again next year . The reason I got it was that I needed a reel that would cast very small lures for lure shy bass and this reel definately delivered . It was even better than I thought it would be . I changed the line on it when I got it , but that 's it .
5 #### Very satisfied with the rings . The fit and finish are top notch ! I have been running them for a few months and since mounting them they have not shifted at all after numerous shots . The plastic insert system I found to be very good ! ! It allows slight compression for a very tight fit without marring your scope in any way . Also , you can purchase additional offset inserts to compensate for any elevation or alignment issues you may have . Highly recommended ! !
5 #### These are standard well made tennis balls , but the price of less than two dollars a can ca n't be beat which is why I am giving it 5 stars .
2 #### No way were these a size 5 . Very unhappy little girl at Christmas . Had to return , could not replace . Had to buy locally .
5 #### Fast shipment , well packed , good price , product as promised all a customer can ask for
2 #### Dog did not adapt to it , it appears to cause an itch and discomfort .
5 #### These along with Plano hard cases are cheap insurance for a move ! We just moved from Seattle to Austin and I packed my rifles in this combo and they made it across country unscathed , also kept my guns from creating safe bumps , scratches etc on each other .
5 #### I have purchased these in the past at Walmart and was pleased but the price here was even better . Looking forward to getting out soon and getting some practice in .
4 #### I bought these as a gift for a working man who really uses his feet and he said they are very comfortable . Very pricey though the quality is there . Would love to see a price break on some of these or an Amazon deal of the day .
4 #### Use my Keens instead of tennis shoes for my walking ( average 6 miles / day ) and work outs . Love them .
1 #### Do not buy this if you plan on trying to tie your boat to the dock . You are much better off with the standard dock lines . Although I love the Airhead brand these just not cut it .
5 #### The shoe looks as described at Amazon . I really wanted the 12 1/2 size but it would not have been eligible for the free shipping and two day delivery because Amazon does not stock that size but can get it from another store . The shoe is tight but is not uncomfortable even after long periods of standing and walking around . I think I will like this shoe unless it has traction problems on wet surfaces . Other reviews do n't seem to indicate that .
5 #### This chalk is so awesome that I just ordered it and have n't gotten it yet but still am sure that it is awesome . I have no doubt as to its chalkiness .
5 #### Great product . Easy to use , sticks well , and excellent for practice
5 #### so comfortable and so cute I can wear them with anything .
5 #### Excellent for the price . Read others reviews and pulled the trigger . I wear a 7 5/8 hat size , that is about as big as it will fit if you are more oval than round headed . My opinion for you other big guys shopping for a bike helmet that you do n't have to spend $ $ $ .
1 #### Wrong item , did not work for the treadmill we have .
5 #### Product is Unisex size 45 M. Fits perfectly for clogs and is very comfortable to walk in . Excellent shoes .
5 #### Best shoe in the world ! I have 15 different colors !
5 #### Have worn these for years , good consistent support . I 've tried a number of different brands of support hose over the years and these seem to be the best for the price .
5 #### My wife loves these shoes . We have both been wearing sketchers and new balance for several years and recently we have both purchased Nike . There is a reason why Nike is still number 1 after all these years , you just ca nt beat their comfort .
4 #### Anyone with kids has probably gone through a few of these . I picked this up on sale for $ 19.00 during the holidays and it is your classic well built and useable razor scooter .
3 #### Pros : 1 . slim design 2 . large enough to hold my Xperia Z w space to spare for car key flob etc 3 . separate mesh compartment to hold loose items Cons : 1 . it bounces and there is no way to secure at the waist without it bouncing 2 . no holes for phone to acquire GPS for running apps to get a fix on my location 3 . lack of built in rubber belts or hooks to stash the extra material from the belt I probably wo n't get it again for the price it is offered . Perhaps at half the price I will . The search for the perfect belt continues .
5 #### Plain Jane minimalist level for those long shots or just leveling your scope . Well designed aluminum unit not over - built but good enough for most .
4 #### Fit is a bit generous , leaning toward the large side of Medium but I liked it .
5 #### We proudly display at our front door . It 's plastic and a little thin but we love it ! Go Broncos !
5 #### Purchased this for my boyfriend 's birthday ; usually he complains that t - shirts are too short , yet this one in tall is too long ! Next time I will purchase a large . Overall , he loves the shirt and we will be purchasing more in different colors for himself and other men in our family !
5 #### Works great boiling a pint of water in any Esbit stove . Get a bunch before they jack up the price .
5 #### Cute and comfortable . However I did order up 1/2 size because this style runs shorter than the whisper style . I have owned many pairs of this brand shoes and have learned from my own experience with the Venice shoes . Very happy with the 9.5 fit .
5 #### I love these adorable shoes . I bought them for my niece . The only complaints I have are that they are a little difficult to get on , and the size is a little too big , but otherwise they are great .
5 #### Have four of these , one in each of my emergency bags . Love that they are crushable but still usable and very serviceable . Enough brim for some sun protection and the hat still gives some rain protection . I sprayed it with more waterproofing .
5 #### Folks , what more we can say about converse ? its a classic ! its GOOD , GREAT , good quality , in love . Everyone must have one . My experience its a great shoe and resistent - the most important .
3 #### These are okay ... I bought them for everyday wear ... I had a pair of Saucony Jazz shoes when I was much younger that I wore out until they were completely dead so I thought I would give these a try . Sadly , these hurt my feet after a day at work . Granted ... I do not work " normal " hours and my feet can be very picky . ( I work very long shifts and have flat feet :) ) They just do n't offer enough shock absorption or cushion for all day wear and I would definitely never consider running in them as I have seen some people mention . I do n't think they were worth the money to be honest . Also , I know I usually EVENTUALLY will get stinky feet but not within weeks of owning shoes . These do n't breathe right , or the fabric must absorb all my sweat because they really do n't smell good and normally that wo n't happen to me for a VERY long time with shoes . I do appreciate that they are vegan and the style is great , but other than those two positives , they are just a mediocre shoe .
4 #### Should have a size chart on site . I researched the internet and thought I found right size but they were kinda small . I can still wear them though
5 #### I put this scope on my Savage .17HMR . Had a little difficulty getting it idaled in , but once we got it there ... WOW ! ! ! ! it has held zero and is everything I need for some target shooting and plinking .
2 #### I returned these as they were not true to size . They ran large .
4 #### The Celestron Ultima 100 zoom spotting scope . This spotting scope right here is built very good . It has all the essential things that you need in glass , in lens optics , and overall design . They did their homework and made a good product at a reasonable price . To me , Celestron is a trusted company of optics . It is made in China , but what is n't made in China . Evidently they know what they 're doing . I love this thing . I have a kind of a compulsion of collecting optics and zoom lenses for cell phones , astronomy . Anything I can put a lens on ! Or get to view through . I 'm addicted to it ! But the images are very , very clear and overall function works great . I have zero complaints so far . I think this thing can take a beating and that tells me its built to last . It feels well - made . If you want the biggest bang for the dollar , this is your scope at 309.00 . Yes , 300.00 is a lot of money to anyone , in my opinion . But if you like your hobby , then why not ? You will be in the upper - middle end of spotting scopes . I recommend it ! And enjoy it !
5 #### Very warm and super comfortable ! Will buy over and over ! Kept my neck and lower face warm in a -25 degree deer stand in Wisconsin
3 #### I use this all the time on road trips during the summer . Have not tried the heating version yet . The cooler works well and I 've had no serious problems yet . The only downfall , in my opinion , is that the connection cable is made very cheap and is not durable . If you are a " rough and tough " type then be sure to baby this cable !
4 #### I wear a hat to most Saints games and got this for my hat ( it 's a Fedora that was my dad 's ) . Pin works great , although the little grabbers on the clip do n't always lock in place or I d have given it 5 stars . I worry a bit about losing it but not too much . It costs about .88 more than a beer at the Superdome . And lasts longer ( and less filling ) . :-)
5 #### This limb saver will save your shoulder this is a great product at a reasonable price highly recommend .
5 #### Yes , I would recommend this item . It arrived as advertised , on time , safely packaged , and I had no issues at all . I would def do business with this company again . Excellent product ! ! -Jim :-)
5 #### Great hammer . I use it for my pins , even roll pins . There is never any damage to the pins , or my pin punch set . Good weight and not too heavy , perfect for precise , controlled taps .
5 #### My husband loves these pants . He is a professional mover and the pockets come in handy for his cutting knife and his phone . The quality is excellent -- very durable . They 've held up well after several washings . Wish they came in a shorts version .
5 #### Like the watch but took the band off and put a zuni made watch band on it . Looks really pretty . I like the indiglo style .
2 #### My son loves them ! Got them for his dance group uniform , but he wears them everywhere .
4 #### Fit is a bit snug , but it works . Made well .
2 #### They look nice but do n't fit . I asked for a 8.5 womens & was sent 8.5 mens . Very dissatisfied :( .
5 #### My daughter wanted these & I am very pleased with perfect fit , great condition & received on time .
5 #### Carhartt makes great products , and these pants are no exception . The double front is stiff , going up and down stairs or ladders is a little uncomfortable after a while . Working in the woods with the chainsaw it is nice to know there is the extra layer of protection below my chaps , and working in the dirt I 'm not worried about wearing out the knees . Over 25 years of wearing their products and the quality remains high , and that is so nice when so many other products and companies have lost their way making inferior products from their originals . The one thing to know about Carhartt bibs , pants , and shorts is that they run a size or two bellow others . I will wear a 36 in all my other pants , but a 40 for Carhartt .
4 #### The bluejeans fit fine . As well as expted , really . I always have to alter them a tad . They 're quite comfortable . There was no hassle with the delivery of the jeans . I am completely satisfied with my Wrangler Jeans .
5 #### I 'm new to archery . But it did n't take long at all to fall in love . You do n't need to spend a bunch of money . This release is perfect .
5 #### I would like to return them and get a larger size .
4 #### Well made product that aims naturally and does what it says on the box . One feature rarely noted in the comments : this is a sturdy but very light weight slingshot ( unless you 're going to pack the handle with ammo , which will make a racket ) . It folds down to a very manageable size , making it easy to pack in a coat pocket or EDC bag . The leather pouch is a bit small and the bands are fairly low powered . But for recreational plinking , this is a good choice .
5 #### I have 1500 miles on this rack so far , and I load it down pretty heavily with four bikes . I love this rack , especially for the money . With this , I feel confident taking our bikes on nearly every road trip we take . The straps are starting to show some wear , so I try my best to be careful so they 'll last as long as possible . I see getting another 1500 miles before running into trouble . I use this on a 2000 Toyota Sienna , and it looks like it was made for it . It 's a challenge to get four bikes to fit on there ( at first ) . There is a learning curve , but once you figure out how to arrange the pedals and which direction to face the handle bars , you can load the bikes pretty quickly . Just experiment until they fit just right . Yes , you 'll look out your rear view mirror for the first 20 miles , but worry not . Those bikes are n't going anywhere .
3 #### My make up falls out of it all the time . Not great at containing smaller items in the pocket area but would be nice if all your throwing in there is a phone or larger items .
4 #### I have many pairs of Merrill shoes and really like how they fit and feel .
5 #### a little long fitting , " did not like " ...... but real tough you ca nt go wrong with this pant you will keep coming back
5 #### Rugged , Low - maintenance , Heavy - duty Shirts from Carhartt I 'm very careful about the way I spend money these days , and I 'm picky about the quality of my clothes . The only T - shirts I buy any more are from Carhartt , as I can depend on the heavy cloth and stable colors to survive many washings and still look good . I recommend Carhartt over any other apparel .
5 #### Love these panty hose . can not find them in stores anywhere . glad to find them online . the color barely there is a brown shade for women of color .
3 #### I always get a half size up in my tennis shoes . For some reason these feel to big in the heel area and wide .
1 #### I only got one ... assumed two would be there . to have to switch from ankle to other I did n't like
3 #### These shoes are unintentionally meant for lifting , specifically squatting . If you need shoes to do back squats with then Chuck Taylors are great becaue they provide you with a hard , flat heel , and they are fairly cheap . I personally like the high tops a lot better because they give you extra anckle support , not to mention they look way cooler too . I bought a red pair of low tops and though I looked ridiculous in them so I returned them . The red color does n't look as cool as the picture online does , they look like cambells soup shoes . In terms of comfort they are not good at all . The toe area is long and a bit narrow so the sides will may rub against your little toes and give you blisters . As for the sizing , for anyone who does n't know the sizing chart is horrible . I typically wear a 12 in mens and I fit into an 11 in these , I should probably be a 10.5 but the sides would rub against my toes to point where I would not be able to wear the shoes . I ended up buying the high - tops after returning these and I think they are pretty good for squats , my form is better and I can lift more because of it . I would not recommend these for anything other than lifting , if I was to wear these around all day my feet would hurt and be badly blistered .
5 #### I bought this ball for my son and I to play catch with . I had forgotten the difference between Official League Baseballs and Little League baseballs . This was just what I needed so my son can make the transition from Little League to High School ball .
5 #### What more , can I say .... I have been wearing Chuck Taylor Hi - Tops for many years ..... classic design and comfortable feel .
5 #### got ta love the wolverines ! goes perfect with my fairway stand bag and mdivot tool ball marker ! can not complain ! the golf balls i will NOT hit though because i do NOT want to disgrace my blue ! that 's why i have the spartan balls to destroy them from hitting it lol
5 #### I love these , I had the previous iteration ( or maybe two earlier ? ) and finally wore them out after several years . They are definitely a light - weight training shoe so I would n't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running . But this also makes them extremely comfortable , I had n't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these . Good support and my feet stay cool all day , also noticeably light but well - made and long lasting . I have worn them hiking in a pinch but do n't really recommend it because the material is mesh - like and will let a lot of dirt in . But if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further .
5 #### I 'm 6'6 " and need the extra length . These are great t - shirts that fit well , wear well and will last forever . I wound up buying a total of 6 to replace my tatered old t - shirt collection and these should last and last .
2 #### After only 1 use the black lines are wearing off . It came flat(which did not loose it any stars but some families might expect their basketball to be ready to use upon arrival ) and I am not quite sure if it is holding its air well .
3 #### Way to large . I have the Moab Ventilator same size which are very comfortable . These were too big even with heavy socks . Probably ok with better sizing . Merrill makes great shoes
5 #### This is a very well - built and durable hand gripper that I expect to last for a long time . I expected my grip to be a little bit stronger , for context I deadlift around 345lbs , but the Point Five was still quite a challenge to close even once . The only thing I did n't really love about the Captains of Crush grippers is that they seem to like using the metal equivalent of sandpaper all along the handles . If you like developing calluses ( as I do ) you wo n't mind this at all . If you do n't like tearing up your hands you might want to look for a different grip or wrap some tape around this one . * * If you find my review useful , please let me know by clicking the helpful button ! :) * *
4 #### I 'm 260 lbs and this bag holds up fairly well but still moves around quite a bit when full of water . It works well for the kids . Great bag for getting exercise or taking out your aggressions .
4 #### Bought this for my wife to hit flyballs to our kids ......... great idea and it works just fine .
5 #### If you 've ever tried to light a fire in the wilderness you know it can be a challenge- especially if what you are working with is the least bit damp and even if you are working with matches or a lighter . These keep a flame for much longer than a match or even trying to keep the tab held down on a lighter , giving your tinder a chance to catch . Highly recommended for your survival kit .
4 #### I really liked these but they were a little small for me . I can still wear them but it does n't fit as well as my other converse . I am generally a size 8 in woman 's , but since this was a men 's size 6 it was a little too small . I would recommend only men getting these because the sizing is for them or woman who actually know what size they are in men 's . Do n't just choose the recommended size , it is not exactly the same for woman . Otherwise I am pretty happy . They are good material and are exactly what expect from converse . Also the people who sent these to me got to me on the day that was promised .
1 #### I bought these for work . They fit and feel great . Last week in the morning I noticed a small hole on my knee . By the end of the day the small hole was not small , my entire knee was exposed , every time I bent down or squatted the hole just got bigger . Now I have a small hole just above my knee on the second pair . It was the size of a pencil tip this morning . Now it is the size of a 2 entire pencils and getting bigger . I have never seen this before . I was not at work today and just cleaning around the house . In both cases I do n't know what even caused the hole . I have one pair left . I will see what happens . I have worn wrangler before and never had this problem . I got these because they stated rugged . I threw the first pair out because I could not wear them to work , I am saving the second pair , but as of now I ca nt wear them to work . Looks very unprofessional . I do n't complain often but I am at a loose for these jeans crumbling .
5 #### Same product I used to purchase at a dept . store
5 #### Got this set for my dad for Christmas a couple years ago and he loves them ! They were the perfect gift for a golf lover/ Wolverine fan !
3 #### Trying to put it together was interesting but finally it all worked .
3 #### I do n't know what the style / type difference is since I do n't have the packaging with me to compare , but I was hoping these are the ultrathick , ultra - heavy - duty kind I usually find at Costco during the winter months -- sadly , they were not . These are still good , solid tights . But they do n't have quite the " bullet - proof ' feeling ( nor the warmth , nor the level of control - ness ) that the others do . Ah well . These are a good fall / year - round tight , I guess ; but the super opaque Costco ones are what 's needed when it gets below freezing .
3 #### My wife collects fishing lures . I thought this would be good to to add to her collection . I am going to try it out on fish tonight
4 #### Great product - but like most shoes , far too expensive given what I know it costs to make them
5 #### I like the fact that Carhartts use the " true waist " , which is higher than the hip - hugging waistline of other pants . If you work for a living , you 'll understand what I mean . More support , no digging in of the waistline into the hips , and no plumber 's crack . These pants definitely hold up to landscaping work , made of tough material but still comfortable and stylish .
5 #### This was a birthday gift and she LOVES it :)
5 #### Very nice looking watch to wear to both work or special occasion . Very pleased with item .
3 #### We left it on the porch with the gardening stuff . The rubber tubing was destroyed by sunlight within a month and crumbled away . Nice product for the money , but store it indoors .
3 #### Nice optics especially for the price . A little big and heavy probably the largest scope you would use on the range . Lack of a rotating band is a big minus .
5 #### I bought this utility lift to store a small 125 - lb paddleboat in my barn . The barn currently does not have electricity available , and a chain hoist is impractical for this particular use . The most important feature was the weight capacity , as I do n't want the lift straps or hardware breaking and falling onto someone or something . Some of the installation directions could have been more specific , but after reading it a few times , I was able to understand what to do for each step . How easy installation will be depends upon where you plan to install the lift . The directions are intended for installation in a garage so that you could drive your vehicle in , hook up the straps , and lift the boat off the vehicle . The lift is designed so that the next time you want to use the boat , you simply lower it back onto your vehicle , secure it , and go about your business . In my barn there is 8 feet between trusses , so I had to build a frame for it . I think that potential buyers should know that if you intend to use this in a location other than a garage , basic carpenter skills and tools will be needed . Overall quality is excellent , and it easily lifted the boat . I rated it excellent because overall it works as expected , and the hardware , ropes , and overall design quality are excellent .
5 #### Purple and pink grips work great . For some reason the red Yonex grip bleeds and it does n't have the stickiness of the pink or the purple .
5 #### I can not find jeans in town that are size 30 " x 34",so I was happy to find them in this size .
5 #### Around the water a lot and feel the need to have something to help if something should happen . This is well made and worth the cost to have safety on the pier or on the boat .
2 #### Some what large fit . Product sturdy , durable and well made so far , customer service poor .
4 #### Was trying to just find regular relaxed fir Wrangler jeans but could only find the " rugged wear " style and the price was right so we purchased them for work clothes . Fit is good , I actually think they look better on my husband than the other Wranglers he wears . He likes them . The only problem he states , is that the color is not the same as the other similar style of Wranglers .
5 #### Leather strap is great since I ca n't wear any of the metal ones & I love the night light . Hard to find a watch that I can read in the dark ! Nice size !
5 #### I love these undergarments ! The color is lighter than shown but , it is still a lovely pink . They are thin and so comfortable . I 've only tried them in mildly cold days ( 30 F ) . Because of how thin they are , I 'm afraid to try them in anything colder . They are so thin and comfortable , that you forget they are even there . I 'm 5 ' 3 " and about 135lbs . and the small fit great ! Cons : Snag easily
1 #### I would recommend that women not purchase these shoes unless you 've tried them on or have had a pair in the recent past because of the unusual fit due to the conversion from men 's to women 's sizes . They have some arch support , but are not particularly comfortable either .
5 #### This is a great watch to wear with anything . The dial is a great size . The numbers are easy to read and the indiglo feature is very helpful in the dark . The elastic band is a good fit for a guy with a regular wrist . If you are very skinny or very fat you might want to try it on in a store first . It just feels right on your wrist .
5 #### Same 4 year olf got this so he would NOT feel unloved with the birth of his new twin bro & sister . He DOES wear it to bed ! AND most of the time unless mom needs to go somewhere . HUGE hit - made pretty darn good too !
3 #### Not the same thick well woven high quality cotton I 'm use to getting from Russell . Hard to find good quality shirts these days . Amazon was good to me so I keep searching for the right weight and style . Appreciate Amazon CS
5 #### I am knitting a bronco 's colored sick and cashmere infinity scarf for my grand daughter . This pin will hold it in place nicely
4 #### Watch arrived quickly . Packaged good . Battery was n't dead upon arrival like other reveiwers experienced . However , did die about two weeks after purchase ... lol ... thats why I gave it 4 stars not 5 . Good tool to teach my daughter how to tell time and has held up good . Washed the band in the dishwasher and held up fine .
3 #### I like the shoe but am having a hard time breaking them in . Getting blisters from them as the rub high on the heal . I 've worn with socks ( yuck ) and without . I 'd like to give them a 4 or 5 star rating but ca n't .
5 #### It is an excellent watch with a lot features at a low price . Buy it .
2 #### I have owned several Rat - L - Traps usually bought from local store and have been happy with them . Looking for some large saltwater lures I decided to try Amazon . These lures look like seconds . The painting is horrible . One is without any paint at all . All 3 of the lures I ordered have some sort of issue , bad paint , dirty , plastic tags , etc . Shipping - even though all three were ordered at the same time they showed in 2 packages , not big deal except for one was in a padded envelope and looked like it had been run over by the delivery truck ( I understand that may not be Amazon 's fault ) . Long story short I will go back to purchasing lures in person at the store .
2 #### When we got the correct size , they seem to be okay . My husband did say he 's feeling a little pressure near the Gore point on one foot . We are hoping it loosens up with just a little wear .
5 #### Best compass - I have its compliment without the mirror . That is the one I use most often . I typically do not need to navigate with the precsion that a mirror might be useful .
3 #### This shirt is hot salmon , if there is such a color . It is the typical travel shirt in all respects , except the gut of the shirt is too loose like most travel shirts . But I can never where this while actually traveling for it will certainly get everyone 's attention while passing through security , walking through airports , standing in crowds , and anywhere else you happen to be when traveling . It is OK to where out in the day or evening to the right affair . It is not the right shirt for the modest at heart .
4 #### Great shoes and very comfortable . However I ordered the charcoal gray and they are not the same as I was expecting to see from the online photos . I was expecting more grayish black like the photo but they came more clay/ gray color . Other than that I would give it 5 stars .
5 #### This is one of my favorite bras so far . Highly recommended for busted women .
3 #### I got these to try , because many people like them . I found them hard to ignite . You may have better luck , or you may want to try something else .
5 #### I ordered a 1/2 size smaller than my usual size , and they are perfect . These shoes are hard to find . Great customer service as well .
1 #### It was too tight and not relaxed fit at all . I also ordered Dickies Men 's Relaxed Fit Pant which fit perfectly .
5 #### This is my second hammock , the first was an Equip brand that I picked up at Walmart . This one is bigger and stronger and does n't stand out like a sore thumb because it has nice subdued colors . I will admit that I did n't even use the supplied ropes and instead installed a pair of Infinity brand whoopie slings . It was comfortable and large but not very heavy .
5 #### These shoes were purchased by me for my grandson , and he loves them ... he says they fit well and feels good . There 's only one problem ; he now wants them in several other colors ! !
5 #### Good product . Does what it 's supposed to do and that is really all you can ask for . Good price good service .
5 #### I love these targets . At only 3 - inch diameter , they are best suited for a laser or iron sights at 7 - 25 yards , but you could use them at a greater distance with a longer range scope . They stick well and do n't peel off even after being drenched in the rain . I 've used a number of reactive - type targets , but these are the most reactive and visible targets I 've used . These are a bargain compared to the quality and cost of other targets . Recommended .
4 #### The hose are great in quality . They are n't quick to snag or run and they look good on . The only issue is that they run small and the sizing guide on Amazon is not correct . Please see my photo for the sizing guide that is on the package . Go by this and you will be right as rain .
5 #### This pair fits perfect ..... the first pair was wrong size in the right box ..... definitely order again ! ! ! ! !
4 #### I had heard from other people that Keens were very versatile and comfortable and they were right ! I can wear them all day long . They have a very generous toebox which I personally like . The straps on top of the foot are adjustable and I did almost immediately had to loosen them . Much better now . I am definitely a fan -- they are good for walking and I look forward to seeing how they do on rocky trails , etc .
5 #### I do weekly AT hikes about 10 miles at a time . Absolutely no sweaty feet and wrinkled toes hiking in 95 degree heat with high humidity . No blisters , nothing negative to say . I have the socks coupled with Merrel boots . Seem to be a great fit together .
5 #### These are the best shoes I have ever use for my workouts ! ! ! I love them and buy them in bulk ! ! ! LOL
5 #### Seriously , though , carhartts double fronts are THE work pants . They 're kind of a cross between a pair of pants and a battle - armor suit . I 'm a carpenter and have been wearing carhartts for years . I 'm already a big fan . I bought these from amazon because I ca n't find my size at retail stores . FYI , carhartts fit differently than other pants . I take a 32 " waste in levis , but a 31 in Ben Davis 's and a 30 " in Carhartts .
4 #### Bought for cosplay . They 're a bit flat and narrow ( I have very wide feet ) , but nonetheless they fit pretty well and I get the feeling once I 've worn them awhile my feet will settle in . I have had no problems wearing them all day for my classroom but I also do n't walk around much .
4 #### Bought these for my husband for Tai Chi . He is a 9 - 1/2 and ordered a 43 . They fit fine except he has flat feet and normally wears a wide shoe . These shoes are narrow for him . They have no insert , , so they do not have any support . He says they will be fine and certainly worth the money .
3 #### Bought this for my son . It works , but it 's not a quality rope . It 's a tough balance when you buy your kids stuff , since their attention span is short and they grow like weeds .
5 #### Nice looking casual mens shoes . They were purchased as a gift for my father and he wears them often . He reports that they are comfortable and as supportive . They have held up well and still look new !
5 #### I 'm old . I need these things to keep my fingers from turning white .
5 #### Shirt tail is long to keep tucked in your jeans . 2XL was also wide enough w/o being a sloppy fit . Material is comfortable after being washed . Carhartt quality is well constructed as always and what you expect from their brand .
5 #### Just like what I use to have . Great for outdoor cooking
5 #### Excellent product ; delivered on time and as described . No different between this release and the $ 75 releases available at big - brand stores . Allen Company makes very good products at affordable prices .
5 #### It 's funny how styles rotate back in time ! My daughter wanted these boots for Christmas . We wear the same size , so I know they will fit perfectly . These boots will make her Christmas !
5 #### I love my Merrell shoes I have 6 pares , the only shoe I ever buy if they have the style I like
5 #### I absolutely love this tool/ It has everything you could need in case of emergency . The tool is well made , I have abused it a little bit and it continues working without problems . The knife and the saw are very sharp , they cut effortlessly . This tool includes a pouch with a belt clip . For me , the clip is very convenient because I can put it on or take it off without undoing my belt . The clip itself is made in a way that it wo n't come off easily when you move around . The tool fits tight into the pouch .
4 #### My son loved it . We had a week where he wore it all day , every day . It 's not the greatest quality , but it works .
5 #### Get a half size smaller , they stretch some . Wear all the time .
5 #### Beautiful fit as well as great colors to compliment skin tones and outfits . Berkshire , in my opinion , has the best quality hosiery .
4 #### Even though the order said c / d , it came as a c. They are a tad tight , but do the job .
5 #### Very well made shirt . Feels like a very tough fabric but remains very light and breathable . I was surprised at how well these fit out the the box unfortunately they do shrink a bit when washed . Not an extreme amount of shrinking but if you are borderline size get the larger so that when it shrinks it will be just right .
5 #### I love these boots they are stylish and comfy . I wear a 8.5 in men 's and a 7 in kids still had a little room . Nice pickup !
5 #### They have been getting hard to find ; but I was so happy to see these on sale at the end of the season . I have tried them on and they fit like all my other Keen 's . Ca n't wait for next summer to start showing them off .
5 #### Am switching to overalls due to back injuries and I gain weight easy on chocolate . Overalls feel better , nice and loose on the hips , spine , back . I move easy . Wearing regular pants with a belt or ties on the waist to keep them up puts too much pressure on my spine and otherr bones in the waist , back and lower back . Throws my bones out of alignment . Got the idea from watching Tim on Moonshiners TV show . He looks so comfy .
1 #### I 've had Converse shoes that have lasted 20 years , but these only lasted a few wearings ( maybe 10 times ) before the soles were worn all the way through and the sides came unglued . Horrible quality . It makes me question whether these are real Converse . Do not buy these . They are a waste of money .
5 #### I love these shoes . I exercise in them as well as just take them on longer walks . Feels good , looks GREAT ! !
5 #### I just love this wallet ! It does n't take up much room in my handbag , for one thing . Best of all , it is so easy to use - everything seems to be in the most convenient place , for example the coin pocket right in front of where the bills are . I used this kind of wallet when I was growing up , but for some reason for many years I used clutch wallets that are about 8 " long and have all kinds of interior compartments . Now that I am using this billfold style again , I wonder why I ever bought anything else . This is so simple and convenient . And I love the wide choice of colors - I bought pink , my favorite . Anyway , ladies , I would give this one a try . I 'm so glad I did !
5 #### Nice fit for hubs . Not entirely happy with patter but not many choices or colors in his size . Roomy butt , thighs . If you or your man are bigger , consider this as a nicely priced short and they launder well . I 'm writing same review for all the items I 've purchased in this line as I did n't realize each item would pop up for review . How tiresome !
4 #### sturdy , lasted through burning man and I expect it to keep going . kind of hard to store once emptied , does n't fold too easily , but much smaller and simpler than water cooler type 5 gallon jugs
3 #### A little hard to put together . Instructions are ok , but the fit of the various pieces was off . It went together ok in the end , but a bit of a struggle . In the end though , it is good and works fine . Definitely a good way to organize all my golf stuff .
5 #### Beautiful watch . Velcro fastening . The second hand is a butterfly and the little tail follows or flowers follow the butterfly around the watch . Very unique .
5 #### Arrived on time . I use this at least 3 times a week . Gives me a good workout .
5 #### Super comfy , true Size , I use them for boot Camp , cross fit and they are great , absolutely recommended it .
4 #### I like this Turtle Neck Scarf because it is warm . I wish it was half the size because my neck is not that long ! When I walk in the cold , I feel better when my neck is warm . It will probably fit better for a big guy with a large neck .
5 #### Love the converse , always have . I think people either are or are n't fans and I 'm in the are category
5 #### they are easy to install , they are easy to sight . have not yet shot the gun to see if they move or how they react . they certainly priced right & arrived fast thanks Amazon as usual great performance .
5 #### Had n't worn pantyhose in years after living in very hot climates ... thanks for the right color hose at a great price !
4 #### Great targets for the price . Gon na shoot them full of holes and throw away so they work great for that .
5 #### Great product , does it catch fish . Not in the tackle box .
5 #### This product is nice looking and very easy to assemble . I had it up in 5 mins . The stakes work very well as I blasted very hard shot to test the durability and it stood up well . Great for the price too .
4 #### Solid little storage devices . I use mine to hold o - rings for my plugs and stretching set . Adequate for storing anything that fits in it .
4 #### The style is undeniable . Just beware that these run a size or two too big . I usually wear a 9 or a 9.5 and I had to order a 7.5 . Luckily I have narrow feet so these fit pretty well as far as width goes
5 #### I like this a lot works just as the seller described in there ad . I would buy this again for myself or a gift
5 #### I worried about this item as my child was in between sizes ( he 's a 4 T because he 's on the tall side but he 's very lean ) and since it was more expensive than I had originally been looking for , but this was a HUGE hit in my house . I loved the detail and how well made the costume was - the fabric was good quality , heavier than most cheap children 's costumes . The metal clasps on the jacket were adorable , although one of them was very difficult to get open and closed at first ( after working with it it 's becoming easier , but he still need an adult to do that particular closure . ) He LOVES this costume , and I would recommend it to anyone who has a little firefighter at home .
5 #### Great shirt , very rugged material , and solid stitching . This shirt is built to last . I ordered 6 in different colors .
4 #### This item is soft and thin , but very warm and wearable under most clothes . The material is similar to tights so you have to be careful not to snag the material .
5 #### Bought this item as a gift . The weight and feel are both very nice . I do n't do yoga , but I considered getting into it when I felt this mat .
5 #### I have only shot these tartgets once , but I am love'n them . I think they are the best deal I found , the anatomy is just a bonus for me .
5 #### Ordered these for my dad because he ca n't get them in the stores anymore . They were a perfect fit !
5 #### I 've owned this may for a year now and it 's great no sliding or slipping and still looks new ( I use Manduka mat wash ) I have not tried hot yoga but I 'm told you would still need a towel in that practice or you sweat a lot . This may be a bit much in regards to cost but this will be the last mat you will need .
5 #### High quality with more than enough helpful tools . Brought this on a recent camping trip and used it every day for various reasons . I chose this one over other similar models because it has the corkscrew and scissors , both of which I have used at home when I could n't find any others .
4 #### Purchased to go with a bow for our nephew 's Christmas present . They look perfect , and we 're sure he 'll enjoy them ! ! !
5 #### Burris Signature rings are the easiest to install . No lapping required and if you also have the Posaign Ring Insert Kit , the cross hairs can be almost in the center position when the gun is on target .
5 #### You just ca n't go wrong with Converse . Stylish and comfy .
5 #### Best summer shirt there is . I discovered these fishing shirts a couple of years ago , and after getting a few bits of skin cancer cut off me , I started wearing them all the time during the summer months . They are vented and actually cooler than wearing a tee shirt , plus they have the advantage of drying quickly if you get wet . I have n't had any problems with sunburn since I switched to them , which is another big bonus , PLUS they keep the mosquitoes from biting me so much . Like I said , I actually do n't wear any other shirts during the summer anymore . And I even wear them over my bathing suit when I go swimming . Suntan lotion always irritates my skin and it is a lot easier just to wear one of these shirts . In fact , I 've been buying a few each year and now have enough to last a week , so when I travel , I have enough to last me ( at least for a week ) . I do n't think you 'll be disappointed . They are well made and withstand even my work in the garden and around roses . And when I get too overheated , I squirt myself with the hose to cool off , knowing that the shirt will dry very quickly . Love them .
5 #### my teenager daughter loves these ! the are true to size and just like the ones i wore in high school !
5 #### I got this to sleep on when I go camping or visit my mom - it works well . Easy to blow up and deflate . I recommend .
5 #### These are perfect size for giving you a lift there very soft and made very well yes I would recommend this product
4 #### I had 2 kswis uproar VI , it was good shoe , but this one feels more stable right out of the box , slightly wider(just like the uproar)than other shoes witch i really like , i highly recommend
4 #### The extra panel makes these the greatest for those of us amply endowed . It is so nice to not have the seams in the back and crotch rip out before the rest of the nylon is hardly worn . I only gave it a 4 star review because little pulls do come fairly soon . I think I will try the full support ones and maybe this wo n't be an issue . Thanks for a great and much needed product .
5 #### We had the white for my son I. Kindergarten and I just bought the black for 1st grade . I had a hard time finding shoes that would last my boy the year , but k - Swiss delivers ! ! ! ! He tears shoes up , but these are up to the challenge ! !
5 #### I bought two of these chairs since they have the updated feet for sand . While they do work a bit better than straight feet and do distribute the weight , you still will dip and sink in deep sand . However on normal ground or typical camping dirt , these work good . I 've carried it backpack camping and it sure beats the lighter folding chairs that you use your sleeping pad to sit on . This chair lets you sit off the ground at a comfortable height to tend your campfires , eat , and enjoy . It is a huge difference between sitting on the ground level and sitting higher off the ground with a nice lean back angle . The carry sack mesh material lets out dirt and sand so that 's great . The carry handle loop is not sewn strong enough and it ripped from the sack easily . I hope they would have double / triple stitched it better or provide lashing loops so users can strap it to bicycle rear racks or to backpacks .
4 #### THe construction looks and feels good . Not sure it will last a long time but it is cool that it glowes in the datrk
5 #### Bought a pair to " try them out " ... will most likely buy another next time I need shoes .
5 #### I use these on a Armscor M-200 , great grip great price ! I also use this grip on my old Python , and have for 30 years . was happy to find this style grip still available !
4 #### Very comfortable and has a nice bottom to the shoes . Takes alot of pressure and I like the smoke color . The shoe seems to run a half size larger , as I always wear an 8 and these are a little to big , but I will keep them , I will wear a thicker sock . Better price then in the stores when I bought them .
4 #### well , converse all stars have never been big in the " support " department , but they are iconic and I slip in an insert and wear them happily .
4 #### If you 're out on the water - these are a must for every fisherman all year long . Layer properly in Fall / Winter and you 'll stay warm , dry and fish guts clean .. I pair these with XtraTuf boots and totally protected.<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/XTRATUF - Performance - Series-6 - 34 - Men - s - Full - Rubber - Ankle - Deck - Boots - Navy - Red-22733 / dp / B01E649ZXS / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">XTRATUF Performance Series 6 " Men 's Full Rubber Ankle Deck Boots , Navy & Red ( 22733)</a > I 'm 6 ' tall and medium is good length , although it 's a bit wide at the waist . Solved this with a simple clip I place on the back to cinch as tight as needed .
4 #### need a freaking wheel for a freakin scooter ... this is the way to go ! But this and keep rolling ! Pretty smooth !
3 #### LL Bean has generous sizing , and I 'm an XLT T - shirt with them . XLT from Carhartt is at least as big as XXL from LL Bean or larger . The logo also looks odd on a big man , as is the case with a lot of logo shirts , which is why I prefer to not have a logo . Material definitely feels very sturdy as expected from Carhartt , great price .
5 #### Was happy to have a chance to get t - shirts that cover plumber butt ! Strong and durable and quality all around .
3 #### she does like these but she has worn out a few pairs . so for the price they are good but higher price last way longer so in the end may be a better buy in reality . that said , we were satisfied with the value .
5 #### Cheap . Light . Easily adjustable . Comfortable . Good airflow . Gets the job done . Hopefully it 's ability to protect my head will not be tested .
4 #### No problems , received what I hoped for at a good price with quick delivery . Chose the green which was correct for me .
5 #### the kids enjoy using this to practice karate . I like that it goes all the way up to the adult size .
5 #### I simply love these World Class scopes . Clear views and great looks . I love the gloss finish with the gold lettering . These are definitely in a different class than standard Tasco scopes . Hard to find better scopes at these prices .
5 #### Very comfortable . Durable and great quality shoes . Will order again .
5 #### Great shoe for uniform for my daughter . They fit as expected .
5 #### Good hoses .. look good and feel good . Size is right for me .
5 #### Definatly not the best binoculars you can buy , but they are an amazing product for the money !
5 #### one of the best net I ever used . very strong and very durable . my only comment is that I wish they have one lighter with 3/4 pounds . the only one they have is 1.5 pounds which is kinda heavy for me . I use it for mullet in shallow water so no need for me for a heavy net .
3 #### I bought the x - small but it was still too roomy for my taste . I 'm usually a size 0 - 2 . If I 'm going to have a layer this thin , I want it to fit like pantyhose . It also has a pattern on it , kinda like snowflakes , but I wanted something plain .
5 #### I bought these for my husband , he loves them ! They fit great and he says they are really comfortable !
3 #### Super light and very comfortable . I 'm a runner and they lack a bit in arch support , so the soles of my feet are a sore . I 'm going to add an insert to try fix the problem .
5 #### My third pair and I wear them to do my 10,000 steps in a day ! Very comfortable .
5 #### These targets are great and I shoot these all the time . I was happy to find this deal on Amazon.com . Great price and fast shipping . Product arrived in a sturdy well taped box . I will buy more when I get low .
5 #### Put this on the ground , lay down on it , find you hot - spots , and savor the pain , as you roll around and break free all the knots in your back , .
5 #### was a great value when I bought them . the price varies so as long as its around $ 2 a can , I will continue to buy
4 #### I would have given it 5 stars but the turrets have some play between adjustment settings which I do n't like . I 've only had it out once ( ammo shortage ) , but shot 3 " groups with it at 100 yards with my AR on a bipod and standard ammo .
5 #### Not stylish , but I do n't care , these shoes just hug my feet and I love them . Have tried Simms shoes of similar design , also an excellent design , as is all their stuff , but I prefer the Keens .
3 #### The shorts seemed to be good quality , but ordered the wrong size . Did n't notice that when clicking on sizing guide , the default was for the women 's sizes . There was an entirely different tab for men 's sizes . My fault , but confusing nonetheless .
5 #### Tried them on in a store before buying online so I knew they 'd fit good . Overall I was looking for a durable cross training shoe that would hold up to my rigorous training and these have been great so far . They are really light and comfortable . Most importantly for me they have grips on the bottoms so my feet do n't slide out from under me while doing planks , push - ups , etc . Highly satisfied with this purchase .
5 #### I wear my first pair all the time when I 'm not in sandals or tennis shoes ; had them for about 4 - 5 years and love them still ( still in great shape as well , ca n't go wrong with Merrell ) . This is the first pair of shoes I 've bought from amazon but my other pair is the same model so it was a good bet they would fit the same and they do ! This pair has a really good saturated color and are just as comfortable as my first pair . Got them in 2 days with prime ; go prime ! ! ! I 'm a cable cutter so free 2 day shipping was an add - on that I 've enjoyed for a couple of years now .
5 #### I bought this for my grandson to get him ready for his first camping experience - and I wanted him to be super warm .
5 #### These are so bright and fun ! I wish they came in a waterproof variety for the pool .
5 #### Love these . Very comfortable right out of the box . I have several pair of Merrells in different styles ; these are among my favorites . I wear them around the house generally since they feel like slippers . You wo n't be disappointed with these .
5 #### I bought these along with a roll of tape , a bottle of solvent , a grip scraping tool , a rubber vice clamp and hook blades . Replaced my grips without a hitch . I really like being able to replace my grips at my convenience for about half the cost of getting someone else to do them .
5 #### Eddie 's happy great fit ... love it .. new shirt will replace the one I bought 30 yrs ago that 's identical to the new Cathcart tee Thanks Amazon & carhartt
5 #### Great product . Great value , ca n't beat the quality for the price .
2 #### What an absolutely crappy company . A number of people here have mentioned the button holes are too small for the buttons . That was my experience too . Called the company and spoke to a true airhead in Columbia customer service . Asked to speak to a supervisor and , after a long wait , an equally dippy person came on the line , completely dismissing my concern and responded by stating , " Well sir , I guess you should return it to Amazon . " She claimed they 've never had a complaint and when I referred her here to look at the concerns about button size relative to button holes , she could n't have been less interested . Fine by me , it will be returned in favor of a shirt made by a company that is actually interested in their products and possible manufacturing issues and treats their customer 's concerns with respect . What an awful business .
1 #### Very disappointed in the performance of this product really needed more power , is there any way you can suggest or give me the information on your best high powered product in this category please if so thank you in advance Amazon
5 #### This is truly one of the best training aids you can get for soccer . Basically it allows you to tether the ball to your body , providing more control for targeted training exercises . It 's difficult for me to judge at this stage just how durable this is going to be . That 's going to be a key element of this product 's value . But in terms of effectiveness , this is a great product .
5 #### Exactly what I was looking for . Everything you need and the bands seem very durable .
3 #### Loved the watch - the band was the problem . It would not stay clasped .
5 #### Well made . Fit my son very well ( 2 T ) . The cape was missing the velcro to hold it closed but we worked around it , and I bought some velcro tabs that I needed anyway . Boot straps on bottom were only good for Halloween night , but he does n't seem to mind . Fast shipping .
3 #### Needed a new flag for this football season . Bought this one . Good quality material but I live n a high wind area and the tab inside that the poles attaches to ripped way to easy .
5 #### Must have for rebuilding air rifles and HPA hand pumps . I purchased this to rebuild my Benjamin hand pump and also my Benjamin Marauder . Others swear by this stuff so i decided to purchase it . Comes in a nice little jar with screw on lid . Just remember that a little goes a long way . This jar should last me years !
5 #### Excellent grips . Perfect fit for the ATI Titan . This grip makes the short officer frame 1911 much more controllable . I love it .
5 #### This is a great boot and my son loved it . We live in Hawaii and went home for Thanksgiving to Idaho . Since my son had never worn boots like this we were concerned he would n't do well with them . But he really loved them and they survived two weeks in the rain and snow of Washington and Idaho . And they looked great on him ! I definitely recommend them .
3 #### It ca n't stretch enough to fit my rifle or shotgun with any accessories on it ( scope , bipod , sling , stock pouches , etc ) . Thankfully I have an air rifle it will be good for .
5 #### It is a Pelican case what is there not to like about it !
5 #### I gave these to my sons for Christmas 2014 . My older son carries this at all times , and my teen son carries this everywhere but to school , where ts not allowed . Well crafted and very useful multi - tools .
5 #### I love them ! They fit perfect and are very comfortable ! !
5 #### AWESOME pants as I have written about before . The double knee work great when I ride my MC and keep my knees warm
4 #### The hose are great in quality . They are n't quick to snag or run and they look good on . The only issue is that they run small and the sizing guide on Amazon is not correct . Please see my photo for the sizing guide that is on the package . Go by this and you will be right as rain .
5 #### I have worn Jockey for ladies for years and these are made the best yet with the cotton covered elastic waist band .
5 #### This is our second . We have one upstairs and one in the playroom . Our son has ADHD and as he is almost 9 , we have to keep getting bigger mini tramps to help him work out the wiggles . I love this style , as there are no springs , so nothing to rust or get feet stuck in . And bigger kids are strong so the " spring " is just enough to get some air but not too much to get launched ! I also use one in my classroom for my " special " friends who have the wiggles too . Our older model has been being used for 4 years and has zero damage . It looks brand new .
4 #### My puppy ate my first pair of chucks so when I finally got around to buying another pair , I was thrilled to get these . Love the look and style .
5 #### To the cast of thousands , I add my own few lines . These shoes are absolutely top drawer ! They look great and they are as comfortable as any shoe I 've ever worn right out of the box . Merrell wins my " best shoe " vote , hands ( or feet ) down !
5 #### My expectations were low , because I have the 5/6 8 ' and I think that rod is a waste of $ 20 . I had heard this one is better , so I thought for $ 20 it was worth a try . TOTALLY different castability and fishability ! This is more of a parabolic taper , thus the tip is not as soft but the lower third is softer . It casts well and fishes better . I 've used it with floating and Type II lines in stillwater and am pleased and blown away at the great value . My $ 300-$500 glass rods are better , but if someone told me I could only fish 3/4 with this rod it would not be a big disappointment .
5 #### Best targets for the price , period . I use the sticky dots every time as well to prolong target life
4 #### I have the blue / white pair , and I find them comfortable enough for pretty much everything I do ( but I do n't work on my feet all day . ) I like the elastic shoelaces , although unfortunately , once they get dirty they tend to stay that way unless you spot clean them . Another thing I dislike is that there 's a lot of exposed stitching , eventually the shoes start looking kinda raggedy . However , they are the perfect shade of blue to me .
5 #### Tried and true , love these Converse Chuck Taylor All - Stars . Were shipped promptly and received in perfect condition .
4 #### Love these socks . This is my second pair . Only reason I 'm not giving it 5 stars is that the last pair actually wore holes in the heel on both socks . Granted , that 's probably because I wore them around the house constantly and on two hiking trips . They provide a ton of warmth without being overly thick . I wear them around the house because we have wood floors , but they 're equally great when hiking
5 #### Cool shorts bro . I bought them for my daughter to practice cheer . I like that they 're not daisy dukes short but they are a little on the short side .
1 #### Great shoe but a hundred times too large . I 'm always a size six and this was like a 10 . Obviously returned them .
5 #### These sneakers are always classic . Having small feet , I always buy them when I can get them for less than twenty bucks . They fit great and even look great with skirts and dresses . I ordered them on a Thursday and received them on a Saturday ! ! Very happy .
5 #### These are quality hose . I have always used this brand .
5 #### Works perfectly as described and would purchase from again in the future .
5 #### These Bali panty brief is all I wear . I do have others that I wear when I stay home . They are a true fit for me . It is flattering to your figure without the panty line showing . Large selction of colors . Quality merchandise , fair price ( I always search to find the cheapest price ) and fast shipping . I would recommd them to a friend .
5 #### Simple and effective . If you are looking to hang upside down , these will get the job done . They offer a far more intense stretch than inversion tables and other similar products . I will use these from time to time to stretch or do abdominal work , post workout . I would not suggest using these if you are currently dealing with back issues , but use them for preventive measures when feeling healthy .
5 #### We have ordered at least three of these . My husband and his friend throw frisbees at night and they love how these light up . They get a crowd watching all the time and people want to know where we got them and I end up ordering one for them and they pay me when it gets here . They are a lot of fun and perfect for throwing on the beach at night !
5 #### Solidly built . Strong , Secure and fast to attach or detach . I use these on pump shotguns with narrow slings and they have never failed .
1 #### One of the posts holding the connector pin to the butt stock mounting stud on my shotgun broke off the first time I used it .
5 #### Love having this at the office . Hate the jokes that follow . But whatever . It works and helps on forearm rehab as well as just general health of the forearm .
4 #### I was considering buying a tricycle , but I 'm glad I went with the RF trike instead . It 's the perfect size for my 21 month old daughter , and she loves to push it around or just sit on it . She especially enjoys ringing the bell - a very nice touch ! I also love the look - in a sea of plastic and character logos , it 's a refreshing classic toy !
3 #### Right size wrong fit , slightly bigger than expected . Had to return them .
5 #### I love these shoes ! They are so much more comfortable tgan Chucks used to be . I will definitely order them again .
5 #### I love this - I bought 2 . It works well on cold New England days .
4 #### I like the Transgia OK , but I think a stand outweighs a simmer ring and o - ring . I bought another alcohol stove the out - D and it does not have a o - ring or a simmer ring , but push comes to shove I would rather have the stand . This MONSTER size cooking stand shown in the picture will get charred up the first time you use it as mine did , and you can feel this MONSTER in your pack no matter where you put it . Maybe if they sent it in stainless it might be worth having , mine will go in the garbage . No no no do n't through the trangia stove out just the stand . I mean really if your going to have a stand this big you may as well just pack in propane canister they work better anyway .
5 #### Fit perfect I love keen shoes been Wearing 1 years
5 #### I have owned several compasses over the years and I was looking to upgrade . And boy did I ever find the jackpot ! The Suunto MC-2 G was the answer . Easy to read , simple to use and easy to set the declination . I went through several other options but they all had problems . So I decided to bite the bullet and buy the best . The Suunto lived up to all the hype . I opted for the Global ( G ) model because it will work anywhere in the world . Not that I will ever get everywhere in the world but a guy has to plan ahead . :-) For a compass to work correctly it has to be designed to work correctly in that part of the world in which it is being used.(I never knew that -- did you ? ) This Suunto works correctly wherever . Great for orienteering or running a line across country and the needle settles down fast . You will not be disappointed in this compass .
5 #### These were s little snugger than the crop pants . And the pockets as I said are a little weird .
5 #### I really like these . I just got a size too large , without laces you need to take into account that your foot will have more movement .
5 #### This mock turtleneck is perfect ! I absolutely love it . It is long enough to pull up over my ears and nose , yet short enough to be comfortable as a scarf . The material is super soft and does n't snag on my Velcro closures on my coat which is a super plus !
4 #### burn well , last as advertised , but start HARD . need lighter or matches or sustained heat to get going . but they are compact for heat output . i ordered two boxes .
5 #### Ca n't go wrong with this classic style . We got them for my son to play tennis in but , he wears them practically everyday as they are so comfortable .
5 #### Hat fits like it should . Theses are good hats I have several
5 #### bought this along with a sling for a shotgun . just what I needed to attach my sling with . easy to use . quality product . seems like it will hold up well
5 #### Perfect for role play in the bedroom . Fit well and looked like the real thing
3 #### Worked great . Did n't have any issues with it deflating at night . Forgot my pump at home so I had to inflated by mouth which was not too difficult but it took some time . Only issue I had with it was the pillow ( useless and unfortunately if you use bring a pillow like I do ) and the width of the bed ! Wish It had a couple more inches on each side . I am 5'7 170 there was no room to turn . Was not the worst but definitely could be better
1 #### Piece of trash . Once you place it correctly them you can not see forward . Very distracting . It doesnot work so do n't waste your money
5 #### Looks good and is light and vented for the summer days
3 #### Did not come in a plastic cover to protected it had scuff marks nor to happy about that .
5 #### These are very comfortable and I wear them on occasions that are not casual enough for my&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Merrell - Men - s - Moab - Ventilator - Multisport - Shoe / dp / B00D7CHAEW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Merrell Men 's Moab Ventilator Multisport Shoe</a > . They 're great for weekend days when I have to go to work or even a semi - casual night out . The uppers are suede and I 've been a bit worried about damaging them , but so far , they 've held up quite well . I bought size 10.5 and they fit well .
2 #### I have several different bands and these are the least likable , they do not stretch enough and make it way to difficult to use
5 #### sweet car flag . wish it made the auburn defense suck a little less when you fly it , but otherwise a great car flag .
4 #### It was fine except the sleeve is too small for our post rod
4 #### Its ok , you get what you pay for , so not bad really
5 #### Beautiful pair of chucks . I get attention from my optical white Taylor 's
5 #### Item is a great fit . I consider myself having a larger than average head . This hat fit me perfect . Not to tight around the head or to loose . Too tight = headache due to tension Too loose = annoying having to keep adjusting This one was the perfect size and product is rugged with strong stiching and material is tough . Also submerged it underwater , it dried out fairly quickly in the sun . I bought desert tan color and jungle green . Gon na buy a couple more . It 's hard to find hats that fit just right ... and I found one . Does its job well ... looks good . Yes would definitely recommend to friends Cheers !
4 #### A generic type product as a fuel pellet . Works as expected and quality is okay . packaging is a bit cheap .
5 #### I really do n't like that I have to write a long narrative for such a minor product . Anyone who is looking for this type of thing , this one is great , buy it !
5 #### Good quality stuff here . Dries quick and keep the sun off while providing good ventilation .
5 #### This is our second order of this shirt . Bought an X - Large / Tall , which is my hubby 's size . The shirt is a bit larger than other shirts he has in this size , but he 's content with it , so we did n't send it back . Well made shirt . Happy with the purchase . Not overpriced . Recommended . Also happy with their work pants . Bought a pair for my son who works in retail and is not allowed to wear jeans . He was wearing Dockers , but they were not durable enough for kneeling on the floor and stacking shelves . We like this company , and will be making more Carhartt purchases !
4 #### Great length for taller guys ! They do fit small , so pick up a size bigger than you 'd usually wear .
5 #### Not really much to say about this . It is a pin and it holds onto my hat very well . I 've only had it a month , but so far it has not fallen apart .
3 #### I have used this brand for awhile . My recent order of this did not last long ... it started to break within 10 usages , which should not happen . all resistance bands eventually wear out , but not within a few uses . If you use them a lot you should get a good two or three monts out of them . I 'm using the 2nd one i ordered and is holding better . Maybe the last one was defective . I will give benefit of the doubt but if the 2nd one breaks soon , I 'm going to a different brand .
1 #### I would like to get the right size of what I paid for . I need an 8 and a half .
5 #### I have drilled probably 50 holes with this instead of a motorized auger . This is outstanding . Cuts a hole in 20 inches of ice is about 30 seconds - tops . Love this ! !
5 #### Finally found my favorite pantyhose ! Ever since I gained weight , I could n't find anything that fit in the color I wanted ... seems most plus size are limited to nude , brown or black ( none of which work for me ) . I ordered one each of linen , pale taupe and stone in the 3x-4x ... looking for a soft taupe to go with summer outfits . I 'm 5'8 " and 225 lbs , pear - shaped with heavy hips / thighs ... the 3x/4x were very comfortable . I would n't want them any bigger . The stone is my favorite - a medium gray taupe that goes well with almost any shoe . The pale taupe was definitely more brown - although I can still use it with some outfits . The linen is a lovely lighter gray taupe . Thank - you Berkshire for all these wonderful colors ! It makes such a difference in the total outfit . The weight is perfect - not too sheer , not too thick - and the feel is silky yet with substance .
5 #### this is the only place a can find these items , works just fine
1 #### Is not the same as the picture . Had to sell it on eBay and buy another one since I could n't return it . The one I received had different padding .
5 #### This is the only thing that has helped my tennis elbow . I would recommend this to anyone who is suffering . Mine had gotten so bad that I could not sleep at night . After doing exercises even on the first day I noticed relief . I was initially skeptical but I am now a believer .
4 #### It 's cute and it 's an inexpensive witch hat so you ca n't go wrong with that . I needed it for one day and it did the job . No complaints .
3 #### This mat is very firm , and therefore not as comfortable as I had hoped . I was looking for something a little softer . It 's a solid mat though ... just figure out ahead of time what firmness you 're looking for .
5 #### I have used various hand grippers for years now . None can compare with the Captains of Crush Grippers . I purchased the 1.5 , the 2 and the 2.5 grippers . I can handle the 1.5 and the 2 , but the 2.5 continues to humble me . I will get there . Be aware that these grippers are way harder than others on the market and that your success with other grippers will not transfer over to the Captains of Crush . Start lighter than you think you are capable of handling .
1 #### The lock mechanism is the worst I 've ever seen . My key jammed and broke off after only two months . Even under regular conditions , it 'd still take an average of 60 - 90 seconds to lock or unlock the bike . Unacceptable performance from a supposedly quality brand . Stay away !
4 #### It 's snowing in Lake Tahoe , CA ! I am waiting for Spring and Summer so I can wear my beautiful shoes . At home they feel extremely comfortable . Wearing them around the house felt OK ! I like them !
5 #### Shoot n see are fhe best .... you can modify any target to achieve maximum accuracy .
5 #### I ordered 4 Bali bras all 38DD . This style fit the best . I only wish it was a littler thicker for better coverage but the support is good . The straps are not as giving as I would like but it 's not uncomfortable . It does give somewhat of a bullet shape like the vintage style bra did ; I ordered another one in black because I liked it so much .
5 #### This watch is very high quality . It has gotten a lot of compliments due to the premium feel to it .
5 #### This inexpensive scuba review workbook covers all you need to know for the refresher course , It is up to date and takes very little time to get through . A must have for those taking their scuba certification refresher course .
5 #### This is one slick scope for such a low , low price . We now have 4 of them out on our 200 yard rifle range and when standing next to the Konus 20 - 60x80 we have there is no comparison ... these are FAR superior in nearly every way ! These Celestron 's cost half as much and are FAR brighter in any weather and resolve 30 cal holes at 200 yards with no difficulty at all . 22 's are a little tougher at 200 on standard service rifle targets . I did pick up an adapter for my iPhone to attach to this scope and it resolves 22 's clear as day at 200 yards on a black center target with black berm material behind it ! I HIGHLY recommend this scope for any and all service rifle guy's / gal 's out there ( although I would recommend the angle eye piece version ) .
4 #### This is an exceptionally made blade with tight tolerances and a keen Edge , but if you are not really used to wearing a fixed blade in a sheath it can be a bit of a distraction on a belt on your waist . I recommend wearing it on a chest mount with web gear , sideways on the small of your back , or low on your leg .
5 #### My husband wore his brown pair out ! I ordered these to replace and was not disappointed ! !
5 #### my grip strength was becoming the limiting factor on my deadlifts . I started with the " Trainer " model , and have moved up to the No . 1 . These are very well made . The texture is very rough , and some callouses will result from the training , but when I covered the grips in shrinkwrap to protect my hands it became very hard to hold onto . That rough texture serves a purpose .
2 #### The drag adjustment wheel would n't stay where I set it . The drag was too light even when set at the highest level . I contacted an authorized Daiwa service center and I was told that there must be a stripped part . I also had intermittant reeling problems like something was interfering with the gears . I ended up returning this reel to Amazon for a refund . I was very disappointed with the reel considering the majority of reviewers had good things to report about it with the exception of the adjustment wheel issue . This was my first and last purchase of a Daiwa reel and will try Abu - Garcia reels next time .
5 #### Works excellent for storing small electronics or other small items that you want to keep dry and safe . I use one of mine for a collection of small pocket knives . I just added some extra foam padding I had and I can fit almost a dozen various sized ones with their being secure and safe from scratches . You can put a small lock on the outside to prevent casual access . I use another one for a Digital camera and all its accessories . Makes traveling simple having everything together . I also throw a small desiccant package in mine . It has a good positive dual latch and the interior is lined with a thin layer of padding . I have not submerged mine in water yet , but feel confident of it keeping everything dry should it be dropped in shallow water or caught in the rain . I recommend it for small items you want to keep together and keep reasonably secure ( using a lock ) .
5 #### I did as most of the previous customers stated and bought one size bigger than I normally would . It fits perfectly . I feel as if this helmet will make my head feel protected when I ride my bike .
5 #### Very waterproof , ultra comfortable , excellent cold or wet weather shoe , very durable . I have used these shoes for years and they are extraordinary .
5 #### This suit is great ! I wear this to snow blow 20 houses and i only wear a tee shirt and thermal pants underneath and i m so warm that i sometimes sweat
5 #### Hard to find non control top hosiery . I wear hosiery less than infrequently but when I do these are the go - to . They are comfortable , look great and are smooth , silky and do not sag . I am 5'5 132 # .
5 #### I got the shark skin grey and they 're so cool ! Do n't forget that with chucks they 're unisex so you may need to go down a 1/2 size . Like I have a wide foot with a high instep and typically wear 8.5 but I should have gotten an 8 .
5 #### I enjoy wearing converse , but after over two years , my old pair finally needed to be retired . Ordered these in the same size as my old pair and they fit like a glove .
4 #### these are pretty cool . look pretty natural except the seam does n't lay totally flat in some bras or suits . But overall they are a nice addition to my arsenal of helpers for very flat chest !
5 #### Great price , great chain net . Gives our hoop that old - school feel of playground hoops I remember growing up . It installs in seconds . NOTE : You 'll want to crimp the 'S ' hooks that hook to your net - holders so they do n't come off under hard play , but the metal is pretty soft and a pair of regular pliers did the trick easily . Nothing like the sound of a swish in a metal net .
2 #### These were not true to size . My daughter said they were tight .
5 #### My 4 year Olds bike has no kick stand so he just throws it on ground . We decided on this stand and are very pleased took me less then 5 min to install . It 's a bit stiff at first but a little wd40 and it slides up and down with ease .
4 #### Nothing was wrong with the shoes I mistakenly had ordered the wrong size for my wife .
5 #### All my goals must have a chain net . I do n't need to explain to you why . You already know ... CLINKCH ! Oh , & i always mod my net to be smaller around the bottom so the ball barely goes through . Does n't hit the base of the goal & bounce off as much that way . Now , order one ! What are you waiting for ? Why are you still reading this ? GO ! :)
5 #### Perfect match for my Stainless Steel Marlin model 60 ( SS ) rifle . Easy to install and product is as described .
2 #### The waistband is too small for Plus Size and the material is rough and scratchy , not silky . I have an apple shape . Has a large breathable cotton crotch that is nice .
3 #### I bought a pair of these in my size , but they are too small . I can get my feet in them but not comfortably . It 's too bad because I can tell the soles are comfortable . Of course , now I 've work them to work so I ca n't return them .
3 #### Ran pretty small with very little " give " . Nice color , tho '
2 #### For people , these frisbees would probably be fine , but not for dogs . Ours destroyed them immediately , leaving sharp edges . We had to throw them out .
5 #### Use the setup on a closet door a couple times a week . I would like it if each band could be used with just one handle instead of both at the same time , but that is how they are designed and I could see that going in when purchased .
3 #### I choose this rating because I thought I was getting the black monoch " leather ones " , but when my shoes arrived I was disappointed . I believe this is a error on my behalf . Mainly because I did n't see nor did I care to confirm it , but should I have ? Either way I love these shoes and I love these wrong ones and I am not that upset just disappointed . This clearly is a mistake that will not happen twice ! And for the record these shoes are eligible for Free Returns , So I am happy with my poor choice . Overall the shoes seem to checkout . I looked over them and they seem to check out . the badge is there and the name on the heel is spelt correct , so I LIKE ! Believe it or not but this is and will not be my last shoe purchase from Amazon . However , it is my first and I 'd recommend buying from amazon to family , friends and shoppers .
5 #### My daughter loves them . True to size . Shipped quickly . Very happy
3 #### If you put cards in every slot that is available in this wallet - it does n't close well .
5 #### Big Bag o ' chalk for a nice low price . You get some big rocks of chalk and the quality is definately great
5 #### Beautiful leather , soft and compact . I have used " Lady Buxton " leather wallets for years and always pleased .
5 #### Great product . Shipping was timely and compass arrived in fine working order .
5 #### Great fitting comfortable sandal . She love this style . My wife has 3 pair and wears them every day .
5 #### I love Carhartt clothing . The shirts tend to run big on me . I always order a size smaller .
5 #### Great fit and great look . The price is excellent and I am most pleased . Always wanted the helmets of Star Wars and now I have added this great item to my collection . ..
5 #### it is a very easy carrying case for my staff and allows me to take it whenever I need to bring it back it is a little longer than my staff is which makes it slightly uncomfortable but it 's really not a big deal for me
3 #### Arrived as expected and advertised , fits nicely , but just know it 's VERY thin , there is only 1 layer of fabric and you can pretty much see thru it at any given time . Would not recommend this for colder weather , much better utilized for warm situations .
5 #### I ordered this air mattress for tent camping for a child . We usually give our kids each a twin sized air mattress in the tent but found that our 10 person tent is cramped with only 5 people on huge air mattresses . So I 'm happy I found this affordable camping mattress for $ 7.99 prime . I would n't pay more for it though . I thought that it having an included pillow would be weird but surprisingly I liked that feature as it is really comfortable . It is wide enough for me to turn and lay on my side and it seems very comfortable for an adult or child .
5 #### Well priced and delivered as advertised . Perfect cooler for a small family picnic or tailgating , kind of your generic cooler . Everyone has to have one of these , I 'd pick this one up .
4 #### Typical high Merrell quality but not the same comfort as the higher priced leather Merrell 's . Was actually somewhat disappointed .
5 #### I purchased this handy bungee dockline 4 years ago ....... other than somewhat faded colors it has held up quite well and I continue to use it . The wind and current move my boat around at the slip which is n't a big deal until you want to board . I purposely do n't keep the boat super tight against the dock , and so when it comes to boarding , this is a great line to tie off the stern to an appropriate cleat . It keeps the boat nice and snug against the dock so people can get on and off without having to pull the boat in . The only downside to this line is the size of the loops . The loops are not large enough to fully and correctly wrap the loop around the cleats . For what I 'm using this dock line for , it does n't matter because I have permanent dock lines for the boat that I leave at the dock . This line just helps with boarding so it 's does n't need to be perfect .
5 #### Love the looks and feel of these pantyhose . Has enough support without being uncomfortable . I hate hurdles one spanks , things go that nature but these control tops are great . Love the sheerness of it . Totally happy with purchase .
5 #### This is a simple , inexpensive ( not cheap ) design that matches any attire for any occasion . The original band does n't last long , but that 's OK because there are a million choices out there . The light is nice if you 're in a movie theater or some place not well light . The time is always precise . I have another one in a dark face ( sort of charcoal ) so that I can mix and match . I highly recommend this .
5 #### I have two , and have given several as gifts . The extra small is a perfect purse size and can be worn on the back , side , or front ..
5 #### Must have on the golf course . Get one in any color other then all black , the all black one blends in with the golf cart and after a couple rounds and several beverages it is very easy to forget it . I have not forgot this green one though . Get product , great invention , just get one in a bright color ... trust me .
3 #### Before you buy a youth arrow consider the size of the youth and the draw he will have with a bow . I buy a lot from Amazon , in this case I suggest you go to your local sporting goods store .
5 #### This may well be one of my all - time favorite backpacking dinners . I find the Sweet and Sour Pork to be quite delicious and it packs a punch when you really need it . I usually do n't go into the backcountry without this one !
5 #### I 've always been a chucks fan ( admittedly over vans ) & was so excited to receive these in the mail they are true to size & color . I ca n't wait to break them in & start using them fo weight training . I would recommend these to anyone interested .
5 #### Perfect for when I travel ! It holds everything and I especially love the ring bar and the bracelet holder . Love it !
5 #### I ordered these sneakers for everyday use and wear . I wear them grocery shopping , going for walks with my kids , playing outside , running errands , etc . They are comfortable enough for all day wear . They look cute with boot cut jeans , skinny jeans , or yoga pants , which makes them a great addition to my wardrobe . They clean really easily and have the look of a leather shoe without any animal products being used . They seem to be durable and show no signs of wear and tear . My feet have stayed dry walking through a little snow and slush even though these do n't boast being waterproof , they resist quite a bit . I would definitely recommend these shoes ( and may buy another pair in another color for myself ! )
5 #### Great shoe , probably my favorite since I have two pairs of high tops and 7 pairs of the low . They are the best and most classic shoe !
5 #### These shoes were for my husband . He has tried several brands of shoes and finds Merrell the most comfortable .
5 #### tif you have not worn cons before go to a store and try them on to find the correct size . they run about one size large . 10=11
5 #### Like this wallet very much , and it was a very reasonable price . would definitely buy again . Seems to be very sturdy
5 #### Great leather steering wheel cover that feels good , I 'm hoping that the raiders logo and name do n't wear off fast , but I 'm getting leather driving gloves next week or sooner which should help . Only time will tell .
5 #### I have gotten so many compliments on the blue color and look of this shoe . It is super comfortable . The grip is wonderful for my indoor gym cross training classes . I always order a half size larger in Nike brand shoes and thy fit perfectly as I did with this shoe .
5 #### I love these stockings ! Hanes Silk Reflections have been my favorites for years and years . They feel so sleek and since they fit so well , they do not snag or run easily . The colors are lovely with my favorites being Barely There ; Town Taupe ; and Travel Buff and of course Black . Those colors will meet every stocking color need you may have and do it with class .
5 #### I am very pleased with this shirt . It has a great fit , is comfortable , and priced great . I recommend it .
5 #### This is a great shoe , but the shoe runs a little small , so it did not fit . The Seller was amazing to work with on the return and provided full credit . Highly recommend , but order a size bigger than your normal size .
4 #### I really like this helmet . I feel safe with it on and it 's very comfortable . The visor is also very handy to hold my rear view mirror . I 'd recommend it .
5 #### I love these things . I use them when I mow grass and you can hardly hear the mower . They are comfortable and great to use .
5 #### I ORDERED THESE FOR MY 5YR . OLD DAUGHTER IN A 10 BUT SHE WEARS A 9 , SHE'LL BE ABLE TO WEAR THEM NEXT YEAR . THEY GO PERFECT WITH HER OUTFITS AND SCHOOL UNIFORM . EVEN WHEN THEY GET DIRTY AND SCRAPPED UP ITS EASY TO WIPE THEM OFF .
5 #### In hot summer , clothing outlets seem to forget that long sleeve tshirts protect from sun . I looked all over and bought several different styles and vendors . All were good fit and shipped as expected . These did not say tagless , but they were . A bonus . I bought white and gray . Both excellent .
5 #### Great size holds up well to round house and punch Great Weight to roll around in garage Very happy with product ! I hooked on Pro Force and Great combination works great ! Great when your working out alone .
5 #### My 14 mo baby weights about 22 lbs and it fit tight and just a tad short , in a months or so i believe will not fit so take into consideration . Otherwise is exactly as picture and I recommend it .
5 #### This will be my second pair , I work on my feet All day and these are the best I 've found for my feet and my back ... and they look good .... I have wore my last pair for over a year now and they still look good so they where good ... I'm getting a nother pair because this is a great price
5 #### Worked great . I do n't know why I waited so long to buy one . It makes camping cooking very easy and the space it takes up is minimal . I would recommend to anybody . It will also make for a good emergency grill to use outside if the power goes out . Only use it out side .
5 #### Best scope for me , holds the to a .30 - 06 . Best scope for the price .
3 #### Bought this standard size costume for my 11 year old daughter who is 5 ft 6 inches and it fits almost perfectly . Just minor adjustment needed around the waist and chest . She is tall and skinny . She loved it . She wanted to wear it for her school play . It is beautiful ! She will have fun with it . This costume would not fit your average adult . Sleeves are small just right for her .
5 #### BEST SHOES MY HUSBAND HAS EVER WORN . THIS IS HIS SECOND PAIR OF JUNGLE MOCS . U HAVE TO BE SURE IT IS THE JUNGLE MOCS AS THEY R THE MOST COMFORTABLE OF THAT . LINE
5 #### This Everlast Mat has about 20 times the quality of ones you can buy in stores . It 's sturdy , attractive , durable and has excellent padding . For the price you 're definitely getting your moneys worth .
5 #### Highly recommend . Have on a Henry .22 lever action . Would be great on any rifle . Bonus is the lens covers are transparent so you can leave them on if you want .
4 #### My only gripe is that I was under the impression it included the metal stake for displaying the flag . My own fault though .
5 #### Very happy with this purchase and will order other styles .
5 #### I bought this Thermasilk for backcountry camping . It is really nice on the skin and dries super fast . The only problem is that the velcro on my sleeping bag caused it to snag .
5 #### Awesome . They were a gift for my husband who is a long time Justin Roper fan and these boots did not dissapoint .
5 #### This is my second pair of Keen Sandals . I bought the first in 2008 and they are still good except the soles are wearing a little thin - not too bad after 8 years of use . These are great for the beach , the river or wherever you may find yourself outside . I have worn them from coast to coast and love them . Your toes are covered so no worries about stubbing your toes .
4 #### It 's a great product , but I needed one that was a bit shorter yet firm and the size that I purchased was n't short enough . I needed more resistance from the product in order to stretch my legs appropriately . I had to return it . But it appeared to be a high - quality product that would likely work for other people !
5 #### I bought these for my 5 year old . He is learning to tie his shoes so naturally I had to get him some chucks . They are his favorite shoes .
5 #### This Superman costume is adorable for my very tall 2 year old son . The costume is well designed & nice fitting with all the details of the classic superhero ( the red briefs are hysterical front & back ) . Does not come with red shoes -- the feet have elastic straps to go under shoes . The belt is separate & adjustable , and the cape is made from a light & very flowing fabric . When my toddler walks , the cape billows dramatically behind him , complete with the Super " S " logo . Proud of myself for ordering this ! TOO CUTE !
4 #### It arrived inside out , as soon as I figured out that I had to invert it , after almost throwing it across the lawn because I was so irritated , the assembly was fairly easy .
5 #### They cost more but : are well made . All the elastic is covered in cotton for assured comfort . The last doz . I had lasted over 2 yrs . actually , nearly 3 yrs . You save money by purchasing this brand . They stand up to rigorous washing and drying w/o shrinking .
5 #### Bought for grandson ( 2yo ) he loves them and looks grown up .
5 #### Absolutely love them . Can even wear them without my insoles .
4 #### Since the fabric streches if can easily fit kids and/or adults .
3 #### i think that this sneaker was a bit tight but otherwise a good buy . waiting to procure a similar item .
5 #### Love the shoe love the style , just a little hard to get onto baby 's feet due to the high top . Happy w / purchase .
1 #### the piece that kept the eye holes seperate was poorly made and falling apart as soon as we opened the package . by the time my son put it on , it was ready to tear and tore soon after . i am also disappointed because there was no receipt . i was trying to save myself a shopping trip . should have just went to the army navy store .
5 #### This is the best wallet I have ever bought and I am a purse and wallet freak . Look good and fits all .
5 #### I bought this for my 6 year old daughter who was riding her brothers 125 razor that is 2 years old . They both love them and they have been very reliable .
1 #### Terrible fit - too small some places , too big in others . All around uncomfortable and unattractive . Not a fan . Oh well .
5 #### Boots are awesome . We could n't be happier . And the cuff proof desigb is exactly what the 10 yr old boy needs
5 #### My son loves these sneakers . They are for him . Since I ordered them they took two days to reach my house he literally waited for the ups guy to bring them . We do n't allow shoes I the house but because they were new he wore them as soon as they came in then sat down to dinner with them on . As a joke he wanted to sleep with them on too . He is nine so sneakers are n't a priority for him yet so it was nice that he appreciated these sneakers so much i am so glad I made this purchase will buy them once he outgrows these .
5 #### It does a good job targeting the tendons that no amount of stretching seem to touch . I 'm happy I found it .
4 #### I like the boot , but as for the wheels I did n't like them at all .
4 #### Great , i am skinny and it fit perfectly . I use it of warm days only , i recommend it . Comfortable on the tushy .
4 #### Well - made comfortable jeans , but the size is smaller than expected . I ordered an identical size of Levi 's at the same time , and the Levi 's fit perfectly while I ca n't fasten the Wranglers . However , that 'll just provide the impetus for me to lose a little weight !
5 #### The solid quality of this hunting knife is excellent . Designed for untold years of use , but in fact it 's beautiful knife . Almost a shame not to be a collector . Shaving sharp right out of the box . Nice aggressive jimping on top of the blade at front and rear . This will be with me in the deer woods for a long long time .
5 #### My husband wears them practically every day . He says they 're socomfortable that I 'm getting a pair .
5 #### I just love this jeans . The quality is increadible . I will buy another pair soon . " Relaxed fit " means they are actually quite wide , have it in mind when ordering .
5 #### This was one of the best purchases I made prior to a trip to the Arctic -- the double layer of fleece helped keep my neck warm over my base layers and under my coat , and I love the color selection !
5 #### The first time I saw Mocs , I thought they were ugly shoes . But wearing them is a different story- they are SO comfortable . It 's the only shoe I 've worn for about 15 years now . I used to buy them from REI , but REI only carries standard widths ( at least the store I go to does ) and Amazon had them in wide , which is what I prefer .
5 #### I got these for my 10 yo son who gets very upset when it 's too noisy ( like his sister is yelling and crying and upset ) so he can shield himself and remain calmer . It works and he likes it . The only problem is that his 7 yo brother and sister borrow them and then he ca n't use them .
4 #### Nice cooler . Like the fact it 's tall and you can stand bottles up inside .
5 #### These shoes rock ! I get all sorts of comments . Not everyone likes them since they are rainbows ; but , everyone seems to have an opinion ! !
5 #### These are great compared to the toys I 've seen elsewhere . Fit my 5 year old great for skate boarding or bike riding . Others I 've seen were either too small or too big , these are just right .
5 #### My husband is very happy with this particular product & it fits quite well .
5 #### Good stuff . The stickers work just like the targets and extends the life of the target you are using . I hate this 18 word minimum for reviews . I just wanted to say the product works and comes as advertised .
4 #### Nice quality , decent length , and the price is great for a pack of six . My only complaint is that they are fairly narrow when unstretched , requiring a bit of work to get one to fit over a scoped rifle . That said , these are definitely not a good choice for a modern sporting ( tactical ) rifle . Allen sells a different product for those rifles ... and it is fantastic . Search for " Allen Company Tactical Gun Sock " if you are looking to protect that type of rifle .
5 #### Bought these shoes for my husband . He said they are THEE most comfortable pair of shoes he has worn in the past few years . He 's only had them one week and he has asked me to order another pair ASAP .
1 #### Bra band measured 30 " and when stretched to 32 " was uncomfortably tight .
5 #### This is a replacement for the one TSA took from me because a good terrorist always uses a nail file to hijack planes . What bastards those people are . So I got this , and I"m glad I did . It has all the tools listed in the description . Being Victorinox , you can be sure it 's a quality item . It 's very sturdy , the knife is great , and the scissor cuts nails with no problems . I love this on my keychain .
5 #### After my neighbor went and got one , my 4 yo begged for one . I figured it would be good exercise , so I got her one . It did n't take her long to figure it out . My son , who is nervous about balancing on two wheels , saw my daughter having so much fun , he tried it out and they both fought over it . So , I had to go out and buy one the same day . Okay , I did n't have to , but it 's worth it to see my kids want to go out and get some physical activity . The construction is solid . I had it unfolded and ready to ride in seconds . The wheels glide smoothly . I am impressed with the quality .
4 #### We 've been pleased with this as a good , basic soccer ball for our young son . I do n't expect it to withstand aggressive play for too long , but for simple kicking around the yard with a new , little soccer players , it 's great .
1 #### Too big and not giving . Hurt the top of my arch during the first week of wear .
5 #### I like this helmet , it fits well and I feel safe wearing it . If I crash I 'll update the review .
5 #### I 'm tired of ugly , hot sneakers for the summer . I garden , walk my dogs , run to the grocery store ... same as everyone ... and these shoes were the perfect choice . The deeper color ( dark denim ) disquises the black toe effect and the coral color adds some spark . The sole is strong enough for ladder climbing and mowing and the bands hug your foot with no flopping . The shoe is shaped so your toes are comfy all day . I love , love , love these cute blue shoes and after a whole summer of mulching ( I throw them in the washer too ) they look brand new . This is the one to buy if you 're looking for strong , comfortable , cute summer shoes .
5 #### Ordered half a size larger than my usual shoe size and fits perfectly .
4 #### Very nice watch . I bought it to use while another daily - wear watch is being serviced . This Timex watch is just what I wanted and I expect it to provide good service . One note , the left number in the date window ( # 1 ) is difficult to see when the date is 10 through 19 . The first setting I made with the watch was 18 , when in fact I thought I was setting it as the 8th . I only noticed the problem when the watch turned to the 20th .
5 #### These Keens are awesome . They run about a 1/2 size small , but that seems to be standard . I have worn them in the pool , locker room showers , and just out in general . Never slipped . They are super comfortable and have been since the first day .
5 #### Making the comparison to much more expensive " designer " jeans , these heavy denim jeans compare equally with LL bean and Carhartt . In addition , if you compare them to the Walmart version of wrangler jeans these are much heavier denim ; and most importantly , heavier pockets . I 'm very pleased , will for sure buy more .
5 #### great ruff and tumble ski pants for ruff and tumble little kids ... just ordered anther larger set for my older boy .
5 #### These worked great for our family on a recent snorkeling trip to Caribbean . Had 4 of these and they kept keys , driver 's license , paper bills dry . No leaking .
5 #### This is a wonderful scooter . My daughter has already had hours of fun on it , and due to the adjustable handlebars I anticipate that she will be able to use it for years to come . She is 5 years old and on the shorter end ( about 36 " tall ) and it works well for her . The handlebars could even be adjusted a bit lower for a shorter child . The quality of this scooter is exceptional for the price , and it is easy to fold up one - handed . As a bonus , when folded it fits easily into the bottom of my umbrella stroller , so she can scooter to the library or store when I push her little brother in the stroller and it can go in the stroller when we go inside .
5 #### Items exactly as described , arrived on time , well packaged , will order again if / when needed .
2 #### These are way too small ! I`m disappointed with my order .
3 #### After my purchased I found out they are overpriced . They feel good but I will not recommended if you need Wide fit .
1 #### First I have a pair of these boots and they are great . The issue is with the provider . The leather was damaged . I was very disappointed that someone did n't check the boots more closely before shipping , especially since it was so close to Christmas and more than likely they knew it was a Christmas gift . It tied up a $ 114 of my money and I had to find another gift and wait on my money from the boots . I understand that things can be damaged , but especially during Christmas , shippers should check things before shipping .
3 #### Very nice shoe , just a bit to snug / small for my foot . The Flex wire really makes it the shoe fit tight to your foot . I need more " wiggle " room in my footwear , otherwise I would have kept them .
5 #### This is a comfortable helmet for rollerblading , biking , or other outdoor sports . It fits my head very well and will probably fit any adult head size since it has an adjustable head rim . It is light weight , has a lot of opening to allow air flow . Its a good helmet in a good price .
5 #### Super product . Great for the boat and easy to apply .
5 #### I have had Justin Ropers for years . A Very Comfortable boot . As I have gotten older , I have had to go to the wide . The store did n't stock them , so I purchased online . These have leather soles , not rubber , so at first they are a little slippery on carpet and wet surfaces .
5 #### We hung a 90 lb ( empty ) , 16'9 " canoe in the garage with this for easy of on / off car top , and it is incredible ( so much easier than manhandling the boat every time we came / went and saves soooo much space ) . The instructions are clear and meticulous , but you MUST read them thoroughly before you even think about getting started as you will need to determine which method of installation will suit your plans and then acquire some additional materials ( which are specified in the instructions ) to do this right . It took about 4 hours to completely install and lift the boat for the first test , and it was entirely worth it !
5 #### Nice knife , was sharp out of the box I recall . It is difficult to get out of the sheath . Personally I press down my thumb on the sheath while pulling the knife up . I wear it in my boot , so it being a little difficult to unsheathe is nice . Hopefully I wo n't lose it that way . Fits comfortably in my hand . The blade is not edged on one side . So only one cutting edge , would n't take much to turn the non cutting edge into one though , however that 's not legal in all states . It exceeds my expectations for a EDC fixed blade backup .
4 #### Very stream lined , not meant for bulky rifles or those with attachments , fits my lever action very well but not the carbine .
5 #### I got these as a gift for my guy . He like them and said they fit great
4 #### This was a gift for a 3yr old . It 's a little large for her arm but her parents say she wants to wear it everyday . She loves pink and loves the watch .
4 #### The outfit is great and fits loose but the horns are crumpled and do not stand up . I will need to figure out how to reinforce it to make it upright .
5 #### I have used hot hands quite a few time over the past few years and I found that these are longer lasting than ever before .
5 #### Excellent case . Have n't tried floating it yet . I would recommend it to anyone who duck hunts ! Would purchase again if needed
3 #### Ran very big and long , so not exactly what I expected . I am 5'3 " but had a previous pair from the summer before that fits perfect .
5 #### Very pleased with this kit . I 'm using it for occasional cleaning . It seems to be constructed well .
5 #### Perfect pants ! I 'm an automotive technician and really wear down jeans . These last a long time , a little pricey but well worth it . Will definitely order again .
5 #### I absolutely love this hat . It is made of good quality rip stop and seems like it will hold up well for years to come . Already I have been out in the woods with it several times . Even wore it on an all day scouting trip right before spring turkey season . It rained on myself and my son and the hat held its form through several hours of rain . My sons lesser quality boonie however was drooping and pouring rain down across his face . I will definitely be purchasing more of these , especially at these prices !
3 #### Even though I used the Amazon print out , the shoes were about a size and a half big . That said , they are too darn cute , and my son wants to wear them all the time anyway . There is no outfit that is not improved by a pair of red chucks .
5 #### Quick tranasaction ! ! ! Loved the shoes ! ! ! Would purchase from them again ! ! !
5 #### Nice little assortment of pans for the toaster oven . No stick pans , sturdy , dishwasher safe .
5 #### I am using these bands for P90X and they work GREAT ! There are a lot of complaints for bands ( these bands included ) about tears in bands . If that happens , contact customer support . I got my band replaced for free and it arrived 3 days later . Customer support is AWESOME . Wear and tear WILL happen even when used properly . For my next run at P90X , I 'm going to add in the orange and purple bands for that extra range of weight ! Great product , great support .
3 #### The shoe is good ... but maybe I misunderstood the shoe size system provided by amazob ... I was hoping for a 38 Euro but ended up getting a 36.5
5 #### I purchased.this for my 6 year old son . It is very well made and my.son.could not be happier . He loves.to ride it and wants to take it with him.everywhere .
4 #### My 5 year old grandson loves this , and it 's really strong and not expensive .
5 #### nice fit , nice designt and high quality on a not so high price , jus what you need if you are starting to train some sports that rquires the protection
1 #### I do n't know why , but all Dickies Shorts seem to fit differently even if they 're the same size ! I bought some for my husband at Walmart , and some online , and they all fit different , and I end up having to return them .
5 #### Great first watch for my daughter . I used the same watch with my older child and now my 2nd child has started with her own time teacher watch . It is easy to read and easily adjustable to fit tiny wrists .
4 #### While perhaps not 100 % accurate in extremely rural locations , nevertheless quite helpful and easy to read . I am buying a second copy to leave in the car when we go exploring .
5 #### " M " is for matte finish . There are other finish varieties . Fits and functions fine .
2 #### Loud but very heavy . If you need to keep it in your mouth for more than a few seconds , get another .
5 #### My little guy has wanted a pair of " work boots " for a while , and they are hard to find in little kids ' sizes during Summer in our area . These are just what he wanted , and he wears them all the time .
2 #### I would give five stars but the nylon plastic knob is rotating around the pin during installation . I used no excessive force . I simply threaded left to loosen and push pin per instructions . No hamfisting required to break the nylon knob loose ! I 'm honestly a bit disappointed and would not recommend if you are looking for a durable no worries sling swivel . Update : I bumped up one additional star . I contacted bushnell and their customer service is excellent . They informed me that the nylon knobs are specifically designed to rotate freely around the pin . You actually have to pull on the nylon away from the swivel while rotating to get it engage . They said this feature was to make the pins more secure in that they do n't back out by themselves . He also mentioned that the packaging does not reflect this change . I still do n't like them but if you think it 's broken ... I guess it 's not and functions as it should . Still feels broken to me ...
5 #### i have other colors in this same hat . i really like especially to help with sunblock . price is reasonable . i would recommend .
5 #### This bore cleaning compound has very fine non - binding abrasive particles suspended in liquid . It is a very similar product as&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/J - B - Non - Embedding - Bore - Cleaning - Compound / dp / B0018L9UOW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">J - B Non - Embedding Bore Cleaning Compound</a > . JB is in paste form and this one is in liquid form . This compound has very fine abrasive particles suspended in liquid . So this product CAN eat away bore rifling if used frequently and rigorously . This cleaning compound should only be used if your rifle looses accuracy and all other means of cleaning the bore have failed . New airgun must go through a tin or two of pellets before the bore is smooth and accurate . Instead of waiting for that long I personally use this compound to " break " the barrel of new airguns . Use little bit of compound on a brass brush and go through the bore for about 20 strokes . Be sure that cleaning rod does not rub against the bore . Be sure to clean from breech side and not from muzzle . Then clean the bore dry with lots of patches . Be sure to remove all the compound out of the barrel otherwise it will keep eating the bore . I do n't mean to scare you but make sure you respect the power of this product .
5 #### It 's a nicely made ring . I bought it to wear on my middle finger . I 've had many compliments on this ring . I did put a coat of clear nail polish on it to protect the gold plating .
4 #### I actually ordered red , and they delivered pink and switched my order online to pink . Luckily it was for my daughter so pink worked anyway . Other than that , everything else is great . Not too fast to be dangerous , but still fast enough to be fun and easy to use . Great gift for my 10 year old .
5 #### We have n't used it yet , but it arrived safe & as described
1 #### leaves no gender specified in size and since there is one of this size for men thought that the same size was unspecified lady , but turned out to be for men too
4 #### This is not anything but a toy , kids enjoyed them on vacation then we threw them away . The price is right .
3 #### I used this today and three bass hit it but did n't take it all the way . I do n't know if it is because the hardness of the bait . If it were soft , bass may be more inclined to take it all the way . It is fun to watch the bass attack it . I will keep trying and i am sure I will hook one soon with this lure .
5 #### This is a sturdy product that fits well in the doorway and can handle my 170 lb . weight . It was easy to put together .
2 #### They did n't even last 4 months before the heels busted out . They were my first pair of converse and I 'll never buy another pair !
3 #### kinda nice , but common coloured . Did , nt have the colour that I wanted in my size . Chocolate , sorta rare in this city . Many folks r with classic red that , s cool , though I like the chocolate chuck taylors best . Maybe i 'll add another sumthin , shoe strings with prints .........
4 #### I 'm normally an 11.5 , so I purchased an 11.5 and they fit like a 13 .
5 #### Our lab loved these ; but if you have a lab , you know they love to chew . Nice and soft for their chewing and grabbing needs . Sadly , she has aged alot since we bought these and only really goes after the rubber balls ...
1 #### You can not hold it , it so rough that it scratch your hands really hard . do not buy this product
5 #### Although I have used resistance bands with the Physical Therapist and also with my Bowflex , this is the the first set of Bands that I have purchased . I really enjoy these resistance bands , they are a safe way to perform practical , strength building exercises and they can be taken anywhere . The resistance bands have helped me recover from Knee Surgery and also from Tendonitis . This is a great set for a great price and I recommend it to people of all body types !
1 #### Is n't the converse star supposed to be on the out side of the shoe ? Or am I wrong ?
4 #### Really like the mat . Great for home use . Very thick and heavy . So its not very portable .
4 #### Great stove . Used it to make breakfast every morning , the smell of coffee and bacon is even better ( if that 's even possible ! ) when you are in the outdoors !
5 #### work good for my 17 footer on a floating dock
5 #### Super light weight comfortable ! Kick box in these and run too . Good support !
5 #### Fit as expected .... same genuine Converse as in the store . Would recommend to anyone looking to purchase converse online rather in the store
4 #### I was very happy to find the exact same fitting pair of chuck taylors as my former pair . they are comfortable and look great !
5 #### We used these in the military . I 'm glad I could get them commercially . Loud indeed ! ! !
5 #### Merrill does n't make make wide fits boots / shoes . These are wide , and wear like gloves on my feet . This is my second pair as amazon often offers great pricing-40 % less that Merrill outlet store
5 #### Great stove for camping , good price . shipped on time . would recomend it to anyone that needs a camp stove . can not beat it for the price .
4 #### I 've had my jewelry in boxes as far back as I can remember , and is the reason why most of them never got worn . It was always a hassle to have to sift through them , with much of the necklaces being tangled . This completely solves this problem . Velvet fabric is a nice touch , as it 's color is rich and makes the pieces stand out . The compartments are nicely sized , some smaller than others for more dainty pieces . I did mark it down one star for it 's very flimsy top cover , but at least it came with one . Would have preferred a more solid plastic for added stacking stability , but so far , I am satisfied with it overall .
4 #### Would give it five stars but I ca n't get the links out to make it fit my smaller wrist . Will have to take it to a watch place . Overall beautiful watch ! Very happy with the purchase .
5 #### Sometimes snaps need a little stretch . This gets the job done without tearing your canvas . They are great to have around if you deal with snaps !
5 #### My son started wearing Carhart pants to work years ago and he swore by them , so I tried them out and now I swear by them too . This year I finally tried the tee 's and I now swear by these as well . They fit right , they wear right , they are right ( I should get paid for writing ad copy ) ... they are the best shirts , period .
3 #### I bought mine from a nearby Wal - Mart and it 's worked perfectly so far . Having never installed one before , I just took my time & had some extra zip ties ready ... just in case . The only tool you 'll need is something to trim the ends off the zip ties when you 're done . I like the " scan " mode which flips thru max speed , avg . speed , distance , total time , etc . On the down side , I bought another for my son 's bike . It either had a bad sensor or a broken wire from the sensor to the unit . It never did work . I took it back for a refund . For $ 10 - what do you expect ? You may get one that works fine - you may not .
1 #### I have owned this grill going on three years . It started out great but let me assure you it 's not meant to be outside very much . It does n't hold up to rain either . The unit started to rust after 1 month when it was left outside on the deck the first summer . It had the camp Chef cover but it did n't help much . Now the entire interior base is rusted and powder paint is peeling . The galvanizing is cheap and does n't hold up . The power coated paint has started to rust on the outside too . The worst thing is the metal plates holding up everything can not be disassembled to clean anything rust or grease . For a product over $ 250 that is used outside , it does n't hold up . You can spend a little more at Lowe 's or HD and get a stainless steel BBQ with more features that will hold up forever .
5 #### I am very impressed with this chalk substitute . It does n't produce dust as bad as chalk which is great but it also works much better . I use this for block weights in the house in which a sure grip is very important . My records lifts increased instantly when I tried this stuff ( almost felt like cheating ) . I will get more when this runs out which will be a long time most likely .
5 #### bought these for my husband to wear to our daughter 's wedding ( yes , the bride was fine with it ) and others thought they were slacks , not jeans .
5 #### I am a fan of TIMEX . It 's the third I buy with the others ' stolen ' by son / daughter . It 's simple and I 'll wait to check on its durability . The backlight works perfectly .
5 #### I give it a 5 star rating as I took this on an Arctic vacation and used it as a base layer , and also slept in it . It is so soft and light and not at all scratchy . I became allergic to wool so this is a good alternative .
5 #### These are real good beefy t - shirts . I 'm always disappointed with most others . These are the ones you 're always hoping you get . They 're great and will last for years , if I do n't put on any more weight .
3 #### I bought this as a joke knowing that it would not be a very good fit nor of great quality , but that 's not why I wanted the helmet . I 've worn it while driving ( only out of a parking lot and never in traffic ) to draw laughs from co - workers and others , which it does every time . It 's almost impossible to see out of the darn thing so be careful wearing it and do what I did - remove the eye covers and just wear your sunglasses underneath for the same effect , otherwise you 'll have problems . I did wear it once through a drive - up fast food window and the kids inside liked it so much they offered me a free order of fries , which I refused saying ( in my best Darth Vader accent ) , " My master does n't allow his stormtroopers to eat fried food . " BTY : You 'll need to use some serious glue to hold the helmet halves together ! Have fun !
2 #### Purchased these as a gift for my husband . Ordered the same size and style as the ones he has because he loves them so much . When he tried them on they were too tight . He measured them against his current pair and they were slightly smaller . Since the shoes came from Wayfair we had to pay to ship them back . Bummer .
5 #### OMG this thing is the best . I work on an airfield , and it 's been some super cold days , this baby totally came in handy ! ! ! It has also made me pretty hot , literally holds in all of the heat , but it 's the best . I love it
5 #### This bed tent is so cute and it fits the full size bed for grandson . Easy to remove the change sheets or put away . It does stay warmer in the tent if you close the door opening . What I like , is that you can situp in there and a toddler can stand on bed in the middle and still has room up top . The other ones I have seen are way to low on the bed , more like a pup tent .
5 #### purchased this for a gift exchange and the person loved it
5 #### These fit well , no itching , they stay up until you take them down , they give just a hint of color , they look good with long or cropped pants , or with a long skirt or dress , and can be worn with any color . The price is good and there are two pair in each pack which is a value especially if you wear them often . They arrived earlier than expected and were well packaged , I have worn these and washed them over and over and so far , no holes . I am happy with my purchase , and would order again .
4 #### Great pair of binoculars and with having 2 different eye prescriptions it 's easy to adjust each lens to work well
5 #### the added resistance make something that seem so weak PerfecT
5 #### Even though these are not American made shoes ... they are made in Viet Nam , my husband thinks these shoes are the best ! We try to investigate and buy American . But , they are made well . They fit like a glove should from the first time he wore them and has had no problems . He wears a 9.5 shoe .
5 #### Love this bag . Bought it for a work trip and have used it many times since both with and without the strap .
5 #### Ca n't go wrong with Chuck Taylor and the right cut of jeans to go out for the night . Just be warned , these things run huge for me . I 'm wearing a full size down .
5 #### It fit well- as long as you know to always buy a size down from your normal size .
5 #### Wanted to show my boys the fun of using a " wrist rocket " and this fit the bill perfectly . Folds compact for putting away , easy to learn . Great deal !
4 #### Does what it 's supposed to do . Folds down small , holds a lid out of the muck . Would give it 5 stars if it was made in USA .
5 #### Measured my head and ordered a size up as other reviewers had advised . Good quality and execellent value . Digital Camo matches military bdu .
4 #### Quick delivery and then very easy setup . The case is handy and keeps everything safely in one place . I used this tool to site in two scopes and it worked as advertised . First shots at the range were on paper . This tool is easy to use and seems to be well made . I think it will easily pay for itself in terms of reducing time at the range looking for zero . Highly recommended . Would have given 5 stars but discovered one drawback . I have a scope for my AR15 , the upper and rail design elevates the scope to the point that this devise does n't work . The devise elevation above the barrel is fixed and too low to be of use . I think they could improve this product greatly by adding this feature . Devise will work extremely well on any non AR type rifle .
5 #### Super light - weight , decent arch support ( mine is higher than average ) . I was pleasantly surprised by the sole / tread on these for my circuit training classes , as I could n't really tell by online pics . Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their " Hurache's"/running shoes , so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own ( athletic , heel , boot ) . But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me ( an inch or less , I do n't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging , jumping , etc . ) . Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe , but no damage to box , paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further . I am very happy and highly recommend , although I have only worked out it once !
5 #### I have had this light for about two years now I have had no bad luck with mine at all . I wonder about the other people here . I know some people you just ca n't make happy at all no matter what you try . I have seen this to many times . I think Bell products are good . Far as rain getting in my light that want happen I have a clear bag for days I think it might rain . I keep a few on hand at all times . Never know what the weather will bring our way when out riding . I have three lights on my bike . Having a light on a bicycle is a must have for me . I ride to work on my bicycle and I never know what time I might get off from work . I also have a small engine on my bike too . I do n't our car much any more I have more fun riding to work and going shopping on my bicycle . Yes I do have large Baskets on it too . Now go out and start having fun ride that bicycle again .
5 #### I ordered size 8.5 women 6.5 mens when I typically wear a 9.5/10 . They were a perfect fit but narrow . If you have wide feet , these probably are n't for you .
4 #### Along with therapy , this aided in making my tennis elbow heal . Still use it once in a while for prevention of cuter issues .
5 #### Best balls so when you can get 36 for $ 25 heck yeah .
5 #### Love the Decal and it arrived quickly . Great way to show off the team on the car . Arrived very quickly .
5 #### This watch is very flat and cool looking . My husband loves it . It was the perfect anniversary gift .
5 #### Classic pair of shoes that everyone has been wearing for years . Perfect .
5 #### My almost 3 year old is obsessed with balls , we have purchased many balls in the last 2&1/2years and I now review them regularly . I found these lightweight , soft dodgeballs to be a necessity when I had my second child . He needed to be protected from golf balls , football 's , rubber bouncy balls , basketballs , even soft nerd foam balls were not an option due to biting . My toddler absolutely loves throwing balls and these are fine if they hit my baby on occasion . My baby could care less if he gets a direct hit to the face . If you allow indoor ball play , and you have a toddler , or even older children , these are great ! My other great ball for indoors is a neoprene covered blue and red soccer ball I found on Amazon too . So light weight and soft . Again , the baby does n't care if he gets hit in the head with that one either .
5 #### Totally love the Venice H2 sandals . They are so comfortable , plus waterproof and great for walking , kayaking and light hiking . More of a city sandal than the Newport , but so much more shoe than the wimpier Whisper .
4 #### As per the other reviews , I ordered up one size from the chart ( I 'm 5'4 " about 160 and ordered 1 - 2X ) and it was perfect . I will mention also that the " off - black " has a slight gray - blue tinge in sunlight , which was great for my outfit ( black pattern on white background , so looks sort of gray overall ) but might be off for a truly black dress . Have only worn once , so ca n't speak to longevity , but so far so good .
3 #### Normally I wear a size 8 but I decided to buy these in an 8.5 because the toe box looks short and it is short . I have long toes and they were pressed up against that toe bumper so these sandals would not work for me and I sent them back . To order up to a 9 would probably just make the whole sandal too roomy . This is too bad because the foot bed was very comfortable . If you have short toes this could be a great choice for you .
4 #### Great product . My daughter loves it . Fits her as expected
5 #### I purchased 2 pair of these for my husband awhile ago and just purchased another few pair for him . He travels alot and suffers from ankle swelling . The moderate compression level of these knee length socks is perfect for him . His ankles do n't swell and his legs feel well supported . He prefers the cotton - nylon blend to all synthetic , which these are . The socks also hold up well to regular laundering . We both recommend this product .
5 #### Folks , Well .... Being that its use appears to be that if some one falls overboard ... you throw it to them ? I hope that I never have a need for it . The Coast Guard appreciates seeing it hanging some were in plane site on your boat . If they 're happy ... I 'm happy . Hence , Five ( 5 ) stars . Rascal
5 #### These shoes fit perfect , and i usually wear this size for sandals . I love them so much i only wear them on Sunday , i 'm afraid that they will for dirty . Do n't be afraid of buying them !
5 #### Good pants , seem to be of a real good quality .
4 #### At under 8 bucks I would not expect this to hold up to the rigors of an adult kickball game . For me it serves the purpose of a ball for my little ones to kick , bounce and throw in the back yard and if it gets left out ( which it often does ) or gets lost ( which has happened in the past ) its easy and economical to replace . Note that it comes deflated which I did not see stated in the description so you will need a pump and a needle . I do n't know the technical terms but I have a bicycle pump and a standard needle which worked just fine .
4 #### Works well enough for the deadlifts and squats I do .
5 #### Love these shoes ! So stylish and comfortable . Just got back from a trip to NYC , Black and white Nikes and yoga pants are in high fashion right now !
2 #### They run big and are super uncomfortable and the soles squeak . They do n't breathe at all .
3 #### These are not DKNY tights . However , they fit well and are warm . If you 're looking for a thicker , stiffer tight than DKNY , these are for you . However , people buy DKNY tights for a reason -- they are soft , and they are durable . This company should be censured for providing knockoffs under the DKNY name .
5 #### Best T - shirts I 've ever owned . Heavy cotton lasts for years . And when they finally fade too much or get bleach holes or paint stains ; cut the sleeves off for " weekend work " shirts ! Note : size changes depending on country of origen .
1 #### Terrible . Got this on a Timex deal . Last 4 months . Had the battery checked and it was fine . Would expect better from Timex .
5 #### Purchased this coat for my Holiday travel ; 9 states in 19 days . This is by far the best multi - use jacket I have ever owned ! It held up exceptionally well to the Brutal cold of the Wisconsin Northwoods and kept me dry during a sleet storm in Boston ! I feel as if I 'm putting on a suit of armor against the elements when I suit up with this amazing coat !
3 #### I have identical pair from a few years ago that fit perfect , but the last few pairs bought are pretty tight . Might want to upsize
5 #### I got it because my physical therapist recommended it - they have it in their office , it 's held up really well , and I use mine every day with good results - the gadget to attach it to the door really works , the handles are convenient . Very nice .
1 #### These are knockoffs . I noticed the material is completely different than before , the tightness of the shoe is horrible , and the sizing is completely different . Save your money , and go - to the store .
3 #### Soft , comfortable granny panties . Way too big , should have ordered size smaller . But to return underwater ? Ewww Decided to keep it , for when I get old !
5 #### Who does n't like old school ! My children came out as clumsy as me ! I battle gravity and dodging objects because I bump into things and trip over invisible rocks hahaha I wanted to teach my 8 year old and 6 year old how to skate so I went old school with the quads . I found these to be supportive and easy for him to lace up , she loved the way they looked and was happy with how comfortable they were . Will buy again next year
5 #### I needed a back up knife for my Ontario rtak2 and i have to say this little tool exceeds the expectation for a back up knife . it is almost half the price you can get from anywhere else . you ca n't go wrong with this .
5 #### These are simply adorable ! I ordered the size 4 for my soon to be one year old son . These are nice and roomy and the price was great so glad I found them ! I ordered these to wear with his birthday outfit next month they 're just precious :)
5 #### I really like this office casual watch . So much so that this is the second one of this model that I 've bought . Realistically this will last about 5 years of daily wear . You ca n't beat it for the price .
5 #### After 3 weeks of daily usage my golfer 's elbow disappeared . I have suffered with it for 5 years and this has given me the relief I longed for . THANK YOU !
3 #### They 're pretty tight in the waist considering they 're supposed to be 36 relaxed fit .
1 #### This bra was 3 sizes too big . When the price is too good to be true ... there 's a reason
5 #### My daughter has already been wearing these for back to school and loves them .
5 #### Never better , the best there is , will buy again . Prompt shipment AMZN Prime , no sales tax No problems at all I have not played the balls yet , will update if issues that I doubted Good to go
4 #### It works ... It 's a lid stand . Nothing really special about it . Maybe a little expensive for what you get and what you do with it .
4 #### Cheap material but the white is n't see through but it was big and I have a pretty big butt and ordered a small . Usually that does n't happen to me with smalls , other than that I like it . I love this brand
5 #### Grandson LOVES this trike ; he was having problems pedaling his tricycle ; gets around with no problem with this item ... he just turned 3 .
5 #### Love my new Nike 's . It 's been years since I 've been able to wear them ( sizing changed years ago and I just could n't wear them any more ) but now the new styles and sizing are perfect . Lightweight shoe with tons of style . The Fog color is just what I was looking for ... not black and not neon ! I wore them to participate in Relay for Life ( 24 hour walk ) and they held up great !
3 #### These work good for only a little while then crack around the little holes around the goggles .
5 #### Used it on my Remington 1100 shotgun . All holes lined up and I mounted a red dot scope on it . Will be trying it out in the fall . Seems to be very strong and it matches the metal on the gun .
4 #### I 've kept one in my office desk for ~15 years . It 's survived numerous desk clean outs . Ca n't bear to part with it . Never once used it for flies ... ! ! !
5 #### got ta love the wolverines ! goes perfect with my fairway stand bag and mdivot tool ball marker ! can not complain ! the golf balls i will NOT hit though because i do NOT want to disgrace my blue ! that 's why i have the spartan balls to destroy them from hitting it lol
5 #### Got this for my black Lab and he loves it ! Easily his favorite toy !
5 #### really fineley crafted and has great choice oof tools . It is small but that 's what I wanted . A lot of tools in small package .
2 #### I 'm a large but ordered a size down to Medium and the shirt is still too big . These are very thick shirts that would not be comfortable if you 're working outside in the summer .
5 #### It works fine for kids fooling around . the price is good . Get yourself a portable air pump . It is a pain pumping by hand .
5 #### Protect thyself from UV . Looks good , highly functional and dries very quickly . Use it for kayak fishing , along with matching pants and proper hat
5 #### I love these balls and the price is affordable and free shipping . I am usually shopping at tennis - warehouse . but this time I purchase these balls from Amazon . It is good to play with these balls I am very satisfied with the quality of these balls
4 #### My wife likes them . they had a different fit than other keen sandals but after a few days she got use to the different pressure points . Love them
5 #### Bought for 5 yr old son , great scooter , fast enough for us , he likes it a lot . Great price .
5 #### This is my second pair of Merrell Mocs . The first pair lasted 8 years and I still wear them for yard work . One of the most comfortable shoes ever . The only minor issue is a slight squeak between the insole and footbed .
4 #### These are very nice riding pants , though a little thicker than I expected so i 'll be saving them for the cooler weather . My only grievance with them is the waist band comes up very high . I would prefer a lower rise personally , but if you like them a little higher you will be pleased .
5 #### I bought this so that my intramural team could practice with it . It 's a really good volleyball to play with , and of course it 's cool that it has Wilson from Cast Away on it .
3 #### I like the look of the shoes , but I 'm not able to wear it all day because of its lack of arch support and hard footbed . I placed an insert in it , and that helps but not enough .
5 #### I keep it on my Air Rifle all the time , ...
5 #### These are some of the best quality out there . Durable , thick fabric .
5 #### Bought 2 of these for camping and fishing . This is one of those rare times when the actual product itself looks even better in person than it does in a picture . The olive - drab portion is a true OD green and the lid is a much darker nicer tan color than it appears in the photo . The picture makes the lid look like dirty white or something , but it is n't . The actual lid looks great in person .
5 #### Use it any time I fish and there is nothing around to sit on . I keep it in truck all the time .
5 #### < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Timex - Women - s - Fashion - Two - Tone - Bracelet - T25771 / dp / B00020J0SQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Timex Women 's Fashion Two - Tone Bracelet # T25771</a > Timex two tone watch was a great buy . Hoping my mother in law will like just as much as I did when I opened the box . :) Update 5/17/2016 - Its been some time since I purchased this for my mother and thought I give an update on its condition ! . Its awesome . The color has not faded , the construction of this watch was made to last and very happy mom loves it . Recommend it for anyone . Also , I forgot to mention on the original post that it does come in a box that you can wrap as the gift box ! .
4 #### I started doing yoga recently , and the first order of business was to find a mat so I did n't have to stand on the hard floor , slip around on a towel , or use a mat at the gym that people sweated all over . I thought I could find something for around $ 20 , but there was nothing that seemd to fill my needs . I 'm 6'3 " so I needed something long . Nothing squishy . Nothing paper thin . Nothing that would fall apart after a few uses . But > $ 80 ? Who was I kidding ? But after a lot of thought I realized I 'd probably go through 4 $ 20 mats and still end up buying this one . So I swallowed hard and bit the bullet . It came today , and I 'm glad I did . This is a well made mat of heavy , high density rubber material . They say it wo n't slip , and I 'm sure it wo n't . It does n't have some nice peaceful design on it , but I can live with that . It also is n't some bright gaudy color either . Plain black with the Manduka label / logo in one corner . Now I just have to forget the exorbitant price and move on . I 'm pleased ( but poorer ) with this purchase .
4 #### This is a great watch for beginners at time telling . My daughter loves the butterfly second hand and the reversible band . My only complaint is that we have to keep it a little loose so she can slide it on and off her wrist , otherwise we have to under the whole watch each time . It would be nice if there was a real clasp that could open and close easily .
4 #### Very good softballs - but very expensive for practice balls - also . Ordered yellow got green
5 #### Better than we expected ! We love it ! Shipped very quickly . Magnet works great on our magnet board in our home as well as on the back of our car on game day . We were happy to see it was true to size .
5 #### Great whistle . I referee water polo matches and may be required to use a whistle for up to 8 hours or more ( at a tournament . ) I can do that with this whistle though I recommend that you wear ear plugs as this thing is LOUD !
4 #### good jean for everyday use .. and the price was right
5 #### You ca n't beat Soffe shorts ! These are cute and are true to size !
5 #### Shoes fit perfectly , and they came in a timely manner .
3 #### Has some kond of chemical on it that may deter you but they work well .
5 #### This is a very nice scope . Clear and easily adjustable . Tri - pod is very good .
5 #### Strong , sturdy cargo bar to keep my bowling bag and other items from tipping over
5 #### Chucks never go out of style . Love these sneakers and wear them with a dress to work often . Very versatile .
4 #### Bought it for 50s day at my sons school . It was a little larger than we thought but it was totally adorable !
5 #### It is warm and fits good , but as one or more of the other reviewers mentioned , you just ca n't help but look like a terrorist in this thing , which I found absolutely hilarious ! I bought it to where at the gun range in the winter because the wind is terrible blowing into our faces on the firing line . Not sure , however if I want a truck load of guns and this mask on me ! Really .... could you imagine explaining to a cop that you are on your way to the shooting range with all your guns and then he sees this in the seat next to you ? ! Maybe I should have picked white or pink or high vis orange .
5 #### I 've used Bosu balancers before so when I decided to get one of my own , I knew just what I wanted to order . No surprise that I am very happy with the product . Very solid piece of equipment that lets you do so many things . And it come with an exercise book so I was able to add some things to my routine .
2 #### Shoes fell apart rather quickly ( 2 months ) , bought adult pair that fell apart as well !
5 #### good quality . cord hole reinforced . comes in reusable zippered pouch .
5 #### We love these shirts . They are perfect for heat , humidity and sun and all outdoor activities .
5 #### Uncle Mike 's does it again , its an old tried and true sling attachment ... an oldie but goodie
3 #### These fit me fine . 11D. However a wider foot will be uncomfortable .
5 #### I picked up the 1450 from Pelican for $ 80 shipped , Prime . Arrived the next day . Boom . Love Prime . Anyhow , the case was as described and measured . A big complaint is how a lot of stacked amazon listings do n't have any information on size and stuff in them . Anyhow , this one had the measurements listed and I liked the size so went for it . Works great . The foam is as described and easy to pluck out and mold to whatever you want to fit in the case . The case is crazy durable . It 's also good looking , not flashy like a gun case , but not like a garbage bin either . I got them to house Headphones . That 's right . Headphones . I also got a smaller one for holding electronic equipment ( DAC , AMP , etc ) . Great for shipping around . Great for storage . Great for carrying around . I can get into a car wreck and my stuff will be pristine . These boxes are how you keep your stuff alive when the worst happens . They 're not cheap , but if you like certain items and want them safe , this does it . Great products .
4 #### Its a strap . Its pink , it attaches onto a gun . What more can you say about it ? Its a lighter pink than the picture indicates , but not bad .
5 #### The fit if just right . Like the material and great in the water .
4 #### This is my second Timex Expedition . The first one which has a dark olive green face was purchased in 2007 and is still going strong . It is a rugged watch and I have changed the battery once ( I do n't use the indiglo feature ) . Why 4 stars on the new watch ? The band . The picture on Amazon shows a somewhat darker band . The one I received had a brownish , gray band which I do n't like . Of course , expect the watch to outlive the band and the band is an easy fix .
5 #### The most versatile pair of shoes I 've owned . Can be worn in any environment . Fits to size , great for long days on feet . I have repurchased these same pair of shoes since they were 1st introduced to me in the early 2000s .
5 #### I own several Smith & Wesson knives I naught on Amazon and like the others , this one for the price you wo n't find anything better . Buy it , you will be glad you did .
5 #### I can clearly see .223 bullet holes in a target 250 yards away . Need I say more ?
5 #### Well finished and solid . Seems to be good quality control from start to finished product .
5 #### Excellent feel and comfort , however i should have chosen a larger size . They fit ok , just slightly snug
5 #### What makes this a killer deal is the fit and the vintage design ! Great for everyday use .
5 #### Nice Watch , I use it for work , easy to read . The only drawback is it is hard to set the day .
5 #### Fits perfect . Comfortable . Ca n't go wrong . Will be buying more .
5 #### The bands came quickly and I was able to use them in a variety of different ways to with out mammy muscles in my body with the small booklet of exercises that came packaged with it as well as viewing exercises of the company web site . I gave up on my L.A. fitness membership for these . I recommend it .
5 #### Great product ! Really completed the outfit ! My 4 year old loves them !
5 #### I have been buying these briefs for years . The Amazon price could not be beat , even when other merchants put them on sale . I definitely will order more .
1 #### Returned item because it was too large . I ordered my regular size , 10.5 , but these shoes seemed to be more like 11.5 .
5 #### Nice product from Timex fits young people under 15 years old in my opinion , or of preferred sizes are small and lightweight from Some people Known products of this company strongly resist water in their products , and the prices are acceptable , especially sales of Amazon , this is a remarkably compared with large sites on the web
5 #### This may sound pretty lame but , I bought these for my wife . LOL She loves them and has a blast ! Great price and quick shipping .
1 #### Received this camp stove today and was very disappointed . There is a dent in the front that does not allow the tank to be properly connected to the stove . The dent is painted and there are no marks so I would say it was done at the factory because the box is in perfect shape . I am exchanging and hope the new stove is in better shape .
5 #### Good hooks as always sharp as hell cut myself as I tied up my 7/0 hooks damn egg knots lol
2 #### I love the watch . It has a nice look , is water resistant , lights up , and has a second hand . What I do n't like is the band . It actually hurts my wrist . The buckle rubs , scrapes , and scratches . I 've tried making it tighter and also looser . but neither helped . I ended up putting a piece of gauze under the buckle ( which only helps temporarily because it moves or falls out ) . I have 5 other Timex watches and none of the buckles do that . It 's a shame because the watch itself is really nice . Also it 's very short . I have very small wrists and it 's on the 2nd to the last hole . Anyone with larger wrists would be unable to hook it .
5 #### I love how the color of the hour hand matches the hours and the color of the minute hand matches the minutes . My four - year - old loves it as well . Slow but sure , she is learning how to tell time on her own watch .
5 #### My kindergarten daughter just started basketball and this is perfect for her ! Very nice ball for the price ! I think I will buy the other sizes as well !
5 #### my second pair , wore the first ones out . Glad they still make them .
1 #### I was really disappointed by these . I should have paid a little more for a better quality product . One of them fit my shotgun but it 's so low - profile that you could still see the original " bead " behind it , so it looks funky when you aim down the barrel . I took it off and just threw the whole package in my junk bin .
5 #### I love the boot , they run a lil large . I should have gotten a 6.5
4 #### I have Raynaud 's Which really effects my hands . I carry these in my pack to stuff in my gloves . I would recommend carrying several sets- the packaging occasionally fails leaving a lump of uselessness .
3 #### Did n't fit my 700 , not even close enough to alter . The description needs more data . Remington 700 stocks vary a lot .
5 #### These are perfect for daily knee highs ! They are comfortable , do n't fall down , and the color is just right ! These are the only knee highs I 'll be ordering from now on !
5 #### I am an average size woman , dress size 6 - 8 ( 5'6 " and 130 # ) and these fit me with no trouble at all and some room to spare . They would easily fit someone larger too ( but probably not a large muscular male --- he might be able to wear the kneepads as elbow pads though ! ) . They have stretch velco straps so the size is adjustable . The velcro straps are comfortable , not so tight that they cut off circulation . I like them a LOT better than my old ones , which were not straps but stretchy elastic and hard to get on and off , especially if one was sweating ! These are simple , fast and easy to put on and take off . These seem well - made ; I 've had them for about a month ( with usage 3 times a week , for biking ) and I expect them to last a long while----but even if they did n't , at this price it 's affordable to replace them . They probebly would work equally well for skating . They do n't hamper one 's movement --- when wearing them , I pretty much forget that they 're there . For the price , these ca n't be beat ! I 'm very pleased with the purchase .
5 #### He wears a 4xl , works outside in construction , does a lot of bending over in public , these covered nicely . Perfect weight for mid - temps . Sturdy material .
5 #### The straps are n't needed most of the time . If I 'm doing yard work , then I attach them with the easy - on velcro . The belt itself is surprisingly light - weight for the performance . By that I mean : You can adjust it easily to whatever tension you need ( and I 'd say it would fit almost any adult ) . And , despite the light weight , it is not flimsy . Other belts I 've bought are thicker , and you never can forget you 've got one on . This is more comfortable . Ergodyne also the has lowest price . When and if I need another belt , this will be the one I buy .
5 #### Terrific stretching and strengthening tool for tennis elbow . I used the red for 8 weeks before moving to green . Doing the twist excercise in conjunction with trigger point balls , stretching , and weighted wrist drops seems to really be helping . I did a lot of research on tendon - OSIS and am 9 weeks into home therapy after being told I needed surgery . Tennis elbow pain seems be getting better ... fingers crossed !
5 #### It is thin and fits close to the body precisely because it is meant to be used as a base layer and not on its own . Excellent under scratchy sweaters made of wool or other not so soft materials .
5 #### I love these shoes . They fit as expected and are comfortable to wear to work . I stand at work at least 8 hours a day and they feel good .
5 #### A - MA - ZING ! I needed a good jogging shoe and these make me feel like " Forest Gump " . I felt like I was running on a cloud . I have narrow feet and these fit perfectly . I am so happy that I am going to purchase another two pair as back - ups for once it 's time to replace them . Highly recommend to women who like to walk or run and light a light weight , comfortable shoe .
5 #### I LOVE this water bottle ! I have been searching for one like it for some time . I like my water to be really cold . Unfortunately , I do n't have a big enough fridge at work to keep a large bottle in . I have a Tervis and a Camelbak bottle , and love them both , but my ice is melted in them by lunchtime . I filled this thing with ice , and it lasted all day . There was ice in the bottle after I finished my last serving before bed , and the ice still was n't completely melted by the next morning . I also had it fall off a 6 foot + high file cabinet onto a tile floor . Small Nick in the lid . That 's it . I have already recommended this to friends and family , who will also be investing in one for themselves .
4 #### These shoes are beautiful . My husband wears them pretty often to church and says that they are extremely comfortable . However , he has the habit of taking his shoes off with his heels ( from years of wearing cowboy boots ) and the sole of one of the shoes completely separated from the leather upper after just a couple of uses . We are going to have the shoe repaired since my husband loves them so much ( and they look so good on him ) , but buyer beware that these shoes need to be handled with care .
3 #### For only $ 22 this is a great board that comes with 2 sets of beginner darts . Not too much to complain about but I 'll be sending it back for the Blade 4 . I played for about an hour and had at least 10 - 15 bounce outs , if not more . One of em stuck in the ground about 6 " from my foot . For $ 40 more I think it 's just worth it to get the Winmau if you 're going to play more than once or twice a week . Besides , for the amount of time you 're going to own the board , 40 bucks means nothing . Other than the bounce outs the board seems fine but does n't seem to heal too well so not too sure about longevity . If you 're on a tight budget go for it but I 'd recommend investing a little more and protecting your darts .
5 #### Diffidently helps in controlling the kick back , I have large hands & this gives me a little more grip .
4 #### I play soccer just for fun , not competitive at all , but I do find it to be relaxing and great exercise . I 've always wanted my own goal and I must say this is perfect for backyard use . I 've been using it about every day and have n't moved it from the back yard , which is saying a lot living in Florida where the sun is absolutely pounding on it ... as well as lots of rain . Assembling the goal was easy enough as were the directions . I was n't looking forward to putting it together but it was done before I knew it . I am disappointed with the Velcros and the amount that they supplied . I wish they were a little more heavy duty , as I am not the strongest kicker and they fall off sometimes . I will have to pick up a pack of heavy duty ones later . I can use the net without having fears of it moving around which is great . This is such an awesome net to practice accuracy shots and to have little 1 on 1 games with friends . I am going to keep the net longer outside and will update the review if anything changes regarding the net .
5 #### Took this case on vacation to an all inclusive resort . It was nice to keep tip money dry even in my pocket in the pool . I was concerned that it would nt be durable enough , but it definitely was . I would buy it again .
5 #### Got this thing today and first thing i noticed is how solid it is . It feels tough . I started out with the 100 pd one , might have made a mistake ? I can do it about five times in a row . I think i could do more but The tread on it is rough on your skin if you are not used to it . Of course i could not put it down all afternoon so it should nt take long to toughen my skin but ... i noticed tonight i have a big bruise on the inside of my hand ? It looks like i must have burst a blood vessel lol . I hope it does n't start hurting tomarrow .
5 #### I am 5.7 with long legs and size A / B fit great . Nothing is worse than having to stretch nylons for all they are worth to get them to fit and you end up ripping them . I ordered the navy blue color and it went great with the dress I wore to a wedding .
2 #### I bought 2 pair for my husband who wears a 29 but he wanted the shorts to fit loose so I bought 30 's and they are way tight on him . And the fabric is thick and stiff and are more of a carhart feel rather than the old dickies he has .
1 #### Worst bra ever made ! ! This bra is horrible ! It will makes your breasts look like two triangles , it 's a very unattractive look . I regret buying this bra . If you do n't mind your breasts pointy , than this is the bra fr you . I can not recommend this bra , not even to my grandma ! it 's that bad ! ! I will never buy another Bali bra again . Every bra I bought from Bali has been a disappointment . Unfortunately I can not recommend this bra to anyone , it 's too horrible . Save your money , and go with a different brand !
3 #### I am beyond bummed ! ! ! ! First time I went to put them on , I spent a lot of time trying to shimmy into the top of it ... according to the chart I should be on the smaller side of the 1x ... and the crotch I just could n't get all the way up so I kept trying to work them up and instead of the hosery I stretched my luck ... Before they even made it out of the bedroom a run from my thigh to knee . I 'm super disappointed
3 #### Some reviews suggested ordering a size up , which I did , a 9.5 instead of my usual 9 . Now that they 're on my feet , I do think a 9 would have been too short , but my heel slips around in these . I have very narrow feet , and I do n't think these shoes will be good for me . They also feel quite hard , more like walking in clogs . Contrary to some other reviews here , I do n't feel my foot is wrapped in comfort and support , though the shoe seems well made and solid . I might keep them for just dashing outside or for short trips , but they will not be my go - to shoes . They 're nice looking though , in the suede !
5 #### Great stretching exercise especially for a warm up fast thing in the morning when the elbow is stiff . Low cost , simple , long lasting piece of exercise equipment .
5 #### My father has had these shoes for years . He LOVES them . They slip on easily .. not too tight , not too loose . As he is older ( in his mid- 70 's ) , the tread on the bottom helps him feel safe -- they do n't slip . They look good with jeans or slacks . And most importantly , they are very comfortable !
3 #### I purchased superman and supergirl matching costumes . I thought my twins ( boy / girl ) would like them . Since they enjoy dressing up . They let me put it on so I could take pictures and then they took them off . They have n't touch them since . Not sure why . I like them they are so cute . They wear all of their other costumes batman , princess etc . Just not these .
5 #### loved it ! I used it on my trip to Utah and slept in the car . did not lose air like other mattresses that I had used in the past
5 #### I bought a bunch of these . I hate my guns clanging around in the safe . They fit a bit tight , but I expected that for that size that I purchased . I stretched them out a bit so they would fit over my guns with optics . The piece of mind is worth it .
5 #### My fiance loved these and was happier than I expected . Amazon was more than easy to order from and they got to me in a timely matter . Very happy .
5 #### Really nice quality , big enough to fit without a struggle !
5 #### I ca n't wait to use this on our summer expedition , looks like it will handle the job just fine !
4 #### Nice Boots . Little more pointed toed than the pic shows .
5 #### Just what the flashlight doctor ordered . I have two Olight M22s that were in need of some lubrication . It was shipped in a flat box and the lid was loose with some leakage . Not big deal .
3 #### LOCAL NAMES Chinese ( baishu , xiangbai , cebai , bianbai ) ; English ( biota , tree of life , book- leaf pine , oriental arborvitae , Chinese arborvitae , Chinese thuja ) ; French ( thuya oriental , thuya d'orient , thuya de chine ) ; German ( Morgenlaendischer Lebensbaum , Chinesiche Thuja , Lebensbaum , Orientalischer Lebensbaum ) ; Italian ( tuia orientale ) ; Japanese ( konotegashiwa ) ; Spanish ( uya de la China ) ; Trade name ( Chinese arborvitae ) Pretty strong given it 's weight . I find some of the reviews , seems folks do not know their wood . Now I got mine for $ 10 at our large flea market in Raleigh NC . It is very nice for something casual hikes and walks . I tend to collect them when I see a stick that appeals to me . I have some Black Diamonds for my serious hiking . BTW Hickory , Oak and Ash are strong but weigh a fair amount . I make my own walking sticks / canes from those woods .
4 #### it fit kinda tight around my thighs and butt but it i think was supposed to do that . really slimmed out everything but ripped in the butt area after a while . maybe i just needed a bigger size for my butt but they looked great and still do I made them into ripped tights and still love them . i have super sensitive skin and it did n't scratch my legs at all .
4 #### Off to a good start with these comfortable shoes . Hope they last as long as the " original " model .
5 #### Love , love , love these ! Luckily I read the reviews first and saw they run big ... I'm normally a women 's 9 , but ordered a women 's 8 and they fit perfectly . Very cute and comfy !
3 #### I would give this a great review because I have owned these before and I love them for putting my cigar in the holder when I am playing golf . The holder has three prongs that secure the cigar . I bought four of these this time because unfortunately I leave them in the cart and then they " disappear " when I go back to the pro shop to see if the cart guys have turned it in . Unfortunately the first of the four I used one of the prongs must have been weak or something and it broke off . So now it only has two prongs and I 'm concerned if these may also be weak and they may break off in time . I 'm going to contact the seller and see if he will consider exchanging it for me . It 's a great idea .... and this is the first time I have had one of these prongs that help secure the cigar break .
5 #### My mom introduced these undies to me , and I still love them . They seem to fit just right , and they are light and easy to wear . I often hear her teasing sing - song , " skimp - skamp , " when I reach for them and smile at the affectionate remembrance .
5 #### This one was too small but I love the shoe . I returned it and will re - order again the right size .
5 #### Simple to use , and gives me a little more peace that the bolt goes the entire way through the hitch , versus the original bolt that just screws in on one side . Also , the locking mechanism works well , and is easy to operate . I taught my 7 and 9 year old how to lock / unlock it , so it 's that simple .
5 #### I have a cheap point and shoot camera setup . I used this to make sure I did n't lose the camera . My dive buddy and I took turns using the camera . The bolt snap made it easy to transfer and secure . When transferring , I would disconnect and connect to him and he did the same when giving it back to me . The coil length was perfect for this .
5 #### Worked in the winter months , of course stored now for the summer , back on late next fall I 'm sure .
5 #### Perfect gift for the man cave . The entire basement is Green Bay Packers , Green Bay everything . This will be a nice addition to my husbands collection
5 #### I bought these for going to concerts , and sight seeing . Was surprised on how clear they look , and so was my husband . My last ones were a gift , that cost more , and they broke . I could n't see anything , everything was blurry . It really was a life saver , when we were in the balcony , using these made us see the show . For what I paid , they seem like so much more . I really got more for my money on these . I 'm leaving this one in my car , for sight seeing
5 #### My husband works construction and I bought him these as an Easter surprise . They are very comfortable , look nice and keep him warm and cool while he works ! Durable fabric and they wash well ! These are great work shirts and very presentable for meeting with clients .
4 #### If you have an extra $ 40 bucks to spend on a compass than this is certainly an option . Points north and everything !
5 #### Have owned only these sandals for about 8 years now ... Would not buy anything else ! Jamie
4 #### I needed a wide size , that option was not available . So I went up a half size bigger hoping that would work . It 's not quite comfortable but I am able to wear them . I like the shoes .
4 #### The pants run about a size small . Since I normally wear a size 36 . I ordered a size 38 and they fit just a bit tight but I could lose a few pounds anyway . Update ... I have been wearing them religously . They have not loosened up as much as I would like ( after several washes ) but they are still comfortable and look good . I am quite impressed despite the somewhat stiffness ...
5 #### The old saying " if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it " must have been meant for this stove . Coleman has been making these for years and years , they are dependable and tough . Have been camping and hunting for over 30 years , and this is only the second Coleman stove that I have had to buy , and that 's only because the first one was recently handed down .
5 #### I love these on my 1 year old , they began to fit her best at 18 months . They ran a little big .
3 #### Leather quality was really underwhelming . I might have kept them , considering the price , but they also run about a half size smaller than all the similar Stacy Adams oxfords I 've tried so I ended up returning them .
5 #### My favorite style of shoe . Fit perfectly every time I get a new pair , which is not very often .
4 #### It 's hard for me to find the right size shoe , and I always have to go one size up to accomodate width . Lots of colour / pattern options . Converse feel different since buying them in middle / high school , but companies change and I understand . I bought the dusky pink ones ( do n't remember the actual colour name ) and while they look cute , the colour barely survived a single 3rd shift . It faded pretty quickly , but I do n't mind it much . These work as both a fashion statement and a reliable pair of shoes .
4 #### I love the pants , great fit , great for working in the security field . My only problem is that these pants are more brown than khaki , would 've gave it 5 stars if the color matched khaki but it does n't .
5 #### Will order this product again ! The price was really good and it fit perfectly !
4 #### Great fit for any older male or grown man . My son loves it !
5 #### I bought 3 of these for my grandsons . They all love to play with them . Quality made and will give them lots of summer fun .
4 #### Great shoes . This is the second pair I ordered . Great style just what my 17 year old wanted for Christmas . I had to send the first pair back because they were the wrong size . I had to pay over $ 9 bucks to return . I thought it was free returns . So make sure you buy with a free return .
2 #### Poor quality in less than two months already coming apart
3 #### Dull as all get out when received . It took a great deal of effort to bring this blade to useful sharpness . It does hold an edge decently , but I would only use this knife as a last resort . Admittedly that is the purpose of a boot knife , but this knife is certainly an example of " you get what you pay for . " I should note that I bought this knife two years ago , so perhaps they 've increased their standards .
4 #### I know chucks run big ... should have ordered a half size smaller but still fit pretty well and really like them
5 #### I have avoided purchasing control top for fear of them being too tight or not going up over my stomach . I appreciate the fit of these pantyhose , when pulled up they fit almost to my bra and I just pull to the waist . Better a bit to big than too small .
1 #### The POCKets are very small . The right side pocket is way too far aft , too close to your butt , so when you sit down , what ever is in there is being sat on . The other pockets are too small as well . The BELT loops are waaaay too small . I bought a Heel belt from amazon which I love . It 's only 1.25 " wide . I ca n't use it on these shorts . I can only use small 3/4 " wide belts . Dumb . There is only one side utiliity pocket . I have several other Dickies uniform style pants , even though they are uncomfortable , esp in summer , they are somewhat useful in the pocket category . .. but not their shorts like these .
2 #### Shoe too stiff for me . Also , I need a narrow and not so high heel and more room in the forefoot and toe area . My feet are difficult to fit .
1 #### Really unhappy with this purchase . I purchased as a gift for my niece and nephew and they just set it up with weather clearing up . After about 10 minutes of kicking balls at the goal the net broke . This was from a 4 year old boy and 8 year old girl . I played college soccer so I hate to see what would happen if I kicked a ball at it . Because we took awhile to set it up while the weather warmed up I can no longer return it . I would n't recommend this goal as I am not sure it will last long .
5 #### Very good looking shoe . Got it for my fiance for our wedding . He can always count on the comfort and style and durability of Dockers .
3 #### This combo is not for me . Just my opinion . The Trangia itself is fantastic but the stove is oversized and bulky and the 4 risers are spread apart too far to use anything smaller than a 12 cm Billy Pot . Forget about just cooking a cup of soup or boiling a small amount of water .
5 #### Works awesome on my boots ! I am able to do 10 boots for the entire family in a single bottle !
5 #### It is a very simple device that works well , making it easy to string or adjust your Excalibur crossbow very easy . You may not need it often but it 's a helpful tool to have .
5 #### Love these shoes . My feet feel so much better . Lots of padding and light enough to run in .
5 #### love carhartt products and this one is no exception . The sizing runs a little big . The shirt holds up well wash after wash .
4 #### fits a little snug which surprise me I have the same size and style with my old ones
4 #### I like the watch especially the backlight feature . Did not give it 5 stars because I find the green face a bit hard to read at times .
5 #### WEAR THESE SHOES ALL THE TIME , GREAT QUALITY , COMFORTABLE AND STYLISH .
5 #### They are amazing . I think the leather is the way to go with white shoes
2 #### It 's ok , it does the job , but the problem is that It does n't stay in it 's little clip very well . Many times I 've knocked it out and it fell off or I was riding along and it was n't logging the last ? ? ? miles ? Other than that it 's ok .
5 #### Perfect for the aluminum side pannier on my KLR ... makes any stop a comfortable one , regardless of the terrain .
5 #### This is the spring and summer shoe you 'll want to wear ! The Sperry Top - Sider Billfish shoe is amazingly comfortable , and runs true to size !
5 #### I took up swimming a few months ago to train for a triathlon next year , and this is the goggle I chose . Fits well , does not leak at all , which was very important to me . I 'd never worn goggles before , and I am so happy not to have my eyes hurt after swimming . I highly recommend them .
4 #### I have a bad back and this helps prevent back soreness and strain . It can be worn over or under clothing and fits a 32 " ( and probably a 34 " ) waist or smaller . It is a big help with my posture when using a compute for long periods which is a problem for me . It provides a light support for the back but is n't in the same league as the leather or heavy support belts for construction or weight lifting ( or cost or discomfort either ) . Can be a little fussy to adjust and I find the suspenders to be a determent which is why it gets a 4 ( even if you remove the suspenders it is fussy to adjust ) .
5 #### I play racquetball regularly and suffer from Golfer 's elbow ( inside of the forearm hurts more than the outside ) . I learned that the medical terms are Medial Epicondylitis ( Golfer 's elbow ) and Lateral Epicondylitis ( Tennis elbow ) . Thera - Band helps in both cases though . You can find tons of videos on youtube or any other sites demonstrating the " Tyler Twists " for each of these conditions . Thera - Band can be used for Shoulder strengthening too . I really like this product . I first purchased the RED Thera - Band but it did not provide enough resistance . I returned it and bought the BLUE one and it works much better for me .
4 #### Franklin makes good quality sports equipment , and this # 4 sized soccer ball will hold up for many years of practice with our younger grandkids , now aged 9 - 12 . This is the size ball this age group uses for their school and soccer league games , so it 's perfect for practice at our local playground . The ball is stitched well , and I appreciate the shiny faux leather material -- it wipes off readily , and when the field is muddy , we can just rinse off the ball with no problem . Still , we were able to use a Sharpie to it our name on the ball , and that does n't wash off . The ball arrives slightly under inflated , which is a good thing -- we were able to quickly inflate it to playing hardness . Very pleased with this ball .
5 #### Exactly what I ordered and great quality . These are the best grippers I have ever owned .
2 #### My first time I have ordered gym shoes on line and they are to small really need a 9
5 #### nice and heavy , prevents breathing cold air during winter winds
5 #### So I looked around on the inter - webz and figured out that this mount would fit my tri - fecta .22 barrel . So far so good .
4 #### I 'm impressed by these fuel tablets . I recently purchased the Esbit folding stove(small size)which came with a six pack of these . So far I made a cup of tea , and Ramen Noodles . With the Ramen Noodles you bring two cups of water to a boil , add the dried noodles , boil three minutes more , and they 're ready to eat . One fuel tablet burns just long enough to cook them . Tablet burnes out about a minute later . Had I the larger stove , I would 've tried scrambling one egg just to see if it would cook it . I 've already used three and want to order the twelve pack as they 'll last a couple months . I rated the fuel tablets four stars because they require a long burning match(long burning storm - proof matches.)or butane lighter for igniting a gas grill . It 's difficult to get a disposable Bic lighter into the center of the stove to ignite the cube . Update 10/1/14 Amazon did it again , raised the price from $ 10-$15 for the twelve pack .
5 #### I collect cowboys items and I purchased this for my office at work , get a lot of great feedback go cowboys
2 #### I bought a couple of these , and wound up throwing both away . The pads stuck ok to the bow , but not to the rest .
1 #### I thought this had a heart monitor . SMALL Display . The Calorie Burnt Counter is Kcal vs regular calories . I ran on the treadmill and compared my Calories burned and Distance and it was VERY OFF ! Overall the pedometer said I only burned 83 kcal I ran for 30 mins and walked for 15 mins = 45 mins total in which the treadmill stated I burned 400 Calories . You must also calculate the kcal according to your age , but my results did not come close to the treadmill measurements . Dissapointed . I bought this because of the reviews on how accurate it is . But it 's not . Have you compared it to something else ? a bike or a treadmill ?
5 #### A must have if you are using Dutch Ovens . I would recommend that you get 2 . One to use a clean surface and the other for using as a stand for frying pan etc .
5 #### awesome dart board . much nicer than the plastic ones . made for a very nice addition to my living room bar .
5 #### my man is 5'7 , 160 lbs and this suit in a large fits him perfect
3 #### The appearance of this medal is great . It is however very light weight . I glued some pennies in the back and put a piece of paper over it and closed up the back . It added weight and worked great . I would not be ashamed to use it in any production of the Wizard of Oz .
5 #### These things are very thin , we 'll see how well they hold up for durability . I hate wearing thick gloves when it 's just a little chilly . Will update if they suffer from any defect other than normal usage .
3 #### Not the Chucks of old but then again , what is these days ?
5 #### Fits as expected : that being - not very fitted , and if you read the reviews they are short . If you want it fitted do n't get it . It 's made to layer up underneath . Also if you 're over 6 ' get the long cut because if I did n't it would have been too short . I 'm 6'2 " and it 's perfect . It 's very stiff - but I wanted a tough as nails , water resistant jacket that was warm as hell and it hits the mark perfectly - if you want soft and fluffy get a fleecy . I use this for riding my motorbike to work on cold days and it is beautifully warm . To be honest if it ever dies I 'll buy the exact same one again .
5 #### I 've had it for 3 weeks & I still ca n't close it but my grip is getting stronger each week . Very well made . Showed it to friends & were impressed that they ca n't close it & are planning to buy one too .
5 #### Great sneakers . Love them and they look and feel great . I got a size 11 and maybe should have gotten a 10.5 . But I really love them . I call them my " day slippers " , they are that comfortable . Go for it , you 'll enjoy them . I get a lot of compliments
5 #### These are great helmets and are just as nice as other brand ( although probably a bit heavier , which does n't bother me while I 'm riding ) . I bought two , one for me and my wife , and we love them . Great price and very sturdy construction .
5 #### Perfect for my granddaughter , she wants to be able to tell time .
5 #### It is a shell holder and does its job like it is supposed too . RCBS makes good products and this one is no exception .
5 #### Works better than trying to stuff a rag in the magwell .
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with swiss knife . I carry it everywhere , its so convenient and handy , the best tool been invented .
4 #### Works just as described . I 'm well satisfied with the product
4 #### used it , it 's really smelly , have n't try in the rain , but I will update , 1 star off for smelly and size smaller than walmart .
4 #### I like chalk better to be honest , but this does n't leave a residue behind so it makes it better in the end . Although I 'm curious as to what it is made of , since you 're breathing it in every time you use it and/or enter the room you use it in . Obviously chalk is n't good to breath in , but is this stuff worse ? Anyway , it does work well so I recommend it over anything else .
5 #### great deal good quality I 'm ready to buy one more
5 #### I bought this to replace my old wallet and love it ! I needed something with lots of slots to hold credit cards , etc . and it is great . It looks very nice and I appreciate the double slots for the coins . Overall , it is a perfect wallet ( and I am hard to please when it comes to wallets and purses ) .
2 #### I bought my normal size , but it did n't fit at all ... it just does n't fit a woman 's breast . I had to bend way over to get my breasts into the bra cups ... then the fabric was low quality and very scratchy . The straps also did n't feel right ... like they were in the wrong place on my shoulders . I have always trusted Bali ... but not anymore . It seems to me that wonderful companies are now contracting out their orders to low quality seamstress companies that cut a lot of corners to make a higher profit ... I ended up giving away two brand new bras to someone else , who gave them to someone else and they finally ended up in the trash . So much for Bali bras from now on .
5 #### I ca n't help it . I 'm a watch nut , but not a picky one . At least I never thought so . But , a watch has to speak and three words it has to say are , comfort , style and accuracy . This Timex screams all three . Chances are when you wear it , someone will notice , most likely after you 've forgotten this lightwegiht comfortable timepiece is on your wrist . You like the retro look that wears like a dream and works and looks like a watch costing a few thousand dollars ? You 'll fall in love with this one .
5 #### They work great with my Thule 822XT Bed - Rider Fork Mount Carrier . I just bought these for my wife 's truck . I have another pair in my truck that I have owned 7 - 8 years . Very handy , well made design .
5 #### Okay , first , a confession . I bought this not as a sea - loving sailor or harbor master . Nope . I bought it because I was sick and tired of stray dogs and ( mostly ) cats using my yard as their personal crapper . Yes , I know this reads like a parody but it 's true . I thought about using a bb or pellet gun but did n't want to shoot anything . So ... believe me when I tell you that this thing is ( a ) loud ( b ) really loud , and ( c ) animals hate it ( d ) neighbors - ( who probably own the dogs or cats so , tough crap , buddy ) hate it . It 's loud , I 'm happy .
5 #### Fits my 10 year old 's knees perfectly . Does n't slide down her leg .
4 #### I fits the toes and legs perfectly and does give support for my legs which I definitely needed . My only challenge is that although it fit to my waist , it did not stay on my waist and kept sliding down , making the panty section slide down . Even when that section fell , the legs remained comfortable and in place . Maybe I ordered it too big . I will try again with a smaller size but it was supposed to fit 5'5 " up to 155 lbs . I am now 153 lbs . overall the support on the legs were great just the panty part that was not fitting comfortably for a full days ' wear .
5 #### Best option for a cold day . Easy to use and gets the job done . Place it in your pockets , shoes , or anywhere that needs to be warm .
5 #### I had tennis elbow for over six months . At first it was just annoying ... but as the pain and discomfort increased I sought medical advice . Even after following my doctors exercise directives the pain and discomfort remained . I went to numerous sites on the internet for advice ... but nothing helped . The pain and discomfort remained affecting my sleep , as well as my work . I finally ran across the Thera - band and was really skeptical . But I thought I would give it a try . In less than a week the annoying pain was gone -- completely ! It has been months now and I 'm still pain free . Unbelievable !
5 #### Great for rehab of the extensor muscles in tennis elbow . proper form is essential . has helped many people so far .
5 #### It 's a little large , but that 's my fault . My daughter is a size 1 and I got the small . Should 've gotten the xsmall .
5 #### Purchased for use in a 2015 Honda Civic backseat floor - fits perfectly .
5 #### My personal COC grip strength progression has gone as follows . COC Sport , COC Trainer , COC # 1 , and now , the COC # 2 . I have a # 2.5 on order and I already own a # 3 just for grins ; keep in mind , the # 3 is light years away from the # 2 . Had I started with the # 2 ( as was suggested to me by an " expert " ) not only would I not have been able to close it to begin with , but my grip likely would n't have developed nearly as strong as it is today , having followed the proper progression . There are a lot of people who think they should start with the # 2 . Really , unless you 're an absolute freak - of - nature beast- do n't . The # 2 is the threshold for ' exceptional ' hand strength . Once you get here , you can bet the farm that your hand strength is going to be superior to most any random person off the street . After conquering the # 2 , you can decide if you want to continue on the journey and shoot for " world class " hand strength via the # 3 . As others have said , the COC # 2 is just like all the other COC grippers . Top quality , super durable and high performance .
5 #### I just got the knife and did couple tests . This is a Great knife , very sharp and strong blade , hard but comfortable handle . Knife feels very well in hand and has a good balance . The nylon sheath is strong and well done , has an extra pouch(for Sharpener or survival kit ) . Inside the sheath is plastic that prevents from knife to cut nylon . Excellent hunting / hiking knife for a very good price .
5 #### Keeps food cold , ice frozen . The drain is a big plus . Lots of room inside for a long weekend camping trip . Happy with purchase .
3 #### I use this for crabbing and it;s a bit heavy . I probably will go with another brand , the next time around .
5 #### This watch was grandly received . My granddaughter absolutely loved it . It helps with the learning to tell time on a ' grown - up ' scale .
5 #### My niece put them on as soon as she opened them . The only shoes I saw her in for five days . The color was great ! ! ! !
5 #### What can I say ? It 's a Coleman stove ! Love it !
5 #### I LOVE this scooters quality & color . Easy to use and it lasted me 3 yrs of good use . A tip , never leave it outside , it could get faded or rusted .
5 #### Absolutely love them . Can even wear them without my insoles .
5 #### My husband and I are taking Yoga together , and the proper resistance bands are n't always available from the common stash . I got this one for me ( I already had green ) and a blue one for him , so we can bring our own and not worry about borrowing them . The resistance level is just right for each of us , and they are the generally agreed upon colors . They 're also the standard length . Added 08/28/11 : I 've just read some of the other reviews , particularly about the door accessory . Would it work to always use it on the side away from the door 's swing ? You 'd be pulling it closed .
5 #### comfortable and light weight . bought a pair for my husband too ...... he says he can wear them all day ! ! ! great support .... awesome for that light hike on a Saturday .
3 #### I purchased this bra for my mom to use after her breast cancer surgery . She went to try it on before her surgery and it was insanely small . Around the torso , not even on the boobs .
4 #### My daughter has used this for a year . I did have to change out the battery once but other than that its holding up well .
4 #### This is my only pair of Sperry boat shoes I have and for two reasons , they are extremely durable , and I do n't care to have multiple colors of the same shoe . I absolutely love these . They are insanely comfortable - so comfortable in fact that I wear them at my job where I frequently stand for hours on end without time to ever sit down . Fit is as expected . At first , I thought they were somewhat narrow for my feet , however , after wearing them for a couple days , they fit perfectly now .
4 #### These docklines lasted all summer . Work great in securing the boat . No problems with coming off or breaking in a storm .
3 #### I got three pairs in different colors . They look really nice , but get do n't last long at all . I wore these hose to two formal events . No dancing or moving around involved , yet they started to run just a few hours into the evening(my toenails are always cut very short , in case you 're wondering ) . If you are planning on wearing these hose with flats or low - mid heel then they might last , but wearing high heeled shoes definitely puts a lot of pressure on the toe area causing tears . Also , I am 5'0 , 86 pounds , size A / B was a tight fit . They definitely run small .
3 #### So far good kit except the spark plug are junk we lost compression on the first race after braking it in 5 warm ups and the spark plug just stopped working good kit so far just put a NGK plug in it when u rebuild with kit . This 60cc has lots of power now ! !
3 #### There must be something wrong with me ( and guess what , not just something , but rather a LOT ) Three stars is actually a gift . Two blades ? No can opener ? A cuticle pusher ? This thing needs real redesign . Anyone know where to get the original ? There is absolutely no reason not to have the can opener . The latest Leatherman counterpart is also bad news . THERE is a lot more to this but not here .
5 #### i do n't know if it works . do n't want to try it out and scare the neighbors .
5 #### They were a little big but that 's what I want so my little girl can grow into them
4 #### Have had 2 before this one . I keep coming back to the same wallet until it wears out . The size and compartments work well for me .
5 #### A shoe that fits very well . Big toebox . Can wear comfortably all day long . Will order again if they keep making it
5 #### I bought this for my niece 's birthday present . She loves it . She 's 6 & has no problem throwing this frisbee super far .
5 #### The Weaver base top mount - 45 fits my Marlin 925 perfectly . The extra height allows me to mount a 42 mm objective scope with a 1 inch scope mount and still have space to work the bolt . It allows the scope to be place in a perfect height for bench shooting . Construction is solid and well worth the price .
4 #### This is a quality bag I am using for my tent . The bag is constructed from tough material and is quality construction . The demensions of the bag seem a little less than advertised , but it is really close .
5 #### Fits me good ( 5'8 " with an small head ) . Looks good and durable . A year and a half later after using it several times it still looks new . Looks like it offers good protection too .
5 #### better than Blackhawk swivels . They go on and stay on . No screw thread stripping issues like so many her with the Blackhawk swivels . Cheap and effective . Buy them .
5 #### These cycling short are a excellent value and so comfortable . So much , that I ordered a 2nd pair because they have made riding so comfortable that I am riding more .
5 #### Been using it for several weeks whenever my elbow / arm hurts . It has diminished the pain substantially and , if I could remember to use it regularly would probably banish ny pAin permanately !
5 #### Handy bag to carry all this stuff in it . It is nice to be able to choose resistance according to one 's strength . I bought them and use the strength bands for both balance and strength in general . Nice sturdy bag and very sturdy equipment in it as well .
5 #### I got this for my husband . He needed a face easy to read without his glasses on and this one is it .
2 #### I ordered a 7 , got a nine . When I tried to get the right size , they were already out ..
3 #### This is a replacement for an identical one which lost the winding stem . It fell out after less than a year of use . I hope this one lasts longer .
1 #### Within one hour the play chute had 2 large holes in the middle where the screen is sewn . Very cheap
4 #### I ordered this for a friend whom had a billfold from ages ago and wanted one like the old one . This was very much like it , she is happy with this .
5 #### After searching for a good price on this style of Converse in the size I was looking for I landed upon these and they are perfect !
5 #### Used on my sole f80 treadmill . Works as advertised . Pleased .
5 #### That 's a good thing . Once wrapped around your bike and a pole / tree / whatever , a casual thief will just move on to an easier target .
4 #### I wear K - Swiss for tennis and bought these for walking around because of the great fit and support . The only negative is it would use more venting . Your feet do get hot in them when walking distances or working out .
5 #### Works great , very helpful for issues such as tennis elbow .
5 #### I enjoy wearing ts w/ pockets all it need is a collar to protect your neck from the sun . Other than that perfect fit and good quality material
5 #### if you use as manufacturer instructs it works awesome . Do n't watch fools on YouTube get mad because they ca n't boil a gallon of water with it . I had water boiling between 7 - 8 minutes .
5 #### Works perfect on my punching bag , really took the stress off my garage beam .
2 #### First , this garden flag was the perfect size for what I was looking for and should fit most garden flag holders . However , this flag changed colors in the sun within a couple months . I 've had other better made flags that last much longer . Overall , I would look for a better quality flag next time .
5 #### Super strong and came really quick . I am using one as a basket hold into a pulley rig for moving lights up to a second story . No snags , bright and colorful , easy . Another I have in a choke for a cable . Still handles over 150lbs like a champ .
1 #### piece of crap bent the first time i put it on the bike but only $ 5 so i did n't even bother returning it
5 #### Ii was very surprised that something so thin would actually keep the chills away . I am always cold at work and this Thermasilk was perfect . I must say , I was hesitant at first , but first of all , when I put it on , I was so happy the neck had enough scoop that it did n't show above my scrub top . It is so soft , you ca n't tell you have it on , until go to take it off and remember " I was n't even cold today . " Maybe not enough for snowmobiling without added thermals , but it was the perfect thing I was looking for under my scrubs and other clothes . Be careful and treat it like a delicate . I wash it in my mesh bag . That 's how great it is .
5 #### AWESOME PRODUCT FOR AN 870 .. FITS WELL .. VERY STURDY ... NICE LONG RAIL .. I ACTUALLY BOUGHT THIS TO MOUNT A SCOPE BUT THE SCOPE WAS BAD .. AFTER A FRUSTRATING EXPENSIVE HOUR L REMOVED IT AND SIGHTED DOWN THE RAIL TO MY SIGHTS AT 75YARDS AND BULLSEYED TWO SLUGS BACK TO BACK IN A QUARTER SIZED BULLS EYE .. I ALSO USE IT TO MOUNT MY TACTICLE LIGHT ..
5 #### I love these shoes . I am rather basic when it comes to Nikes , I do n't need all the cool colors , so these look amazing and feel amazing , like they were made for my feet . I definitely suggest purchasing them .
5 #### all it takes is a few sparks and you got fire . i am ordering more . so yes i would reccomend them .
4 #### I am 5 ' 2 " tall and weigh 122 # . I ordered the A / B size which works for me . I do n't think anyone with long legs could get into these without ordering a size larger . That is why I gave only 4 stars . I used these everyday as a nurse for 15 years and do n't have varicose veins . I am using them , as ordered by a physician , because of low blood pressure . Wear thin fabric gloves when putting the stockings on and it prevents your fingernails from putting holes in them . The reinforced toe is great as your toe nails wo n't rip the toes of the stockings . All in all I am satisfied and would buy again .
5 #### I totally love these panties . I have worn no other brand in over 20 years and if they stop selling them , I would dimply DIE ... I absolutely hate bikini underwear or ANY kind that rides up on you ... they HAVE to fit , and STAY under the butt cheeks at all times ... these are the best ... I do n't care if people say I wear granny panties ... I am proud of it .. and even when I was n't a granny , I wanted these ... I hate to see panty lines going in every direction on a woman 's behind ... it is just GROSS ... I love my granny panties ... YAY
1 #### Sprayed as directed . First day of backpack trip it rained . Did not repell water at all . Buy a different product
5 #### I am knitting a bronco 's colored sick and cashmere infinity scarf for my grand daughter . This pin will hold it in place nicely
5 #### My son and 10 year old granddaughter planned a week tent camping trip in northern Idaho . Needless to say , I at 60 + was not looking forward to sleeping on the ground . I looked around in various stores for an inflatable mattress - the cheap pool mats were non - existent or too small . REI offerred several great mattresses , but required a dollar investment I was n't willing to make for what could be a one - time need . I was thrilled to find these mattresses on Amazon . The price was within my budget and the reviews were pretty good . I bought 3 of them and they were delivered as expected . On first seeing them , I was surprised at the quality giving the cost - not flimsy plastic ; they looked sturdy . I slept comfortably every night of our camping trip . Mine lost a little air after a day or two , but nothing I would n't have expected from any air mattress . I was very pleased with my purchase and recommend them to others .
5 #### I use these in the winter when I am working outside in the woods in Maine . I can slip these in pockets and my gloves as needed . Great comfort . No , they wo n't keep you whole body warm . If you are going outside in cold weather , you need clothing , sometimes lots of clothing . ( If you feel cold all over , you do n't have enough clothing on ! ) These small heating pads can help relieve discomfort in you hands or feet . I appreciate them . My wife takes them when I come and and warms her hands and pockets indoors . She loves them too .
5 #### These are my favorite shoes . They fit perfect and are durable as well as comfortable . I fell in love with them for their comfort as well as the way that they fit great right out of the box and I did not have to break them in . They also look good if I wear a tie .
4 #### Love it but the horns do n't stay up . They flop like dog ears . A little wire fixes the problem
5 #### I needed something for tent stakes , mallets , etc . We camp on the beach , and everything gets full of sand . This allows me to take less sand back home with me . I like it so much I ordered another . I 'm going to see how the tent(s)/ground tarps fit , and if it works out , I will order another to have all my tents in mess bags . The bag appears to be very strong . I 'm taking it out again this weekend . If you do n't hear back from me , you 'll know I 'm still very pleased !
4 #### Love my new band 's . The handles are good and wide for a easy grip . Love the different options . The door thingy any ways great for the money . Will get plenty of use out of this .
5 #### Very versatile . Used the one that I had so munch , I bought another one for me and gave three away as gifts .
5 #### For what I used it for it 's perfect . seems to dampen some bouncing really well , and is just the right length for my 91 Prostar 190 wake pole->dock line .
5 #### Super comfortable , makes sitting on that hard cold metal seat for several hours bearable . Very light weight , and can attach to my bag easily .
5 #### Love these shoes ! ! They are true to size and very comfortable ! ! This is my second pair - I wore out the first pair ! ! Good arch support - I have a high arch ! !
5 #### Wears well , washes exceptionally well ! Find it 's the best t - shirt on the market . A bit pricey but we 'll worth the money for the wear !
3 #### Standard mono - line which I will use for saltwater fishing . I have used 50 lb . test of this type before and will be using this for surf - fishing application .
5 #### Unlike what other reviewers said , this shoe is EXACTLY the correct size . I will say , though , the tag on the inside of the shoe has weird sizing information . for instance , it says that my size 11.5 men 's shoes ( US ) are size 9.5 Mens ( US ) ... I ordered 11.5 's and these are , in fact , 11.5 ... I have no idea why the sizing info on the tag is wrong as these do not appear to be counterfeit shoes .
5 #### Both my husband and I have this , size M for him and small for me . They fit very well , easy to put on and take off . They are excellent for snowshoeing , no more snow getting into the boots . The material is super wind and water proof . So they keep our legs warm . Highly recommend ! ! !
5 #### Highly recommended for the intended use . Easy to install and use . Sturdy and secure . I would buy this item again .
5 #### This mat is very thick relative to other yoga mats and that works well when working out on a hard surface . Some other reviews have complained about slipping , but this has n't been a problem for me . It might be because there is a distinct top and bottom and if it is upside down it is slippery . If you are planning on traveling with this mat be aware that it is heavy , so if it is a long way from the car to the studio it 'll be some work .
5 #### Ok for what you pay . No complaints . Bought them strictly to fly our drones , using them as spotter glasses . Not exactly stressing them for that . Not very powerful , but like I said , ok for my needs . If I ever fly farther , I 'll have to upgrade . Comes with dust caps , bag and a strap . Nice compact design , do n't take up much rm . I leave them in the truck .
4 #### They 're Chucks . Shoes . Just make sure to go a half size lower .
5 #### Excellently sized guide that fits vest pockets easily , and contains all the necessary knots in easily understood illustrations . Pages are all coated to be water resistant if not water proof . Definitely a handy purchase for those who are new to fly fishing or get a little rusty during the off season .
5 #### Best tee shirt on the market period ! Is it a bit expensive at fifteen dollars ? Yes , but the quality , fit and tough durability makes it worth every penny .
5 #### My husband loves Carhartt clothing . I bought this bright color with matching modded zip front sweatshirt and he always gets compliments !
5 #### I liked it so much , I bought another one for backup . I 've own most brands of knives , including the crazy ones that cost hundreds of dollars , and this one is still the one I grab every morning and put in my pocket . First , the action of this knife is the closest thing there is to a " switch blade " , and I should know because I own a bunch of them as well . I love being able to pull out the knife with one hand and have it opened without flicking my wrist just the right way , or using my thumb to manipulate the bungs on the blade . Just press down on the top of the knife and it pops right out . They also hold an edge quite well . Maybe not as well as a good Benchmade , but for the price it 's way better than some of the others . The grey handle is also very cool looking . I work outside running a golf course , and I use my knife all day long . Big fan !
5 #### Husband has worn these since .. well I think since Wrangler first offered this style , 20 + years maybe . They wear well , the boot cut fits perfectly over his steel toe construction boots . He says he has freedom of movement without them being too looks or baggy . The fabric stands up to construction sites and the colors last nicely washed inside out in both the washer & dryer .
5 #### When choosing your size , I would definitely go a size up from your waist size when you purchase jeans ! It Allows more room for clothing underneath these coveralls ! Made very nice and extremely warm ! ! My husband and sons love these and think they are the best in cold weather !
4 #### Comfortable . Item is as advertised . I am going to buy 2 more so I can cover more floor and have a bigger work out space . It is made in China so I will find out how long it will last .
1 #### Some of my rolling partners complained that the ear - guard was too harsh on their ears . Also , when rolling , the top section can fall forward over your eyes . I was on the bottom of a mount defending against a cross collar choke when the top section fell across my eyes and started pressuring my eyeballs ... I was basically Oberyn Martell getting my eyeballs squeezed by Gregor " the Mountain " Clegan ... thank goodness for the tap out . Still got bruised up like crazy , and now I sit in the office looking like a red - raccoon fool ... I had this ear guard during my high school wrestling days and it was fine . However , BJJ gi fabric can cause the ear - guard to move around . No - gi usage might be worthwhile , but would not recommend gi ...
5 #### Love it ! My son was really looking forward to getting this jet pack and it did not disappoint . Also , I did n't have a Halloween costume for him . This came just in time for us to put one together with what we had on hand . Good quality .
5 #### The shoes are very comfortable , easy on and off , no slip at the heel .
5 #### A bit different than the other Buxton wallet I 've used the past few years and will take a little while to get used to it , but I like it ! Good quality product . Has several secreted type areas where you can put things , including two different areas for paper money . Has all sorts of card pockets for credit cards , appointment cards or any other kind of cards you want to access . The coin purse has a separation making two pockets . The driver 's license pocket does fits a bit tight , but hopefully you wo n't have to remove it very often !
2 #### I have to wonder if these are genuine Hanes Silk Reflections knee highs . I 've had them before and they have lasted much much longer than this present set . Yes , it was an unbelievable price for 6 packages ( but it was like pulling teeth to get them to send me all six -- they came two at a time , each time my having to write and complain that I had n't received the full order ) . But EVERY SINGLE TIME I wear a new pair , by the end of day , there 's a run or a snag in them . These things used to last me a very long time and I ca n't believe I 've suddenly become extremely careless in the wearing of my knee highs . It 's like I can barely get them out of the package without snagging them . So either these are knock - offs or the quality has gone way down .
4 #### Took two weeks to get them but i love em , make sure you order a size up in the waist . They run small
5 #### Keens are just the best . These are the only shoes my son will wear and he only likes the leather ones . I wear them everyday too . I highly recommend them to people with wide feet . The rubber toes have saved me from painful stubs many a time .
5 #### I was looking for a product to help keep my grip sticky when swinging clubbells and kettlebells . Chalk seemed too messy to use indoors in my apartment . This " eco ball " does the trick and looks like it will last for a long , long time . I had no idea how much my grip was slipping when swinging my 15 lb clubbells . Now my grip stays in one place . Note : Make sure to wash your hands well after and then put some lotion on .
5 #### I have used these for my teams practices for one season and they have held up very well . They are a good weight so they do n't lift up easy when the kids slide or step on them . They will last me a long time
5 #### This is a great travel set and the bag is nice to be able to throw in my travel bag .
2 #### I love the style and fit of the shoes . However , when I received these shoes , there was a gooey substance all over the top of one shoe and side of another . I have struggled to get it off .
1 #### Do not like ! Have had them a few months . A lot of static , then the condensation gets into the cups and shorts out the electronics . Will never purchase them again . Did not try to contact Peltor . I use them every day at work . I am a firearms professional . Will not recommend them to anyone . Buy Howard Leight !
5 #### Great shoe ! Outside arch is kind of high , but I 'm still breaking them in . So I 'm sure that will work it 's way out . I originally ordered a 9 , my regular size , and it was a tad too big . Returned and ordered an 8.5 and it fits perfect !
4 #### First time I used this rod today , I know its sole purpose is used for surf fishing , but its 15 foot length , is very good for casting anywhere . Caught me two catfish earlier today using anchovie bait . It is true what they say about the rob sticking at the sections , but knowing this ahead of time from user reviews , I put them in slightly , an even better idea is to iol the sections prior to use . Pros and cons as far i ve used it , pros would be its extremely long casting distance , cons would be its sticky sections , and since its 15 foot long , it can be sorta heavy . But all in all , this rod stood up today , and I would recommend this rod to anyone who wants to cast just a bit further from the shore .
5 #### item came very quick it has helped my wrists and elbows you also can do the same exercises from a power spring on the thera - band but this is a lot safer
5 #### The ultimate rocker or groupie shoe . So cool and never goes out of style . Wear them with a tux or jeans or a mini - skirt . You can not go wrong with these shoes . Great price . In Europe they cost three times more !
5 #### Very dependable and durable watch . ( This is my second one . First one lasted quite a few years , enduring daily exposure to a magnet at work and the occasional water drops at home . Also it is so hard to find a watch band large enough for my wide hand and wrists : this fits nicely .
5 #### I could wear them all day the first day I put them on . Nicer to wear then tennis shoes especially in the warm weather .
5 #### I bought this scooter when I was ordering some helmets because we always seem to have extra kids of all ages playing at our house . This purchase was an instant hit at our house . My kids , their friends AND my husband zip around non stop . I love how adjustable it is . It can really be used by a 2 year old or a 12 year old . Then it folds up so small and easily stores in our outdoor toy box . Great addition to our outdoor toys . Very happy with this purchase .
4 #### Good bag . I have only had for a day and used only a few times . On one try , the zipper " jumped the track " , but going back over corrected the problem . Removing one star for that and hoping it was an anomaly . I will " wax " the zipper in hopes of solving that problem in the future . I like the plain " rugged " look of the bag . Makes me look like I actually work for a living . I am using this to store my Stihl Chainsaw kit ( wrenches , oil , small gas can , gloves , eye & ear protection , etc .
5 #### One of the new toys in my arsenal to increase grip strength . Correction , hand crushing strength . This apparatus is great to strengthen holding / crushing strength when performing pulling exercises like the Pull - ups and Dead - lifts . In my use of the " toy " , it has aided my holding strength specifically for Dead - lifts . The handles are rough and a pair of gloves may be needed especially for first timers . However , if you 're one of the many with callused palms , it 'll be a brief hurdle . I do plan on purchasing the No . 2 to further strengthen my grips . After using the grippers , you 'll get a new concept of " firm " handshake . Enjoy !
5 #### Awesome for all the indoor games we play . It is nearly impossible for anyone to be injured while playing games with this ball . I love to use it for Gaga , since it does n't bounce like a rubber kickball and will not injure the players from striking the ball or getting struck by it . Highly recommended ! !
5 #### Beautiful watch . I have been looking for a watch that was waterproof and lite up . BINGO ! I found it all in this lovely watch
5 #### These are especially good for sighting in , you can instantly see where you are hitting the target . I have been using the Birchwood Casey 3 " shoot - n - c to quickly patch the center .
5 #### I use these so I do n't have to have a cast iron set for the oven and another for the campfire . I have several and recommend them . Prop these on top of a charcoal starter chimney , and you have a nice woodburning / charcoal stove too .
5 #### I have an original Spit'N Image and rarely used it . It was an overcast day so I had it in my tackle and tried it . I caught bass in this order : 3.15 , 3.08,3.11 and finally 4.08 This was in about 40 - 50 casts - NEVER had a day like that in so few casts . These are had to find but was excited to see them at Amazon ! ! Do n't work to good on sunny days but overcast or overcast and windy , they work great ! ! Have n't had this same success but it still works and have landed bass in the 2 - 4 lb range .
4 #### I already rated this , Amazon . It 's fine , but the material sheds like a cat .
5 #### It 's never too early for a pair of classic kicks like Chuck Taylor Converse Allstar ! My son calls them his " black boots " .
5 #### Good time , sharp looking , super easy read . Stem cam should be longer to prevent rare snags
5 #### I got this watch for Xmas and I love it
5 #### Have bought a lot of Plano boxes and like the others this is high quality . The plastic is not brittle and should resist breaking if dropped , but is still clear enough to see contents . As described , the compartments are fixed , no removable dividers . Although for certain apps , I 've been known to remove the internal dividers with a sharp utility knife . Single lid catch latches firmly and stays shut .
5 #### I ve always loved a great pair of Sperrys and these are a perfect example . Once you break them in , get ready to feel like you walking in the Bahamas all day .
5 #### There is about a 1/2 inch of extra space from the tip of my big toe to the front of the shoe . That 's okay , though . I usually wear socks , so it does n't feel too big , even if it does make your foot look a bit long . The colors are vibrant , and the sole has plenty of grip , even on a slippery floor . I wore them for most of the day and they are comfortable . Overall , I 'm very pleased with this shoe .
4 #### I 'm happy with this . About 5 minutes to put on my Trek 850 . It 's about an inch short . It 's adjustable , and I have it all the way extended , Just need to put something on the end . I 'm still happy with it and am ordering another , probably the best option out there . Works good otherwise .
4 #### This is a great mat , but only after you break it in . I do strongly recommend you slowly and evenly vacuum the mat . The corse brush from the vacuum significantly improved the grip of the surface . The directions say you should use salt , the sun , and a brush to help remove the coating from production . Salt made a mess and the sun did n't do anything . It also says you should use the mat daily , but I do not think that is a safe recommendation given the slippery surface . Some people recommended buying a mat towel , but that will prevent the mat from breaking - in and I do not like the feeling of mat towels .
5 #### I go 204 lbs . and this chair held up very well on a river trip . Does n't take much space in the canoe . I 'm happy with the performance of this chair , especially at such light weight and compactness .
2 #### Its a great ball , the real deal , just do n't put isopropyl alcohol on it , it f****s it up . Do n't ask me why i put alcohol on it
5 #### Love this top ! It 's so soft , comfortable , and modest ! It provides wonderful coverage while nursing , the ties are cute and my daughter loves to rub them on her face while she nurses .
5 #### I like using these items in the toaster oven , especially when I 'm trying out a new recipe , or modifying an existing one . It 's a lot easier to test things out small - scale then ramp them up to the main oven for the final product . The muffin pans alone are what I lean on quite a bit . They are also practical , in that it 's easoer to make egg cups in the toaster oven than the main oven ... especially when it 's just for me . The bakeware itself is sturdy and typical Chicago Metallic . Careful use ( eg no metal utensils , gentle heating ) will prolong the non - stick coating . I 'm very happy with this item .
5 #### I use these shorts for hanging out at home or for working out . They are EXTREMELY comfortable . I have this same style in the yoga - sweat pant version too .
5 #### Great , comfortable shoes . Shipper sends them fast , and new in converse box . I would recommend them for casual walking and such , not very much for aerobic exercise .
5 #### I have n't found a better boat shoe . I do n't like the brands that have leather laces because they wo n't stay laced .
3 #### I love these tights , the color jet is the right shade I like but why do these always come with damage ! ? Every .. time ! I 've owned a few pairs of these and maybe my lesson is learned . They stay up , fit well but why do they come with the tears ! ? I just opened these , delivered yesterday and photo to show , might have to stop purchasing these and giving the chance of hope .
4 #### I got this costume for my 3 years old . It was bit too big for him , so I need to hem the pants , but other than that , it was great buy . It 's good that he can wear next year , too .
4 #### Nice quality , which is getting harder and harder to find , just a tad baggy and long compared to others the same size .
2 #### Good Fit . Good Seller . Thanks Fit was OK - but these were or are very poor overalls . must be seconds or thirds . do no know how they ever got the Carhartt name on them .
1 #### pay the extra $ 20 - 30 for real skate pads . These do n't stay on my 7 year old and the stitching is completely blown out on one of the pads . worthless .
5 #### These are the most comfortable shoes I 've used for working out . Extremely light weight and flexible . Loved them so much I purchased two more pair in different colors .
5 #### Wide FOV and lightweight with lower price . If 7x50 binoculars feel too heavy , this one is good for amateur astronomy as a beginning device or star finding device for telescope .
3 #### I really like this mat a lot because it is cushion - y and it makes me feel happy whenever I do my Ashtanga practice . However , I have to minus 2 stars because it still super slippery even after using it for yoga almost everyday for 1.5months . I followed the instructions on breaking it in but still its super slippery . :( So I now use a towel over it when I practice . But I would still love to be able to use it on it 's own .
5 #### I 've been wearing Birks since 1999 and I absolutely love them . They are very well made , suit the contours of my feet and I have high arches and are so extremely comfortable for the wide foot as well . Whether with or without socks , they are a great fit . They last a long time and tolerate any kind of weather conditions . Slip out the insert and you could walk through water with them . Love them and look forward to staying in them for years to come .
5 #### Received in excellent condition , just like you would in a store . Perfect experience .
5 #### I am very pleased with this purchase . As usual the service from Amazon went very smoothly and was deleiverd earlier than I thought .
2 #### I bought this as a replacement for a fungo bat for hitting game like pop fly 's to the baseball team I coach . It is great for hitting hard grounders , getting them to take different bounces , but I can do that with my arm . I got it for hitting the ball high and accurate . After one practice , I gave up and am now using an old racquetball racquet .
5 #### Always my go to shoes . Even though my feet is a little on the wider side it 's still comfortable after the first coupl me wears
5 #### Just like my 3 pairs of Merrell hiking boots and one pair of Merrell Mocs , these fit EXACTLY like I expected . And , like all of my other Merrells , they are comfortable right out of the box . Merrell also has great customer service . My only complaint with Merrell is that their leather hiking boots ( non - Gortex ) that claim to be water proof , leak like a sieve . Two pairs have done this . If you want water proof shoes , get the Gortex ones .
5 #### This is good ! Still , can we get three instead of two closing adjusters in the back ? Thank you ! Love it ! ! ! !
5 #### You ca n't beat the price of this sling . I attached it to my Mossberg 88 and there was plenty of room to spare . Can be adjusted to any comfortable length .
5 #### My Chocolate lab loves this stuff ! ! I can just open the jar and she comes running from just about anywhere in the house . Unfortunately , I have not followed through training her to be a hunting dog ( grown up to be a 70 Lb . lap dog but loves to track and hunt still , or maybe I baby her and do n't want her to get into trouble with the other critters ( but do n't tell my guy buddies of course , HA ! ) .
5 #### I just my received today and I love it . I was so afraid the gold plated would look so fake and brassy . it does NOT . it is beautiful for a cheap watch and the perfect size for my big wrist .
5 #### Works OK . Wish I would have purchased I size larger . My PT made a mistake on the size .
5 #### I like to bring these along on work trips to get a good workout for the arms . Use them a lot in the home gym as well . Sturdy and quality made .
5 #### Ca n't believe I am writing a review for a girls scooter .... but I am . My 10 year old still uses this scooter ... and it 's been 3 years . It takes a beating and is cute while receiving the beating .
5 #### I have been wearing for a solid week during my work outs & they are great for comfort and they are light weight .
4 #### My son is enjoying his pogo stick and it is almost time to take off the green support ! Great way to learn and get comfortable !
3 #### It got me through about a week of camping , but then developed a slow leak ( no visible puncture marks ) . I woke up on a deflated mattress several nights before throwing away . For the price , it got me through and provided adequate comfort for the time I needed it .
4 #### This is a very well made hat . It will keep the sun from beating down on your ears and neck . It looks a bit goofy , but I can deal with it to protect myself from the sun . It is well constructed and seems to be very water resistant . The chin strap can be adjusted to keep it down durring windy conditions . The only reason I leave out one star is that it gets fairly warm , but then again so does anything above 100 degree temps .
4 #### Just what I needed for my futsal intramural program . Sport ball worked well during gameplay . Will purchase more when the other ones wear out .
5 #### I love this watch in fact this is my second one I 've bought for myself
2 #### I bought this in Costco the other day and it 's going right back . The chair is uncomfortable when it folds , the excercises are very awkward . It gave me a headache and nausea after 2 - 3 minutes , and I do n't usually get sick . It also occupies way more space than it seems . I would n't buy anything like this again .
3 #### I love the look of these for my toddler , size 7 , but they are a pain to put them on him . It 's hard to put his heel down and hard to fit his foot in . It takes me a while to get his foot in and adjust them .
3 #### I was n't such a fan of the unforgiving fabric and it was not flattering on me , so I returned it . I can see how it is convenient for breastfeeding , it just was n't right for me .
3 #### maybe i did n't read well enough when i bought it , but i knew it was a costume prop . its flimsy plastic not any kind of metal and looks very cheap . i feel like it was a little high for what you get but all in all ok for a kids costume .
5 #### Love these , my mom and her friend wear them , too .
4 #### Very good watch . I love having indiglo . Large easy to read numbers for low light situations . The easily read numbers will stay visible for some time if charged by light . I would agree with other reviews that the stem protrudes a bit to far hence the 4 rating .
4 #### Soft and true to size . The bra had a weird manufacturing smell that took several several washes to get the scent out . I used this bra as a post breast surgery bra ( four weeks out ) . The bra is soft and does n't irritate the incisions . If you are looking for support this is not your bra .
5 #### I bought these for my husband . Best shoes he has ever owned ! They are so comfortable right out of the box . We walked all day at the zoo and he was amazed his feet and lower back did n't hurt ! He has worn them every day since I bought them for him . He likes them so much I bought him the same brand in a work boot for Christmas .
5 #### Fits well , easy access , excellently made but after all it is a Galco is n't it .
5 #### great to make a hand warmer with old soup can doesent scare the deer or bears away
5 #### They are tennis balls . Not much else to say here . They shipped fast and were exactly as described . Fuzzy and bouncy .
5 #### Very nice and well made shirts ! I bought several for my husband and he loves them ! They wash nice and do n't fade fast !
5 #### let a butt dart throw it and it will sail away ! first stuck in biggest tree ... new one fast delivery . works as said ! careful or ya by many
5 #### Most reliable Frisbee ever . ( Side note : Frisbee just auto corrected to be friend ... I could have left it , it 's true ) . We 've lost this thing on three different roofs and once in the ocean . Every time , we have managed to get it back , like the true boomerang Frisbee it is . Easy to throw and catch . Normally I 'm a klutz , but this makes me feel athletic compared to other Frisbees .
4 #### Fits very well over my long guns . My one gun with a scope is a tight fit , but once you figure out how to pull the sock over it the scope properly , it goes on a lot easier . I would recommend purchasing . Using these socks has increased the space in my gun safe by letting me place each gun with a sock up against the one next to it . Save money by not having to buy a bigger gun safe .
5 #### I BOUGHT A PAIR FROM SPORTS AUTHORITY AND REALLY LIKED THEM BUT THEY ONLY HAD ONE COLOR SO I CHECKED AMAZON JUST FOR THE HECK OF AND THEY HAVE A FULL LINE OF COLORS . THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST CONFORTABLE SHOES I HAVE PURCHASED AND WILL CONTINUE TO BUY THESE SHOES
5 #### I was getting ready to spend more money one , works great at the range , very clear optics .
4 #### I am happy with the quality of the product . The service was good . I got size 12EE . I am happy with the width of the shoe . However , the length appears to be short for a size 12 . I compared the length of this shoe to other size 12s and this one is shorter . I would recommend getting a size longer than normal .
5 #### I had a difficult time finding a long half - slip until my sister told me about the Vanity Fair half - slips for sale on Amazon . I bought one in the 30 " inch size . Not only did the slip fit perfectly , but it was only $ 12 . From now on , I will be buying all my slips from Amazon .
3 #### Too small ! . I thought for sure they would fit , but these run terribly small . The ones that fit gray are Berkshire brand
5 #### Great beachball ... thinking about ordering another one just in case this one hits one of my sago palms ... will probably order the next largest size just for grins ...
5 #### I have serious walking problems due to overpronation and subsequent bad habits . From the moment I put these shoes on , I was a different person ! I am a teacher and am on my feet all day long , usually returning home fatigued and achy due to my bad walking ( I do n't run ) . With these shoes , I was energized , painfree , and walked significantly better throughout the day ! I am leaving Saucony in my will for helping me with such an amazing shoe design ! They are fabulous ! ! !
5 #### Perfect longline bra for under my wedding dress ! I bought several others at kohls online that did n't fit right . I 'm happy with this purchase !
5 #### Got it for my son to celebrate his Boy Scouting advancement and responsibility .
5 #### I bought these for my son and he loves them . They fit as expected and are very comfortable . We definitely recommend them to anyone looking .
4 #### purchased as a gift for some family and a friend .. A cute fan statement piece and appears to be weather proof .
5 #### My feet are generally a bit too wide for Converse shoes , but the material is very forgiving in that regard . These shoes are comfortable , affordable , and very stylish .
5 #### I purchased this mat- my 3rd- to accomodate a new home tile floor doing pilates / yoga with mature , compromised , knees . My old mat combo rumpled and wiggled too much on tile where it had been fine on carpet . This mat alone has great stability , and as others noted , was a bit slippery until the salt treatment recommended by Manduka . The 85 " is perfect to always have my feet and hands on a mat . However , alone it is n't enough cushioning for my knees , so I placed my cheaper 3/8 " bubble type mat underneath , and I 'm satisfied . I do n't have the movement / slipping I used to get on the bubble mat alone , or the rumpling of the thin mat on bubble , so I 've finally got a combination that works for my home practice . The Manduka PRO surface is very firm , but gives just enough my knees are n't in pain in positions where I 'm on them .
5 #### This seems like a good quality product , although I have only had it a few weeks . I needed it for a costume and now am just going to use it to work in . It did n't shrink or bleed in the wash and the sizing was accurate .
5 #### My kindergartener loves this watch and so do I ! She is quickly learning to read the watch do to the way the face is set up for learning . The wrist strap is soft and stretchy and easily adjustable . She loves the glow option .
5 #### Our son wears this almost every day . The clasp was a bit tough to undo at first but it has gotten a bit easier over time for him to maneuver . Appears to be very good quality too and the price was great !
5 #### I liked these . They fit my Simmons scope well , and tighten down very securely with the four provided allen screws . It even came with a little allen key so I did n't have to go digging for mine . No complaints whatsoever thus far .
4 #### The cooler is well made , handles I have my doubts . Lots of side to side wiggle to them . I bought for evening trips on the boat . It can be hard to open , but to me a tight seal is good . I only use it for 3 hours at a time and so I ca n't say how it would do all day
4 #### Bought this for my 8 year old son 's 16 " bike . It was easy to put on and to adjust . It 's tight , several months of use after installation . On the one hand , that 's kind of nice because the kickstand is n't just falling down when he 's riding , but on the other hand he has trouble getting it down and up himself which means sometimes he just does n't even use it .
1 #### ordered 10 D boots . boots were not the right size ! my old 10 D boots are 4 1/4 wide at the sole , the new boots were 3 7/8 ? ? ? ? ? ? i will return them
5 #### Great looking shoes with jeans and very comfortable . The arch support is minimal , but the shoe makes up for it everywhere else .
5 #### It was a gift for my fatherin law , he loves this brand
3 #### Excellent features , replaceable battery that is easy to find . HOWEVER , the first time I dropped it on the bathroom floor it was toast . So , be careful with it and it will do you well . The only other thing I did not like was that it has an audible " click " with every step . Other people can notice it .
5 #### Held the boat in place on Lake of Ozarks with various bottoms . Anchor sets and comes off the bottom very easy . I have a 5 ft chain attached to the anchor so the rope wo n't get cut on anything . I used to have a mushroom and and a grappling anchor but this one beats them both . Its a bit pricey but I think its worth the investment if you are a serious fishermen or a boat owner .
5 #### arrived in timely matter . seem to be fine . will use in a emergency kit .
1 #### I loved these shoes ... that is until after about an hour of wear , the green inserts on the sole of the right show began falling off . The wear was in my home , on smooth floors . I can only assume they were defective .
5 #### The cut on the jeans is very nice . My husband went down a size and these are cut just right for a 66 year old man . I would n't like him in skinny jeans or big loose legs . These were perfect and they enhance the back size very well .
5 #### Great product for the price . In all honesty it 's a flimsy little strap , but it was purchased as a requirement for a tournament ( we 've never had problems with helmets falling off to begin with ) . Ca n't beat the price !
5 #### The stand arrived on time with all the parts . Assembly was fairly straightforward and required crescent wrenches to tighten the bolts . Placing the handles for pull - ups proved the most challenging , but I finally got them configured correctly with extra effort . Although the stand moves a little when it is in use , it has adequate stability during use . It provides a wide range of exercises using body weight for resistance that gives me a good upper body workout in the convenience of home . It is proving to be a good product for the money .
5 #### These are amazing for use ase base fire and as wood fire starters .
3 #### very comfortable and provided good power with minimun effort . was able to snorkel quite a while and keep up with others .
5 #### I Tried one of these hand warmers out and feel that they get plenty hot enough to warm your hands when inserted into a glove . They are not very big but plenty big enough to fit into the palm of your hand . So each box has 80 hand warmers in it . I did not time to see just how long they stay hot but it is mentioned if they seem to start to cool down then just expose to the air again and shake a little then return to the glove . I am not sure what some of the complaints about these not getting hot enough but I certainly do not want them burning my hands and I also want to be able to use them for my Grandchildren so there would be a concern there too it they got any hotter than they do . I believe these will be just fine . I will keep mine stored in my storage room in the basement where they will remain dry and cool . I received these on 4 - 18 - 2015 and they have an expire date of 01/2019 . If they last that long which I believe they will I certainly will be more than satisfied .
4 #### I wear them for Zumba and my heel slips on turns . A little annoying because I have to pay attention but they are so cute and comfy , it balances out .
5 #### These are great tights . Being flubby in the middle , these are all I wear now . The top pulls up past my flab and the feet roll up nice and far . I 've attatched my own cloth bra straps permanently in the criss cross way so that they do n't slip out .
4 #### I bought this pair for After wearing my Chuck taylors for less than 2 month , the glued rubber trim aound the shoe started getting peeling away from the canvas ! Which is dissapointing , knowing that they used to last me at least a couple of years !
4 #### The maroon color I purchased appears more red than expected , which is n't necessarily a bad thing , just different from what I was expecting . I 'm overall really pleased with shoes , price , and time in which they arrived .
5 #### These hand warmers work pretty well , and you ca n't beat the price . If you forget and have to buy hand warmers on a cold day skiing , you 'll be paying a huge markup . Buy these , and keep a couple in your car / ski bag at all times . You 'll be glad that you have them on those really cold days .
5 #### Wow I have tried so many different brands of support hose and hanes is by far the best ones I will not buy any other from now on .
5 #### Typically I do n't care for Uncle Mike 's Brand items , particularly their holsters , but these swivels seem okay and are priced right .
4 #### Tou wo n't find a better price . Problm is they run a bit small , either way the extra money in shipping i had to fork out really bummed me out about them . The shorts are great quality , no 9 mm pocket hole but durable overall . Just be careful , cause they charged me to ship to them and the again back to me , i suggest you find a compny where shipping is n't an issue in case they do n't fit
5 #### had one for years , the spring finally gave out and I had to get a new one . this one cost less than the old one and is the same quality . good deal
5 #### This product was as advertised . They are of good , lasting quality and I would not hesitate to order these again when needed . Neat gift for the sports - minded person .
4 #### Strong ball , but I can not pump it up to the size on the chart and I did follow the directions . It is at 29.5 inches not 30 inches . Otherwise , this is a great stability ball .
5 #### I do n't wear much jewelry , so I was able to fit some " fashion emergency " stuff like a mini sewing kit and nail file among other things in it for my wedding and honeymoon in addition to a ring , two sets of earrings , and two necklaces .
5 #### Very realistic looking in the water . It has great movement in the water .
4 #### This wallet is exactly as described & as nice as any Buxton products I have owned in the past . While the leather is not as soft as other wallets I have owned it also is n't nearly as expensive . It holds many cards with lots of space for money etc while not taking up much room in my purse . It is certainly worth what I paid for it and I would order it again .
4 #### I have a philosophy about my new commuting experience that can be summed up as visibility trumps cool . If you are rich or if you are seriously touring at night ( I guess folks do that ) go drop a couple of hundred on a fancy light . Essentially , this will do . The Bell light makes light and flashes . I am more concerned with people seeing me at dusk or dawn than I am lighting up the road . It is fairly cheap construction , but it should n't take a lot of pounding riding back and forth to work . The light is inexpensive and it works . If you are concerned with batteries and the environment , buy a generator light ... or at least rechargeable batteries for this one .
5 #### Wonderful for camping great to easy access , very happy with this easy to clean and store
5 #### Easy to use and easy to catch fish with them make these one of my fav plastic baits . I find simply nose hooking these with circle octopus hook lets me get the best action . It also makes for an easier hook removal . But some times it will get short striked and I will texas rig it to get the hook further down the body to try and get better hook ups . Also , once it starts warming up , hooking it weed less is a must . For me , so far , the watermelon red , houdini , and watermelon magic are the best colors by far for the waters I fish for bass , and more visible colors ( albino has been my best ) for sight hunting fish like pickerel seem to work best . For me though , often times when bass fishing these will get hit on the first drop when it hits the water . If bass are around and this is what they are looking for that day , they will come and get it . Ca n't tell you how many bass I have caught in heavy cover by simply throwing this in the weeds and waiting . I 've even used this like a frog over pads and caught bass . I use all the flukes from tiny to magnum . I find there is a time and place for all of them in my fishing season and every one of them catches me a lot of bass .
1 #### Not the sellers fault . I just do n't care for Mountain House anymore .
5 #### I mounted these on a Tacoma , using the bolt - down points for the factory rack . I had to buy longer bolts , but that 's because this set was not designed for the Tacoma . I love how quick and easy the yakima system is to mount / dismount control towers and crossbars to these landing pads . The first set I mounted on another vehicle lasted the life of the car , and showed no sign of deterioration when I sold it .
5 #### I have these in just about every color and love them for the gym . They 're light and not incredibly short if you do n't roll the waistband down as shown . I think I 'm going to buy more for my Disney trip also . They 're juniors but I take about a size 8 in women 's and the medium fit although I may start buying larges .
5 #### I have a different pair that I love enough that I bought these for my brother . He 's retired with a bad back and loves these especially with how simple they are to put on with a bad back . Perfect and highly comfortable .
5 #### Great quality . As comfy as these things can be I suppose . Definitely sturdy . I have 36 DDs and a 30 in waist . 5'4 , normally wear size medium garments . This was a good fit .
5 #### What is there not to like ? ! The sound of the chain , not having to replace the net couple times a year ... Is nice ! !
3 #### Good quality , but are darker and more like salmon in the color . Also had some stains on the white rubber , looked like that could be washed away . Rubber or glue or something had an odor as well . They were still pretty , just not the same kind of pink as the picture .
5 #### Bought these for my sister who recently underwent surgery . By far the best quality of four brands she tried . Wide straps for support , wide bottom band - very comfortable !
5 #### I bought this sock for my Mossberg 500 's extra 24 " barrel . It fit 's perfectly , with the scope attached and I can slide it in my soft case right next to my shotgun .
5 #### My girls love these . Bought 2 and they ride them all the time !
4 #### My son asked me to buy this for him -- he used it as a sort of home gym while he lived with us . He brought it with him to Cambodia so he must like it .
5 #### I have been buying Danskin shorts for years . They fit great and continue to fit great after many washings .
5 #### Durable and high visibility . Extremely sturdy and steady in flight . Highly reccomended as I have been playing with this for a few months now . Blue is my favorite color out of the colors offered .
2 #### These things have stretched pretty good from washing them . I would suggest going with a brand that has better elastic .
5 #### Holds my cigar while I 'm playing golf . I have only used it once and it held it when in needed it to .
5 #### Great set of grips . They fit my Citadel Officers 1911 in 9 mm perfectly . They both look great and fit wonderfully . Hogue really is great but gets crapped on because it 's not a tacticool high - speed , low - drag operator company .
4 #### I was surprised my normal size 8.5 was too small
5 #### Wife loves them and that 's a perfect review . I wear corrective Speedo / TYR goggles and daughter wears Speedo for swim team . Wife did n't like the fit of daughters old TYR goggles so I got her these and she 's happy as can be .
3 #### The gel chamois is comfortable , but the fit is a bit on the large size ( size small - Pearl Izumi small fits me well ) . Because of the fit and the fact that the gel chamois is a bit stiff my backside ends up looking pretty wrinkled around the pad edges when I 'm standing - on the bike it is fine . would be 4 stars if the small were smaller or there were an XS to choose
4 #### To me , this seemed like a better solution than a larger pony tank / RBS . I like having less hoses so it appealed me . The only negative is that it is huge . I am 5'11 " 175lbs and this thing very awkward . Pretty much your only mounting option is on your BCD . The problem is , there are not many mounting options for something that large on the average BCD . I use the included straps to attach it to the cummerbund of the BCD so it is out of the way ... ish . Anywhere else will be in your face or inaccessible . Small price to pay for something that could easily save your life though .
5 #### These babies are classic , fit great , good quality , look good .
4 #### This is a decent compass . It was worth the price . I use it while hiking and it will point you in the right direction . Would make a good gift for a kid to play with because it 's cheap but solid and functional .
5 #### Nice long sleevs , I prefer litlle bit thin it will going very good with jacket or t - shirt , good for excericeze out or just for relax
5 #### Beautiful fit and finish thank you . holds my charter arms 38 bull dog perfect .
5 #### They were all intact and the contents felt soft and powdery , unlike some hand warmers that feel hard and lumpy . It 's good to be able to shake them up to expose the contents to the air to activate the heating process . They were very warm , great for , skiing in cold weather .
5 #### My husband is on his 8th pair of these . Great quality , comfortable and looks sharp .
1 #### there was too large , about sizes larger than the size i bought
3 #### Too large all around . I wear inserts with them for arch support and to make the fit a bit more snug .
5 #### My daughter loves these .... Says everyone is wearing them this spring and had to have 'em . The High Top is what 's in ( again ? ) , according to our teenager . This is probably her 10th pair of assorted Converse and she ca n't seem to wear them out . As an artist , I can say they are a pleasure to paint on if you want to customize them . Use acrylic paint and fabric medium . And , E600 secures rhinestones across the toe or wherever . The seller spells out the unisex sizing clearly . Women 's sizes are equivalent to two sizes smaller in a Men 's size . So , unless you have a very narrow foot , you can adjust your sock thickness to make them perfect . Frankly , she has flat feet but has not complained about them . I , however have flat feet and a lot more mileage on my arches ; I would not wear them without arch supports ... if I were to buy them for myself . Not !
5 #### Bought this for Nephew at Christmas and he takes it with him everywhere . Pretty good quality and good price .
5 #### Bought these for my lil girl as uniform shoes . not much were expected of them but that one purpose . she likes them though . I did n't think she would but she proved me wrong . Guess ill get her some more soon , lol
5 #### My second pair , love the fit , light weight and great support .
5 #### My wife loves these shoes , she wears them daily throughout the summer -- she often complains about not good arch support on other shoes , but has never complained about that with these . I use the Men 's Keen Newport H2 sandals and the toe protection , on these sandals are awesome I have used them for canoe camping and hiking -- of which my wife has work her Keen Venice H2 sandals .
5 #### Kids love to rowing in a pool too . and They do 5 little monkey jumping . Kids are so crazy with it
2 #### They are super tight and unlike and Dickies I 've worn or purchased
5 #### I LOVE these shorts . It 's perfect . I wear it at home to lounge around in at home , and I can wear it out . It is on the short side , and is fitting without being skin tight . I am 5'2 " and weigh about 120 and wear a small . When I was pregnant I wore these and wore a medium ( I gained 40 lbs and it still fit around my belly or below ) . I have about 3 pairs of these at any given time . The quality is ok . Several washes and the color fades a little , but I still love them .
5 #### FlexBar heavy and medium have helped continue my P.T. and Occupational Hand and shoulder Therapy beyond what my insurance would allow . It is effective and efficient . Great for my injured hand and shoulder '' ' I will suggest this to my orthopedic specialist when I see him this week after months of P.T. and O.T. for a very serious , life changing injury . Great item .
3 #### Bushnell is the premier maker of Binoculars . In this case these were advertised as having auto focusing - which are actually manual . In the end they were light weight and magnified as expected .
5 #### This is my son 's 2nd year wrestling and this is great headgear at a great price .
5 #### These Sandals are so comfortable . I was a little apprehensive as I have n't worn sandals in years . They look great too .
5 #### Great product and seems to be fairly priced ...... Love the stretch feature ..... Got one for both ends of the boat ! love the color that matches perfect !
5 #### Ordered 4 of these shirts for work use . They have been wearing like iron . They are slightly oversized which is nice for maintenance work . So far no complaints .
5 #### I use these as workout shorts . These are comfortable and fit well .
4 #### Excellent Balance and comfort for a 9 " boot knife . All leather high quality sheath with snap out hold and metal clip . Great knife for the price and was shipped with - in a week . VERY HAPPY WITH THIS ONE !
2 #### I love the fit , they are very comfortable . Unfortunately the fabric used is thin and weak . I wo n't order these again because of how thin these underwear are .
5 #### My wife loves these . She had some that were years old and starting wear out . So I got her a new top and bottom for Christmas . This is a different brand than what she had before , so I just got the one . She is 5'4 " and about 110 . So I got smalls . They seem snug but are supposed to be as the go under other clothes . She tried them and loved them so we ordered two more sets , one in black . Her office is a little cold and she says these make her very comfortable . So a winner ! It is thin , breathable and washes and dries quickly ( by hand ) . She 's looking forward to the other sets ! I ordered this on a Thursday and it came exactly a week later .
4 #### They fit well but they have not been washed yet . I 'm a little concerned .
5 #### This is a heavy duty sled . I use it to haul bails ( 2'x2'x4 ' bales ) from my hay stack to my animals because we have have a foot of snow . It makes quick work of something that used to take me a lot of effort . I love this sled ! ! !
4 #### The bottom leg area is narrow but it does have side leg zippers
5 #### I wear these regularly , so I like to have a couple of pairs in different colors . They are perfect , thanks a lot !
1 #### Leaves a nasty nasty residue , I would not recommend this product .
4 #### Great boots but dug into my sons leg and caused a blister .
5 #### On time and exactly as described . The quick detach mounts and rings work well and look great . I highly recommend vendor and you can not buy better than Warne mounts and accessories .
1 #### These guys make all the consumer treadmills you see in most places - NordicTrack , Proform , Wieder so do n't be fooled by one brand being better than another . For the most part the higher end equipment they make is fair quality and works fine . It 's when it does n't work that it all breaks down . Even though you have a warranty , that is no guarantee they will fix the issue . Everything they do is set up to discourage you from calling back . Long hold times to talk with a representative , extremely long shipping times , local technicians unavailable for a week to install the part you finally received . A major upsell is the extended warranty . Do not accept their first offer . It will usually be $ 400 + to add a few years . Wait until they call you and it will go down to $ 150 . Since it is going to be lousy service anyway , you might as well save some money .
5 #### I work with a lot of new swimmers who at times need more support from all ages . This allow me to adjust support as they improve . Great price , would recommend to a friend .
5 #### Great product ! works on my 28 " bathroom door frame . Comes off easily . Sturdy enough for me at 5'9 " , and 160 .
5 #### I bought this to use in my Kayak , it serves the purpose well and does not absorb water
5 #### Update ! As I hoped , these softened some with washing , without losing any of their toughness . Will definitely be buying more ! I needed tough work pants , and could only find lighter - weight ones offered ' for ladies ' . Hubby bought these in his size and loves them , so I decided to risk ordering them for myself . I am 5'2 " , 25 " waist , 35 " hips , 107 lbs . I got the smallest ones offered ( 28x30)and they fit fine ! ! A bit stiff the first wearing - I did not wash before wearing , as we are in the middle of a building project and I wanted to test them right away . They fit comfortably at my real waistline ( not low riding or hip huggers ) . I can move freely ( climbing ladders , etc . ) and they do n't pull up or fall down , with or without a belt . The fabric is very tough , and putting kneepads in them made kneeling on concrete surprisingly comfortable . The only very minor negative I can mention is the lack of cargo pockets on the front for my gloves - and only because I 'm accustomed to BDUs with loads of pockets ! Ladies , this was a very pleasant surprise , so if you 're looking for work pants that are tough and can stand up to cactus , yucca , mud , dirt , etc . etc . , try these out .
3 #### These shoes are different than normal low pro vegans . These are slip on and have thinner walls than the other ones and thin , elastic back . Seems like they are meant to be worn without socks ? There are not laces , but elastic in the laces . I actually liked the design , kind of as a sneaker style alternative to Tom 's shoes . The sizes also run a bit big . I am normally an 8.5 or 9 and the 9 was WAY too big on me . This shoe is listed as the same as the orange and grey ones ( which I also ordered ) but they are quite different . The orange and grey ones ( which also cost more $ ) are more like the normal low pro 's , but made out of different material . I really like the canvas/ vegan look of the vegan shoes , but this particular style seems a bit flimsy compared to the $ 54 ones . Can always buy then return .... which is what I am doing .
5 #### ATTENTION : Read the Reviews & be sure to pick a Vendor who has been verified by customers as supplying the genuine Doan 's Emergency Fire Starters . Apparently there are a number of unscrupulous vendors who are selling cheap Chinese imitations that do not work or do n't work nearly as well as the original Doan 's . If you are unlucky enough to get one of these imitations , contact Amazon & you 'll likely get your money back . I got mine from BigFlySports . These are authentic Doan 's Manufacturing Magnesium Fire Starters , identical to USGI Surplus ones issued in survival kits to Air Force Pilots . The only difference is that these lack the NSN & NATO stocking numbers , not that that makes any difference in their performance . If the ones you receive from other vendors are not stamped on the side " MFD . BY DOAN MACH & EQUIP CO . INC . P.O. BOX 21334 SO . EUCLID , O. 44121 " then you got robbed . They also have " SPARKING INSERT " & " SHAVING EDGE " stamped above & below the company 's information . There are a lot of cheap Chinese knock offs out there , and a lot of those simply do not work as they do n't use nearly pure magnesium but rather an alloy of magnesium , aluminum , and/or zinc , or some other " mystery metal " that will not ignite or burns poorly . I have no idea of what the other vendors here are providing , but I 've bought several of these from BigFlySports & they are the genuine article and they work well .
1 #### Thin and flimsy and see - through . Granted , it 's a $ 7 long - sleeve shirt , but there are far better brands out there ( like American Apparel ) for about the same price or slightly higher . I bought these as a junk shirt for athletic purposes , but I doubt they 'll last as long as the old Russell long sleeves I was hoping to replace .
3 #### It 's a cheap belt , but I gained a few pounds and like my belts to hang thigh level . So I ordered this to wear until I loose a few pounds . It 's thinner and a much brighter red than my original red belt my master gave me . The first class I wore it to , another student noticed it looked different than his . Lucky for me , my master does n't seem to notice that it 's different . He 'd probably make me do push - ups ! LOL
2 #### This pair of White / Pepper Keen Newport Sandals were very inexpensive on Black Friday , and hard to resist at the price . They were $ 25 cheaper than a gray pair , and $ 45 less than the Bison . Unpacking them , I could see why . The back of the footbed portion of the heel , just above where the footbed meets the back of the sole has bumpy , sharp irregularities , on both the left and the right , in several spots . They were poorly fitted and glued . It may hold just fine , and my heel does n't touch the very back of the sandal , so I do n't necessarily anticipate discomfort . But it was very disappointing because it indicates a couple of things ( via inference ): 1 . Keen has developed some poor quality controls , particularly with this Pepper / White model ; 2 . Is my experience an example of selling factory " seconds , " but not advising the customer of these issues . I wear Keen Newports and Newport H2s . I like them . I hope this is n't the beginning of the end , an accelerating race to the bottom in terms of quality .
5 #### I have several pair of these in different colors , but these run slightly smaller . All my others were made in Vietnam and this pair , the only pair made in China , so maybe that is the difference . I recently found out certain Asian manufacturers clothing run smaller . I just make sure a wear a really light sock and it works .
5 #### I recently went on a trip to Disneyland . It was a hot day that day , and being surrounded by thousands of other park - goers made it that much hotter . One thing I did n't have to worry about was getting sunburned on any part of my head . This hat gave me a great deal of protection from the sun , shielding my face and neck from the nefarious sun 's rays . The rest of my body burned to a crisp . But that 's another story . What I really love about this hat is how great looking it is . I happen to think this hat looks very stylish , and I received many compliments on it . As far as the quality of the hat , it 's top - notch . Craftsmanship and materials are great , and I did n't have any problems with it feeling too heavy or tight . Just make sure you measure your head and order the right size . I 'm glad they come in a size that fits my big melon head . This is an inexpensive , great quality product , that I was NOT given a discount for a review . However , I 'd gladly pay full price for another one of these bad boys . They 're just that good .
3 #### Material , style , and design is great . Plenty of pockets to satisfy most people . My gripe is the size . I have several Columbia long sleve shirts and wear a medium , however this style meduim was like a larger or bigger . The shirt was either labled wrong or they have poor manufacture control on this style .
5 #### My son is 2 yrs old . He rather small but he wears a 2 t ( some things that size are too big even ) so got the 3 - 4 t in this costume beachside I read it runs rather small . Well I agree . It does . It fit my little guy just perfect over his normal clothes . He loves the costume also . I wish the ears would stand up straight all the time though . Still would recommend . Super cute ! ! It did come with gloves so I bought some on here .... I search " white toddler gloves "
5 #### Perfect fit and warm . Wore them skiing and never got wet or cold . Recommended !
2 #### Maybe I just have bad luck with hose , but there is already a huge run in these hose after wearing them for approx . 30 minutes :(
1 #### The review below is from March 20 , 2013 . The T - shirts were great . I ordered 2 more in white just 10 days ago and washed them . One washing , never worn , and they 're more wimpy than a cheap Haines or Fruit of the Loom . My old ones , even those of well over a year old , have more oomph than the new , unworn ones . The new ones come from Guatamala , the old ones from Haiti . I have no idea if that has anything to do with it but I wo n't buy any more . It 's discouraging that a company like Carhartt , with a fine reputation , would cheapen their product just to make a few bucks more . Definitely not recommended - they 're crap . OLD REVIEW I now have 10 Carhartt pocket T 's if that says anything . 6 white , 2 navy , and 2 tan . Over the years , I 've bought several brands and usually by the sixth washing or so , they 're wimpy and the necks get out of shape . Not so with Carhartt . They 're heavyweight and built to last for years . They 're certainly worth the few bucks added investment . Recommended .
5 #### I looked around and compared item and price and the best deal was here . This is a small family company and their products hold there own against the more expensive ones . Unless you are a workout crazyman or do n't take care of them , these bands will last years .
5 #### This is one of my favorite knives . I like how the blade locks securely into the sheath . It feels good in your hand , is very sturdy , and has a great weight and look . The only thing I did n't like is that is about 2 inches smaller than what I was thinking .
4 #### SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE THAN THE FIRST BACKPACKING MATTRESS I BOUGHT BUT YOU CAN DEFINITELY FEEL THE WEIGHT . FOR THE PRICE THOUGH ITS HARD TO BEAT . SEEMS THICK AND MAYBE MORE DURABLE THAN OTHERS . ONLY OTHER THING I DID NOT LIKE WAS IT HAS THE RUBBER NIPPLE TO INFLATE SO THE LIGHTWEIGHT HAND PUMP I BROUGHT ALONG ON A BACKPACKING TRIP DIDNT WORK SO WELL ... YOU GOTTA GIVE THOSE LUNGS A WORKOUT .
5 #### Got this to replace the one on my 20 + year old Coleman stove . Let 's face it , unless you throw your stove onto rocks and then jump up and down on it you 'll probably never have to replace it . Just gives me a warm fuzzy to have a backup .
5 #### I bought these for my husband and he loves them ! ! ! !
5 #### Gift for dad , he is a quality knife guy . It is now his daily carry .
5 #### I purchased this watch on Amazon five years ago , and it still looks great , and works well . The band is alot less likely to snag arm hairs than the link bands out there , and it is very light and thin . I can wear it hiking , to dinners , to meetings , or event riding a motorcycle , as it is thin enough to fit under a suit cuff , or a motorcycle glove cuff . This is Skagen at its ' simplest and best .
5 #### Fun fun fun except trying to close the air valve before you lose to much air . Bad design .
5 #### Wonderfully warm and cozy . I love the look of a muffler but do n't always want to have the bother of stowing it when I get where I 'm going . This is the perfect solution . If you button or zip your coat all the way up to the gaiter , no drafts can get in , and when you go indoors , it fits easily into a coat pocket .
5 #### These are great shoes and my husband loves the comfort
5 #### Good watch and ok price for this watch . Dependable and I would recommend this watch for everyday use . Second on of these watches . Older one still works .
5 #### I wear a women 's 11 in Nike , a 10.5 in Reebok , and these fit me perfectly . They 're more narrow than regular shoes , but nothing someone with a wider foot ca n't deal with . I love the shoes !
5 #### Fun toy to fool around near house . Obviously not for serious riding .
5 #### Love this brand can not go wrong . These shoes are great , highly recommended . I wish they would make this in a leather instead of suede
3 #### I normally wear a 32 DD bra and liked the way this one was revved . It is a small cut bra with very little stretch in the 32 inch band . Perhaps ordering a size larger would have been better for me . Opted to reorder a style that I ve worn before .
4 #### Very good thick mat ! Great for tall people . Is a but heavy but nice to be on ! !
2 #### This bathing cap does not work for my head . I have hair just a few inches longer than my shoulders and it will not hold it . I guess you can say that I have a big head . It literally just rolls up and falls off . Useless .
3 #### Too bulky and too heavy . Looks nice . I like the many slip - in pockets for cards .
1 #### could not breath through this mask , do n't know if it was defective , but litterly could not breath with this mask
5 #### Super light weight comfortable ! Kick box in these and run too . Good support !
4 #### Ordered the size she typically wears ( 10 W ) . They fit well . As comfortable as a chuck taylor can be .
5 #### It is long , so if you are short like me , you will need to take it up quite a bit , otherwise it is a neat costume
3 #### Having already purchased the lighter resistance level from this Flexbar , I probably would have been better off jumping to another resistance level ( maybe the Medium Resistance - Green ) . As the resistance offered when doing the Wrist Extension Bilateral ( http://www.thera-bandacademy.com/tba-exercise/thera-band-flexbar-wrist-extension-bilateral ) exercise just only varies slightly compared to the Yellow ( Extra - Light ) Flexbar .
2 #### This bar did n't do anything for my " tennis - elbow - like " pain . Perhaps I do n't have the conditions it was supposed to treat or I have n't done enough exercises properly . I used the bar for a couple of months before stopping due to ineffectiveness . I still have n't found anything that can help besides reducing the pain by switching from heavy dumbbell exercises to cables or stopping the exercise program altogether . I 'm giving this product 2 stars because it can be used as a roller / massager for arms on a smooth surface . Otherwise I 'd give it 1 star although I 'm still tempted to throw this out ...
5 #### A little stiff when new , but the fit is very good and they look nice . Dickies are made well and are tough enough for work pants , yet look good enough for casual wear .
4 #### The quality of these are great , but I made the mistake of erring on the side of caution since I 'd heard how difficult they were and got the Sport . Unfortunately it was about the same strength as a hard version of any regular gripper you could pick up . I did like the product though , so I ordered the # 1 and am waiting for it to arrive . The other thing I would say is that they are quite abrasive . I got around this by taking the rubber grips of a cheap gripper I had and using them on here , since they seem to be a standard size .
5 #### now that i have been using this mat for about a month ... I ca n't imagine my yoga life without this mat . It 's wonderful . I was worried it wo n't be " soft : enough but it provides me enough cushion for my joints and is not so soft that I feel unstable during balancing poses . LOVE LOVE LOVE this mat . I literally ca n't imagine life without it now that I have it ...
1 #### I received the shorts , and could n't even button them up . I 've worn a size 34 for around 8 years , I recently purchased several pairs of pants and shorts , all a size 34 . Every pair of pants and shorts I own is a size 34 . I 'm not imagining my own size , I 'm a size 34 . Dickies , however , sent me a pair of shorts that said they were a size 34 , but when I pulled them on , the button was 2 - 3 inches away from being able to button because they were so small . I returned them as per their return policy , understanding that I would eat the return shipping cost . As it turns out , I only got a partial refund : they would n't even cover the price to ship the shorts to me ! So I 'm just out $ 16 , and there was no way I could have worn the shorts . BEWARE ! ! ! Buying from Dickies online is EXTREMELY RISKY ! ! ! You could receive a super small garment and get raked over the coals by their returns department ! PROCEED WITH EXTREME CAUTION ! ! !
4 #### For the price I spent on the pair of shoes , I 'd say it 's as good as expected . It 's comfortable and does n't hurt my feet when I run .
3 #### I have had a couple of these in the past and stopped getting this product because the spring on the arm that holds the cigar will break fairly fast . Say , 5 - 6 uses and that spring was useless . Which renders the whole unit useless . Still , I am going to Las Vegas to play golf for a week and the guys there ride carts so I got this again .... just hoping it survives 5 - days of golf . Now , if you use a Click - Cart and carry a cigar to the golf course , this product does work , just will not last long . I would tell you to get the rubberized Click - Gear cigar holder . That thing is nuke proof and works perfectly .
5 #### Purchased these for my hubby he likes them and I like that it is a nicer color than green
5 #### best " Frisbee " I ever owned . Flies far and can be lots of fun in a parking lot too ! Just be careful not to hit cars ! I taped a bunch of keychain LEDs to it and it was great fun at night ! !
5 #### Perfect little gizmo for putting my hunting and fishing license in .
5 #### I got this flexbar due to lateral epicondylitis . I 've been doing a home exercise program recommended by a PC doc , but it was n't cutting it . I did some research and this bar came up . I can say , without a doubt , that one week of using this item beat 3 weeks of the other exercises recommended . If you have a strong grip already , you might move up from red to another higher resistance .
4 #### Pulls down in the crotch . The legs feel fine but I do n't like feeling that the crotch is partway down my thighs .
5 #### These work a lot better than other magnesium fire starters I ve used . This is a solid product .
5 #### just what i needed for my mountain home . good size , very tight lid , handles to carry it and a drain to empty it .
5 #### Shaving Sharp ! SOG strong , well made . I love the ballistic sheath with pocket in it .
5 #### Remember this is a 100.00 scope . For the money its great . Mounted on new Ruger charger and zero was easy and quick . Very clear and well made for the price .
5 #### Good material , strong construction , i have no problem trusting this piece of equipment .
5 #### The camo color is great . The material seems to be durable . I wore this whole day under the sun and protected my head from overheat . I have small head but I do n't like tight hat so got size 7.75 and just right fit in .
3 #### Adorable watch for beginners . Easy to see the numbers and hands . My only complaint is that there is no Velcro to keep the strap at your desired tightness . It kept getting loose .
4 #### this piece works very well . I do recommend it to any body with Elbow pain and problem . Should use this .
4 #### Love this flag but it was a little smaller than I expected . I should have read the measurements closer . It is not same size as typical small garden flags ... it runs smaller
5 #### Good looking shoes for running around . Comfortable , but just for walking , not high activity . Ran a little big , but not a problem
5 #### I purchased these for my grandson , this is his first year of high school football . He said the professional wear these and he wanted some . They were just what he wanted and fit great . We looked other places and compared prices and the deal was better that sports stores we tried .
5 #### In the last couple years I have bought about 10 of these ! These are great for any boater ! ! ! I just purchased more for a Christmas gift for a jet ski owner . I think they are more convenient than the conventional rope . There are no tying knots or worries that there is n't enough rope to tie to another boat / dock . They stretch and are easy to store . My only complaint is that over time they do tend to stretch and lose their elasticity but still can be used . Also another complaint is that they tend to come up " missing " because other boaters like them so much as well ! ! !
5 #### Black is the new black with these Chucky T 's . I 've always kept a pair of Chucky T 's in my closet and the black takes these bargain kicks to a new place visually . I love it .
3 #### It is ok for this price . But after 2 months , there are small holes on the bottom of shoes . But after 2 months , there are small holes on the bottom of shoes .
5 #### I bought this watch based on its good looks , size , the way the numbers are on the dial , and Timex reliable reputation and it has n't disappointed me in the least . It is stylish , tough , accurate , and so very comfortable to wear .
4 #### I know the Columbia isue with sizes , so I buy a smaller size . I am 5'6 " 140 pounds ( 169Cm 63 Kg ) normaly I am size small in almost every thing . I bought a xsmall and fit me perfect . I did n't use it yet , but it looks great . I need UPF Sun Protection and Columbia give us what we are rearching for . Tengo mucha ropa Columbia y conozco el problema con el talle . Compr un talle ms chico de esta camisa , mido 1.69 mts y peso 63 kg soy small en casi toda mi ropa excepto en Columbia , en la ropa de abrigo soy medium en camisas xsmall . Creo que Columbia piensa que la ropa sobre el cuerpo debe ser holgada y la de abrigo para usar sobre una tshirt o similar . Es raro ver en una foto de Columbia un modelo donde claramente la camisa le queda muy grande , tal vez no entendemos el concepto " ropa fresca " que tiene Columbia ,
4 #### Fit as Expected , size as choose , color as shown on Demo and Material very Good , it is comfort and durable Thanks
4 #### I love these bags . This is a perfect sized bag for around town , but a little small for travel .
5 #### Got this for my hubby for his USAPL competition . It def served the purpose . It was tight enough to offer some compression while still being legal for competition . Great product for the money !
2 #### the size , the French purse , and color is what I wanted , and the number of card slots are numerous / useful , but I 'm underwhelmed by the stiff leather and difficulty is using the card slots . Interior seems to be plastic PU , the see through window for the driver license is impossible , could not fit card in or remove it because of plastic backing . I used to love Buxton products for leather quality in the past -- guess , like everything else today , cutting corners is the norm .
5 #### Carhartt clothing has always been great fitting and made very well . these Tee Shirts are no exception . super sturdy material and quality workmanship . I keep going back for more of these shirts .
5 #### Great quality , easy to use , and convenient packaging with the bag . I travel a lot so this is great for keeping in shape during the days I ca n't get to a gym and lift !
3 #### The hat is awful , as many others have mentioned , but I had a better Maleficent hat already . I do wish that the trim was more purple and less hot pink , too . However , this did the trick - I dressed up at Mickey 's Halloween Party at Disneyland and got a LOT of attention !
5 #### I got this to hang up my 80 pound heavy bag and it does rhethe job easy and releases stress from my wood beam ! ! !
1 #### After only 4 hours of use , this seat cover is starting to fall apart . The stitching is coming apart on the back part of the cover , and gel is coming out . This is a very poorly made product .
4 #### These are great shirts ... I wish they were just a tad thicker ... I'm aware that Carhartt makes a heavier material for other t - shirts but they 're about twice the price . I would recommend this t - shirt to my friends & family too !
5 #### These fit great ! They last long time . They are very helpful when you need to wear something , not socks , with your shoes .
5 #### Excellent value ; I bought it to use while kayaking because of its length . Very nice action ; looks much more expensive than what it is . Plus , it has a handy ruler on it . Buy it .
5 #### Great addition to my camping supplies . I love stacking my dutch ovens when I cook or bake outside and this is perfect ! Also use it inside to protect counters and table tops in my RV . VERY helpful . Thank you
4 #### From everything I have read this anchor holds better than any other river anchor , Just one look at it and you will see why . I did not realize how large the side ring loop would be . I wrote several electric winch makers to see it this thing will seat in the davit and no one will confirm yes . I found one Amazon rating where a man said he uses it on his pontoon boat . I just took a chance and ordered a winch . My thougs are I may have to have a machine shop alter the davit for me . This thing is big . If you do n't want your boat to move , this is for you .
5 #### they fit as expected an my son is so happy ! !
4 #### Cute costume ! My 1 1/2 year old just barely fits in the 18month size . Definitely wo n't be able to wear it again next year but it works for now . She wears 18month clothes so the sizing seems fine . As others have said the costume is very scratchy inside since it 's not lined . But if you live somewhere cold , that is fine because she will be wearing long sleeves and pants underneath anyways in order to stay warm with a jacket . The costume is good quality and does n't seem like she will be able to rip it as she plays and runs around all night . Very cute costume to go with my 3 year old Winnie the pooh! ... weird that Winnie the pooh is so soft inside and piglet is not ... oh well !
4 #### This winter has been really cold and this gator has been used a lot for time spent outdoors . Too warm for running even at 20 degrees . Easy to stretch over your head and remove . It will keep you warm .
5 #### These are way better than I ever expected . The fit is perfection . I find sometimes that shorts or pants have too long a rise in front for me and things bunch up in front but these are made low , to be worn a bit on the low side . The shorts are not baggy but are straight and narrow along my thighs all the way to the top of my knee . I am 5 feet 4 inches and they come to the top of my knee , which is fine with me . The fabric is soft smooth cotton with that so important 5 % spandex for comfort . The pockets on mine lie flat and do not show or bulge out as some reviews state . While being incredibly comfortable , these look great . They are exceptionally flattering . They fit just like the size chart says they do . I want ten pairs of these , as I live in them all summer . These are really fabulous shorts .
5 #### I love these shorts nice lightweight , with that broken in feeling . They seem to be put together pretty well , I have had them for about 5 months and wear them a lot , no issues rips tears buttons falling off or anything of that nature .
5 #### ca nt go wrong for the price . good quality and gets the job done . easy to inflate . also quite comfortable !
4 #### Fit well just a small ant of shrimkage at waistlinw
4 #### I ordered them a half size bigger than what he is now to give him a little growing room . He 's only worn them once , and he seems to be able to walk in them just fine .
5 #### A little more cushion than the Powerstep Protech but the arch is maybe just a little lower . We love both styles . Excellent for plantar fasciitis and neuromas .
5 #### Very stylish . I have carpal tunnel so expansion bands are out for me . This bracelet band is both comfortable and stylish and you can never go wrong with a Timex watch .
5 #### Bought these for my husband . They are the only ones he wears . Very comfy and supportive and look good too !
3 #### I have never bought chucks from on Amazon before and it 's difficult to find an 8.5 in them anywhere as it is . So I was thrilled to find these . However , THESE ARE NOT AN 8.5 . They are most definitely a 9 . And honestly , I do n't even believe they are truly Converse . I believe they are KNOCKOFFS . I have had TONS of pairs of Converse . They all have tags sewn onto the inside of the tongue of each shoe and they are fabric tags . The tags on these are some sort of rubber . Never ever had rubber tags before , and I 've been buying Converse since high school and I 'm now 34 . I would have just bought a size 8 . Now I have to return them and play the waiting game all over again . What a shame .
2 #### The wings look great when you blow them up . There were a little to big for what we needed . The wings were easy to fill but once they were filled the jet pack was to big in the middle . So wearing them long made my sons back sore the straps were way way to small for my 3 yr old . Makes a Great Wall mount for a toy story theme room .
5 #### At first I thought I do n't need this ... This is a must have when using the dutch oven .
5 #### I 've been using this helmet for about 6 months and I 'm pleased with its performance . The vents keep my head cool while riding in the hot summer sun while it has enough coverage to keep my head fairly dry in light rain and warm in cooler weather . It fits well and the chin strap and clasp work well . I 'm pleased !
4 #### It works . Used it for medial epicondylitis aka Golfer 's Elbow . It 's not a miracle cure so do n't expect one use to heal your elbow . It still takes time and rest . Suddenly my elbow started bothering me ( probably from overuse ) because of constant Crossfit workouts and my regular lifting / strength training program . There was n't a particular moment that caused my elbow pain . I refused to see the doctor though I visited a chiropractor to see if any upper back adjustments could be done in the event that the nerve was being pinched from all the way up there . Between that , daily tricep / forearm massaging , refraining from movements that cause pain , and this Theraband , my elbow is finally getting better . I would definitely recommend the blue one if you 're a strong person . I do it 10 - 12x twice a day .
5 #### Takes a little time to set up , but my son and I love this goal . The other pop up goals tend to flap in the wind a little to much for us . This goal works best for us .
5 #### Although it is n't the intended purpose , these really helped with my husband 's stinky feet . He loves these socks and so do I.
4 #### Love the shoe , but had to return to get a smaller size . They run a size too big .
5 #### Nice sled . I bought it for waterfowl hunting and dragging my things into the marsh . It is plenty big for decoys , gun and gear bag .
4 #### A bit bigger than expected but came super quick and completed my outfit for a concert that I was attending .
5 #### 5 year old loves it . Perfect for spring strolls in the park .
5 #### Great quality work shirt . Little large but shrinks up to fit just right .
1 #### I would expect an American icon like Lodge would make the accessories in the US as well . They should buy USA too .
5 #### This is the cheapest you will find these balls . These are brand new and sealed in the protective case . I got this to have autographed and could n't find them under $ 25 at dicks or academy stores . These are the exact balls minus the mud that the MLB uses in every game . Perfect for autographs .
4 #### I like the way they fit . I would rather have a 33x31 but they did not offer that size .
4 #### Comfortable . I 'm always pulling my bras down because they ride up under my breasts . Not so with this bra . I wondered if I 'd like a front closure with all those snaps . Turns out , I can just slid the bra over my head without worrying about it . I just ordered another one .
5 #### Very comfortable . Birkenstocks are the best feeling shoes for me with my flat feet and pronation .
3 #### Need longer than 6 feet . Anyway two can be put together ?
4 #### My 13 year old thinks it 's great . I mean -hey it 's a halloween costume , not some big deal fashion item . The back is pink , but it did n't matter much because since it is a bit big for her , we are just pulling the tie across the back tighter . And yes the wig could be a bit better - more populated with yarn . But it is a better costume than the discount department store ones for 20 - 30 bucks so I 'm happy .
5 #### Thanks for saving me money on my grand - daughters shoes . Really nice looking and the real thing . She loves them !
5 #### Just what I needed for Group Fight class . Quick movements and footwork are so easy in these sneakers . Love them .
2 #### Terrible quality and very wobbly- my 5 year old and a few of his friends had fallen off at least once and hurt themselves . Returned this after 2 weeks .
4 #### Have n't used it yet but I am sure it is fine .
5 #### Very high quality . After looking at the big box stores prices , ( $ 69.00 ) I thought 17.00 was a very low price . I 'm knew to archery and did n't know if I would like it so I went with the lowest price . I 'm very happy with the quality . The store was nice and they even let me try the different kinds of releases , but this one is as nice as any of them . Very happy .
5 #### I got two for my granddaughters who use them constantly . Bikes are ok but these are more active for them .
5 #### This is a really reliable watch and perfect for me ! I have been wearing it every day for the last 2 weeks .
5 #### I was stunned when my son told me he wanted the original scooter and not one of the upgraded , more expensive ones . ( Hallelujah ) Apparently , this the one all the other kids he knows has . The reason is , and this is IMPORTANT- the newer ones have some kind of bar / guard on the back , that in theory , is a good idea , but according to my son , gets in the way , and inhibits breaking ( stopping ) . Cheaper AND safer- it has my vote ! !
5 #### Finally , after trying about 10 pairs of Nike 's , these were a perfect fit . They are light and very comfortable , I really just forget about my feet when I 'm wearing them .
5 #### Bought this as a Christmas gift for my nephew and he loved it .
4 #### I bought this reel for my grandson 's fly rod so I can not give a fair review for this product . I can say that he seems to be happy catching trout with this product !
5 #### i was unsure what would happen when nike bought converse , but as far as i can tell , they 're exactly the same as when i bought my first pair when i was 15
4 #### They fit as expected and perfect for training , the shoelaces are a little bit too long . Other than that these shoes are as I expected them !
5 #### Love the Color and price was great . It 's a chuck ... nuff said
5 #### This item came in a timely matter and will be used when set up . It looks well made . Will clean muddy boots well and easy to clean .
5 #### Love this bag , I use an iPhone 6 plus and it fits perfectly , I additionally put some keys and two GUs and it is a bit packed but still fits
4 #### Bought these for my husband and he loves them . He had an old pair that had to go . He will wear these all day everyday if he could .
2 #### I ordered these shoes in a size 9 and they were way too big . I returned and ordered an 8.5 and they were way too small . Sizing is not accurate , which is too bad because they are a very cute shoe and I would have loved to wear them if they fit properly .
5 #### The look and versatility of these shoes make them worth every penny , despite it 's lack of support . I wear a 10.5 in most running / court shoe ( Asic , Adidas , Nike , etc . ) but the Chuck Taylor size 10 fits me perfect . Since dropping in a pair of Dr Scholls Custom Fit orthotic inserts , I can walk in these shoes all day .
5 #### This watch is easy to read , has nice band , shows day and date , and also has indiglo , a dial light that is great for reading dial in the dark . Also says the battery is 10 year life . If you want an unassuming , unpretentious watch with many features , at a great price , this is the watch for you .
5 #### I bought this to protect my new shotgun from getting dinged up in my safe . Does the job . I would recommend .
5 #### Good shoe at a good price , very happy with this item
5 #### Along with the purchase of the green flexbar , this has helped tremendously with tendonitis in both my elbows . Very versatile and can use different exercises to help with wrist , forearm and shoulder injuries .
5 #### Love this , really makes a difference and enjoy cleaning my jewelry
5 #### My husband wears a watch every day and he is so pleased with this watch . At first , the band seemed a bit tight but it expanded enough so it is very comfortable . He likes the large face and the light . Easy to see .
5 #### It works great . Though $ 5 seems like a lot for a simple whistle , that 's just the going price with online retailers ..
4 #### i bought a pair from DSW for 50 $ and they are very comfortable but i bought a size 6.5 when I normally where a size 7 . and even the 6.5 feels a little roomy . I have wide flat feet btw . i m not sure if I will keep them even though i love their look and comfort . I 've been having feet problems while taking a gym class and I think they wo n't give me enough support when running . they 're great for wearing at home or gym and doing exercises in one place- extremely light weight and flexible , but i do n't know if they 'll last long if you use them everywhere else . :( i really like them but i ca nt just buy 2 different shoes . also , i really like the strings inside the lining on the side of the shoes to adjust and make the shoe fit snug . it makes me feel secure :D
4 #### Does what it 's sposed to do ! We had a little bit of trouble getting it to buckle onto the Rawlings Coolflow Metallic Batting Helmet that we purchased it for . But in the end we persevered , and now it does it 's job spectacularly . I 'm a little disappointed that you have to purchase this separately from the helmet , but that 's for another review ;) .
5 #### These grips are perfect . I own them for my full sized 1911 and my compact CC 1911 . They really show their worth with the CC 1911 . It has a 3.5 " barrel and is considerably lighter than the full size 1911 . Having the finger grips in front makes all the difference in a solid hold . I have big hands and without these I was having trouble getting a solid grips . Hope that his helps .
5 #### Perfect fit . Perfect look . I like mine to get a little dirty , but it 's not hard to keep these clean if you want to .
5 #### I ordered this " wings " Jet Pack for my grandson for his 2nd birthday along with the costume and pillow . It is hilarious ! He put on the entire outfit for his birthday and it was just the cutest . The wings are large and he was wiping everyone out as he walked in the living room . Just so funny . He really felt that he was Buzz and was trying to jump and take off . If your child loves Buzz and enjoys pretending any time of the year , buy the set . You will not be disappointed .
1 #### Love these shoes . Been wearing them for years . I can usually get a year out of them if I do n't mind a bit of fading and scuffing . Not sure if they 've switched manufacturers or if I 'm getting knock - offs , but the last two pair I 've purchased barely made it 3 months before the bottoms began to detach from the rest of the shoe . I 'd give these a five star rating if it were n't for such a low life span .
5 #### Tough shirt . Comfortable . This purchase is n't my first or last .
5 #### Fine leather product . It is very solid , but light weight . The size is accurate . You may want to consider going one size larger if you wear a larger belt / buckle underneath .
5 #### these inserts fit as predicted into my gold tip xt hunter and expedition hunter carbon shafts . never had any issues with these ... since they are the factory replacements of the ones that come with the new shafts in the package
5 #### A very thick and durable bag that is perfect for carrying my trailer hitch , portable air compressor , road flares , flashlight , first aid kit and a few essential tools with room to spare ! It keeps all those items together rather than having them loose and moving around . The dimensions listed by the seller are accurate . I 'd recommend this bag !
5 #### My Granddaughter Loved her new watch . And of course purple is her favorite color . :)
4 #### Great jacket for cool weather . Heavier than I expected , and somewhat large for a medium , but I love it .
1 #### The Converse symbol is on inside of shoe instead of the outside of shoe .
5 #### this is a great rod for surf fishing . action is perfect and the rod is strong . i took it to malibu for a little surf fishing and had no problems landing a leapord shark . i ve got it paired with a okuma abf 90 . i liked it so much i ordered a 12 footer with a abf 60 .
5 #### A beautiful watch for the price . Very stylish , clean and neat looking . Easy to read . I like a watch with a stretch band .
5 #### it works .. Having chronic issues with tennis elbow ( from construction activity ) I 've used various therapy methods and this thing is the easiest to do and most effective
5 #### These would make your feet sing for joy , if feet could sing . :)
3 #### I must have not read the product description thoroughly enough , I tried a pair on and it felt as if I was wearing a tiny waist with big meaty legs . I 'm taking the blame for this one , Dickies is a great company .
5 #### This is the best way I have found to get rid of pesky flies ! It works almost every time
5 #### Started working at a office which requires leg wear and I thought that Hanes Alive disappeared in the 90s . Its a bit of a trick to get them on but they do give you the support I love during a long day of " Heels and Hose " . It would be nice if they were a bit longer at the top then they would hands down beat Spanx .
5 #### these are great all - purpose putzing around boots . Very nice and fit well .
4 #### A nice lightweight shoe . Not a lot of cushion so I would n't run long distances in them .
5 #### I love these wingtips ! They are very comfortable and a great value . Be aware that you will need to spend some time polishing these right out of the box to get them looking perfect . Highly recommended .
4 #### I gave them to my daughter for her Birthday , I ca n't answer all the ? 's but she was happy with them .
5 #### I love this watch - it 's very pretty and tells time . I have n't had any issues with the band but your mileage may vary .
4 #### Cute sneaker . Look very good on my grandson . Be prepared for them to get dirty .
5 #### Nice to have to keep the hot lid out of the dirt .
3 #### These ropes were a little short , I ended up donating them to the local elementary school .
4 #### This is my second goal of the same model . The first one lasted almost 10 years in harsh weather conditions . Assembly is tedius and instructions / illustrations could be better for sure .
5 #### Disappointed when I could n't find a pachmyr grip like I have on my full size 1911 so I was looking around and chose this . Well I 'll tell ya it 's great went on very easily in my para companion c7.45 hardest thing about it was trying to find the right tool . Looks and feels great . I have large hands and I like there to be a bit more girth to the grip . This adds a small amount . Just enough . Hogue never lets he down
4 #### I ordered these pantyhose to wear for a friend 's wedding - the color was as expected and the packaging was nice . The quality of the pantyhose initially seemed pretty on par for pantyhose , but when I tried to put them on they ripped as soon as I tried to pull them up over my thighs . They also ran a little small . I am a plus sized gal and went for the plus - sized queen thinking they would work . I 'd much rather spend a little more money for a quality pair of pantyhose that will last more than one use - however , in a pinch , these would work .
5 #### We , the humans in this family , find these to be the best flying frisbees we 've ever used . Really really nice . They throw well and sail far . Unfortunately , the smaller sized one is also our dog 's favorite - in - the - whole - world frisbee , even though she has many different frisbees , especially dog specific ones . But none even come close to the Aerobie in her opinion . She LOVES it and goes bonkers every time it comes out in the yard . She will chase it forever , until she literally drops . We have to have a little pool for her to jump in often , because she gets so overheated . It is definitely not made to hold up to dog teeth , and so we can not her alone with it for even a minute . We play frisbee with her until WE are tired of throwing , and then we immediately put it away where she can not get it . Even so , we still have to replace hers every couple of months . But she loves it SO much , we ca n't deprive her of one .
3 #### I wear a men 's size 9 shoe / boot and always order socks in this size , something like 9 - 12 or a large size . Fox River is my favorite boot sock OEM but I was not able to find a sock from them in a shorter height for hiking boots . These Wigwam socks run almost one size small on my feet . They are usable , but just barely and the next size larger would have been a better fit , I imagine . I will be replacing these socks with something from a different OEM in the future and should have returned them to Amazon after I tried the first pair but needed them the following day .
5 #### For serious orienteering . You could do with just a baseplate but the lid with the mirror makes for more precise bearings and mirror can be used as a signaling mirror . The lid also protects the compass .
5 #### you pay for quality , you receive quality ! The perfect every - day - knife ! No problems , received it sharp and it has stayed sharp ! ! This the the knife spend the money and stop buying those $ 20-$50 knockoffs , from China . A real knife for everyday use .
5 #### Bought this watch for my dad and he loves it . It fits perfectly on his wrist ; not too tight , not too loose . The band itself is made of durable and quality water resistant leather . The hands glow in the dark , which proves to be useful whenever my dad goes fishing or barbequing late at night . Packaging and pricing is very reasonable ; nothing for me or my dad to complain about . My dad wears this watch EVERY day , and yet it has never been broken , shattered , scratched , or dirtied . Definitely recommend this watch as a gift to a father , brother , brother - in - law , co - worker , etc .
5 #### This was a hit at a 4yr old birthday party . The perfect size for a few kids and adults and super sturdy ; we had some future s / he - mans yanking on the handles with all their might . Play some music and do freeze dance , have the kids try to all run under before it goes down , are they fast enough ? Other fun games - through some ball on top and do n't let them bounce off . There are probably many more ideas out there if you search the world wide web of fun . Now I am waiting for another turn where we have enough people over to use it .
5 #### BEST . SHOES . EVER . I bought two pairs in different colors- black n ' white and the pink and white ... They have AWESOME support for whatever you use them for .. I have one for work and the other for training / running / etc in ...
5 #### Love the shoes , been wearing converse since i was a small boy .
5 #### Not the grippiest , but has enough grip for me . very high quality and is holding up well after many months of regular use .
4 #### I normally wear an adult small or extra small ( 5'5 , 120 # ) so I ordered a medium in these & they fit well . Adults should definitely order 1 - 2 sizes up . They were exactly as I expected . Comfortable , but not overly soft or of great quality BUT I am happy for the price .
5 #### I spent a while deciding which golf bag stand to buy , and feel like I made the right choice . The basics : - Hold one standard size bag PLUS my club bag which is larger than most . - Assembly took maybe two hours , and I 'm fairly handy . But it is a sturdy product . - The shelves are just wide enough for a pair of shoes , hat , or other misc . golf stuff . - The sides and bottom are a wire mesh . It is n't the strongest material out there , but it is working . I could see myself cutting a piece of plywood to make the base stronger down the line , but it works / looks great for now . Overall , I 'm very happy with this item . I paid around $ 75 and feel like it was well worth it .
4 #### This vest had 95 % of what I wanted for about 35 % of the cost of comparable items . Worth the money .
5 #### I have purchased dozens of pairs of all styles of MERRELL 'S over the years . It just so happens that they fit me perfectly so I can buy them with confidence every time I need a new pair .
5 #### I use this on my Horse blankets and Turnout sheets , it works great ! I re - seal my sheets and blankets every year with this stuff and extend the life of my horse blankets for years ! ! ! It has kept some of my gear lasting for 6 years ! It 's a must have !
5 #### Love these ! I am 220 lbs . 5'7 " . 48 hips . 39 waist . The 2x fits with extra room in the waist . I use the draw strings because my waist is narrow and it fits wonderful ! Length comes down long like a bermuda short . Very pleased with the quality of the material .
4 #### Comfortable , but it 's tighter around than other bras I own of the same size .
1 #### This chair failed on its first outing on the flat plywood floor of a Yurt at Lake Cachuma Ca . I weigh 250 # and am pretty fit at 6'4 " . The chair 's frame failed and I fell hard . Bought the chair through Wayfair . They want me to wait a month of prime hiking season for a replacement . Asked for a refund through Amazon . Travel Chair was also contacted . They say they stand by their product but want me to jump though their hoops to repair or replace the product during the season I hike the most . I 'm not going to waste my summer waiting for a fix . I will buy another chair from a different manufacturer from a brick and mortar store where I can get a replacement for a defective product the same day . Seriously do n't trust this chair . It failed at left rear leg insertion point of its hard plastic frame with a load 50 # lighter than its advertised capacity . Fit or not an unexpected fall can get you hurt .
5 #### This actually works really well . Use it when still hunting for ten and trying to locate one .
5 #### I have worn them for several years , and every time I decide to try another kind I am disappointed , so I decided to stay with the Bali Skimp Skamps . They are so comfortable and fit just right .
2 #### Did n't realize it was for kids . It 's ok for me because I 'm small . I will use the extra weight to strengthen my arms when I swim .
5 #### I grew up with a granddad who always had a Swiss Army Knife on him , and I finally bought this one about three years ago . There 's really much to be said for always having a knife on you ! Though to be honest I do n't actually carry this daily , but it 's always with me when we go camping or hiking . This seems to have everything I need . My boyfriend has gotten so used to me always having it , that he 's constantly asking to use it . Forgot the can opener ? No problem ! Need to make some wood shavings ? You got it ! Really , this little thing covers just about any scenario I can think of . This is a nice , heavy weight pocket knife . It cleans up really nicely with soap and water . I just open everything up , rinse , and dry completely now and then , and have never seen any rust on it . All the blades are still really sharp . It 's pretty darn sleek too .
4 #### i 'm sure they work . i have not used it yet . I have not used it yet . that is all folks
5 #### Love the color , love the fit . Takes a while to break them in , otherwise great product !
5 #### Definately what I wanted for my daughter . It was true to size and fit great . I would definately buy these again .
5 #### Great jacket , I 'm happy with it . I wish the front pockets were larger but they are adequate . I 'm 6 ' 195lbs 46 " chest - I ordered a large because x - lg jackets seem a bit oversized on me and other 's reviews indicate these Carhartts run large . The lg . fits me nicely but I do n't have the longer arms that most 6 footers have . I was told by Carhartt 's chat on their website that this jacket with it 's firmhand duck is not expected to shrink more than 2 - 4 % if directions for washing are followed . So I might regret getting the large as it ca n't afford to shrink on me arm length wise . Maybe I 'll try washing it in cold water instead of warm and dry it on gentle instead of medium .
4 #### I used these to replace some wheel on a roller bag the airport destroyed . Works great . The bearings are 8 mm ( ID ) and will fit Eagle Creek luggage .
4 #### These are nice midweight socks that I use with my fall and winter boots . I wanted ones with no wool and these are one of the few like that around . Recommend them .
5 #### I love Chucks ! I bought these specifically for work . In retrospect , I would 've bought additional insoles for some arch support ( 40hrs / week in a restaurant setting ) . If you 're buying these for casual wear , they 're awesome and comfortable for all day wear without additional insoles .
5 #### I catch , photo , and release and as been mentioned , these tend to corner mouth hook fish and getting the hook out is rarely if ever an ordeal . Less stress for me and the fish so I can get them back in the water . It also makes life easier if you are dealing with a toothy fish . They are very sharp and hold soft bait very well . These are my go to hooks .
5 #### Got these for a very athletic granddaughter , just 14 . She loves them ! ! Her grandfather , my husband , wore pretty much the same chucks , say about a hundred years ago . :)
2 #### Well I thought this costume was all in ONE piece . I thought the cow head would have been attached to the body but it was n't . Just was impressed . I did n't feel comfortable in it , so needless to say I did return it .
5 #### Just received my Chucks ! Tried them on and they fit perfect . Just in time for summer . Ca n't wait to show them off with my tan !
5 #### 5 yo daughter loves this . Was given for Xmas . Great quality , fun " girly " colors .
5 #### Every type of Smartwool sock that I have purchased has been great . They are true to size and do not shrink . They last and last too !
5 #### PURCHASED ONE IN FLORIDA ! HAVE FOUR GRANDCHILDREN AND THEY ALL WANTED THEIR OWN , SO I ORDERED FOUR ! GOOD PRICE AND GREAT PRODUCT ! WE USE THEM IN THE POOL AND IN THE OCEAN ! PROVIDES HOURS OF FUN ! ORDERED A SET OF PADDLES AND HAD TO ORDER MORE . THEY ALL WANTED THEM ! YOU WON'T BE SORRY IF YOU BUY THESE !
5 #### Love it , replaced one I had used so long it began to fall apart .
5 #### lol , even thou its to early for shorts tried them on very please rothco always satisfies.nice and sturdy construction top notch !
5 #### The Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Oxfords were even more comfortably than I expected ... like walking on air . Easy match black . Love'em .
5 #### The blue jeans I wear . Lasts for a long time , and inexpensive . I used to get these from Wal - Mart , but now from Amazon and love that it comes right to my front door .
3 #### There is a piece that goes against my back that feels sharp . I am going to have to cover it with material or something . Other than that the fit is good and the seller had it here fast .
5 #### Awesome . I grew up with this toy . How can you go wrong building an igloo after a good snow ? Must have for kids and the price is right as long as you wait until the price drops .
3 #### I prefer the hex head to flat or crosstip screws but this seems like a lot of hardware for a simple scope mount . It does the job though .
1 #### My husband is very tall and these pants came down 3 in past his knees
5 #### I love these shoes my second pair of 40 plus $ shoes and they both have certainly out done the $ 100 K - swiss that I 'm looking to return . The shoes are extremely comfortable , all my clients love them , just wish they came in more colors .
4 #### These are kind of the standard for solid - fuel stoves . Aside from the terrible fish smell they work as described . You ca n't beat the weight and size for backpacking .
4 #### Durable bike and the only disappointment was it did n't come with the bell that 's shown . I had to go buy one and put on it and the little ones love the bell .
5 #### I enjoyed wearing these sandals and found them comfortable and plan on using them again and again . Make sure that you check the size so you get a good fit .
5 #### Great product - 1 tab for dry wood , use in the cooker it comes with , 3 tabs for wet wood .
5 #### For Christmas we got a lot of iron cookware . We already had a lot , but I wanted a whole system to use independent of the rest . Got a huge dutch oven , tripod , lid lifter , insert and lid stand . We love the way food tastes when cooked over an open fire and iron does it better than anything else . This si part of a set that will last a lifetime !
1 #### I had ordered a watchband that I viewed on the seller page . I got what was on a different page , and trying to get this seller to understand what the problem was , was impossible . The seller was supposed to have return labels dropped off to me weeks ago , but I have n't seen anything . Trying to get what I needed has been a nightmare . Do n't order anything for Suunto watches , you 'll get something you ca n't use , or do n't want .
5 #### Well made & comfortable . They are expensive compared to other shoes of same type , but you know why once you try them on . The cheaper brands hurt my feet , are not finished as smooth on the inside & do n't offer the support you get from these . I 've worn them in the snow a few times & they are totally waterproof . Would buy again .
5 #### Think next time I will order the next smaller size JUST TO SEE . Otherwise , very pleased .
5 #### Right out of the box , this scope was " right on . " It is perfect for my Browning SA-22 rifle . AND ... it 's a good price !
5 #### great product at great price , look like they will last a real long time , very heavy but flexible rubber material .
4 #### I like that fact that it is 2.5 gallons , which means it is not too big and not too small . Good for two people for a weekend trip canoeing .
3 #### need a backup ? this 'll do nicely . It 's a decent little cheaper knife . I keep this one in a sheath with a kukri clone .
3 #### He loves looking at the compass . I just wish it stayed on more secure . It swivels a bit . Maybe his bar is not the right diameter for it to fit right .
5 #### This is my first purchase of Sperry footwear , but not my last !
5 #### Can not expect more . This is a dream product - just a little testy at the beginning with the suction , but after that was fixed , it was smoothe sailing all the way .
1 #### This is way too small for a men 's watch , both the face and the band -- the band would n't even go around my wrist . I think this must be a women 's watch mislabled . Nice looking , but I sure ca n't use it -- I 'm going to have to return it !
5 #### Bought this in size 7.5 " and it fit perfectly . The material is a nice durable almost canvas material . Bought this as a hat for my paintball setup , which is also tiger stripped themed and it matched in well . Since this has to sit above a mask I have to use the chin strap to keep it in place ( should have bought a 7.25 " or a 7 " since it sits higher on my head ) which does its job well . The only thing I can think of is the fact that for a hat , this is kind of heavy due to the thickness of the material . This does n't bother me at all , I hardly notice it once I put it on . But for those that care about such things , there is a heft to this hat . Pro 's : Durable Material Good chin strap High Quality stitching Con 's : Weight ( for some , see above )
5 #### My husband loves them , they are his favorite jeans , they are durable , well made and fit perfectly .
4 #### Got this for my mom she plays bingo and when they call I 22 they all say quack quack aflack , not sure why
5 #### I have two very happy sons who can load all their ice fishing gear into these sleds ( I bought two ) and quickly go ice fishing . Wonderful product
5 #### What 's not to like about these that 's why I ordered two sets .
5 #### Great way to keep the boat off the dock . Easy to use and well made . Ideal for areas with tides , waves or boat wakes .
5 #### Oh , wow , but these have been impossible to find in stores . They are soft and stretchy without the big wide legs . They are a great length , and they are nicely made , with slash pockets that sit flat . Legs not too loose or too tight . I am very pleased with these shorts .
5 #### Love this hat . I wear a size 7 1/4 fitted hat and ordered a 7 1/2 . Hat fits fine and is very comfortable .
1 #### Tiny . We 're going to have to put this outside my kids playhouse .
3 #### stiching on inside of one shoe had a lump that painfully dug into my foot . Had to return them . Will not try them again , poor workmanship . Not the quality shoe were used to .
4 #### I am sure they will be great when broke in . The soles are going to be awesome on ice . Good service and attractive shoe . Pleased
5 #### So cool . I am using this as a seat pad to get myself into a better sitting posture . As a guy that is 6 ' 6 " tall , chairs just are not built for me . A skilled Physical Therapist recommended getting this pad to elevate my sitting position . What a huge difference from a little thing . Top quality workmanship and good materials . Very happy with this , So happy I bought more for other chairs !
5 #### In all honesty , I have beaten the crap out of this raft . We 've dragged it into the river on two different backpacking trips now . Rocked it down river and some small rapids ( nothing crazy , but some 3 - 4 foot falls , lots of sliding over river rocks , both with 1 person or 2 people , etc ) , slept on it , dragged it back upriver over rough terrain etc and I am honestly shocked at how well it has held up . Put one small hole in the front on our first adventure , sealed it with gorilla glue and gorilla tape and it was great on its second outing last weekend . The next trip may be it 's last , but for $ 30 it has been well worth it ! Going for the 3 person next ! !
3 #### Great look but zero support inside the shoe . Had to buy expensive inserts to be wearable . Expected more from a nike shoe .
5 #### Smart wool socks are a family favorite for gift giving . I bought these for an outdoorsman who plans to use them when out hunting , hiking , etc . They appear to be the same high quality we 've come to expect of the Smartwool brand . Would definitely buy again .
5 #### I 've been wearing Chuck Taylor All Stars for the last 25 years , and they 're still the ultimate in fashion over function . Even with their weird sizing chart , and the fact that every pair of Chucks has one thing wrong with it ( these ones have a weird flapping sound when I walk ) they 're still the same classic cool looking shoe with no arch support that they 've always been . Do n't forget to buy yourself some insoles when you purchase them . Chuck Taylor All Stars : a classic American shortcut to looking like you belong at concerts and record stores around the world .
3 #### It 's great . Nice and small to fit my very small wrist but also large enough for others Not sure if it keeps good time as I have to keep resetting it .
4 #### Glad I read the reviews before I used on my ski ! Knots on ends were crappy .... I just read these reviews and changed the knot they used and used bowline knot and boom works like a charm .. with bowline knot loops wo n't come loose ! ! ! ! !
4 #### The frame piece that goes to the side of your face is too flimsy . It is a true polarized lens though . Not sure about the Z87 rating , for there was no Z78n marking on the lens .
4 #### This is not as dark red as the photo . I found the burgundy and will order it . The style is nice , though , with lots of room for the amount of stuff I carry . I wish the credit card slots were enclosed within the pouch of the bag for more security . I ordered a credit card stacker to play it safe . Overall , it 's a nice mini bag for carrying cash , cards and my smartphone .
4 #### I really like the shoes and walked all over Germany and Austria in them but would have returned for a half size smaller if I had had time .. They run very large in my opinion . They are nice shoes , I 'll have to wear thicker socks . I 'd buy them again , but in a 7.5 next time .
5 #### Awesome shirts they have a wide variety of colors which is hard to find and they were reasonably priced .
4 #### Okay , so the opening line is a bit much , but hey ... it IS tough . For those who like to keep their body in top performance , this could be a nice little addition . It 's not your typical " off the shelf of a Big Box Store " product . It 's made ( in the USA , thank you very much ) by guys who do this for a living . Meaning : You Get What You Pay For . This is from guys whose make hand grips their Speciality . Get with it !
5 #### MY only wish this came with a tool to take out the extra links . I have had every watch I owned lose time , even after changing the batteries , within 6 month . I am hoping this Timex does not do that . I had one years ago that kept time correctly and I only parted with it because of the band and the scratched cover after years of abuse .
3 #### not made the way they were . they were made to better specs before . I 've worn this exact shoe for so long . the new pair fits differently . threw them out and wearing old pair that needs to be replaced . think I 'll look for a different brand after 20 years . these started to hurt my back which went away after going back to old pair and other shoes . they must have switched factories or something , maybe these are seconds I do n't know
4 #### I 've used the rainbow trout version of this lure a few times now , and of course it 's built well like all Rapala hard - body lures . I 've had no luck so far fishing with it in Illinois , probably in large part because there are n't enough rainbow trout here for the game fish to recognize a lure that 's supposed to resemble one of their fry . In Wisconsin , on the other hand , in lakes where trout are not unheard - of , I caught decent - sized smallmouth bass with it . So as with all artificial lures , yoru luck will vary depending on how and where you use it .
5 #### This is one tough pair of pants . I climb around a truck all day in comfortable style in these rugged work pants .
1 #### I have a wide foot and wear a 11.5 EE . I also own serval brands of boots all of which fit very comfortably in that size . I have owned Justin boots in the past and they were well made . These boots however are terrible ! I placed them on the boot sizing chart that I have and they are not a 11.5 EE . Not even close . It looks like they took their average size width and just stamped it EE . The other thing is the quality is way below the previous Justin boots that I have owned , which were made in the USA . These look like some cheap knock offs made in Mexico .
5 #### This is very good silicone grease , and it is food graded . This jar contains 2 oz silicone grease , so it is more than I ever need to use for fountain pen . When I convert my fountain pen to an eyedropper style pen , I apply to the thread . This is one of the best and cheapest silicone grease on the market so far . Overall , I am very happy with this purchase , and it is well worth the five stars rating ! I have included few photos for you to look at the details of the product . To sum up , I listed some Pros and Cons below . Pros : 1 . Very good food graded silicone grease 2 . The product price is reasonable . 3 . Very easy to use with a nice jar 4 . Perfect for fountain pen use too Cons : 1 . None so far . [ ... ] Thank you very much =)
5 #### I really love these rings . They fit well & I love that I can wear on my thumb or on my finger ! Came right on time & well worth the price !
5 #### Not too expensive and it works ( for me ) . I used this as per the instructions - and within minutes I can feel it hitting the areas where my ' tennis elbow ' was sufferring from . Was a bit painful but I felt it was working . Used for 3 - 5 mins and mentally I knew I be ordering the more firmer BLUE coloured one . This thing works . It has now been 2 weeks and I used it most days just for 5 - 8 mins ... and my elbows are felling better . Not totally gone but way better . I ordered the GREEN based on user feedback that it was " too tough " or " they needed a lighter one " etc ... I should have gone straight for the BLUE one instead . I am 90 kg , 5 ' 6 " male who does alot of sports and gym . But honestly my 45 kg wife managed fine on the GREEN . So am a bit puzzled how the lighter versions can possibly be difficult . ? ? Just saying this in case if you order you end up like me having to order a " step up " version and end up with 2 colours !
5 #### both my hubby and I have these . recently I took a pic with my other road biking friends and it actually looked better than the pricey Giro and Specialized helmets everyone else was sporting . Price is great on this for the function and fit . I like it has a visor and have ridden it in hot weather for 3 + hour rides and not felt hot .
4 #### They wear well and take a beating and wash well too
4 #### Super warm , but not wide enough to cover my whole ear . I do n't normally wear a hat , so some part of my ear will get cold .
5 #### Fast shipping ! Fit is exactly as expected . I wear Women 's size 8 or Men 's size 6 and was true to size . Love my new shoes ! !
3 #### When you are on it , it spreads weight unevenly . Your butt will sink . And eventually , for me , it started deflating every night .
5 #### This is our 4th scooter . My kids just love them so much . Great toy for a wide range of kids . Never gets boring and keeps them moving . The pink is perfect and girly too .
2 #### wonderful for about 3 months , but after that they got destroyed :( they ripped on both sides and inside one of the shoes . I love the way they looked until they ripped . But when I had them when they were new , they looked awesome . It also seemed as if one shoe lace was way longer than the other .
5 #### These are really great googles . With proper care they will last a long time . The fit is great also .
5 #### I bought this helmet back in October . I am not an avid bike rider , but my friend and I try to go every Friday morning . I have to say this thing probably saved my life yesterday ! I had a collision with a deer- yes a deer and I got banged up pretty good- the helmet only suffered minimal damage- a crack in the front and the visor was torn off- but the EMT 's were certain I could have had some serious brain injuries had I not been wearing it.- So bottom line- for the price- this helmet did its job and did it well !
5 #### If you need to repair a boot , shoe , wader , or almost any other rubber item ... look no further . You have found it with Aquaseal .
5 #### I hate using bridges . This tool allows me to reach my shot without some goofy bridge . The tube is tapered just right so it grips your pool stick on the grip instead of damaging the finish of the cue . The extender feels very sturdy and its easy to keep it strapped to my case . It will not fit inside of most cases because its wide .
5 #### High quality . Go ahead and pay more for name brand . This deal is good . Got them today and they fit and feel perfect . I will be buying more . Seller was very fast on delivery
2 #### Bought 2 balls .. 1 ball fails to keep the proper air pressure ... should have bought the Baden Elite
4 #### Looks good , but as other reviews stated , its tight across the bridge of the nose and hard to see out of .
1 #### The design on these things is horrible . This was bought for and used by a 2 year old so we 're not talking about a lot of weight . First , the circular frame is actually two half circles that are bolted together . The bolt does n't hold the circle frame flat , so it causes some legs to hit the floor while others are not . When the legs are not flat on the floor , the angled pressure cause them to bend and bending them back risks breaking them right off .
3 #### Have worn this brand of shoes for years . The new pair I just got feels very tight . Same style and size as usual we 'll see .
5 #### This is for all of u saying its 2 small because it 's supposed to be unnoticed in combat as it looks like u just have a closed fist . It about wear u place the knife on the opponents body .
3 #### the darts broke so fast that I had to buy more in less than 5 hours of use . the actual board is not bad but is not the best either . the wires are rounded so darts tend to rebound from them .
5 #### In regards to the shoes not providing good arch support ... they 're converse .. I 'm not looking for arch support , I 'm looking for flat footed squatting shoes .
5 #### Excellent product for the price . I like that it holds ammo in the handle , but do n't like that it is plastic because it may not last . But it is an excellent design and lots of fun to use . Was a good purchase .
5 #### They fit a little big but I wanted them to be big so that they last longer I love them
2 #### The shoes were great except .... I ordered a women 's 10 for my daughter .... They have their sizing mixed up , because they more like a men 's 11 . We had to return
4 #### Warm and soft as all Turtle Fur is but very snug and close fitting . If your looking for short tight turtle neck this is it . The picture looked like there was a bit of slack . At 125 lb . I have a slim neck . It also stays above collar bones , now that I 'm using it I will look for mire slack , more coverage . It 's 5 star if it was described as snug turtle neck fit . Color is dark fleece back as in picture .
5 #### Good binoculars for the price point . comes with a carrying case .
5 #### These locks are awesome . They are a high durable material that Master Locks make all their other locks out of . It fit my Ak , my SKS , and my Mosin Nagant . VERY sturdy locks . I am sure they will fit any other gun out there as well , besides a lever action . I recommend these to anyone that is broke like me and ca n't get a gun safe , or simply wants to be more secure . Accidents suck , but they are always preventable . You are not getting these bad boys off without the key or harming the firearm . They come with 6 keys that fit all 3 locks . They have a nice rubber padding inside and on the rim to protect from scratching your beauties . They are easy to slip on and off ( with the key of course ) and they are adjustable by width . There are little teeth on the bolt that ticks as you put it on , allowing you to make a very tight ( or loose ) fit on your firearm . Last but not least , the keys . The keys are little gold keys with real teeth on them just like a real key . The keys are not from a crappy material either . If you are considering buying gun locks , try these out . I am sure you 'll be happy .
5 #### Awesome . My 6 year old son lived in this raft for 8 days at the lake , last summer . We tied it to the dock , but he rowed around easily , had no problems with it deflating . We could get in it with him ( my husband or myself , one at a time ) . We left it in the lake overnight , every night , it held up well even with thunderstorms . We got it out this summer and it is still in great condition .
5 #### chuck taylors . what can I say . they have been great for decades .
4 #### I 'm not sure how to feel about these . They 're VERY tight -- I 'd go at least one size up , even after looking at the sizing chart provided . They suck me in nicely which I loved . I did n't expect the entirety of these to be THAT tight , though . It 's difficult to step into them . I am amazed at how sturdy these are , though . They have n't ripped at all ( a first , for me ) . They 're also very , very comfy and soft to the skin . I would n't say they 're heavy / too heavy for summertime ; they 'd be good for any weather , I think . Overall , these are okay . Great for the price , but I 'd recommend going up a size or two .
2 #### They are not soft , the texture is sort of roughish and it made everything orange- from face to helmet strap . Warmth was good .
4 #### Mounted on an H&R Handi Rifle 223 . Clear glass . Very nice scope .
5 #### Both of my girls love them . They fit my skinny 11 year old volley ball players . No more sore knees !
5 #### Was concerned about the quality of the costume when I got it but it looked good on and worked well for an Oz dance number . It came on time and fit as expected .
3 #### I am disappointed , as is my son too , because we ordered the size shoe he already wears and the Converse were too big . He will eventually grow into them , but it may take a few months .
5 #### True to fit . Love these pants . Very comfortable and I can tell these will be very durable . Love the button fly .
5 #### I bought this set a little over a month ago and use the bands several times a week . This is by far the best deal I have found for bands and I am totally amazed with the quality and the good assortment of bands provided with the set . Love it and really can not say enough good things about this item .
5 #### It keeps the water cool . I used it for shrimp and shiners , the bait stays cool and alive for long periods of time .
5 #### I needed a smaller wallet . This one is great . Lots of room for all my cards , do n't have to jam several cards in 1 slot . Nice leather .
5 #### I bought this bra abroad and I 'm thrilled to be able to find it again . It 's comfortable , has good lift , the two hooks is nice , at my size , padding is not needed and 2 years later I finally snapped the underwire .... Wishing for more colors .
4 #### Son wears and likes them . But has found out he ca nt stand in them for hours at his job . His feet start to hurt . Not enough ' cush ' for the foot .
5 #### The pants were a great price , very light and comfortable . Seem to be well made . I will continue buying these pants
5 #### Order by weight not pants size . I order these every other month- love the way they fit and look !
5 #### lil girl loves it , it zooms as fast as she needs and faster than what her momma likes ... nice stable platform to learn on . Got mine on a black Friday deal so paid a lil less but would 've been happy with it at full price even . No complaints , , , even went together fine .
3 #### I bought this item on June 1 to soften my experience on the hard seat of a Dahon Matrix . It works well , and far better than another competitor 's seat which failed to protect my tailbone . The problem is , after only 3 rides ( about 50 miles total ) it has already begun to wear out . The stickers and wording are already almost gone ... [ ... ] ... and the edges of the seat are already wearing out . For only $ 15 , I was not expecting miracles . But I was expecting it to last more then 3 weeks before showing significant wear .
4 #### I loved the way they felt just were way too small . I have wide feet and these shoes were just too narrow
5 #### I use these in order to keep my fishing gear separated . I decided it was time my Step father joined the 21st century and got these fro him along with a tackle bag to replace his 60 + year old tackle box . Just make sure you get the sizes that you need for your bag and for your particular fishing gear .
4 #### I love this vice . It 's light - weight , no frills , and it works well . I travel with my vise and have taken this thing all over the world and have tied over a thousand flies with it . I actually like it better than my more expensive Tiemco that I bought used for $ 200 . The heavy base ( $ 30 more ) stays home - the c - clamp comes with me . The compression bands are still going strong . I like the feature that allows me to slide the hooks up and down on the rail to line the shank up with the rotating axis , especially on hooks with a wide gape , without having to get out a screwdriver . You ca n't beat the price of this vise for the flexibility it offers . Same features as a lot of the $ 150 and up vises . AND best of all , its made in Kalispell Montana USA - got ta love a home grown business .
5 #### I 'm a 38 " pant size . I had to buy the size 42 " for them to fit properly . Inseam was right on the money . Like any Carhartt product it needs some breaking in . Very warm and came just in time to replace the starter on my wife 's Jeep .
4 #### I haver always been happy with the look and comfort of the Timex watch of this type . I have had several of them over the years and this is no exception . Easy to read dial , well lite in the dark when the button is pushed and fits comfortable around the wrist . My only complaint is setting the date and month . The date was not too bad but the month is a pain becuase it needs to be done at a certain time of the day . Since I rarely use the date and month , its no big deal but just an annoyance .
2 #### I was hoping that at 41 " it would be a substantial witches broom for use in our middle school play production . It immediately started to fall apart . We are using it as a rehearsal prop and building our own broom for performance .
5 #### perfect . i 've always been a sperry fan . HOWEVER , the idea is to test the longevity of these things , and it 's only been a month or so , so we shall see !
5 #### They looked great on her . She was so happy with them so she wears them alot now need more tho .
4 #### I am just starting and did not want to spend big bucks on a release . this worked well for me and for the price you ca n't beat it .
3 #### This is a classic shoe made of inferior materials . I wore it three times and the sole of one the shoes peeled off completely .
5 #### This is the perfect karate belt for me . It 's not so thick that you have trouble tying it . It 's lightweight and is easy to work with . It the knot stays put easily too . Great buy ! !
5 #### Love my new Chucks ! Great fit ! Order a half size smaller then you normally wear in other shoes . I ordered charcoal but they have a slight green tint to them . Still a great color ! On to my next pair !
5 #### I 've been using these to exercise and they are nice a roomy and allow my feet to breath . Also love the colors .
2 #### The shoes fell apart very fast . Not worth the money .
5 #### I am a fan of Manduka products . I keep this mat at home as it is too heavy to carry to the gym . The quality of this mat is exceptional . This mat will likely last for years to come . It cleans easily .
5 #### These things are STURDY . We always check for safety before use , and we have never had any issues with using these while working out . The bands have different strengths which is good for us because my husband is much stronger than I am so it is nice to have bands that work for us both .
5 #### Not conventional , but I bought this to use on the moving parts of a piano keyboard . Many silicone greases contain petroleum which can break down some plastics ... and I wanted the purest possible . I felt the diving community would demand the purest silicone grease and I was right ... this stuff is gold .
4 #### Actually I do n't like it anywhere near as much as my dog likes it
5 #### Fits my giant head no problem , comfortable to wear with good construction . Ca nt beat it for the money . Groves in top provide great airflow too .
5 #### This is the only helmet I 've ever owned so I have nothing to compare it to but it fits well and does the job . I took a spill hit my head on the pavement was able to get up and keep riding .
4 #### It 's a basic compass that has everything that 's needed for basic / casual orienteering . It 's easy to read , and the rounded base makes it easier to hold in - hand for those quick bearing checks . I gave one of these as a gift to a friend who them took it along on a Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness trip . It served him just fine , and has proved durable . It is a little more compact , so it fits better in my waist pack , or in my cargo pants side pocket .
5 #### it is soft and comfy . I have a skinny neck , about 40 cm . It fits just right ; tight enough to cover my neck .
1 #### After 2 weeks the metal rivets for the laces started falling off and I just had to buy a new pair because the rubber sides of the sole separated from the cloth where the foot bends . This is the only pair of Converse I 've ever purchased my son that have not lasted . I feel I could 've got just as crappy a pair of airwalks for him at Payless for this length of wear for half the price .
5 #### This is a great shirt for a variety of reasons : It 's tailored well and so is fine as a casual shirt with jeans It works as well as a backpacking shirt as a fishing one . So if you are heading for mountain lakes it is the only shirt you will need . It dries very quickly and wicks sweat effectively . If it gets too funky , throw it in a stream and put it in the sun for 20 minutes . Pockets are well made and have drip holes . Back , armpit vents actually work . As for fit . I am 6 ' 190 # and the M is roomy but not loose . So do n't buy oversize .
5 #### love this ! ! Always take this with me when I go skiing and even if it is snowing , it keeps me super warm .
5 #### Great color for those of us that are pigment challenged ... i.e. pale ! They are natural looking and do n't make me look like my feet stepped on an Oompa Loompa - that earns 5 stars in my world .
1 #### Snagged and ripped immediately after first wearing . I will not purchase them again .
5 #### Another great Rothco product . Fits great tough material stunning color .
5 #### I 've been wearing this style of Casio watches for a very long time , but my last one finally died . Since it 's about the same cost to replace the battery as it is to get a new one , I got this . It is basically the same as my last one ( one less button , but not a loss of functionality for what I need ) , so I got what I expected . It took a bit of getting used to the display of only the date ( no month ) , but if you do n't know what month it is , you probably have other issues . I also bought the LW201 - 1AV at the same time , and to be honest I like it a little better - maybe just because it 's " new and different " ? For either one , you ca n't beat the price !
1 #### It fits around wait , but around arms a bit tight and the cups are UBER pointy ! ! ! Kinda weird ! !
5 #### I learned of Keen sandals from a friend and loved the features of comfort , arch support , and using as a water shoe . My Keens are comfortable and they look nice !
1 #### Garbage . Took 5 days to deliver . Even though I used my prime account
5 #### Use these for wacky rigging and also for nose hooking small finesse and floating worms . Does the trick . Sharp points .
5 #### My daughters like it so much ! suitable for ages 5 - 11 approx . , very well built . An awesome buy !
5 #### These were perfect , kept me warm all day ! I was a little worried when I tried them on and thought they were a little long but when I put ski boots on and unzipped the unique zipper at the bottom I realized the were perfect ! Well made and fits as expected .
5 #### This item is a must during vacation . We went on a cruise to the Caribbean and carried our room key , credit card and a few bucks ! Perfect size . Waterproof .
5 #### Works great . Easy to put together . My son loves it . With in minutes of my son kicking on it the Velcro straps ripped apart so I just zip tied the net onto the frame and that has worked great . Very good deal .
5 #### Exactly what I had been looking for . Needed a Sling for a Mossberg 702 .22lr plinkster due to no swivels posts and not wanting to risk drilling in to the synthetic stock . This just loops around the barrel and butt prefect . Also my main concern was the length as I am a large gentlemen . 6 ft 280 pounds . I can carry this rifle over 1 shoulder or if I prefer put the sling over my head to the other should so it is about a 45 degree angle . I believe the description said it was 36 inches , I did n't measure it but I have no reason to . I can take up slack or extend as needed . I am certain this would work for some of my other guns that I do n't want to drill into as well and will be ordering a few more .
5 #### A powerful spotting scope at a " wo n't break the bank " price . A quality product for spotting , bird watching , star gazing , etc .
4 #### Just what i wanted , good fit and fun to wear . also helps keep me steady cause there flat in the insole and not over cushed , which is good for me .
5 #### Typical Hanes quality . Good weight , sized just right , made pretty well
5 #### Use the guide to buy the right size . If this wo n't hold your boat , nothing will . Worth every penny .
3 #### Really comfortable , but the back pocket is n't sewn down so it rolls up and down sometimes . Constant readjust with active movement , otherwise really nice . Would have purchased more , but the price doubled since last purchase . They do stretch a little after wearing , should have tried a size smaller . Ordered a X - Large and wished I had ordered a large , but drawstring helps .
5 #### My feet are a bit wide so I was worried that they would n't fit properly but they fit perfectly . I love the all black look so finding all black converse was awesome . I 've also walked for hours with them on and I have n't had any issues with pain or construction issues . I will definitely be repurchasing these once the ones I just got are worn out ( which wo n't be for a long time ) .
1 #### it is tiny , cheap and a piece of crumpled material . I would say pass for certain . No doubt . Better on market
5 #### Very happy with this gift for brother in another state . Ca n't say on fit yet . Washed them & washed perfect . Great quality .
5 #### I love these stockings . They look nice and feel great . they last pretty long before getting a run .
4 #### Very clear optics . good eye relief . I put this on my Hi - Point .40cal carbine and had it zeroed in 10 shots . The turrets have a nice positive click and it held up to the recoil very well . I plan to update this to a 5 - star review once i take it out again and confirm that it held zero .
3 #### I only gave it three stars because I thought this board came with legs . It did n't . I was disappointed .
5 #### I have donated this knife to TSA many times . Now that I am retired I think I will be able to keep it ! ! . It is large enough to do many of the daily " knife " things that a person needs and the added benefit of scissors , Orange peeler , micro - saw , tweezers , toothpick ... all are just great
5 #### For the price , this board is amazing . I have mine in my backyard and it holds up really well to the rain . Other boards like this seem to run in the 40 - 50 dollar range .
1 #### This was my fist vice and first fly I have tied ( zebra midge ) and I have to say this vice is over priced garbage . This is not rocket science it 's a vice that holds a hook , but when the vice does n't securely hold the hook and the nobs are hard to work and ruff on your hands . That makes it garbage .
5 #### This was the 2nd step in the rehabilitation of my tennis elbow .... started with red , then to green and finally to the Heavy Blue . Took about 4 weeks for the whole thing , compared with 4 months of Physical Therapy that did absolutely no good . Do yourself a favor and youtube the theraband flex bar , you 'll be glad you did !
4 #### This Coleman Two - Burner Propane Stove is very good double stove . Because the heat is generated form propane , it can get very hot and able to cook faster . This is excellent for cooking in camping settings and sometimes in our back yard for dishes that require very high heat . A small 16.4 ounce propane tank lasts a really long time we found , although , with the right adapter you can use normal large propane tanks . Also , we like to put some non - slip tape on the bottom as it can get quite slippery during use . The fit and finish is medium quality , though , unlike the ones that used to be made in USA long ago .
5 #### Bought for my Husband as a birthday gift - he loved them ! Fit great !
2 #### today 's sperry top sider is not the quality it once was . i have had sperry 's for 40 + years . i ordered the billfish boat shoe , with travel in mind . i wore them for a few weeks to break them in , couldn't do it . the heel area on one shoe had a leather bump that hurt my heel . i bought the same size as they were supposed to replace , whicked uncomfortable . i wasted 100 $ on these . the quality is not the same as previous sperry 's . these almost feel- look like ' pleather ' , not leather . what a shame . they were smaller than the previous pair . the laces were shorter than the previous also . aatn : sperry - did you find a new manufacturer ? they suck . these spetty 's are poor quality .
4 #### some times hard to focus . sturdy and can see the object that i forcused on
3 #### Was n't quite what I was looking for , but kept it rather than go thru the hassle of sending it back . Not a bad knife , and someone else may find it lovable , but it 's not for me .
2 #### I bought a large for my daughter is is on the large side of 10/12 but the larges were way too large so I had to return them for a med which are a tad bit snug . My other problem with these are they are not water resistant , first day playing out doors and my daughter is soaked when i picked her up from school . The only reason I bought these is because I thought they would keep her more dry than some cheap ones from walmart or target . I am no happy with them at all . Do they make a snow pant that will keep kids dry ? ? ? ? Look else where if you want to have a dry kid .
5 #### Great targets for a good deal . I 'll be buying more when I need to . Not much else to say . They 're IDPA targets .
5 #### I am a bit over the top and do n't like to risk guns falling over in the safe and damaging each other . These are great I use them on all my rifles they even fit my AR . Great protection with the silicone infusion . These are cheap in price but good quality for the price to protect your guns I would recommend .
5 #### Item is as described and of exacting swiss quality , the tools are all easy to access but I do wish they would lose the parcel carry hook in favor of a phillips screw driver . All in all I am very pleased with the knife , and will be looking foward to primitive camping with it very soon . Knife blades are extremely sharp as is the wood saw so watch out . The small eyeglass screwdriver should be included with all Swiss army knives that have a corkscrew but oh well , I ordered it seperate for a few bucks along with spare tweezers , toothpicks , and scissor springs .
5 #### I am happy with the wallet . My teen son needed a new wallet and it is working well for him .
5 #### This was purchased as a gift and fit the wearer well . The color happens to be the favorite of the wearer and longsleeves keep the chill off on cold winter months .
5 #### Recently purchased 2 of these air mattresses for camping . They really hold air very well . I have had them inflated for over a week and they have barely softened . The colors are beautiful .
5 #### Thee are a perfect fit in my Cuisinart toaster over . They 're a good non - stick , but i still spray them when baking .
5 #### I bought them as a early , he says they fit great and makes him feel like a kid again .
5 #### I bought this as a seat / lid for my Custom LeatherCraft 4122 61 Pocket - In & Out Bucket Pockets It is loose enough so it fits well with the tool pouch thingamajig so you can sit while working on low stuff . If the bucket had wheels it would really be great .
4 #### Perfect watch for a young girl to wear and learn how to read analog time . We especially like the indiglo lighting on the watch . Though the watchband feels cheap and probably wo n't stand up to wear and tear from a child if worn every day . But for the price it 's a great watch for our daughter .
3 #### It 's a good shoe , but very close , I should imagine that this is the model , use very little
5 #### MY NEPHEW IS THE CUTEST . These have replaced the Vans & the Pumas for the time being ! ! Only thing is laces become undone but it 's ok
4 #### I put this on my shotgun and it did work but It took me too long to get used to it so it sits in my range bag . I does move for me personally when shooting over 100 + rounds .
5 #### Wayyyyyy cheaper than getting these at the store . They work great and last a long time . I love the door attachment . Just be sure to double check that the door seal is tight , especially when attaching it to the bottom of the door . For ideas , you can always use YouTube , but these are great for anything you 'd use dumbbells for . I use them for Tabata exercises . If you do n't know what that is ... find out ! !
5 #### Great helmet ! My wife has a small head and had difficulty finding a lightweight but sturdy helmet to fit well and comfortably without looking " ridiculous " ( her words ) I doubted she would actually wear this but she does and seems to really like it . Adjustable inner liner ensures a good fit yet the air moves freely throughout to keep it cool and comfortable while riding . Great purchase , says " she "
2 #### I got this for Halloween this year BUT , item DOES NOT inflate at alla . Should had read the reviews before buying . Waste of money .
5 #### There 's not much to say . This is a standard Pelican case . This case will fit your " camera " , along with at least 3 magazines , a " shutter suppressor " , and plenty of 9 mm " film " . Would buy again .
5 #### Will have to wait until it 's colder to start wearing , but this ( J140 ) jacket was my favorite from the lineup . Classic canvas shell that feels very thick and durable . Will have to get broken in to loosen up a bit . Liner is soft flannel , does n't feel snaggy . Sleeves are nylon which is great so your shirt sleeves do n't get caught and bunch up . Overall size is what I expected , fits pretty true but is a hair baggy if anything so movement is very good . Sleeves are a hair baggy but I 'm not complaining . I like how the waist and ( mainly ) wrist cuffs are stretchy so they seal off air , but are n't tight at all .
5 #### This is a great gift . My soon to be 4 year wanted this for Christmas and after receiving it , I am highly satisfied . It is age appropriate and will grow with her . It allows for her to learn balance and stability while having fun like her older siblings ... it does not look babyish or like it is made for a younger child . It looks very fun and exciting . Nicely mad and appears very durable .
4 #### Glad to not have to torture myself in the stores looking for the same bra I like . Knowing the bra number made it so easy to purchase on Amazon , saving time and money ! Bali is the best !
5 #### Rugged as stated . Husband finds they last well as his days are very long and the work is very hard manual labor .
5 #### This watch is absolutely gorgeous ! My husband took out 3 extra links and it was perfect for me ! .. I wanted a watch to wear with gold or silver and this came up pretty handy =] I just love the light ... easy to read # s and it does n't look cheap at all yeah ! ! looks just fantastic .. I like a lot you can tell lol .
5 #### Awesome item , it does n't come with mounting bracket though . That has to be purchased separately .
4 #### I love the texture and the fit of these stockings . I order mine a size larger than the packaging advises because I do n't like the feeling of being shrink wrapped in stockings - especially at the waist . The larger size makes for a more comfortable fit but there 's no problem with them being too loose or too long . These stockings also launder and wear well .
5 #### The pants arrived as promised . I was very pleased . I measured them and they had a 28 " inseam as advertised . I was hesitant at first becsuse in the description it stated the pants had a " hammer hoop " and another tool pocket and hoop . I did not want capenter pants . I asked the question if the pants in fact had such hoops since the picture did not shop any . I never received an answer to my question so I took a chance and ordered them willing to send them back if they were in fact carpenter pants . Thankfully they arrived and were not carpenter pants . The fit is perfect for me .
5 #### I mounted this on my mark 2 , I have not zeroed my scope yet . It is important to add a drop of lock right when mounting this . Will post more after I go to the range .
4 #### So far it performs well at a reasonable price and I have n't lost a steelhead yet using it
5 #### I needed 100 % cotton and these were polyester blend so I gave them to our neighbor .
4 #### I was looking for an inexpensive watch for everyday use . And finally I found this one . Its amazing and I totally love this watch . It is very elegant design with a perfectly matched Dial and Leather Strap . It is very light on the wrist . I would recommend this watch .
5 #### Skagen is a good brand . I have one too . they are simple and very elegant . Mine is so nice but it 's hard to read since I am losing my vision .
1 #### Now , my boobs are n't particularly picky . I can wear most bras and not have a problem . But I can not understand how anyone can find this bra comfortable . First of all , it looks nothing like it does on the model . It 's bulkier and less form - fitting for sure . Just as well , the material used in this bra is really cheap . Now , I 've bought cheap bras before , but this one feels like cardboard . I understand it can be hard to find cheap , attractive bras for bigger busted women , but my experience with this one was simply terrible . It also has a huge backstrap which is n't evident in the photos . Seriously , it 's like four buckles spanning four inches . I would have liked to known that before buying it .
5 #### It is the perfect size to fit several items such as iphone , a car key , a lipgloss and earbuds . I really like the separate zippered area that is big enough to hold ID , Credit Card or Money so it wo n't fall out while retrieving your other items in the larger section . I had a more compact waist pack but switched to this one because it had two compartments and I also use it on outings with the kids . I have my essentials and do n't need a handbag . It is still small enough that most of the time it goes unnoticed .
5 #### Best hooks on the market for bank poles , trot lines , and your rod and reel . Not much more to say , they stay sharp for a long time .
5 #### Really rugged , does what it 's supposed to do . Very nice piece to have when using your Dutch Oven ... should last a good long time .
1 #### the picture implies that there is a devise to hang it on . Looks like false advertising to me .
5 #### This is a bag -- not a pair of shoes . I am very happy with it .
5 #### Love chucks ! ! I wear these all the time . Great all purpose you . Awesome gym lifting shoe , great on the Harley , perfect for going out on the town
5 #### I love to take these on field exercises in the Army . Perfect for staying warm at 2 am on guard duty . I bought the 40 pack so I can use 10 and the rest to barter with ; when they are this cheap , why not ?
5 #### I had been suffering from Tennis Elbow for nearly a year but at first I would hardly notice it , I could just ignore it and that was it , nearly 5 months ago I started taking swimming lessons and shortly after I started feeling it more and more , until it felt really bad , could n't even straighten my arm in a natural relaxed way . So , I decided to look for exercises on the interweb computer and there you have it that using a bar made of a flexible material provides what seems to be the most effective exercise to treat tennis elbow ... After some research I decided I would get this one , being a fairly strong guy I went for the blue one and if it felt too hard I 'd keep it and get the medium one . I have done the tennis elbow exercise as recommended , 3 sets of 15 reps daily for only 2 days .... I really hate to sound like a victim of a placebo effect but although I can still feel my tennis elbow condition there , it 's not bothering me anymore . I plan to keep on using this bar and hope to see the problem go away and will update this review .
5 #### Looked everywhere for wide width on these shoes . They 're kinda expensive but I was so tired of looking for them in wide width I do n't even care . Husband needed these , he has severe foot problems and these are the only outdoor shoes that work for him . We tried others but they fall apart or lose their shape and support easily . These shoes last for years . So happy to have found them here .
4 #### Overall I 'm happy with this shirt . I 'm a big guy and was nervous based on others comments , but I 'm happy with purchase
3 #### I had a hard time finding these for a mission project for our CBFVA mission project for Haiti . We are thank full we found them although they seemed a little expensive . They finished our Baby Care Package . W did not use the item ourselves . !
2 #### I bought these in the same size , style and color as the Wranglers that I buy at my local Sears store , and these were cut at least 2 sizes smaller than I needed , and this was right out of the package . Knowing how they can shrink after the first wash , these would have easily ended up sized more like a 32 . Thankfully , returns through Amazon are painless .
5 #### My husband uses this so my 12 year old son and his teammates do n't take his head off or maim him in any way . It does n't weigh too much and it is fairly transportable .
4 #### Works great in my EDC bag . The only thing I do n't like is the pliers can fold if your not careful when your using it .
5 #### good fit . good price . Runs a bit large as to what I normally wear . I am about a 38 - 40 inch waist and the " Large " fits perfectly . The XL was too big . I wear mine twice weekly for golf .
5 #### Just fine as an entry - level singlet . All my buddies at the gym were pushing me to get a pricier , flashier singlet . Well , needless to say , my weightlifting skill is definitely not at the level of " flashy " yet , so I opted for enough singlet to get me into competitions without breaking the bank . Sizing as listed in the title is perfectly comfortable . For the price , it 's a great choice for a beginner .
1 #### My son just turn 5 . This 4 - 6 size is 2 inches too short for the pants . There is no tail too . People have been complain in the size since 2009 , WHY can your company correct the sizing problem ? This one piece suit should be 3 - 4 , not 4 - 6 years old ! Please correct the sizing mistake !
5 #### These shoes are definitely worth the money ! I did n't even get a chance to break them in and I got through dance practice with them and had no issues . I usually wear a woman 's size 7 and I got the size Big Kids 5.5 ; great way to save money by just using conversions !
5 #### This pair fits perfect ..... the first pair was wrong size in the right box ..... definitely order again ! ! ! ! !
3 #### Really like this lure but noticed that some of the paint has come off already . Guess I bumped it on the rocky bottom a time or two .
5 #### being a big guy 6'5 290 with wide shoulders shirts can be hard to come by atleast good fitting ones , carhartt shirts are awesome they fit great with plenty of room for shoulders . will buy many more .
5 #### Most comfortable training shoes I 've worn in a long time .
5 #### It 's a black , vinyl disc cover . Includes a shoulder strap , and built in carry handle(with clear tube over it ) . Carried two discs easily , will carry more but it gets prett tight .
5 #### Love these shoes ! Runs big ! ! I wear a 8 usually and ordered an 8 in these and really should have got a 7 .
4 #### I like this thermal top - it 's really thin and light , but warm and feels nice against my skin . It has a delicate pattern knitted into the fabric , subtle , but gives it a little ' fancy ' up close . The shirt makes a nice under layer , warm without being bulky , and pretty enough that it 's okay if the arms stick out under a t - shirt . The quality seems good , no manufacturing defects that I could see , with nice straight seams and no loose threads . I 'm not sure yet how it will hold up to multiple washings because it 's still pretty new . The fit is as basically expected . I ordered my usual size and it 's a close fit without being tight or confining . My one complaint is that it 's a little short ; when I tuck it into jeans , it immediately un - tucks itself the first time I bend or sit . Another 2 or 3 inches at the bottom would 've made it a 5 star shirt .
5 #### It was fine , excellent shoes . They were exactly what we saw on the pictures and we like them of course .
5 #### OMG ! These are awesome . We are going to visit Lady Liberty and these will be a hit . Great find .
2 #### Got these for my husband as he was looking to get a new ear protection for the range ... had lots of good and bad reviews but like most things its best to test it yourself . First impression WOW very compact and super sturdy ... instructions were a bit iffy on the battery needed . they could specify its needs AAA battery but other than that its great . Tested it out real fast in the garage banging a hammer against metal and it was great . Tested speech which had no problems at all . Highly would recommend this to anyone . Now the bad parts . Took them to an indoor range wearing them outside the shooting area sounded great , walked in and hear a BANG from a 9 mm was like umm ok . Kept walking towards the lane and hear another .40cal go off had ringing in my ears . Right away I got out went grabbing regular nr25 slim protectors and it was a major difference . You must wear additional ear plugs using this at least for indoor range or anything powerful . Also no light for on and off light . Buy something else . Only reason it got 2stars for quality of build .
5 #### Really good quality , heavy pans that fit our counter top oven perfectly . Just the right size for meals for two people .
4 #### I use this product on all my scuba - related o - rings and it does a good job overall . Tank rings , regulators , camera housings and , in fact , I even apply it to my mustache so that my mask forms a good seal without my having to shave the upper part away like other divers do . One major caution ! ... this product will cause a damaging chemical reaction to Sea & Sea o - rings ( must use ONLY Sea & Sea grease with their products ) .
5 #### Great shoes , perfect fit and look good ... fast break - in . I can recommend and would absolutely but these shoes again . Thanks Sperry !
4 #### If you want a nice basic everyday watch , you ca n't go wrong with this Timex . Nice profile and easy read .
5 #### great . I had a hip replacement . So this helps with daily stretch prior to my Jiu Jitsu workout
5 #### The kids are so happy that i was able to snag one for them with A discount you made them so happy thankyou for the Hockey goal
5 #### Like it but the face could have been a little larger
1 #### could n't get chubby feet into , the front toe box is too short ( sole to top ) .
5 #### I had my first pair of Converse All - stars in high school in the early 1960 's . That was before they were known as " Chucks . " They were , and still are , the best basketball sneakers around . They 're good for everyday workouts and just hanging around the house . Comfortable , inexpensive and they last just about forever .
3 #### Purchased hawk call to help locate Turkey for upcomming spring hunt . It is a decent call , you will have to practice to be good . I also purchased a Flambeau MAD series Hawk call for the same reason , which is alot better and does not require much practice , if any .
5 #### Too cute and easy to wear to trick or treat . Great because clothes fit under easily . My daughter turned 3 on Halloween and she 's true to her size . She will not get another year out of this . It runs small
5 #### Light but still nice and stiff , has been very durable
4 #### This wallet was exactly what I was looking for except I wish it was a bit larger . I can not use all the features of it since it impossible to fit cards in slots and also fit cards in slots opposite those . If it were larger and would accommodate all of it 's features , I 'd be buying many more of these as gifts and one for myself .
4 #### This is a great little set for toddlers and preschoolers learning to play either street or indoor hockey . If you 're using it indoors , make sure you put them in a room without breakables , since even though it 's padded , those little ones can pack a powerful punch ! There 's a matching net that 's sold separately , too .
5 #### The item arrived on time and as stated . These pants are very durable . Wash well and my husband goes through a pair monthly . Thanks
1 #### The description for this sneaker clearly shows- Size : US Men 's 6 = US Women 's 8 . That 's the size I was looking for but when it arrived it turned out to be a Men 's 4 . I shipped it all the way to the Caribbean and by the time it arrived it was too late to return it .
5 #### I put them on an ATI Titan Extreme . They look , feel , and shoot good .
3 #### It is fine , just like I expected it to be . Other old Carhartt tees still are used by me though they were a little heavier material . I can only hope this will wear as well .
5 #### Can never have too many forms of fuel to help with that campfire . Nice fit for the bug out bag .
5 #### Thanks to the good folks here giving us a heads up on sizing . I got 1/2 size smaller than usual and if my feet were n't so wide I could have actually gone one full size smaller . They fit , look and me make me feel so good that I ca n't wait to wear " em . Mine are made in Vietnam amd look sturdy and well made .
4 #### I 'm a little over 6'5 " , about 190 pounds . The 34 X 36 jeans fit me well , though they ride a little higher at the waist than I prefer ( higher than most Levi 's ) . The quality and color of the jeans is good though and I 'm overall pretty happy with them .
5 #### I love these things . The local YMCA uses this type when teaching kids how to swim and you remove one square at a time as the kid gets better at swimming , eventually learning to swim with none of the squares . A Good buy .
5 #### Always happy with my Converse ! Size and color were perfect . Thanks !
5 #### Bought this for my husband as a Christmas present and he loves it ! Great men 's watch for a great price !
4 #### Well made holster . I actually bought this one for my N framed S&W M&P trr8 .357 . Good leather , and fits tight to my body . Would have given it a 5star but I really wanted a thumb strap for the hammer .
1 #### This costume was just awful . It is not true to size , and that 's an understatement . I purchased it for my son , who wears a size 5 and this was at least 3 sizes smaller . Unfortunately , I blindly trusted that the advertisement was accurate and did n't open until Halloween Day , when he had a class party . Had to run out and purchase an emergency replacement ! Never again . Super disappointed . Also of note is the fact that the sleeves were not compatible with the rest of the costume - way too short , even had it been the correct size .
4 #### This is a good product . The resistance is good , and it works if you put it on the top of a door . The only problem I have with it is that if you try to close it in on the side of the door , the door wo n't close and you ca n't use it . So if you wanted to use this for horizontal abduction and adduction arm exercises , you probably wo n't be able to unless you have someone to hold it for you .
5 #### Versatile cigar holder for sitting on the patio , driving the side by side , etc .
1 #### The date does not stay put . It keeps changing . Very annoying , my husband always has to ask the correct date and keep resetting it .
4 #### Well made , fit as expected . Holds up well for work . easy care .
5 #### When I first tried these on I was worried as they were a little snug . After wearing them a few times they stretch and mold to your feet which is great . I wore these all over Disney World ( 10 miles a day ) and did n't get blisters . They are great on rainy days as they have good grip and dry quickly . I will be getting more !
5 #### These shoes are extremely comfortable , and fit as expected . Will purchase again .
4 #### Need more power ! This thing is great just used it over the weekend at Camp Pendleton . Good is it puts out a lot of even heat . A lot ! Bad is you need a whole bottle of gas for a weekend . Good , it had two burners and you can put a griddle across the two burners and make pancakes , sausages , scrambled eggs , etc . I found that the distance from the burner to windblock was insufficient for my 8 " cast iron skillet to sit centered on the burner . The wind locks in back and on sides work great . Also , after first use it will show signs of use as in heat discoloration on grill and burners . It does n't have a handle so you will have to carry it with two hands or under your armpit or in a beach buggy . Yes I would buy it again and yes I would recommend this product .
2 #### I like everything about these shorts , except the top button from the fly came off after second or third wash . Decent quality & it looks great otherwise .
5 #### Great buy they are all I wear ! Long lasting in the wash and are very good quality !
5 #### I did n't buy the Mini on Amazon that I carry a lot .... I bought it used and could n't be happier with it . It 's an older model with black handles , satin finish , and serrated blade . I have a lot of high end knives .... Spyderco , Emerson , and Benchmade .... and a few customs .... but the Mini Grip just KEEP knocking them out of my pocket . I have a Leatherman with me always ... but the Mini Grip has " something " about it that I just ca n't quantify .... but that 's why it 's so darn popular and has been for eons . Honestly I 'd love to carry my Spydie Military more ... but whipping out a 9 inch folder in the suit / tie environment I work in ... well , that 's not too cool . The size of the mini - grip does n't set off alarm bells .... it 's almost the same reaction as when I use my Swiss Army Cadet in the company kitchen for lunch or something .... no one seems too ruffled by it . I ca n't speak to the new ones ... but mine is BUTTERY SMOOTH - of course it 's a decade old now . I called Benchmade to ask how to buy a black deep pocket clip ... they told they would send me 2 FREE ! One for this one - and one for my 530 ( awesome blade / super thin / too scary for my work environment . I even put a Benchmade decal on my window of my jeep - right by the Glock and Leatherman decals ! lol !
4 #### Bought for Christmas for my dad to put on his new 2017 Jeep Wrangler . The tire size was the standard Jeep size and it fit fine . It is a little wrinkled in the beginning , but that has finally started to iron itself out . Quality is pretty good . Hard to find anything like this anywhere else and you ca n't beat 2 day shipping .
3 #### Very low cut heel so if you training and pushing sleds - I ran right out of shoes ! Although the traction on toe and heel are great
3 #### Shoes are as expected overall , however ... The converse all star logo is in the wrong spot on each shoe . Otherwise happy with the purchase .
5 #### This is the third Smith and Wesson knife I 've purchased over the years . I love all 3 of them and the HRT Boot Knife may be the best of the lot . This is a solid well made knife . Excellent balance and heft . It was also sharp as a razor coming out of the box . A few passes on my black sharpening stone and it is even sharper . I like the Tanto style blades and this one really impressed me . This is a good $ 30-$35 knife . For $ 14 and change on Amazon it is a bargain .
5 #### I purchased this singlet for a powerlifting meet . I am 5 ' 8 " tall and when I tried on the singlet I weighed 172 lbs . It was snug , but not tight . The material is lycra ( think bike shorts ... shiny stretchy ) so I think i could still fit into it even if I gained another 20 lbs , but it would likely not be very comfortable . It 's well made . stitched together nicely , and .thank goodness not see thru . I 'll use it may 30th ... so I 'll update it then . Update : it was fine for the powerlifting meet . can be a little revealing ( bulge ) it was a little snugin the thighs and crotch for deadlift .. good quality would buy again
5 #### It 's made in America Carhartt , tough as nails , keeps you warm without having to worry about it getting damaged .
4 #### My kids and neighbor kids have really enjoyed this . Seems pretty decent so far . The top bar did bend when a kid grab a hold of it but it really is n't made well enough for that . Overall I am pleased . We do n't have it anchored in the ground and they where kicking pretty hard goals 9 - 14 yr old boys and it was n't moving .
2 #### Excellent watch . My last one went for years . I like the look but the one I just bought from Amazon stopped the second week . The hassle of returning it does not appeal to me so I took it to a jeweler and had the battery replaced .
3 #### There very long and pretty stiff . wo n't be buying another pair . when there just over your waist the bottom is way below my knees . i m 5'10 and wear size 32x30 jeans .
5 #### Yep ! It 's a bus . It distributes electricity . I used it to reduce the number of plugs required to power my entertainment system . I ran one plug wire from the bus to the power strip . I then ran power to my Wii , my Video Disc player , My Xbox 360 , my 10 port USB power hub , and my laser disk player . I do n't have to worry about too many amps because these are lower power and not often used simultaneously . For the devices that require a power block I simply cut the plug off the cord and wired that in on the wall side of the power block . I also purchased the bus block cover for a little added safety
5 #### I have not used these yet , but as reported by others , these are the best money can buy . They burn completely and only leave an ash . Other sources of this type fuel may leave you with a mess .
5 #### This is our second time buying this brand of tee shirts . Fits well , good quality my husband likes the fit . We will be purchasing again .
1 #### Not happy with this 6 lb line . It seems the line was old . It is brittle and breaks easily . Lost a fish on my second cast . Immediately stop using and off the solo it goes .
5 #### My son still wears this outfit a month after Halloween and he wore it to Disney on ice .
4 #### you do have to hit the fly against a solid surface -- against fabric upholstry , the fly will not die with this device .
3 #### Non - Stick ? I do n't think so . I 'm afraid to scrub the stuff that 's on there because of it being coated . Also , after first use , each surface has a yellowing to it .
5 #### This is my first pontoon . I bought two of these for my dad and I when we fish . The assembly is very easy and the strength of the frame is stronger then i expected . the bladders pump up very quickly but the valve system is a little bit frustrating . A hi - output hand pump fills the bladder without having to open the valve but takes too long and a electric pump does n't even fill the bladder unless you open the valve manually . So the solution is to use the electric pump to fill and then use the hand pump to top off . If you use a trolling motor in the back , the weight of the motor and battery causes the back to sink into water . A front trolling mount is highly recommended . In all this pontoon is a very good option for the money especially when amazon gives you a 10 % coupon . The listed price was $ 350 + tax but I only paid $ 343 with tax included thanks to the coupon !
4 #### I always order a 1/2 size larger because they do not make an extra wide . They fit well and last a good long time - Once the non skid wears down and I can not use them on the boat , they are great for the gardens .
5 #### This hat is made as well as any military surplus . It runs a bit tight though , maybe order a size up so you can wash it .
5 #### My dad loves these , so I got him a pair for Christmas . Exactly what he wanted ! Pretty , pretty , pretty good shoes .
5 #### Comfortable for all - day wear IF you 're not walking around . If you live in an area where you walk rather than drive , you may want better walking shoes . I love them , though . I get a lot of compliments .
5 #### Lost the other one somehow had to order a replacement , works well just like the original . Would n't count on too much security since there is much of the pin visible to cut .
5 #### This goal was easy to set up . My wife and I put it together but it can easily be done with one person . Attaching the net probably took the most time . It comes with Velcro but you can use just about anything including zip ties . The bars are lightweight yet still fairly solid . I do n't have the net staked down and its holding up fine against hard shots . The construction appears solid but time will tell with how it holds up against the elements .
4 #### It 's good for the price . I think it runs a little small for adults but it 's fine
5 #### Recipient very happy with the shoes and they fit perfectly .
5 #### Bought as a gift for my 6 year old and she loved it ! She is just learning to tell time and the light up feature is great . Colorful and style will be suitable for her as she gets older as well !
5 #### Steel balls to shoot from slingshot , not much more to say , they work .
5 #### This tool does its job well . If you are reloading you will need to resize your brass . It works as advertised , stem seats into primmer hole and stops cutting action before the case is cut too short .
5 #### My favorite costume purchase . This costume is extremely well made . Very sturdy with metal clips . Very life like in my opinion . Well worth the money . My son loves this costume ! The little suspenders under the jacket are extremely cute as well .
5 #### i love this costume . its fits my.daughter perfectly i was so worried that it would n't . she s actually going to wear this for her birthday party since its minnie mouse themed as well for Halloween . it was made perfectly i did n't have to deal with any rips or anything . i highly recommend this .
5 #### I was surprised at how good the sweet and sour pork turned out to be ! ! ! At first I was not going to order because it did not sound good but my hubby wanted it . Now after trying it , I would definitely buy again ! ! !
5 #### Got this for my 3 year old . She loves it . What I love about it is it 's stretchy and she can take it on and off herself . She wears it all the time . If she was learning to tell time , I could see it being a little small in the face .
4 #### This knife was purchased as a replacement for a SD knife which was confiscated by tsa personnel I believe it is an upgrade although I do wish they could have figured out a way to incorporate a toothpick
5 #### This shoe does exactly what it is supposed to do ! If you have a pronation , this shoe helps keep your foot from turning in . It is very lightweight and comfortable . I was n't sure about the color when I ordered it , but it really looks nice . The purple in the shoe is n't a bright shade of purple and compliments the silver very well . I would recommend this shoe !
5 #### Who ever made these should be hugged , I love these . Received them as promised and I used them this weekend with some rough water at the dock . Man they worked great .
5 #### WRANGLER MAKES A GOOD JEAN AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO SPEND A FORTUNE FOR A GOOD LOOKING PAIR OF JEANS . VERY DURABLE . I HAVE HAD THESE JEANS FOR YEARS , AND I HAVE TO SAY THEY LAST AND LAST . I WEAR MY JEANS EVERY DAY FOR WORK AND PLAY AND THEY ARE TOUGH AS NAILS ...
1 #### The last belt pack I had lasted 15 years . I got this a month ago , I have about 15 runs on it and the seams are already splitting and coming apart . Poor quality from a brand I thought was good
5 #### Got the medium and it fits great and is comfortable . The logo is fine .
4 #### Satisfied with this product ... even though my husband and I never got around to " installing it . " We still use it to clean our shoes , but you need to bolt it onto something to hold it in place .
5 #### Nice heavy coat seems very durable nice pockets inside and out .
5 #### This is the most I 'll probably ever spend on a pocket knife , and I 'm glad I did . It 's very strong and very sharp - very well built . The opening and closing mechanism has a nice accurate feel . The color is nice - designates it as a tool , not a weapon . It 's something I can easily carry around and use without it appearing threatening .
5 #### FIT IS PERFECT . GREAT ARCH SUPPORT AND COMFORT . ELASTIC TIES ALLOW EASY ADJUSTMENT AND EXPAND IF FEET SWELL . LOVED THEM FROM THE FIRST MOMENT I SLIPPED THEM ON . I have had them for a couple of months now , and still love them !
5 #### I love my converse all stars they 're comfortable and easy to co - ordinate with my clothes I 'm hoping to get other colors
5 #### VERY GOOD ITEM , IF YOU ARE A MLB FAN , OF ANY BASEBALL TEAM OF MLB , YOU HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK OF THE SEVERAL OBJECTS THAT LUISVILLE OFFER
4 #### Love these , but they 're too narrow across the toe box for me . I 've worn my size 6 leather Teva sandals for 14 years in water , on trails , to work ... you name it , and I guess my feet have spread out too much for Keens . Makes me sad , since I love the look of these Keens .
5 #### This product was perfect . I 'm a women 's 8 so I ordered a 6 since these are men 's sizes . They fit perfectly !
5 #### Love my new Nike 's . It 's been years since I 've been able to wear them ( sizing changed years ago and I just could n't wear them any more ) but now the new styles and sizing are perfect . Lightweight shoe with tons of style . The Fog color is just what I was looking for ... not black and not neon ! I wore them to participate in Relay for Life ( 24 hour walk ) and they held up great !
5 #### I use this in my locker at work by bending the arm and hooking to the door vent . I had one for 13 years when I accidentally broke it . Thank you for still making the exact same one ! ! I hope to have it until I retire !
4 #### I use this to work out knotted muscles in my back , and this works really well . I put this ball between my back and a wall , and lean into it . The ball is just the right texture and firmness to make this work well , and though a knotted muscled may hurt , and working it out with this ball may not be a delight either , the result is surprisingly effective . I think the bigger challenge in my world is to keep this ball out of the mouth of one of the dogs ...
5 #### If you know Justin quality you know these are excellent boots . These boots are very comfortable and are highly recommended .
5 #### Nice shoe , comfortable , no break in needed . material does not stain . Have previously worn this shoe , they wear well and last a long time . They are water resistant and can be worn in rain & snow . That 's what I like about them .
5 #### These shirts are very comfortable and well made . They are very light weight and great to wear in the sun . I have several different colors and would recommend these shirts very highly .
5 #### This tall brand is a life saver to keep my man who stands at 6'8 dressed well and spices him up with color !
5 #### These knee pads work perfectly for various ages of children , up through teens . We do n't use elbow pads , so what we do is use the elbow pads for the youngest children 's knees . Works great ! My children all say they are comfortable , and you ca n't beat the price ! No need to look further .
4 #### This bar is sturdy and really easy to install when you want to use it . However , I do take issue with the stated weight capacity . While I have no doubt the bar itself can support 350 lbs , it relies on door moulding for support and I do n't trust the meager moulding around our doors . Also , at 6'-2 " , I found that I really had to tuck my legs way up just to be able to use the bar . Our interior doorways look to be appx . 6'-6 " tall , so you might have better luck if your doorways are taller . Overall , the product is good but the flimsy moulding and low opening of my doorways make it difficult for me to use . It works great for my wife ( who is both shorter and lighter ) .
5 #### My husband loves these shoes ; he buys a new pair when the old one wears out . Sometimes I have to nudge him that it 's time for a new pair !
5 #### These fit a bit tight , but not too much . With a good coat of polish , these make very nice dress boots . I 've been wearing them daily for several months and they 're very comfortable .
3 #### Generally a fan of Hogue grips , I bought this for my personal carry piece - a Kimber Ultra Carry II . Not a thing wrong with the checked rubber grips that came stock , just wanted to give Hogue a try . The product is at a price - point that makes it possible to do this . I found nothing tricky about installation of the grips onto my gun although they will not accommodate a " quick - draw clip " for holster - less carry . So do n't buy this if you prefer to carry in that manner . The rubber is a little stickier than the stock rubber used , which may be a byproduct of being new . This feels ' grabby ' on clothing when carrying . I suspect this gradually reduce as the grip breaks in . I have regular American male - size hands , wear large gloves and the gun feels much different in my hand . My hand positioning when shooting is slightly different . I 'm on the fence to be honest and considering returning to the stock grips .
4 #### This does just what it says it will do . It stores two carry bags well . It 's angled back to keep the clubs from spilling out , and the feet are easily adjustable . I will 100 % agree with the people who say that you should have two people put this together . It would really be unruly for one person to do it . Also , the instructions are TERRIBLE . You ca n't tell anything from the pictures . You will screw in a plate incorrectly unless you are an amazingly lucky guesser .
2 #### I order a size well in the middle of the chart 5'3 150 pounds and legs and stomach were too tight and tore when placed on
5 #### These are great . I ordered them a little bigger , I normally take an 11 1/2 . Happy with them
4 #### Works very well on my 70 lb bag . Makes some noise as the bag bounces around , but I can see where it will extend the life of the bag greatly . The only thing I wish was different was that the ends were open a little bit more to keep from having to use snap links on the chain , but that s really no big deal .
4 #### ordered 2 of these for my savage mk II and they fit great , did not come with mounting instructions but that s pretty straight forward .
5 #### Worked perfect for my young son 's bike . Easy to install and adjust to appropriate length .
5 #### Very comfortable , i have a pretty standard size and this works great ! I have worn this for hours and never had a problem ! Will keep this for life ! I have tried several masks from the small paper ones that do n't work very well to expensive masks and this is by far my favorite !
5 #### All set for next year 's pool season . This is my new rolling bar for the pool . Nice size , well insulated , workhorse for carting my gear from the house down the street to the pool . Already tried it a few times . I live in the desert in the middle east and the heat in the summer hit around 115 degrees . So I needed a reliable cooler and this fits the bill . Also with the internal tray I can keep my electronics off the ice but cool enough to keep them working in the heat . The tray hold my mobile phone , ipod , Mifi and Kindle . Only the blue tooth speaker is in the heat ... so far that is not an issue . Plenty of room for hauling the adult beverages ... a party on wheels
5 #### Classic style that is both comfortable and very stylish with cuffed jeans . Love the gray color !
5 #### It works real good . It 's fun when it actually comes back to you .
3 #### Runs smaller than described . Be aware of this if you have a big head . Other than that , it is a good quality product .
5 #### Sperry , the very best , bought my dad these bad boys probably for five years straight now .
5 #### My second pair , love the fit , light weight and great support .
4 #### These do n't have that " Carhart feel " so much as they feel like regular jeans , heavy duty ones , but still just regular ole ' denim . Also they are dungarees so they are meant to go over your hips , to your waist .
3 #### Yellow is more like the color its like a pale yellow , not so much natural white . I love my cons so i wo n't send them back , however I still feel like i want my dirty whites . One i need i suppose is more like an eggshell . Thanks
5 #### We had this bolted to our cement steps outside our back door for almost 10 years before we had to replace the bristles . That 's pretty good for a climate that gets high humidity , beaming sun , negative temperatures and snow . Very well made product . The bristle did n't seem to damage dress shoes either .
4 #### Needed some short cues due to the size of the room our pool table is in . Great value . Not perfectly straight , but good enough for our our level of play .
5 #### I ordered small and they fit perfectly . However after several hours they tend to become baggy . I do n't mind it and they get back to original size after a wash . I very much like them and was not certain I would . I wear them to sit at the desk and work from home , walk the dog , lounge around . Happy with the purchase and bought two colors .
5 #### When basketballer Charles " Chuck " Taylor walked into the Converse company back in 1921 complaining of sore feet , he started a revolution . He designed a shoe that was to bear his name only two years later . It would go on to be THE most popular sneaker of all time . Over 500 million pairs have been sold worldwide . The popularity of these legendary shoes has gone in waves but people have always come back to Chucks throughout the past 80 years ! And some people , like myself , just ca n't get enough of them , and go on to build a collection of these wonderful sneakers . Nowadays I only wear Chucks , no other sneaker graces my feet . They are so comfortable and good looking , and take it from me , they boost your self - esteem ! Walk down the street in them and you feel ten feet tall . Sounds corny , but it 's true . They 're like a security blanket around your ankles . I absolutely love Chucks and wo n't ever stop wearing them . Do yourself a favour , buy a pair . Then see how long till you get another and another .
4 #### Razor makes a decent product , but we go through these pretty fast still . As soon as the kids start jumping and doing tricks , these things start to wear out pretty fast .
5 #### The school kids love them and they were everything we expected
4 #### Somewhat large compared to other Columbia shirts I have . The material seems denser that the other Columbia PFG fishing shirts , not the fast dry / cooling material used . I now use this shirt around the house or daily wear , and keep the other , lighter PFG shirts for fishing .
5 #### This product is dirt cheap but it has lasted many uses these last few months and has good support . I still expect it to spring a leak someday but it has not happened yet . For indoor use this product is perfect and the price is right . It is noisy to inflate and turn on when you move but the price is right . This unit is the perfect solution for expandable sleeping equipment .
5 #### It has really helped me out in learning the art of flyfishing knots
3 #### I like the looks but it 's a very heavy feeling watch that has a date that would take me forever to get to the 20th by turning the hand all those times from the 4th ... it says quick set for the date but I did n't find instructions on how to quick set it . Should have a barcode to scan to get a video or something if there really is a quick way to do it . Additionally , I have a larger size wrist ( 7.5 or 8) and it was HUGE . I would have to remove a lot of the links and I 'm not sure how I 'm expected to do that with no tool or instructions . I could take it to a jeweler but the benefit of ordering online is to not have to go to a store , so that defeats the purpose . Because of all of that , I have to send it back . It 's not the watch itself that is a problem , but the set up . I will just buy it in the store if I 'm going to have to take it to a store anyway .
5 #### Better control than my shapewear ... I cut these up to the thighs and wear them under my bodycon dresses and skirts .... amazing ! ! ! No panty lines and tucks my tummy in better than any shapewear I 've ever owned
4 #### Good school uniform shoes , safe and durable . Last year 's pair lasted for one year . This pair probably will hold up , good also for PE .
5 #### Ordered to be a Christmas present ... so my son has n't gotten them yet . But they are so cool looking . The price was AWESOME , and they shipped FAST ! I ca n't wait till Christmas to give these to him ! ! !
1 #### I needed this for one specific event . You clearly get what you pay for as it is pretty cheaply made . My main complaint is that the top would not stay open . When trying to fill it or empty it , the top kept closing .
5 #### Was what it said , seems to help . Time will tell .
4 #### This is an optic bore sighter , that will set a standard rifle and scope to 100 yards at the kitchen table . I did not have a range available with a 100 yd distance , Nor one right now with 25 yards , so I needed something that would work optically , rather than laser . The sighter has a crystalline glass plate with a 100 yard set target alignment etched into it . It will work for a rifle with a scope rise of 1.5 inches which does limit it . Measurement is from center of scope to enter of bore . It will not work for ARs or AKs or any rifle that has a scope more than 1.5 inches above the bore , which greatly limits it . Could be improved it it had a way of using it with elevated scopes . Designed primarily for standard rifle and scope sets .
5 #### I love Converse . They are one of my favorite shoes . I have narrow feet and they fit my feet the best . These are the same as any I 've gotten any where else . Thanks !
5 #### These are great targets - I have n't shot at a single one . In fact - I would n't buy these again but , not because they are n't great . I just do n't shoot enough to purchase 50 targets . What I did use them for was xmas wrapping paper !
5 #### Tremendous deal .... where else could you get a genuine pair of Chuck 's for under $ 20 ....
5 #### Absolutely love these really cute boots . Bought them as a gift for a friend 's son for Xmas and they look awesome . Sizing was perfect and the price was good as well .
5 #### It is a very good pant , comfortable and warm . I am very happy with it . Bought L size for my 12 year old son and it was perfect !
5 #### I got the 14,640 yd spool and used it for surf perch and it did good I ended up catching 3 perch and 9 other fish
5 #### Chucks run a half size large . I knew that and ordered a half size down and they fit perfectly . These shoes last for years . I keep buying more colors and have yet to replace a pair due to wear .
4 #### This ammo is of good quality , although the larger size is more efficient for hunting squirl or rabbit , but overall ok .
1 #### This was a waste of money . The mattress inflated partially and fused together . Cheaply made ,
4 #### Bought for a 16 year old granddaughter who wears a size 9 women 's ; so got a 7 men 's . Would have been better to get a 6 1/2 if they made them but find that converse have very little 1/2 sizes . They run big which everyone knows ! But She loves this pair and wants more . Like everything bought online - look for sales and but this product when on sale or clearance .
1 #### first the real product different from what the picture shows secondly , when wearing it , it is very uncomfortable , I ca n't stand a second so return it immediately
5 #### We use these to extend the multi - target sheets we have . It makes it much quicker when at the range to put the stickers on and not have to replace the whole target sheet .. especially when it may not be all shot up yet . The extra little dots are nice to cover up any shots that were outside the center rings ( not that that happens with me .. lol ) . We are very happy with the ease of the stickers and that they stick even when in the 30 's .
5 #### This is one of my most prized lures . Years ago when they first came out I bought 3 of them before my trip to Canada . Of all the colors of rattle traps this one ruled the water . I caught fish on nearly every cast . Smallie 's , pike , musky , and even some walleye . I Illinois they work well on Bass and even crappie . Try and let them drop to the thermo - plane before you crank them in .
5 #### replaced old ones , these are better with the buckle guard
5 #### My son looks so cute in these . We all know Converse give no arch support , and who cares ? He 's 9 months , he 's not walking anywhere .
3 #### love these . have had the best luck with the white / pink tails
2 #### I bought the pan set for the Panasonic Flash Xpress Toaster Oven . First of all , the muffin pan does not fit in the oven even though Amazon put it together . Also , the flat pan barely fit in the oven . The pan warped and I threw it away . I think I still have the cake pan .
5 #### I bought this for my wife 's Jeep Wrangler which has 31 X 10.50 tires on it(including the spare ) . This rack will not accomodate a larger than factory tire . It is made well enough where you can simply cut the mount and weld in an extension piece . It is very secure and she has hit it a few times - no damage to the rack . NICE RACK !
5 #### My son is a long distance truck driver and had only ONE pair of these fabulous work shorts and wanted more . He loves that he can stash his cell phone easily in pockets and the incredible quality ! ! ! Super well made and perfect for work shorts . Bought the LONG pants as well . Excellent quality fabric and construction that stands up to harsh washings and constant wear !
2 #### Started out with a 5 star . I bought this for my daughter due to the look with the tassels . They just fall out . In fact , one side is completely gone . Very poor construction on this feature . Might as well bought one without them as now my daughter is sad !
5 #### As a boater we spend a large amount of time at our home port marina . While we have a stove on the boat I am hesitant to use it because the cooking smells linger inside the boat and I prefer cooking outside in the picnic area . Fresh crabs and corn on the cob are standard fare . I was looking for something that would hold two large pots , would heat evenly and cook fast . Most importantly , it had to be wind resistant as we sometimes get gusts up to 20 kts . I had used it this weekend and it performed perfectly ! It heated a large kettle of boiling water in a short amount of time and held up to the wind nicely . Very easy to set up , just twist on the propane nozzle and attach the propane canister . It folds up into a very compact size and even has a built in carrying handle . This is a great product for the money and if you are a camper or just prefer to cook outside at home I would highly recommend it .
5 #### If you go to buggy places , you need these . They keep off the bugs that count . The midges seem to be able to bite through them , but those are n't the kinds of bites that keep itching very long . They keep off the mosquitos and the green - headed flies really well . These pack tiny and they 're sturdy for mesh clothing .
5 #### Item as described , quick to ship , would recommend to others . Great strength training tool for hands and forearms
5 #### I like this watch . It is easy for me to see the time . It keeps good time , better then my Casio , not quite as good as my Citizen . After six weeks it is has only lost 7 seconds from what I set it at . I like the Indiglo feature and the quick set for the date . The looks of the watch are a matter of personal taste but I like mine . I also like the fabric and leather band better then the vinyl bands prevalent on watches at this price point .
5 #### Good solid watch at a very reasonable price . I have purchased four of these over the past twelve years . No breakdown whatsoever . Only replaced because the watch bands wear put . Wish Timex would sell replacement bands for this model .
5 #### Well , this was a major hit with my 8 year old nephew . We took the Nite Ize to the beach one night and it worked brilliantly . I will update my review if it stops working . I also purchased wristbands that light up and highly recommend them . They were essential in the dark .
5 #### Was n't expecting much seeing as it is so thin but was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it is . Would be better for back sleepers , side sleepers ( specially people with big hips ) , you might have to reposition a few times at night since it puts a little pressure on the hips . This is something i have found with any air mattress however . I had a decent night 's sleep in this and would recommend to anyone who needs a little more cushion when camping .
5 #### I got these for my son to go with his Halloween costume . They were a great touch ! They are roomy and comfortable . My son has big feet and I sometimes have trouble finding shoes that fit well . These are easy to get on him and he really likes them too .
1 #### The front sight was dead . The second set I received was the wrong model . And guess what , the third set was also the wrong model .
4 #### This shoe crushes the top of my foot just above the base of the toes and requires a lot of brief wearing for a gentle break in . Now I can run in them - three or four miles typical , but I still ca n't walk more than short distances because the toe flexes more when walking and crushes my foot . That said , now they do what I wanted them to do for winter running shoe - keep the water out in near freezing wet conditions and wet snow while remaining fairly close to minimalist . Wearing wool socks , by feet stay pretty warm and dry now , whereas with the summer type minimalist shoes my feet would often get numb while running in bad conditions . For a great minimalist shoe , try the recently introduced Merrell Vapor Glove - it requires no break in and is truely minimalist . The quality of the Merrel shoes is great , but I am a bit dissapointed in this one in that it is still not really " broken in " .
5 #### Normally I wear a size 10 , but heeded the warnings of other reviewers , and I ordered these in a 9.5 ... they fit great and really comfortable .
4 #### I like these shoes ! However , if you wear size 10 's or 10 1/2 's I would suggest going down a size or a 1/2 size . The shoes where surprisingly large , I got a size 10 and they fit like a size 11 . All in all though they are great shoes ! !
5 #### I love the way they fit . And the price was excellent
5 #### I live in Chicago and I should have gotten this sooner . We are having a terrible winter , so I finally decided to get one of these . They are not the coolest things to have on , but your neck and cheeks will be warm . Ultimately , that 's all that matters .
4 #### To be fair , all converse run large . If I buy a smaller size they would be too narrow .
3 #### They 're ugly : the toe is rounded and the material is weird . the Nike Womens Flex Trainer 6 is way better looking and costs about the same .
1 #### overpriced . you can buy it at Costco for 1/3 of the price .
3 #### The bra is okay and fits fine . I read in reviews how with longline bras you need to go up a band size and down a cup size in order to get a proper fit . I picked 40C because I 'm normally a 38DD in regular bras . That gave me the right fit . The problem with the bra is that with the 3/4 length it rolls up all the time . It is really annoying to have to keep pulling it back down . I think it could have been designed better so that it wo n't roll up .
1 #### This was made for pregnant women or D cup size men with a baby bump . Never had a jacket fit so terribly . Its a large , not a 4x .... SMH
4 #### I like the size of the hoop the faster was hard to open the more I used them its better .
4 #### Nice pin but it is larger than I thought it would be . I bought it for my 8 year old son to wear on his tie for his first communion as I could n't find a Steelers tie in his size . Pin was slightly large for the small tie but it still looked nice and he was happy .
5 #### These bands have provided a very simple way to workout at home with the conveniency of making it on my own time ! I have enjoyed using the bands and the accessories that come with them . The additions besides the bands allows for an easy way to turn one 's living room into his or her own gym at home ! No problems with them whatsoever !
1 #### I got it and it was broken . I piece had chipped off in the flimsy box that it shipped in . They 're supposed to be the best case out there . Well first you have to cut the foam to your specifications , I wanted it for handgun travel and that was going to be a pain . If you 're looking for a tough case for handgun transportation , try Case Club . The one I got carrys 4 handguns , mags and ammo .
4 #### use it on a regular basis and not only did it get rid of my golf elbow but has kept it away for a couple of years now .
3 #### Got this for my dogs to play with and within the first week , the batteries were dead ( and this was just turning it on for maybe 10 minutes each night ) and nearly impossible to get the battery cover back on after I got it off .... So it was fun for them for a week .....
5 #### Carhartt t - shirts are the only ones I buy for my husband . Carhartt is his favorite brand as well , for work or as casual wear . He especially likes the extra length of the shirts , as they stay tucked in while he works , constantly bending and reaching . He wears these t - shirts in orange to work in lieu of having to wear an orange safety vest . Good quality material , nice thickness , reasonable price , wide range of colors ... these are the best .
5 #### This product is one my wife has used for a long time and meets her needs .
5 #### Great Rod , I bring it out once and awhile to impress people with the size of it ... LOL
4 #### Wife likes it but the only thing I wish it had was a clasp adjuster . I was able to size the watch to fit my wif 's wrist but she wanted it a bit tighter . Taking off one more link was too tight . Some other watches have the ability to to do small changes to the sizing via the clasp but this one does not .
5 #### Its a good watch and for the price its a great watch . My wife often asks , " What day is it ? " , and I look at my watch and give her the date . " No " , she says , " what DAY is it ? " A discussion then follows about whether its this day or that day because , well ... , it must be Tuesday because Monday nite football was last nite . Problem solved . Now I can look at my watch and say something like , " Its Weds . the 18th " . Very cool . Aside from that its good looking , it is easy to read , and with the expansion band its much " dressier " than my expedition model . And , oh yeah , it keeps excellent time .
5 #### 5 stars today for a high flying frisbee that catches a lot of attention ! I 've found that it 's easy to use and easy to throw which makes night time frisbee fun ! Now the only issue is tripping in the dark . I 've owned it for about 6 months now and used it very often with my nephews and nieces , who are young and do n't quite have good throwing technique yet , so its taken some abuse . Only recently has the LED had flickering problems . I will buy a replacement when this one dies out and recommend it to anyone .
4 #### Takes quite awhile to break in , but it is definitely a very high quality clog .
5 #### Replaced an old one with this one ... it works great and is easily readable . I do n't need lots of functions , just want to know how fast I 'm going !
5 #### My son loves this . We had one before but after a year of being banged around they died , which is acceptable . So we got a replacement for him .
4 #### I never think of myself as a fat head , but I must have a giant head . All of these " one size , but adjustable " type hats are just a little too small for me . However , it was a good price , worked well for my costume , and let me pull all sorts of things ( work access badge , rabbit , other small magic tricks ) out of the " empty " hat .
4 #### I love Converse . I 've lost track of how many pairs I 've purchased over the years . Is anyone still buying Hyper Orange ? Because the color on the computer is deceiving . I thought it looked like a pumpkin color online . In person these are NEON ! ! I like them but do n't love them .
5 #### it was the best one out of all ordered and shoots well did not break at all and everything is there
4 #### Works well ... Would and will buy again .. Allows easy access in and out of bucket .
5 #### I did n't expect that shopping for good nylons would be such a battle . But they all get such mixed reviews or downright bad ones . I finally settled on these and was nervous about purchasing online . But they are great ! They were exactly what I was looking for . They are n't weirded or streaky or anything . They are soft and nice looking . The size chart was on point . Will buy more .
5 #### MY SON LOVE IT , HE WAS WAITING FOR THIS , IS ALL RIGHT , PERFECT SIZE , COLOR BEATTIFUL , IS GREAT FOR KIDS , FOR ADULTS
4 #### This is a good watch but a little small for a big guy like me . Also the watch band is a little small and tight . If you are a big guy I would recommend a different watch .
5 #### great fit and quality will probably purchase more as needed .
5 #### The best wearing and fitting rubber boots I 've ever owned , live in country , work in large vegetable garden daily , wear boots daily . Will purchase again .
4 #### I like the Flexbar and I would have given an excellent recommendation except that the pamphlet with exercises is very thin . I had to go on - line to learn how to best use the Flexbar
5 #### A few months ago I read an article that said if you 're over 24 the only appropriate Converse to wear are ones like this , with black / grey skinny jeans and some sort of wispy - weight ironic graphic print t - shirt . That article was written by damn fool . Wear these anywhere you want with any outfit you want and rest assured you will look so fly .
5 #### Great little knife and great quality . Great for work , travel , or around the house . Will buy again A+++++++ A+ A+
4 #### Returned the original order for a size 11 - Great fit - Great Style . What 's not to like about Converse - Built to last . Thanks Trendi USA . Have never figured out why so many sneaker / athletic shoe manufacturers refuse to offer products with matching uppers and soles - Strange . PC - LA .
5 #### Well made working pants and fits nicely . No complaints from my husband about them so I will definitely buy more
5 #### Plan to use it for the first time this weekend . I keep a lot more on hand for use during our expected New England power outages this winter .
5 #### Great Scooter ..... Pink Color is the perfect thing to keep her brother from taking it away from her ! ! ! ! !
3 #### Very soft material , but it felt very constrictive around my neck and it definitely is n't long enough for my liking at the bottom . The bulk prevented my coat from being able to zip all the way up and since it does n't come down far enough , I had a small section that was n't covered by coat or this so the cold air had no problem getting in . Also , I wear contacts but sometimes I wear my glasses . If you wear glasses , forget it . It kept creeping up above my mouth on its own and caused my glasses to fog . I planned on buying these for Christmas gifts , but after using it for myself , decided not to .
5 #### Seller : 5 Stars Product Quality : 5 Stars Awesome ! you not only have a good quality tubing but also a variety of them you can use to suit your needs ! for example I can use the heaviest one for most of the exercises ( I 'm an athlete ) , but for some exercises you need the tubing to be pre - stretched and it 's very difficult to do it with the heaviest one , so you have four others to choose from !
5 #### I purchased these shoes for my husband . He had several pair in the past that lasted a long time and fit him well . He really likes the look , style , and feel of these shoes . They are so comfortable and lightweight . Just a great shoe to have in your wardrobe . He is very pleased with these shoes . Good price too !
5 #### The unit worked perfectly on a recent trip to grand cayman The depth gauge agreed with my wrist computer and the units small size was still easy to read . I went down as deep as 115 ' with no issues . II would buy again .
5 #### I love these shoes . They are my pick for the summer . I have had three pairs that I have got through . My foot is unusual . It is a " C " . Regular shoes are B and wide are D , so I can have trouble with finding the right shoe ; but these fit me perfectly . They are very comfortable .
1 #### Absolutely terrible . Genuinely surprised with the good reviews . You ca n't really wear it with anything .
5 #### I love the Berkshire stockings . First of all they are made in the USA which for anyone who gets a paycheck from a USA business should matter . Second , I love the sheer texture of these stockings . Get one size larger than you might assume as based upon the fit chart as these stockings do not have the stretch of cheaper stockings . But what you get in return is a really sheer look that makes your legs look tanned and toned . I love the Creme Crepe color as a good natural for someone fair skinned like myself . Linen is another color I like ... a light color that is a chalky taupe but looks good with neutral shoes and summer pastels .
5 #### Bought these for my granddaughter , she loves Converse Shoes . Will continue to buy these .
5 #### After using it one time , it 's really fun , but have a large , large field to play with these !
3 #### The cross bar has two remarkably weak points where they join three pieces together . I have had repeated issues with bending .
5 #### Excellent bike for the price . My kid loves it and thrashed it and still running strong . Easy assembly too .
5 #### These are very comfortable walking in warm weather . You feel safe and secure . Have not used in water yet . They are also a little cute for what they are .
5 #### I actually got this for a friend of mine who moved to WI , but I 've owned these things all my life and they put any scarf you cold ever own , to shame . They sit ON your neck , and you do n't have to worry about a scarf unraveling . You just put it on , tuck it underneath your jacket , and pull it up over your nose . So warm .
5 #### They are size 8.5 but fit like a 9 .. a little big , but i love them !
1 #### Unfortunately , this Flex Supreme does NOT have enough support over the toe and ankle are for my requirements . Returning for credit . Thanks anyway .
2 #### Broken strap and died within a month of opening . For a Timex product , I expected better .
5 #### Needed new baking pans and these fit the bill perfectly . The price is right . Though one of the pans will not get as clean as I prefer it to do , and use it anyway with something baked on that will not come off . Oh well .
4 #### I have very small feet , and have always been able to purchase children 's sizes in shoes . I had an older pair of Converse that fit perfectly , and they are a size 3 , so I ordered the same size as those thinking they would be a perfect fit as well . When they arrived and I tried them on , they were larger than a regular size 3 that I am used to . Not sure if they have changed their sizing or not , but I could have probably ordered a 2 or 2.5 for a better fit . Otherwise , they are great quality as always and I still love them !
4 #### Simple , sturdy plastic sled . Rope attachment may be weak - link , but overall good quality .
5 #### Good product . With some soft feeling when in hand . good for wet hands .
5 #### Converse run big , so be sure to order a half size down . Same classic shoe as always , always a great casual sneaker .
5 #### Best rings out there . Absolutely no ring marks left on scope upon removal .
5 #### I have already had one of these speed holsters for my Surefire 6PLED for over two years now , and it is incredibly durable , comfortable for wear , and allows for unusually quick deployment of the flashlight . This is my second one of these speed holsters , this time for the " Defender " version of the Surefire 6PLED . The construction is glass reinforced nylon , making for unparalleled durability and lightness . The holster also has a sliding belt retainer that has a screw allowing the user to easily adjust the level of friction keeping it in place . The retainer prevents the flashlight and holster from slipping off your belt during bathroom breaks or when undressing , and it also keeps it rigidly in place for running and other rapid movement . The spring retainer that holds the flashlight in place positively prevents it from accidentally falling out , even if you are running at full speed , yet allows the flashlight to be drawn with ease . Anyone who carries his Surefire daily would be well advised to use this , as it is so comfortable to wear that you forget you even have it on , until you need your flashlight , then away you go . Excellent product !
5 #### These have been keeping my husband 's hands warm during his 5:00 AM runs and workout sessions . Florida is not known for cold weather , but we ended up with a bit of snow this year where my husband is training . These helped him feel his fingers throughout the cold winter , much of which he spent outdoors .
4 #### A little big but will be ok . Order1/2size smaller than usuall next time
5 #### Nice and compact . Definitely waterproof as I used it underwater in the pool and ocean .
5 #### I have these grips on all my clubs . I like the slightly spongy feel but my hands do not slip and the material last a long time without breaking down
5 #### Thanks for the speedy shipment of the shoes . My son enjoyed his new shoes and has n't complained once ! I might have to get my own pair .
1 #### It lost a little torsional strength right away , however , it really lost strength quickly when bent in the shape of a U when exercising the wrist . Not recommended for that .
2 #### Does not work as advertised . The slide sticks and makes it very hard to move .
1 #### These are not the Chuck Taylor 70 's model . They are just regular chucks .
2 #### Bought one from a Walmart supercenter not Amazon . The shad lure I normally use has to be ordered from Northman tackle and did n't have time for it to ship . Did n't notice any breakage but same day I bought it and after first catch had a smooth break along the flat sides . little balls popped out some big mostly small . Ca n't return no receipt . Emailed customer service about warranty no response . Posted video on YouTube and trashed lure that 's my response . I would never buy again . Have n't seen such a fragile lure . Gave it 2 stars because it caught the fish before breaking granted senkos , top floaters and an MTB box was n't catching anything in the lake I was fishing .
5 #### Got the kids each one of these for Christmas . Even with other tech presents these were the favorite . They are easy to open and close . They are sturdy enough that I can ride on them .
5 #### I love these shirts and rarely , if ever , work in anything else . The pocket is great to fit my pens and a sharpie and the quality is top notch as you would expect from Carhartt .
5 #### I had recurring tennis elbow from dethatching my lawn with a hand rake 5 years ago . My orthopedic surgeon told me I had torn some of the rubber band - like parts of my tendon that attached the forearm muscle to the elbow bone . He sold me a clamp like strap to ease the pain . It worked but the pain always came back when I used the arm a little too much . Very frustrating . Thera - Band works ! After using it for just a few days the tendon no longer ached . I can lift weights now with no after pain . I started with the green and now have moved to the blue . Highly recommend this product , even if you can only use the lowest one . It will build up your strength . I am 76 and now do things I would not have been able to do .
5 #### I love my Converses , and these are no exception . Unbleached white is the way to go , I would definitely recommend to anybody !
5 #### I 'm a size 7.5 , but I read the instructions carefully and ordered a 1/2 size down . Really glad I did because they fit perfectly ! I was also worried about needing a wide width as I tend to need it for certain shoes . These are regular width and fit great !
4 #### Not having a lit up field at night ; this disc is perfect to keep the game of Ultimate going . Just make sure you buy extra batteries ! After 3 nights of playing , time to change those batteries .
5 #### I love them ! They fit perfect and are very comfortable ! !
5 #### Came on time so cute I love them . They are in great condition .
5 #### Straight out of the box , these shoes are great ! Very lightweight and fits comfortably on my feet like a glove ! I love most especially that the sole is not bulky like my previous running shoes I hated those things lol ! I would give them a shot and they are great for the price !
4 #### After having bought the watch for my little one and observing her using it for a little over 3 months now , I feel comfortable writing this review . The watch simplified the teaching process for me as far as getting my child to know how to read a watch . The " To " and " Past " feature really helped . The size of the watch was also perfect for her small wrist and as another reviewer noted , the $ 10 replacement option provided by Timex was comforting . My only gripe with this watch is the strap that it ships with . I noticed that she has to be constantly adjusting the band in order to prevent the watch from falling off her wrist . I believe Joe , ( other reviewer ) also made mention of this . This is a real concern for me because kids romp and a wrist watch is the last thing they are focusing on at play time . A simple clasp would have been just perfect instead of the expansion band . It is really a nice watch but the strap leaves much to be desired and I would have given 4&1/2 stars but it is what it is .
5 #### This seems to be a very nice set . I 've bought their previous set and these new ones have heavier duty carabiners than the previous plastic . Good padding on the handles . Nice carrying pouch , too . The previous pouch was pretty wimpy .
5 #### Love my new cookware set . Works as expected in my new toaster oven . Recommend .
2 #### Did n't like the fit . They ride high and are super long so unless you wear them significantly higher than your belly button , they are going to look like short pants . Buy a size or two up for the waist . Good color , but they are just sitting in my closet because they are way too small and uncomfortable . Cost more to return them than the original price so stuck with them .
5 #### Boots . Black . Justin . Nothing pretentious ; just a good , reliable boot .
5 #### wife wore for year then I got it for work . its carhartt , its fantastic .
5 #### I purchased these for a recent trip to Washington DC with my daughter and two granddaughters in the hope that they would help keep us warm . They exceeded my hopes . We put them into our coat pockets when we left early each morning and they were still warming us when we returned after dinner . I honestly do n't know what we would have done without them . We are from coastal California so are unaccustomed to very cold weather . DC weather took a dramatic dip while we were there with temps not exceeding 17 degrees and hovering in the 10 - 12 degree range with a wind - chill in the negative numbers . There was snow and slush . Yet we stayed remarkably comfortable between these warmers for our hands and insulated insoles in our shoes . The warmers do remain warm for more than ten hours . We loved them and believe they are an easy 5 - star product . My daughter has since purchased more of them for her girls to take to school on chilly days .
4 #### This is the second version of this watch that I have owned . The first one got some water in it after wearing it in a jacuzzi so the water resisitant is pretty liberal . This watch has a very classic look and I frequently get comments on it . I also own the same one in Black and both are pretty much identical . Skagen was one of the first brands to go titanium in both the watch and bands and more and more companies are switching . Titanium is lighter and stronger than regular steel and once you go Titanium , you wo n't go back . This watch has a small face so its perfect for people with average to small wrist sizes . Some of these watches have faces that are so big its like wearing a tea saucer on your wrist and it 's an eysore . This watch is a revelation to smaller wrists everywhere . Also the band on this watch does not grab your wrist hair ( VERY IMPORTANT ! ) . One disadvantage of this watch is the lack of features . Its got the date and that s about it . Also the ticking from the watch is loud enought that you sometimes notice it if the watch is within about 2 feet of your ears and the room is silent . I would n't normally go to bed with this watch or store it nearby while sleeping . Bottom Line : A classy and durable dress watch appropriate for any non athletic situation . I highly recommend it and well worth the money .
1 #### Only gave this item 1 star rating because of bait and switch . I was excited when it came in but when I got it , I noticed something was wrong . Either way , I went ahead and just attached the towel on my golf bag ... Long story short , picture on Amazon was not right . No mascot on the towel . Was going to get it replaced but it did n't have that option . Only refund . Other than that , towel was great quality and embroidered . Golf balls had he mighty D with the mascot on it ... Does n't have a brand type . And normal wooden tees .
5 #### I love my new Timex . It 's easy to read and handsome as well
5 #### My husband says they fit true to size & are very comfortable . He will be wearing them as F.O.B. on July 5th in Hawaii !
1 #### Snapped with just one bike causing a total damage of over 80 dollars in repairing a rim , I do not know how would it have handled four bikes . and when it snapped it was not on a highway with 70 plus speed it was a street drive with 40 mph max on a smooth road
4 #### These are really cool . I bought them for my boyfriend who has had several pairs of Converse shoes and he loves them . They were everything that I expected . Buying was easy , they arrived without any issues . We 're both very happy with these shoes
5 #### This is without a doubt the most amazing bag I 've ever owned . There is plenty of room for the essentials and a tablet . It is very easy to organize with all the internal pockets . The cushioned strap is wide , comfortable and stays on your shoulder even when bending over . The Crimson color is beautiful and the texture of the fabric is very nice . I ca n't imagine ever wanting a different kind of bag , I might just have to get additional colors for different seasons .
3 #### I ordered 2 shirts : 1 Oxford and 1 Green . I received the Oxford but never received the green one and now it does not even show I ordered it . I would give the shirt 5 stars but the order problem is not right .
5 #### I have the leather version of merrell 's barefoot shoe , and this one is a lot more studier for hiking and running . I do n't do a whole lot of trail running since I am not much of a runner . But I love this shoe for its quality and comfort . Compared to the other softer versions , this one takes a bit to break in but once you do you will enjoy it .
3 #### PRO : STYLE CON : RUNS a little SMALL and the CHEAP LACES
4 #### Nice boots , but they fit pretty narrow . If you wear a D width , you might want to try an E or EE .
4 #### I wore these for a 2 week scout hike . They held up pretty well , even wearing them multiple days in a row .
2 #### My son loved his Radio Flyer Trike when he got it . Scooted around all over the house . But , I noticed he outgrew it long before his friends had outgrown their plastic ride - ons ( like the Little Tykes Push and Ride ) . Problem is the wheels start to get in the way of the feet -- but that does n't seem to happen on the Little Tykes design . Then , the neck of the thing started going loose and eventually hopelessly wobbly . Steering it was then impossible . I called Radio Flyer -- they were n't much help for this problem and we eventually got rid of the scooter in a garage sale . We also had a choking hazard problem with Radio Flyer 's push wagon -- several screws came off and I would find them and the washers strewn about the house . Regrettably , I have now pretty much sworn off the brand .
5 #### Discovered this Tiru the NY Times article and find it very effective if not a cure all , a big help .
5 #### excellent product and condition , i recommend ordering a size smaller because they run a size larger
5 #### Smart wool is the best , hands down . To keep warm in the winter , cool in the summer - under work boots they keep feet warm and dry , under walking shoes keep feet from sweating . My family wears only smart wool ! Do n't let labels fool you , however , if it does n't say smart wool with their little picture of a " man " with a cross for a head ! Seriously ! It ca n't just say " merino wool" ... they are n't the same ! And they are made in the USA ! ! !
1 #### Item arrived quickly and on time . ( Prime member ) Fair price . Size was a little big but hey it needs to be In order to have that villian sway of the cloak . Great colors HOWEVER it arrived ripped ! ! The black neck spiked pieces are folded and bent out of shape . I could get over the neck spikes but the actual cloak has a rip in it . Highly disappointed I am a huge Disney fan and Maleficent is my favorite villian -- this was a disappointing day .
5 #### The box came a bit damaged but the shoes are perfectly undamged . And fits perfectly .
5 #### These things are awesome . They clean up , as much as you need them to clean up , with a hose or just throw them in a bucket . We use them on both grass and the cul - de - sac hard tac and they work just fine . I 'm very happy and the kids absolutely love having bases they can run , jump and stand on .
4 #### My previous Justin Ropers like this in a different color in size 10.5 EE fit perfectly . Before ordering this new pair I had my foot measured in a shoe store and it was sized at 11 EE , so I ordered these boots in that size . However , they are really too large with a lot of heel slippage . Have not worn them other than in the house just to try them on . I 'm debating as to whether I should return them for a size 10.5 EE . I do like the style as they are nicely mottled .
5 #### Warm and excellent quality . Double layered and holds it shape .
1 #### I always wear size 4 men , 6 women but this shoe size is wrong . I ordered 4 men size again but too large . Box was damaged and very dirty . Shoe has some spots on it and one of the shoe do n't even have a lace . Missing shoelace . Very bad experience . I am returning it back .
5 #### They are my son 's 5th pair . He only wears Merrell jungle moc since he was 8 years old . He loves them .
5 #### Because this tablets smell , it 's great that they come individually wrapped . As a general rule , when backpacking , I do n't like to produce trash , so these are not for backpacking . But the sheer simplicity and safety ( because there 's nothing to spill ) of these tablets makes them ideal in an emergency kit that might get used by the novice or child . Anytime you use fire , there is always a risk , but risk is dramatically mitigated here . I highly recommend these tablets .
5 #### I was skeptical with all the overzealous reviews exuding happiness , but then they arrived I slipped these bad boys on and I knew it was go time . These are my new business socks ...
3 #### I really wish they made odd sizes . I 'm not a 34 anymore but the 36s were just too big . I 'd be so happy with a 35 . The quality still looks top notch , as I 've been wearing Dickies for more than 20 years .
4 #### Love Time - teaching watches for kids . The numbers are quite small - but it has a nice elastic band and is water resistant . The lens scratches easily .
5 #### Love my new watch ! Stylish enough to wear out but still functional for work . Would recommend to everyone .
5 #### Perfect work shorts . These things can take a beating . I wo n't buy anything else for work .
3 #### Honestly . We found these to be useless junk . They broke from rubbing on the dock . This was our first year EVER having a boat tied to a dock . We hoped these would make it easier . Will definately come up with a different plan for next year .
5 #### Love the look of this sneaker ! We have owned this brand before and this style , but for some reason , this time , the shoe seemed to be cut a little smaller and a little more narrow . I would recommend getting 1/2 size larger and maybe in wide ( if available ) .
4 #### Just as described . delivered promptly . the elastic is secure , stays up well
4 #### Watch is beautiful . Needs two links taken out to fit properly . Would recommend
5 #### Great knife , have bought several for my kids . Quality product at a reasonable price .
5 #### Size really depends on the brand . I wear a 6.5 in Nike and they fit me perfectly . These shoes are comfortable , they wrap around my feet like a bandage but do not restrict movement .
4 #### I need a size 12 in any other shoes . These I ordered a size 11 and they were to big . I had to pay $ 16.45 to ship them back . I am a prime member .. I re - ordered a size 10.5 and they are perfect . Verry happy , but disappointed in Prime charging me to return the 1st pair . I just paid my Prime annual fee to , maybe the last time for that .
5 #### This Resistance Band Set is well made and certainly a bargain on Amazon at this price . My wife bought me the set as a gift through her Amazon account , and I 'm very pleased she did . The handles , resistance tubes and clips are nicely machined , and work easily . I wanted this primarily for traveling , since everything fits in the included bag . We are scheduled for three weeks on Maui this year , and the bands will be added to our suitcase to give us an exercise option right in the condo , before we go out to the pool or sightseeing . I 'm really pleased with the purchase .
5 #### These insoles help my heels feel much better . I would never wear a pair of athletic shoes with the original insoles .
5 #### Just like the old days . I love these shoes . Get so so many compliments . Now I want them in pink
5 #### These are very nice and comfortable . They do n't ride down my shoulders and provide nice support .
4 #### It is everything they say it is in the description . Face is a bit smaller than I wanted , but still a bit larger than the standard women 's watch . Band is large enough for any wrist , with 8 removable links . I really like the clasp . Easy on and off , without fearing it will unlatch on its own and fall off . Looks exactly like the picture .
4 #### A great fit and prompt delivery;ordered another pair within days of receiving the first pair . The question is , why not 5 stars ? Have always loved the Wrangler product . The thickness of the jean however , is not what it used to be . Have 2 pairs I recently ordered and will order 2 more because alas , they 're not as " rugged " as they once were . Not a complaint , simply an observation .
1 #### Either the wrong item was sent to me or the image shown for my selection is incorrect . Photo shows entirely black and white converse , I received black and white and yellow with different laces . Not only that , ( I would contemplate keeping them ) but the material does n't seem as nice and the white above the toes looks sloppy . Will return them .
3 #### I followed the measurement chart to pick my size , but when I tried them on they were too small . I have worn them once , but they were very tight and uncomfortable . I hate that I paid so much for them and they do n't fit .
4 #### I am satisfied . One can last about 3 sets game . BTW I am a 3.5 player .
3 #### The long and short of it is this is a pretty good bag . I have had problems finding similar products at reasonable prices , and this one fits the bill . If you used to own a bag that looked like this , be aware that it will not be identical to the old one- the fabric is now quite a bit lighter than the originals I have ( still have ) , and it is " laminated " on the inside with a type of plastic to give strength . What s Good : 1 . pretty good capacity 2 . Nice inside storage compartments similar to a tool palette . 3 . Strap for carrying 4 . Place for documents , or something other than tools . 5 . Weight : Actual bag weighs very little . What I do n't like : 1 . Colors- Why are they stuck on this combination ? Its kind of ugly , and it always was . 2 . Material : The material these bags are made with has changed since the first few I have bought , and they are now a lot lighter and thinner . 3 . Tendency for small items to disappear in the crevices of the bag . 4 . Bag loses its form when loaded with tools due to the lighter weight fabric . 5 . Prone to " wear through " in places where pointed or heavy objects sit .
4 #### Fits a little larger than expected but definitely a quality shirt .
4 #### Works great with the need and the flint is included . The metal cod be softer to get better shavings that 's my only advise . But for the money and the level of quality it is a great buy and lasts forever !
3 #### A bit hard to pull on for me , but after I get them on , they are great .
5 #### Awesome tool for building strength in the forearms and wrists . Great for Golfer 's Elbow and Tennis Elbow exercises .
5 #### I 've found that Chuck Taylor run about a half size to big . I normally wear size 11 , but the 10.5 fits perfectly .
5 #### I do n't know how about it , because it is a gift . I will give it to my mother 's coworkers . Thank you .
5 #### Nephew loves it - great birthday gift for our 5 year old nephew .
5 #### I have a difficult time finding just the right socks and these seem to work better than many I have tried . I 'll probably get more in the future . As soon as I put them on I was pleased at the way the toes had room to move while the ankle and calf portion of the sock fit snuggly but not too tight as to cause marks .
3 #### I am just having the hardest time finding the right size in this brand . I went from 32gg to 32 g and now 32ff . Still too big in the cup . Maybe I 'll fit a 32f if I decide to give this another shot .
5 #### I absolutely LOVE my new chucks ! ! The pic is true to color & size perfect not to mention I received them right on time ! Thx !
5 #### Ca n't wait to give it to my granddaughter on her birthday . She is going to love it . I especially love that it ticks , not all watches do anymore .
5 #### I like the fit . The material looks to be very sturdy . Very satisfied .
5 #### Flies inevitably find your BBQ site ; this little killer will at least lessen their numbers . It 's fun to use -- in fact , everyone will want a turn -- and before you know it , someone 's keeping score ! Tie the dart to the gun with the included string so you do n't pop Aunt Ag when she least expects it .
5 #### Well , not being a baseball expert , I love this ball . The seams feel perfect and the ball weight feels perfect . The little collectors case is pretty cool too . I would recommend this ball for pitching practice or for throwing practice . Use the cheap balls for hitting and fielding practice .
1 #### Absolutely a horrible and unsafe design . Terrible quality . For starters they are dangerous . I have been using inversion boots for decades . These have a very shallow hook design and are on the wrong angle to hang safely on any type of bar . They unhook from the bar very easily while pulling your self back up . Plus the angle is so off on the boot itself that they dig horribly into the back of the calf muscle . Again , I have used different types of inversion boots for years and years . There are terrible .
5 #### Nice Converse however the shipping took a very long time
5 #### GOOD GIFT FOR A FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL LEARNING TO TELL TIME . SHE WAS PLEASED & PINK IS HER FAVORITE COLOR .
2 #### I could put 1.5 of me in this pair of underwear . The underwear were fine but size was way off .
5 #### First wore these on flight to London . Arrived in London and walked around site seeing for 6 hours . Felt great on my great on my feet with no problems !
5 #### Higher quality material and workmanship than other boots in its price range . Will be getting another pair .
5 #### I have nerve damage and the occupational therapist had me use these to strengthen my hands / wrists / forearms . So why not have my own . Hygenic had the best price and the shipping was on time .
5 #### I 've been wearing this bra for several years . It always fits properly with no pinching or poking . Gives me the support I like . The bras hold up extremely well if you machine wash on delicate cycle , cold water , and hang to dry .
5 #### Pretty durable and fit good . As long as they stand the test of time .......
1 #### Poor fit , poor quality , non - existent insulation . This item was to be used for the purpose of skiing . I can only imagine it now used to scare the neighbors throwing out the trash with this item included in it .
5 #### Needed a new bike helmet but did n't want to spend $ $ $ $ on one that may or may not fit right or feel comfortable . However , the Schwinn Thrasher Adult Micro was an excellent choice ! ! The most comfortable bike helmet I 've ever owned , easy to put on and secure with the under chin buckle and the adjustment knob in the back . When it 's on and adjusted it stays put . The ventilation is superior and I still feel the wind in my hair even though I 've got a bike helmet on . I also like the detachable visor and the thickness of the padding , both in the helmet for comfort and on the shell for protection . I would definitely buy this again if I had to and the price could n't be beat . It out - performs and is more comfortable than a helmet that I used in the past in which I paid more than $ 200 for ! !
4 #### yup half size down , I 'm typical 8 , and I needed 7.5 Otherwise I have no doubt theese are NOT fake :)
4 #### In general , I am usually between a 7.5 and 8 , with 8 being the size I buy most often . I purchased these in a size 8 and for the first time ever in all my shoe buying , I need an 8.5 . So the 8 's are going back . The shoe itself seemed comfortable and I believe the only issues I had with them were related to them being a size too small , otherwise they would be considered very comfortable and supportive . And I love the style , super cute !
3 #### I hate that every time I order new Carhartt shirts , they come from some different country , made of different cloth , and are Never the same size . Carhartt shirts were all I would wear at work , Now I 'm looking for a new brand that does not go down in quality every Year !
5 #### Quick shipping ! Product was exactly what we were looking for !
5 #### I was specifically looking for slip on shoes with some structure that I could wear without socks . These do not work for me without socks , the tag in the top made a blister on top of my foot ! But they are the most comfortable shoes I 've had ... maybe ever ! I 'm heavy set and tend to break down my shoes pretty quickly . I 've been wearing these every day for a couple of months and they are still good as new . They have a firm sole but cushiony inside , and I feel like I could walk in them forever . As long as they do n't change the design , Merrell has earned a customer for life !
5 #### I bought these for my husband as his everyday t shirts were getting pretty shabby looking . The fit is very comfortable for him , they are 100 % cotton and very reasonably priced ; a win - win all the way .
5 #### This shirt is well made and comfortable . They do run big ! Even after washing in hot water ( no discernible shrinkage ) . I 'm 5'8 " 175lbs , the large hangs to mid thigh . I will definitely buy more , maybe I 'll try a medium .
5 #### Amazing dress ! The dress is knee length , does n't hug , and is very comfy . I am very pleased ! It hides my postpartum belly well and has easy access for nursing . It was exactly what I was looking for !
4 #### This thing is amazing ! I do n't exactly understand how it works , but it helped heal my golfers elbow almost immediately . I would think that it would worsen my already inflamed right elbow , but it took away over 80 % of the pain . In about a week over 90 % of the pain went away , but I 'm still resting my elbow just to make sure it is healed . Great stuff and my strength in my forearms has increase , because now I can twist the Theraband much easier .
5 #### Perfect . Got hose to go with a white lace dress . Not too tight in the waist , good fit . I am small 64 " 112 with round hips . Ca n't find in stores , thanks again Amazon .
5 #### This one was one of the tastiest meals that I had on my recent week long backcountry elk hunt . I had ordered quite the variety and it was certainly the best of all the Mountain House meals .
5 #### My primary use is on threads . Threads of containers and threads on FLASHLIGHTS .... YEP ! flashlights . I apply the silicone with a Solder Flux Brush . The brushes are cheap and plentiful , easy to find at any LOWES , WALMART , Home Depot and other hardware stores . This SILICONE GREASE has met all of my expectations . This is the second time I bought this ... I ca n't find where the first one is ... DUH ! OK , so I 'm a guy ....
4 #### My mother bought this for my son for his last birthday . He is six and I was afraid of him getting hurt while riding it . It is well made but it does not stay charged for very long .
5 #### Hands down the best pantyhose I 've ever worn . They are thicker than I expected which is nice , well made and sturdy , very breathable material . I 'm very rough on pantyhose I have pulled and yanked on them and they have held up exceptionally well . I 'm a large plus size woman and I did a full squat in these and they did n't tear or break . No more cheap pantyhose for me . These are the real deal . Now I got my normal size which according to the packaging looked like it was going to be too small . I did have to pull the legs and band , stretch them out a bit . I had to jump and wiggle into them . I will get the next size larger for me to avoid that . However I got the on , they have a nice lyric like stretch to them and they fit me although technically they are too small . There also has been no cutting or digging into my flesh . They are very comfortable to wear . The shades are on point just what I expected . Silky smooth feeling that shapes and curves to you . My legs felt and looked amazing . Over the moon pleased with this brand !
5 #### Bought these for my son who plays baseball . He is a larger than average 10 year old and these fit him perfect . He wears them a few times a week and they have held up nicely .
5 #### I had bought a surplus assault pack with straps on the side for a rifle . I had ideas on how i would improvise some protection while strapped to my pack . Then I came across this , and at first was not sure it would fit my rifle even when i had it in my hands . It fits a Colt LE6920 with a 20rnd mag . I keep the slack between the front sights and the carry handle . It is absolutely perfect for protecting my gun , and concealing it somewhat ( the sight of an AR can be intimidating to some . Actually it 's nice to have it covered for many reasons ) . I 'm absolutely satisfied with this product and am happy I have it .
5 #### We make buckets for scout camp to use in permanent tents and around the fire , etc . These are SO MUCH EASIER than taking the old lid and padding it , etc . Yes , they are hard plastic - but they prevent the lip of the bucket from biting into your thigh , and the molded shape is actually very comfortable . The lid stays on , but is easy enough for kids to get in and out of the bucket . The lid serves as a perfect nightstand inside permanent platform tents , etc . If they are in the price range you are looking for , they are a great bucket lid !
4 #### i still have it and i use once in a while ..
4 #### Good ball ... I 've had this ball for a while and its taken a beating ... its gotten better ! Buy it ! There s no reason to not buy it !
3 #### This is a shoe I will wear with black dress pants or jeans when I need comfort and a little style , but I am not impressed . This is a very flimsy shoe with little support at all . Not like any Nike I 've ever purchased in the past . It looks nice , but it 's not comfortable .
4 #### Tis sneaker is what I was looking for , it looks terrific , but it runs a little large , so I wear 12 and think I should order 11 or 11 and half
5 #### What would I do without my most necessary watch ? Turn around and go back home . I do n't even do this when I leave my cell phone at home . Over the course of my life I have ordered this watch 3 times . It is the best there is . I love it for checking the time when checking in on a patient . I can hit the indiglow button to see the time rather than turning on a light . It 's just brilliant folks , you have to try this exceptional piece .
1 #### Lyman appears to trying to mimic a product made by Merit , a product that has been on the market for many years . Unlike the very precisely made metallic product with adjustable iris Merit , the Lyman product is a flimsy piece of pliable plastic that does not sit parallel to the plane of the glasses it is affixed , which tends to obstruct the aperture or blur the image and it is not adjustable .
4 #### It was a great costume overall . The head piece was a little small , even for a small head . The remedy to this would be to pin or sew the back closed once it 's on your head and tied . Also , pinning the collar down in front holds it in place . The gown material is nice and strong , not cheaply made . I wore this to a Renaissance Faire and it was a big hit ! I do recommend .
4 #### I looked everywhere for pads for my 6 year old son who wanted a skate board for Christmas . These look okay , but are still very big . He wears the elbow pads as knee pads . At least he has some to grow into !
5 #### This was a last - minute purchase for a 5 - year - old who could n't decide what he wanted to be for Halloween . ( LOVE PRIME . ) It turned out to be surprisingly well constructed with great details . The bunny comes off and on easily thanks to Velcro , and it can be stashed inside the hat in a separate compartment so you can really pull a rabbit out of your hat ! The hat size is also adjustable via Velcro ( and it fit my son 's head great ) . The only downsides was that the ribbon sash was a little loose and got a little stuck on the Velcro , and if you want a true top hat this one may be too squishy , but we got nothing but compliments this Halloween !
5 #### This watch is exactly what I was looking for . I have a small wrist and it fits as if it was made for it . It keeps time accurately and is a most attractive watch . My wedding ring is gold and it goes very well with the watch and also the numbers are easily readable . I felt the price was very reasonable .
4 #### A little big and I have a big head . Tough hot to use on a costume run . Could use a bigger mouth hole .
5 #### I use it to carry stuff from my bigger raft . It can hold one skinny adult on it good . My friend weights about 200 lb and it did hold him fine . But when he got of the raft he fell into the water . I tow it from my bigger raft which can fit 5 people . on this small raft I put beers , air pump , and other stuff I might need . Excellent , easy to patch . I did not use the patch that came with it when it had a hole . I used a better one with cement boat repair . Nothing can beat its price . very very happy .
5 #### Good stuff ! I use it to lubricate the sealing rings on my aquarium filter .
5 #### Yesterday , thanks to advice from a fishing friend , I tied on this lure . In two hours , I had a largemouth going 9 lb 8 oz and a second going 6 lb 8 oz . Both were taken on the perch color and the lure had been in my tackle box for a number of years without being used . These were the two largest , but we also boated two three pounders before the wind got so back we had to get off the water .
5 #### These shorts are built to last . Dickies takes your ACTUAL waist size , so you may need to order these a size bigger than usual . For example if you wear a 38 normally then buy a 40 . This is because most manufacturers make the sizing a little off in order to make people feel " better " or " thinner " . Will order these shorts again .
5 #### nice weights but I miscalculated , they are way to big / heavy for me so I am returning . I need some ' wussy ' 5 pounders I 'm afraid . Still , return looks like it will be hassle free and like I said , the weights were fine , good quality and look like they will last plus I could adjust them down to 10 pounds . Thanks to Amazon because as I said , return looks to be hassle free ! !
5 #### Arrived very quickly and was well - packed . It is easy to adjust . And to punch it or kick it , well , it gives you a very good workout . It feels more real than a punching bag .
4 #### i ordered a size 38 and it was way too big for me , I would advise ordering a half a size down from your usual size . Other than that its stylish and goes with pretty much everything .
3 #### The garment seems nice , however , the size chart or specifications do n't fit every body type . I 'm 6 ' , 192 lbs , and the recommended size was large . I m not robust in girth , and with a base layer and a pair of fleece pants , these bibs were snug in the hips and thighs , and gave me cameltoe , which leads to great discomfort over extended periods . If you plan to layer up and be outdoors for a while , go up at least one size to accommodate your underlayers . I have three pairs of snow pants this brand , and they all fit well and retain heat just fine .
2 #### as they were way to big . I am fairly true to size with shoes and order on line frequently but these were about a whole size off ...
4 #### My ( rather large ) two year old loves Monsters Inc. He is wearing size 4 T now , but his clothes are starting to pinch , so he 's almost in a size 5 . I ca n't imagine this fitting him when he 's in a 6 . It 's pretty easy to get on , but getting it off is pretty stressful . It has to go on over his head with his hands up in the air . There is a small piece of velcro at the back of the neck , but it does n't stay closed at all . I may add a drawstring . One of the biggest design flaws is in the bottom , where his legs go through . Elastic would be a great improvement . It fits my son right in the perfect spot so his legs move easily , but if he was just a few inches shorter I think it would be cumbersome . It is made of thin foam , maybe a centimeter thick . I 'm sure it will last the night , but I seriously doubt it 's ability to be handed down . I may be pleasantly surprised , but I 'm not holding my breath . The shoe covers will probably require a bit of two - sided tape . My son wears a size 11 shoe , and they fit perfectly over his loafers . If his shoes were much smaller , I think they would probably spin around as he walked .
5 #### Keeps time and is still attractive for a large face woman 's watch .
5 #### I - I mean my kids - love playing catch with this disc in the dark . It looks very cool as it cruises through the night sky .
5 #### Title says it all . I always loved Rothco hats . Word of advice though , DO NOT WASH ! ( it will fall apart and fade considerably after like 2 washes ) .
5 #### Searched for days for a new EDC and finally selected the Hiker . I wanted something versatile , small enough to fit in a pocket but large enough to be effective when using . This knife does all of that and more .
5 #### These were a birthday gift to my granddaughter . She loves them . They were exactly what she wanted to make a fashion statement .
4 #### Though putting in a scoped weapon can be hard , the result provides safe long term storage and silicon based protection .
4 #### I love these shirts but can not get over how disappointing the inconsistencies are . You play this lotto where you hope its made in Honduras or Guatemala because the ones made in Haiti are too small . So far the ones I 've purchased from Amazon are made in Guatemala , thus they fit . I have several that I ca nt wear that I 've bought elsewhere that were made in Haiti and are useless . Carhartt should put an end to this .
5 #### Classic sneaker my grandson runs , climbs , plays at high energy so they are great for him .
5 #### Have n't used yet but it 's what I thought it would be .
5 #### Just the right size for quick meals while camping . Easy to set up and use . Might be helpful if we get hurricanes that knocks out our electricity .
4 #### I had to return the first pair , because Amazon sent me size 11 in a size 12 box ! I returned them and the correct size came today . I added some heavy duty gel insoles I got from Amazon ( Dr. Scholl's)as I have done in other size 12 shoes to make them fit better . Not easy getting them into these shoes and although they snug up my feet nicely , my heels still are slipping up and down a little . I can live with this , but do n't plan on any LONG WALKS for awhile until I get them broken in and used to the heel slippage ..
5 #### This frisbee goes REALLY FAR and is VERY EASY to throw . The rubber design is great . I highly recommend it because it 's fun to use . However , it WILL get stuck in trees or sink in water ... Keep that in mind . Otherwise , this thing is really easy to catch / throw , and goes really far . Our frisbee came in pink . I recommend it .
5 #### Best camp purchase ever ! ! A definite must for car camping . The carrying case also eliminated that forgetting the fuel at home issue and great for packing up in a hurry due to unforseen rain storms . The knobs where a bit tight at first making for off and FIRE FROM MODOR cooking . Eventually , they loosened after the second camping trip so all is well .
3 #### They were a bit more clunky than I hoped Wanted more slim streamline shoe
5 #### Works great as a fire starter or with a esbit stove . The cubes are lightweight and do n't take up much space . This is great for backpacking where space and weight are a concern . Highly recommend .
5 #### I Purchased three of these They work well . 1 for my kids bike , 1 for my bike , and 1 for my wife 's bike . I love the adjustable height on these .
5 #### love these walking shoe . i have a pair of beige also and wear them all the time . they fit perfectly and they are very comfortable , could wear them all day everyday .
5 #### You ca nt go wrong with Converse they have been great footwear for years . They do run large so I always get 1 size smaller then I normally wear .
5 #### I use this to help with tennis elbow and as a warmup for rock climbing .
4 #### Pros : - I was surprised by how handy the 2 - way handles can be . It 's a nice feature . - Great size for the back of my car . ( I use it for groceries when it 's hot outside . ) - It 's blue ! I like that . - Keeps things cold . :D - Shipped on time and intact . Cons : Like most coolers , the lid does n't stay open unless you 're holding it open . -_- I would love to not have to fight the lid while I load and unload the cooler , but that 's not the case with this one . Can someone please make a cooler that 's lid stays open please ?
5 #### These shorts are quite long and durable . The product packaging and shipment was perfect and timely . The fit was perfect , without shrinkage after laundering .
5 #### They fit very well , love the color , over all very pleased .
5 #### Great chair for hiking . Very light and easy to pack .
5 #### Smart wool makes a great product and all of their sicknesses . I 've had parents that I 've had for years and you ca n't wash the stretch out of them and they still are like the day that I bought them .
5 #### A must have for your posterior and joints when working - out on bare concrete floors . I feel well protected and not sunken into the floor .
1 #### I really wanted these arrows , but after i ve shot these , and then the really nice steel feathered arrows , in the long run it is $ 10 more to get 6 of those for $ 40 , while 6 of these would be $ 30 , the plastic fins scrape the top of your hand and mess up the flight path , but i got 6 real nice steel , feathered arrows at my local archery place for $ 40 , ( btw 6 is the normal number of arrows in target archery ) I 'm sorry to say , these aroows are useless , two of the tips dented and one broke from shooting at a cardboard bow w/ styrofoam in it yes it BROKE THE TIP ! the tip ( width wise ) is larger than the shaft , resulting in it getting stuck .
4 #### If you want to improve your balance , this simple pad will do the trick . You can balance on it , as well as use it to do other exercises that you 'd normally do on a solid floor . The dots that make it " elite " are not worth the extra money -- it is not especially non - skid despite the dots , though I imagine skidding is n't really that big a problem since you 're standing on top of it , not pushing against it . My biggest complaint about the product is its price . It is quite expensive for a square of foam ... even very " special " foam such as this appears to be . If you get this thing , do n't store anything on top of it or wedge it tightly against anything else -- the foam has a memory for those insults and it takes weeks or even months for dents created overnight to fade away . Standing on it does n't create those problems -- but putting weights on it or sticking it in a tight space for a few hours will mar its surface .
5 #### Absolutely love them . Can even wear them without my insoles .
2 #### After a month of use on two of these goals the center bars have begun to sag down and not be straight , the metal has all begun to rust , . For the price you not going to find a goal this size , but sadly they just do n't hold up like I was hoping for . I have sanded down the metal and spray painted them with antirust paint and have welded the bars straight on both goals to be a better functioning setup for my son
4 #### But I wish I got another color instead of black . The helmet is very comfortable and safe does the job well .
4 #### I recently ordered about 5 different brands / sizes / styles of hose trying to find an acceptable pair , since my prior style is no longer available . This style 4489 is the best I have found yet . I am 5'3 " and 210 , so according to the chart I should order Q / P , but I hate the feeling of too - short hose , so ordered the 1x-2x . They fit perfectly with no annoying roll - down . Be sure to check that you use the correct size chart - Berkshire has many ! These hose are not as sheer as some , but you have to sacrifice either sheerness or wear . Super sheer hose have much less stretch and I rarely get more than one wear from them . While not super sheer , these are nice and silky . I got the nude , and even though I am fairly light skinned , I felt they may have been a little too light . So I am trying the natural next . The control top is also a good balance - not too tight , but does provide some firming . Overall , the only real drawback is the price . I find it ridiculous that a pair of hose costs more than going out for lunch !
5 #### My 6 year old loves it and use it all the time . It is well made and hardly no assemble required .
5 #### A must ! Why beat yourself up ! Two screws and your set for great comfort .
1 #### Does n't really bounce to well and is collecting dust under my pool table . The underside on one side is a little rivet which can possibly damage your pool table if left on there for extended periods of time .
5 #### I wanted to add a core & strength workout a few times a week and did not want to store a full weight set or go to the gym . These have been great . They come with handles that easily clip to the bands and have and ankle strap and door stopper piece .
5 #### These Gazetters are amazing ! I own them for NY , VT , NH and ME . Fabulous ! They provide info and details that go beyond what 's available online and via smartphone apps . I use these to find waterfalls and to learn about state parks and destinations . The extra info they provide about natural features / highlights are valuable too . The only downside - they 're big if you want to carry them around or keep them handy in your car .
5 #### I too have a small wrist and this watch is perfect . It is elegant and looks great . Very easy to see the numbers . Would recommend . The band is thin , but I like that .
4 #### Nice looking watch and what I wanted but the band was too big . Even though I followed included instructions to remove some links , I could not do it . had to take it to a jeweler and pay more money . Be advised if you have a very tiny wrist like I do .
5 #### Nice shoes for toddlers ... Grippy sole and they lace up good so they stay on ... Canvas lets feet breathe
5 #### Perfect item for cooking in the outdoors , very durable . I purposely bought because it is stainless steal , i had an alluminum one and when i pulle it out for use it had a hole in the bottom of the pan . It will last forever if taken care of , and not real heavy .
5 #### Ca n't beat Chucks ! Needed some easy , light shoes that look good with shorts . They do the job .
4 #### Always a Turtle Fur fan ! Light material , keeps me warm on the slopes . Glad I went with black because it does n't show dirt , but it 's still washable . A must for the slopes !
5 #### These shoes are very comfortable . I can wear them all day . Canvas is sturdy and cleans easily . No arch , but foam insole is very comfortable .
5 #### This is my very first pair of Chucks , and I 'm old ! They are very comfortable , I 've worn them all day with no issues . They fit perfectly . And now I want some funky shoelaces to put in them ! Being old you can do weird things and people think you 're quirky , it 's lots of fun . So are these shoes !
4 #### Comfy shoe . Wore all day the first day with no problem . I usually have a problem with the spacing on the side with this type of shoe because my pinky toe pops out or " catches " in the opening . This one was great - no problem with that happening . :)
5 #### Bought this for my now 6 year old son for Christmas last year . He still rides it and loves it a year later . It has been a sound purchase . Just make sure your child wears a helmet , it goes pretty fast !
4 #### The assembly was relatively easy . It does however stink to high - heaven until you air it out . We left it outside overnight , and by the next morning one side had a rust stain on the blue cover . I do n't know how that happened , but oh well . My daughter likes it , and does use it frequently . It is a bit small , so you must put it somewhere with at least 3 feet perimeter for safety . I still recommend it despite the horrible smell .
5 #### this i have had for about 2 years and they are great they have n't ripped or anything they fit great and i recomend them heavily . i go hunting very often and they are great
4 #### I think my title says it all , love the watch but what a waste to even waste the money to have the date feature ... with a magnifying glass I can BARELY read the date . Not that small of a watch either , I do n't get it ? ? ? But for the money , great looking and keeps perfect time ... so even I would buy it again ( I 'd just buy a jeweler 's loupe to go with it :)
4 #### Got them for my brother in - law as a Christmas present . He 's a hunting guy . He loved them .
5 #### I am a woman 's 7 . Bought a boy 's 5 and they fit perfectly . These shoes are perfect / cute waterproof winter boots ! I 've worn mine nearly everyday since I received them just because they go with so much while also very functional .
5 #### I wear these bras almost exclusively . They give a slight " bullet " shape , which I feel makes me look slimmer than bras that create a rounder shape . And the seam does n't show up as much as most other conical - shape bras . Just wish I could find a version that is a little lower cut -- this tends to peek out from necklines .
5 #### I can not say anything bad about Timex . If you need a reliable watch and not spend a fortune check out timex collection .
5 #### Kids these days have much cooler toys that we did . Good pink color . Easy to work . No assembly , High quality . Low price . I 'll get pads later if needed - but this is a hit .
5 #### I 've had a case of tennis elbow that has persisted for 10 months . While shopping for the Band - It elbow strap , I read a review that mentioned using this bar for strengthening the affected muscles . I debated which bar to buy , and decided that since the problem was longstanding , I should start with the lightest resistance bar . That was a good choice . After doing the exercise for about 3 weeks , I was ready to move up to the next bar . I 've just received the red , 10 lb resistance bar , and I 'm starting to use it for the tennis elbow exercise . But I 'm not through with the 6 lb bar yet . I 've begun some of the other exercises shown in the flyer that comes with the bar . Maybe my weak , inflexible wrists and thumbs will benefit as well .
3 #### The level fits well on my Mossberg MVP under the scope . Some of the other reviews mentions that the threads stripped when the set screw was tightened . I could feel that the metal was soft when i tightened it down , so I did n't torque the bolt . It fit flush to the weaver mount , unlike others that saids theirs did n't . It did make it very easy to level the scope . Only time will tell if it holds up to shooting . As a note , the bolt that holds it together is not exposed on the mounting surface . This means that the level can be mounted anywhere on your rail system an not just in the groves . I was worried because I only had one groove left on my rail system , however I ended up placing the level on the back 2 cm of the rail , which worked out much better . This should be mentioned in the description somewhere .
5 #### Great to have when traveling or doing at home workouts . You have everything you need . Great quality .
2 #### I purchased these in a size 5 and after reading the size chart on the tongue of the shoe , saw that what I had actually purchased was a size 7 . Not sure how a size 5 translated into a size 7 . Other than that , I still love Converse sneakers , they are classics in any color . I may just donate them or give them to a friend .
5 #### Excellent shoe and colour . The length is true to form - my husband 's last pair was a size 13 , and it was too long . The size 12 good . However , he can only wear thin socks with these - next time I will buy him the wide size .
5 #### Good size knife for hunting and camping . Cleans and skins a deer easily . Very sharp out if the box . Looks good , too .
1 #### I purchased one of these for a camping trip in August . I tested it before I left and noticed that even on low the flames looked really fierce and hot(and loud ) , like a jet torch instead of the nice mellow low - setting flame on a kitchen stove top . I figured I was being a bit picky and it would probably be fine . Well it was n't . I was constantly burning the outside of all my food(and I do know how to cook well enough to not burn everything ) on the lowest possible setting . And the lowest possible setting is very tough to get on this grill . The flame would go out almost every time I tried to adjust to flame that low , and that caused another problem . The only " pan " I brought was a cast iron griddle . Now I have a burning hot cast iron griddle with food on it that I have to pick up in order to relight the flames that just went out . I have heat proof gloves for this , but the grill got the cast iron so hot that the gloves that are rated to 480 F started to melt . Needless to say cooking was the worst part of that trip , and it took a week to get the taste of burnt cooking oil out of my mouth . I returned the product to Amazon as defective very soon after the camping trip .
4 #### I really like these tights , but I did expect them to be more sheer and a little " shiny " . They are high quality nonetheless .
5 #### These are my favorite walk around shoes ! I can wear them all day and not be in pain ! Love em !
4 #### It 's been awhile since I bought a new pair of chucks and could n't remember what size I needed . Some reviews said to go down a half - size but unfortunately that was n't enough for me . I am normally a women 's size 9 but looks like I will need a size 8 to get the right fit . Looking forward to getting the correct size !
4 #### I like it overall but it 's MADE IN CHINA ! Even my Boonie Hat ? The quality seems good initially and it fits perfectly but it will never feel as good as MADE IN USA ! ! ! !
5 #### My son LOVED this costume ! It fit perfectly . He 's 3 , and he wore the 4 - 6 size . I guess it runs a tad small ...
5 #### Purchased to accompany my Autistic daughter 's school program . Decent sturdy design with no Velcro or awkward buckle . This is perfect for her , as it has the time learners as well as a " low stim " design . Even came in her favorite colors . ^_^
5 #### These shoes run large so order a size down . I wear a women 's size 10 ( equivalent to a men 's size 8) , and I ordered these in a 9 ( men 's 7 ) and it fits perfect . Best squatting and dead lifting shoes ever !
4 #### I like silver jewelry , but it does tarnish . Just a quick swipe with a silver polishing cloth and it is ready to go . I do n't see any difference between this cloth and others I have had .
5 #### The best you can buy , no regrets on this purchase and I am very happy using this !
5 #### One of the best brass hammers available . If you need a non marring hammer for gunsmithing then this is the one to get . They also make a 4 oz and an 8 oz brass hammer . Looks exactly like the picture provided by Amazon .
4 #### Pulls down in the crotch . The legs feel fine but I do n't like feeling that the crotch is partway down my thighs .
4 #### I have used Coleman products off and on over the years . This is my first propane stove and I am very pleased with its ease of operation . Gone are the days of tracking down Coleman white gas and the spilling it at just the wrong time and then smelling of gas for the next while . The fuel canisters are easy to find and easy to use . The stove lights easily and the burners are equally easy to temperature adjust to do a good job of cooking . This is a perfect " car camping " stove . I am glad I got it .
5 #### They work as advertised . Very easy to take off the scope and put it back on .
5 #### Great for small stoves or for heat to use with wet kindling
3 #### The shell is certainly hard and will protect you ; however , the internal cushions are covered by a soft tissue that will start to peel off since the first use .
5 #### Great pair of shoes . This order was to get a new pair of some old shoes .
5 #### YAY a waterproof watch that fits my daughter 's little wrist . Great product ; I 'm very satisfied .
5 #### This is my third pair of Merrell Jungle Mocs . They are so comfortable that I hardly notice them on my feet . They have great traction on wet surfaces and are easy to clean with a stiff brush . I would n't recommend buying them from Orvis . My first order arrived with the wrong size . Amazon was great and paid for the return and sent the replacement out again from Orvis , one day shipping . Orvis shipped the wrong size again . I called Amazon and got the same great customer service for which they are noted . Thankfully , this time the shoes arrived with the correct size although the box was crushed , but the shoes were not damaged . In fairness to Orvis , by having three different sizes on the box - UK , USA , and Euro , I can understand how a warehouse employee could make a mistake , however their management could have become active in seeing that the first replacement order went out correctly .
5 #### I found this to be very useful while rehabbing my hands & shoulder . It is a versatile tool with good visuals on how to use it .
5 #### Lowest scope mounts I 've found . Works great on my RSW Daina 460 with Utg compensator on it .
5 #### I love these for storage in the safe . Never have enough .
5 #### I am trying to get my gear as small and lightweight as possible for a bike tour next year . In this one small , almost weightless bag I was able to fit a ultra light sleeping bag a light blanket and a blow up pillow . It fits perfectly rolled up in my air mattress . I am glad I took the chance and bought it . It is also very tough which means no breaks , no coming apart at the seams . It also seems like it will be water resistant if not tight ( yet to be seen ) . I 'm impressed . I will now be ordering another one for my tent and one for my clothes . I liked these bags so much I bought two more . One is the perfect size for three changes of bicycle riding clothes . The other one will be for dirty clothes . I will have to get the next size up for my tent bag or use a much heavier compression bag .
1 #### Poorly made . Soils from panty liner sticker . I used these for rags after cutting out the crotch .
5 #### I have always loved boat shoes and these are really comfortable . At first the arch seemed really high and stiff on my feet and I thought about returning them but after I wore them for a few hours the arch wore down a little and them molded to my feet and are super comfortable . I got the lighter color as I already have a darker pair . They look good and classy but not over the top . I have them as my nicer pair for work / going out and my older darker pair for everything else .
5 #### I like them . They are sheer though which I was not expecting .
5 #### This is really a gorgeous watch . The numbers are clear on the white base , and the stain less steel band is dual shaded , which adds to its beauty . Received in very good condition . I bought it for 34 bucks from Amazon . It could be worn on all kinds of occasions and officially as well , displays date too . I bought it as a gift for some one , the price is also good .
4 #### Bought these as I start getting into cycling . They do run a little large as I am 5'10 and 180 lbs , 33 waist and the mediums are pushing a little big , but not bad . The grippers on the bottom hold the shorts in place well . The pad in on the thin side and seems a little broad , but I have had no soreness on rides up to 40 miles . I think it depends on how you personally like your chamois .
5 #### Wonderful sneakers ! They are comfortable and stylish . They run slightly large ( I wear a size 7 shoe , so I ordered a 7 ) . They are very roomie , but comfortable and I can wear thick socks with them if I need to .
5 #### this is the best thing to add to my shotgun . works like a charm . will be ordering more for all the guns I have you ca nt go wrong
3 #### I love the fit , style , ease of matching the minute and hour hands , but the way this watch is labeled is seriously challenging . For the minutes , it labels 5 - 10 - 15 - 20 - 30 correctly , but once it gets past 30 , instead of doing something logical for a kid like counting 35 - 40 - 45 - 50 - 55 .... it starts past 30 with ( -25 ) , ( -20 ) , ( -15 ) etc like it 's trying to teach them that 5:45 = " 15 minutes until 6 " etc . It 's been really hard for my daughter ( who is learning to tell time ) to differentiate past 30 minutes past the hour ... she can understand everything up until then , but then says " it 's 5:20 again ! " ( Actually 5:40 ) or " its 5:05 again ! " ( when it 's 5:55 ) . I wish this watch was labeled easily for a new learner .
2 #### cheap quality , 6 yr old rode for 3 weeks and bolts were falling off of it , he weighs almost nothing , very cheap , not like the others from a few yrs ago that all my other kids have , just like everyone else trying to make things cheaper and cheaper forgetting about customer satisfaction ...
5 #### For the range it enables you to see where you hit at just about any distance . I love them .
5 #### my husband wears one pair for work and another pair for house shoes . He was so surprised how not going barefoot has helped him with comfort . Still we both miss barefootin '
5 #### This is another great product from Carhartt and I know it will last me a good long time . I am tough on clothes but Carhartt holds their own against me . If you want something that will last and last and last , pick up one of these and I bet you will agree .
5 #### I GOT THIS OVER 13 YEARS AGO BY CROSS - MAN . IT 'S A GREAT PRODUCT . I SHOT A BUNCH OF RATS IN THE BACK YARD . AND AS A RETIRED OFFICER I GET TO PRACTICE AND STAY SHARP .
4 #### Great deal for the price . Not the best helmet out there , but still not a bad deal for the price .
4 #### These little pasters light up when shot , making very easy to see where one it hitting . A chartreuse circle on the target is much easier to see that a black hole on a black bullseye . They save a lot of walking back and forth to the target , for sure . Although a little pricey , I think they 're worth it .
5 #### I also have this on my keychain wherever I go ( be sure to wash it regularly if you do this ) . First time I blew it , I temporarily lost about half my hearing . So now I try to only use it in non - emergency situations when I have ear plugs or muffs on .
5 #### Love the CoC Hand trainers ! Get hands of iron . If you are an athlete hand strength training is a must do ... your hands are your link to the ball , the bat , the raquet , your opponent , etc ...
4 #### This item is fine . How can you go wrong on a lacrosse ball ? I bought two and use them for back massage .
5 #### These are great quality pans and I get more use from my toaster oven now . It 's nice to just heat the small toaster oven rather than the big oven sometimes . They clean very easily , too , which is a definite plus .
5 #### Cheap but a great price .. If we drown we will update the review ..
4 #### Simple but effective . This throws a fantastic spark and there is plenty of magnesium to start a lot of fires . Great value !
5 #### For the boat , passed the Coast Guard inspection with flying colors
5 #### Hubs ordered these for work , says very good quality , maybe a little heavy for summer wear , but that also means they are made with good fabric too !
5 #### I bought these for my youngest grandson . He likes blue . As it turned out he really enjoys them . They protect his hearing very well .
5 #### After reading all the reviews we decided to try these rather than pay 100s for prescription masks . THEY WORK ! If you follow the directions to the T they fit and stay put ! I had to cut down my wife 's pair with some scissors to make it fit . Will be ordering a second pair t take with us just in case .
2 #### These ran a bit small for me . Cut off circulation .
5 #### These are not only great for a consistent tee height but also last a long time . This latest order was a replacement for some that I had been using for quite some time . Definitely recommend .
5 #### I have worn the pants for years -- decades even ( well , not the same pair ! ) , and they are rugged and sized right . In my opinion , there is no equal , 'nuff said !
3 #### These panty hose did n't last past me trying to put them on . They appeared to run small and being petite this was a surprise . Poor overall quality from what used to be a reliable brand .
5 #### This is the only type I 'll buy anymore . It 's easy to attach and is pritty well out of the way . Matche 's the bike I have , and you almost ca n't tell It 's there . I 'll tell all my freind 's this is the one to buy .
4 #### Unfortunately Razor scooter 's rear wheels develop flat spots from braking . Both of my son 's scooters sounded as if he was riding on a cobblestone road even when he was riding on a smooth road . These wheels restored the quality of the ride to the smooth , like - new experience . ABEC 5 bearings turn easily , smoothly , and quetly Since the wheels are made from the same material as the original ones I am sure they will too develop flat spots . I ordered a set of red and a set of blue wheels to fix my son 's two seemingly identical scooters . Both rear wheels and blue front wheel fit perfectly . However the red front wheel was rubbing in plastic inside the front fork . I had to use a utility knife to cut away some of the plastic inside the front fork . I am surprised because these were the wheels recommended for my scooters , and I specifically chose the Razor brand wheels over much cheaper aftermarket ones to avoid fit issues . Still , my son is riding happily on his scooters , so overall it was worth it .
5 #### Totally love the jungle moc . I order a couple pair per year .
5 #### Excellent hat ! well designed and fit perfectly . I highly recommend it !
5 #### Typical Hanes quality . Good weight , sized just right , made pretty well
5 #### This was my favorite pair of jeans . Except they got torn . So I copied the size off the label , an viola ! They were too small . in the waist and thighs .. And not by a little bit either . I am a 27 length and these appear to measure out correctly . If I could have sucked it in and lost another inch , I would have kept them . But the material and construction were excellent . Liked the color alot . Liked the style . Material is heavy , but not as much as the L brand . Return policy was painless , in fact easy . Not a lot of questions . Particularly liked the return pick up option by UPS . Worked out the pick up day was the replacement pair delivery day Arrived on time , Packaged only in oversized plastic bags . I have already ordered again
2 #### I * * loved * * these shoes when I got them . I 've noticed that the foam inside tends to compress during a workout , though . I 'll lace them tightly enough that they 're nearly cutting off my circulation . 20 minutes later , I 'm sliding out of them while doing sled pushes .
5 #### So glad to be able to have the tennis balls delivered .
5 #### I bought the set - pants and jacket and these are great ! I hunt in the swamps of South Florida and these keep the mosquitoes away and let the breezes in ! They are also tough , I have hucked through all kinds of tall grasses , bushes , trees etc and no damage whatsoever ! I would buy again in a heartbeat . Can I get them in camo ? ? Also they are very baggy , which works fine for me but maybe not everyone . I got medium and you could fit two of me in them .
5 #### I love this wallet so much my daughter bought one in blue . It has so much space for cards , money , coupons , coins , pictures and more but is n't bulky . The color is beautiful and smells of fresh leather . Great buy !
5 #### Idk about the Knife Snobs claiming any issues with this knife , But I know I love it . I ordered it and got it the day before going to Hatfield & McCoy trails in West Virginia for a 3 days atv ride and stay in the woods ! I forgot a bottle opener . This knife opened probably 24 bottles without any damage , bends , breaks or any sort of blade discoloration . No easy feat . This knife Looks mean and the holster for it worked flawlessly . I was able to carry a lighter and a sharpening stone in the pocket of it . I got plenty of compliments on this guy . Highly Recommend !
5 #### These Bushnell 7x35 Binoculars work just great , This is my second pair to buy I use them to deer hunt with and they are super clear and very easy to focus . I watch around the edge of fields were I hunt and they work just great . I would not buy any better or more costly because it would be a waste of money these work as good as any that cost 100.00 plus and as always working with Amazon is great as usual . these work GREAT
3 #### the miniature tampons , YES tampons , they are much better , durable and they are very inexpensive . i am certain the company who makes these got the idea from some woman 's magazine or tv add as well . I always carry three or four in my pack .
5 #### Converse do not have arch support built in . The best arch support add in would be Birkenstock Blue Footbeds .
1 #### I am disappointed in this board . The first one I bought was with the cabinet . That one wore out so I bought this to replace it . I used it for a week and played a few games and found that it has many dead spots . Dart will bounce out even though they are hitting the board and not the wire . Most of the bad areas were closer to the bullseye on numerous numbers . Also the double bullseye had bad spots which is not cool . Hopefully I can find a better one .
4 #### Had a lot of pain in my inner elbow ( golfer 's elbow ) and bought this to strengthen it . it is easy to use and does n't take a lot of time per day to use . It will probably make a difference in the long run if it does n't sit on my floor by the abmaster . Even so , I do n't use as much as I should .
5 #### this stuff is so good I used to get it at the museum as a kid and when I seen it I ordered it
5 #### keeps dry dry - tight snaps , cubed foam for precise contents holding , ca n't crush it short of a sledgehammer
5 #### Perfect fit , great shipping . Now if I could just hit the damn bag consistantly .
4 #### Got this to do some should / bicep tendinitis rehab . Serves its purpose . Good oscillation for the shoulder help and is enough stiffness to use for the bicep / elbow pain . Come with instruction for the bicep / elbow pain but if you want to use for shoulder then try youtube for some info .
5 #### Has a fish like odor . Works as advertised . Smell goes away when burning . Takes one tab to boil 16 oz of cold tap water at 65F ambient air . Very light weight and works great with the stove / pot combo by Esbit . Will probably need to double bag and carry in outside pack pocket ; recommend for those looking for a lightweight fuel solution . Update : Used on recent hiking trip . Double bagged in a freezer bag without any smell leaking out . Boiled water in 8 minutes at 10,200 feet . Used with a aluminum windbreak . Leaves a black residue on bottom of cup / pot . Recommend wrapping bottom in aluminum foil to prevent . Would recommend .
5 #### I use one of these knives for garden work and decided to get one for the camping / possibles box . Excellent quality , well - made , and built with safety in mind . Additional to closing the razor , you must first push on the thumb - opening button before you can open the knife , which prevents the blade from opening inadvertently . The rubber insert help hold the device when your hands are wet . Knife blade is sharp from the factory(carrying pouch also holds several band - aids :> ) ) . Strong side - locking device for blade . Pouch flap , when closed , also serves to keep the razor blade dispenser from falling out .
5 #### Great scooter , definitely is very durable and do not see it breaking anytime soon .
3 #### Simply a strap Just what I wanted . I added two 1 " clips to it for me shotgun works perfect and the prices is right ! Git one fur yersef .
4 #### if i had continued to make my own slingshots this is what it would look like . frogs where the usual target ai n't many frogs left something else is targeting them and its pollution our final solution .
5 #### I bought this because it looks simple but classy and has indiglo . I wish all watches had indiglo . Works fine so far and can get a little wet with no worries . Takes a lickin and keeps on tickin . I wish more things were still made in the U.S. Yes it 's an American company but as usual most stuff is made in China .
4 #### Okay so I lost , misplaced my summer hat on in a style similar to this one . So I had to find a replacement and this one will serve me well . The little band is perfect to display pins if you happen to be into displaying them . My military pins adorn my hat .
1 #### Awful . Unreliable at best , terrible at worst . Steer clear of this overpriced pain in the butt !
4 #### This watch works well and it is easy to change dates and times . You will have to reset the date most months . I 'm presently replacing the band but I 'm pretty hard on watches .
5 #### I swim so fast at the pool I was almost kicked out and have my leisure pass revoked . Clarity , wow . I 've never seen so many feet underwater . Not that I stare at feet .
4 #### These socks do what they 're supposed to do , which is slip on the gun and protect it from minor bumps and scratches . They fit all my unscoped rifles very well . They are snug , but that 's not a problem unless you have a scope mounted or a rifle with pistol grips . If you have either of those things , these will not fit . But they are fine for regular , plain rifles . Good price too .
1 #### Bought this once , and it never arrived . Bought again a d took to Alaska and the entire trip had double vision . No matter how many adjustments I made . Ca n't explain how mad and disappointed I was to be in Alaska with defective binoculars .
5 #### Perfect fit , nicely made . Just the ticket for a 38 - in . rifle !
5 #### My wife wears these at work . She says their comfortable and loves the different color choices . She 's on her second pair . Tried a different brand for about one week between the two pairs and bought the second pair . Said the other shoes did n't compare . Worth the $ $ .
3 #### This bra was ok but it is a bit big . I returned it and got a 32DDD and it fit better .
5 #### My husband is 6'2 " . He likes the Tall size because it falls below his waist . I like Carhartt shirts because they hold up through many washings .
2 #### Been using a set of Peltor 6s since 1999 . My old pair gave up the ghost after 13 years . The new ones are nice but they seem to eat batteries in the left side . 5/15 Update : Right side muff does n't work . The quality of these things has gone down hill , way down hill . Talked with a 3 M Peltor rep at a trade show , she said it would cost way more to have them fixed than to replace . She recommended their comtac muffs . Those are $ 500 ! Ridiculous ! My 16 year relationship with Peltor 's products is over . Going to try MSA .
5 #### I gave them to my boyfriend as a gift and he loved them ! They fit just like his other pair only the pricing on Amazon is so much better than retail stores . Very happy with the purchase
4 #### These run smaller than they did the last time I bought a pair . Of course , that was many years ago , since these shoes last forever . The new pair , aside from being a little snug , are still very well - made . I prefer this style because it 's more like a sandal , with lots of open spaces for air flow . Other Keen 's sandals are more like tennis shoes than sandals , because the shoe covers so much of the foot . These are sturdy and comfortable and great for hikes in warm or wet weather .
5 #### Was not really sure what I .was going to get , but this was better than I hoped for . Very nice , rugged construction for years of use .
5 #### My usual store quit selling extra tall men 's shirts . I had to branch out to find clothes for my son . I had to learn new sizing and new brands . I am happy that I found this product . Great quality . Sorry for the company that ran me off . Happy I could find a replacement .
5 #### Ordered two of these previously and they work perfectly . Shipped fast and arrived packaged well . Ordered two more for the other side of the boat . Seems to hold up to exposure to the elements .
1 #### If you 're familiar with the USA Carhartt T 's from about 10 years back , these are not the same . The material is thinner on the newer version , and they fit slightly bigger . The colors also fade faster , and these wear faster . Still a good shirt , but disappointing if you are familiar with the older version of these t - shirts . Update : As Carhartt continues to manufacture these shirts in new and different countries , the fit and quality of the fabric has become more and more inconsistent . Therefore my rating is dropping . I would pay the premium for the old USA shirts , but not for the new variations of the shirt . It 's not worth it , and the inconsistencies . Especially online since sizing is hit or miss .
5 #### She loves the color and light weight of the jacket . Also , the quality of the workmanship and materials . The fit was also accurate for her .
5 #### These were to replace the same model that I bought 5 years ago that were worn out from so much wear ! I love that they are waterproof , I can hike in them and not slip , and the bumper protects my toes . I also like that when my feet get hot they do n't seem to make the shoes smell funny .
4 #### Hopefully the heaviness means durable . I like it though and i like how it locks itself shut . A quick hit with a flashlight and you can see the directions and guide lines in pitch darkness .
4 #### Good quality , does what it does best .... hold the sling . Finish is a little spotty but not anything you would notice from arms length away .
5 #### 1/2 oz rat - l - trap is a large mouth bass machine . Get some relatively heavy line ( 17 + ) and a 7 ' rod to chuck it out , reel it in fast , and boom- violent strikes . I use this lure 95 % of the time for NC bass all year and own several in case I lose one . My son calls this the " secret weapon " . Stop messing around and order a bunch . Silver with black trim is my fav .
4 #### Just what I expected . As usual , I am completely satisfied and will not hesitate to reorder . Good quality and value for the money
5 #### Coleman is the best - decent price with high quality build and works as needed .
5 #### I bought my son in law a set of bib overalls and this jacket . He was /is overjoyed .
1 #### The sizing for man / women was confusing and the show was way too big . Find a converse sizing chart when ordering
1 #### These tights are plain weird . I am 5 feet 4 inches and weighs 130 pounds so I ordered three pairs of mediums . They tight did not stay up . I pull them up and 15 minutes later the waist bands are around my crotch and the crotch are around my mid thigh and I am doing the penguin walk . Ugh ! ! !
4 #### I bought this to aid in treating tennis elbow . Although I was not certain it would help , after a week I began to notice an improvement . Within two weeks I was pain free .
4 #### i bought a pair from DSW for 50 $ and they are very comfortable but i bought a size 6.5 when I normally where a size 7 . and even the 6.5 feels a little roomy . I have wide flat feet btw . i m not sure if I will keep them even though i love their look and comfort . I 've been having feet problems while taking a gym class and I think they wo n't give me enough support when running . they 're great for wearing at home or gym and doing exercises in one place- extremely light weight and flexible , but i do n't know if they 'll last long if you use them everywhere else . :( i really like them but i ca nt just buy 2 different shoes . also , i really like the strings inside the lining on the side of the shoes to adjust and make the shoe fit snug . it makes me feel secure :D
5 #### Bought these Chuck T 's as a gift for my son . He has purchased these himself and knew the size . I bought the black ones as well as the gray ones . They look great and according to him they feel great and wear great ! Highly recommend !
5 #### Throw this along with a good lock blade Swiss Army knife and a baggie of dry starter kindling into your ' Bug Out Bag ' and your good to go .
5 #### These shoes fit great and are very comfortable ; color is great . I like them a lot -- they are a great casual shoe .
5 #### Nice . Much better than my older 20 yr ago model .
4 #### Wear inserts with the shoes , they are not ' feet friendly ' but really love the style so spend money on inserts to provide needed supported
5 #### Before I ordered this shirt , I read that one of the customer reviews said the Carhartt t - shirts run large , but I could not imagine that my 6'7 " 250 pound son could ever wear a medium so I ordered a large anyway . The large was huge ! It was my first time to return anything to amazon , and it was a breeze . They make it very easy and pay for return shipping . They had UPS pick it up at my house and even had UPS provide the return label . The only kicker was that Carhartt does n't make the medium in tall so I was out of luck getting him a Carhartt t - shirt .
5 #### What 's not to like about Swiss Army Knives ? I prefer one over a multi - tool any day .
5 #### Unlike others , I found this seat perfect because it fits a bucket snugly , wo n't come up if you turn it upside down , but still removes easily without getting stuck . Thicker and sturdier than I expected , too . I 'll buy more as Festivus gifts to give with the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Bucket - Boss - Tool - Organizer / dp / B000022439 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Bucket Boss Tool Organizer</a > .
5 #### Love these heads , have used everything else out there and these are hands down the best on the market , buy theses and forget all the other junk out there.when these hit a deer it 's game over
5 #### Works as expected for me . I wear them inside nitrile gloves at work while working with COLD produce and they keep my fingers from going numb . :) periodically I need to let air to them to keep them warm and they last more than 10 hours the way I use them .
2 #### The product was misrepresented . It was not made by DOAN and Government Issue like it was advertised . Next time I will buy from Midwayusa like I have in the past and get Real ones Made by DOAN and in the USA .
4 #### Wish they d bring the old quality back . They are still good shirts , but not what they used to be .
5 #### Item works great , easily identify the target and send rounds down range . Have to approach the target to verify shot placement .
4 #### My husband was in a Wizard of Oz skit and he was the Scarecrow . I ordered this costume , along with a separate straw accessory kit . The costume was made from a very flimsy fabric ( including the hat ) , but the overall look was that of scarecrow . To add more authenticity to the look , I bought a bag of raffia from my local craft store and hot - glued several strands around the hat , the sleeves , and the pants to give him more overstuffed - with - straw look . It served its purpose and my husband retained his dignity for wearing a scarecrow costume .
5 #### Just got this as my first wrist release . It 's comfortable , cheap , and has n't misfired yet . The trigger is very very light . Pulls back perfectly , my bow is set to around 80 lbs . Seems like it should be pretty durable .
5 #### It 's Great ! ! ! I was sporting both of them at last Sunday 's and Thursday nights games ... They stay affixed the entire freeway trip ... there and back . Would highly recommend the item !
5 #### First of all I have read some very positive and very negative reviews of this scope . For my first long range spotting scope that I use at the range I have to say that so far in the couple of times that I used it .... I love it . I like to shoot 100 yards ( which is very easy to see ) , and 200 yards also pretty easy to tell where you are hitting . I shoot mainly 5.56 and .22 LR at my out door gun club . I would recommend using a good sturdy tripod but otherwise I have had zero problems with this scope and I am pretty picky . I have had some time when it 's cold that the heat of my body around the eye piece has caused a little fogging but really that is no big deal and easily fixed . At the price that I paid I am completely satisfied and happy with this product . As a professional videographer I have access to great lenses and sure this is not the greatest glass but it actually really gets the job done for sighting in your scope and checking your targets at the range . While I know there are other great and way more expensive spotting scopes I was very happy with the purchase . It takes a little getting used to but once you dial it in you can see great . Hope this helps .
5 #### I bought these for use with a breville oven . I wish they made a little bigger ones but these work fine .
5 #### Nice , high quality leather . That means they take some time to break in - but once they do they are SUPER comfy and will last forever . Plus , the style ca n't be beat .
5 #### Originally , I was worried I would have to drill a hole into my gun when I first started looking for straps . When I found this I thought I 'd give it a try . Worked great for an all day multi - mile hike for those long beards !
3 #### The strap does n't seem as robust as my old one and is a little shorter . I only have a couple of holes free .
4 #### Serves the purpose . Seemed thicker thank kick stands that come with bikes . But it dies the job who cares what it looks like right ?
5 #### This is n't as ' sexy ' as some bras , but it looks GREAT under clothes , and is supportive without feeling constrictive . Sometimes when this is sold in outlets , something is ' off ' in the material ; it 's a little scratchy .... but from Bali or as this was sold from Amazon , it 's l00 % right . Washes well and lasts so much better than some of the fragile bra fabrics . Maybe not so special for ' date night ' , but for a great bra to wear all week , it 's terrific .
5 #### Nice looking and numbers are easy to read . Got this for my teenage son ( 5'11 " ) and it looks good ( not too small ) .
4 #### I 'm mostly using the black and red bands . The lighter strength ones are pretty much useless to me . Maybe at some point I 'll add them to the black and red . The door anchor is ingenious though .
5 #### As usual they are as expected . A quality slip on moc that is very comfortable . The inky footwear I wear anymore other then duty boots and sandals
5 #### Great product , fits well and seems durable . I would recommend this product to others . Chances are I will purchase more of these in the future .
5 #### I have owned a pair of knock offs of this shoe and really liked the style . I got these and I love them . They are warm and so comfortable to walk in . The sizing is perfect .
5 #### Seeing that snow pants in bright colors are typically pricey , that women 's pants within my budget were in boring colors ( white , black , gray , booo ! ) , and that I only snowboard 1 - 2 times per season , I opted for looking into youth sizes . I 'm 5'2 " 115 lb and wear Size 26 " in pants , and x - large fit me pretty perfectly ! The length was perfect for when I had my snowboard gear on , and velcro straps allowed me to make the waist snugger ( in picture , red pants is me in youth size , and orange pants were men 's size medium also from Arctix for a 5'9 " 150 lb adult ) . So far I have only worn these once , and for about 5 - 6 hours ? and I fell down a lot so I can definitely say these were snow - proof . Not so much waterproof though , for my pants got a little soaked when I fell into a slushy area . Colors held up well so far after one wash . Overall , I would say I 'm happy with this purchase and ca n't wait to go snowboard again in the next season in these pants !
5 #### Omg I love these . I wear these with my sissy pouch panties and I feel sassy and turned on . I have wore these a few times and they are just my favs . Will order again for sure . Lots of room to play . Just perfect
5 #### My wife loves to hunt flies with this thing . Works well !
5 #### This is as close to regulation as possible . It is regulation material , and lights up very well . Long enough lasting batteries , and so simple that it is easy enough to work on if it breaks . Also I can attest to it being waterproof
5 #### These are extremely adorable on my son ! Fits a bit bigger than his Nike tennis shoes of the same size , but he will just have plenty of room to grow .
4 #### Good for holding in the slip , however not that great for just a quick tie up . Or in windy weather they streach a lot
5 #### Nothing wrong with these . The kids and I have had a blast with these . Yes the foam will eventually stress and tear and yes the plastic pvc pipe inside will eventually break . For now , these are great and my kids can not put them down . Brought them to park to practice after watching a few instructional videos and they held up to a bit of abuse . For the price the entertainment value is excellent . In terms of using these as instructional tools - absolutely perfect . I do n't see these breaking anytime soon except with an unfortunate accident as they are well made ( as long as you do n't try to beat someone really hard with one of these they will certainly last through many sparring sessions ) .
5 #### nice for the money . lasts forever . easy to clean . thick enough for 220 lbs user .
5 #### Took this when I went on vacation and it survived being in the ocean / pool for countless hours and water never got into it !
5 #### I really like this watch - the black and silver pretty much go with whatever you 're wearing , and I 'm not worrying about trying not to knock it on something because it might get scuffed up . Mine does roll around on my wrist a little bit , but I have smaller wrists and I do n't like to have my watch bands too tight - I 'll live with it . The Indigo is also a great feature , I do n't have that on my other watchs .
4 #### There not fancy there not special . They just burn good and it does the job if I had use them all I 'd prolbly buy more
4 #### Work fine . No complaints . Good value . They sit on my porch and I use them to look a birds , animals and anything of interest that I notice on the street . No problems .
4 #### really glad i could find silk undies for less then $ 45 a piece . took one star off for sizing , but i always seem to have sizing issues . xs fits more like a small .
5 #### I brought these boots for my son and he loves them . He wants to wear them everyday . I like them too and love the price I paid for them .
5 #### Amazing ! I 've been dealing with lateral epicondylitis ( tennis elbow ) for 4 months . After a few days of just one exercise with this I am nearly pain free for the first time in months ! I can finally use my right arm again .
5 #### Was very pleased with these Wrangler jeans . They are well made , and a perfect fit . The design is very good , and they did not shrink with washing . Thank you , Amazon !
5 #### What a great sign to hang in a neighborhood where the team is not a favorite . It creates a lot of conversation and amusement . Once a " Bear"fan - always a " Bear"fan . This sign conveys the message .
5 #### I always buy these as my day to day boots and they never let me down . Love em .
5 #### Big and tall clothes are always expensive but this Carhartt shirt was a grat price and grat looking . Will buy more .
5 #### Wow ! My new Keen Venice H2s JUST arrived . I had to go write a review right away , because I was stunned at the amazing comfort ... right out of the box ! ! I 'm normally a flip - flop girl but will be doing a bit of hiking on vacation and needed something that could support my bad feet better . If I ca n't wear a flip - flop , these are the way to go !
5 #### I buy this shoe to avoid buying several shoes for the kids in one school year . This color is a uniform school shoe color and this shoe last the entire school year and more but I stick to tradition of a new one each school year .
5 #### Does exactly what is claimed and is easy to rate the results from a distance . Will buy more of these targets in the future .
4 #### When I took these out of the package I was amazed . They reached from the floor to my chin . When I put them on they fit fine . Strange . I find that pantyhose are difficult to find in the stores as I am told by my daughter that one is not supposed to wear hose anymore . What ! Every blemish on your legs shows and you look naked . Unfinished and ugly look . Hanes , keep making pantyhose . You make the best .
4 #### The shoes have a very fresh look but they are so hard to clean being that there white definetly not your every day pair of shoes .
5 #### LOVE these nieces of mine are extra spoiled absolutely love converse and these fit well were a great style too
3 #### They look nice but they run way large I usually wear size 12 and ordered 11 1/2 they are two sizes too big I should have ordered 10 1/2
4 #### I used the sizing chart and the fit was correct to the chart . The shirts are heavier duty than most T shirts and seem well made . The only thing that I marked them down for is they come out of the wash looking like they need to be ironed .
4 #### Nice quality if only it really did fit in the toaster oven . Everything does except the cupcake pans .
5 #### Use it to clip the first bolt in sport climbing every now and then . Give me the confidence when the first bolt is very high like 15 feet . Fit better with metal gate carabiner , not the wire gate .
3 #### Decent fit , a lil stiff , a bit heavy for a boat shoe ...
5 #### used for the first time for a 16 mile trip and I felt it as a 100 bucks short . I will try it again next weekend on a 60 mile round to see how it behaves .
4 #### They were a bit small when I first put them on . After wearing them awhile they soon fit well for me .
5 #### Is there anything better than the sound of a chain net ? ! It is easy to put on and as others have said you will need a solid pair of players to crimp the hooks to prevent them from coming off while playing . But this will make it permanent and they do n't wear out like regular nets , especially from people hanging on them .
5 #### Love the looks and feel of these pantyhose . Has enough support without being uncomfortable . I hate hurdles one spanks , things go that nature but these control tops are great . Love the sheerness of it . Totally happy with purchase .
3 #### Merrell Men 's Jungle Moc Slip - On , Gunsmoke,13 W is a not so good fit for my son . I wish Merrell made more WIDE and extra - wide shoes . These were a struggle to get on over socks . After a couple of weeks he admitted to me that he could not wear them but was unable to find the box and receipt for a few days but when he did he brought them over to me . We printed off a return label and immediately took them to UPS for a return . The easy Amazon refund only took a few days .
5 #### I 'm on my second one now , lost the first . I 've got this one secured with an S biner and some paracord . The long handle is comfortable , the long saw , long blade , large scissors are great . The little phillips head screwdriver is awesome , used it a lot on battery doors on electronic devices .
4 #### I have somewhat narrow ( not super skinny -- a narrow - ish " B " ) feet , and although these sandals will adjust to my foot if I pull enough , I end up with a absurdly long"tail " ---so long it has to be tucked under and then looped again into a loose knot . ( see images of the tail attached ) This is not such a huge deal unless you are in India going in and out of temples every five minutes . If you have REALLY skinny feet ( like a true AA , or AAA , find a different sandal -- you will break your neck on the endless laces ) So , these shoes are somewhat short in length ( go up 1/2 size ) and really wide ( I would call the normal short lace tuck as in the marketing pictures a " C " width ) . They are however , * supremely comfortable * , so I 'm keeping them and dealing with the long pull and " tuck and loop " . ( I just notice , that Amazon states above that I bought a 5 B , lol . I have no idea where that came from . Try doubling that and more -- I bought a 10.5 " B " ( in reality " C " ) I am normally a 10 B / AA .
5 #### Have n't yet used this product yet but the quality is terrific and I 'm looking forward to learning how to use a compass and being more self sufficient ... and not getting lost !
5 #### This is our second set of these bases ; the first set lasted for years . They are very durable ! My boys ( ages : 16 , 13 & 10 ) play baseball everyday . My youngest son always has his friends over and these bases are used over and over . We just leave them out in the yard . They lasted for years , before I finally needed to purchase a new set . Definitely worth the purchase !
5 #### Does what it 's suppose to do ! Always good to have after a good clean of the arms
5 #### I never have any problems with Weaver mounts .. If you get the right size and height you 'll never go wrong .. I use mine on a 10 - 22 and a 25 - 06 single shot bull barrel ..
4 #### I like my briefs to cover me and not be too high on the legs . These are perfect . Easy to wash .
5 #### My daughter loves converse shoes . We ordered two different colors in the same size and the orange pair ran a little big .
4 #### Only used for about a week but so far it seems good quality and very useful for at home use . Only gave four stars as I will update later to see how well they maintain their strength .
2 #### I love the look of chucks but these shoes started to fall apart after a few weeks of wear , normal wear , not running over hot coals or completing spartan races but walking to my car and around shops . It started to split where the canvas meets the rubber sidewall and toe . I wo n't be buying these again .
5 #### It 's a cute top , works good for nursing and lazy do n't care how I look days .
4 #### You really ca n't be the convenience and/or the price . Bought two , will probably buy two more for the rest of the family .
5 #### If you 're tired of paying people to bore sight for you , here 's your answer . This is simple to use and very intuitive to set up . It comes with several arbors to fit most barrels . I 'm very happy with it .
5 #### Great hosiery . I will definitely purchase more in the future .
3 #### I did n't like it , I guess the sizes run too small
5 #### when I first got these I found the toe area was hitting my toes as I walked , so they were a little small . However after wearing them a few days this stopped as they got more relaxed . They are very comfortable and I wore them every day in the summer . You can jog in them too . They are not great for hiking as the twigs and pebbles get in the shoe frequently .
5 #### I 've worn this bra for years and know it fits well and lasts long .
5 #### The single best bra in the world . Classic style and shape . As a guy this is the best bra I have ever worn . If it was n't for the 5 hook clasp and strap adjustment sliders you could never tell I was wearing a bra . I would suggest to wear a nylon camisole to further disguise detection . I have a few very understanding women who enjoy going out wearing the same bra . Adds an element of excitement and naughtiness . I like the giggle I get when you can see the bow through the v of my thick polo . I could care less but they find it embarrassing if I was caught while out with them . I wear bras for the pure fetish of it . I have handed this bra out like candy to many a women who also verify it as the best they have worn . No strap slides or fidgeting with it as it stays place with out of this world comfort and support . For the price you will not find a better bra !
3 #### My fault , thought I checked the high top version . Already got rid of the box and receipt . Oh well , first time buying online , lessons learned to go slow .
5 #### Sent this to my 7 yr old grandson & family . Had one of these bigger version years ago , it flew forever . Saw it here on Amazon & thought this new smaller version would be just right for them , hoping it would still fly like old days . They have had it a week now & have used it a few times . My grandson thinks it is awesome ! My son & daughter in law ca n't believe how far it goes . My son asked me why he never got one when he was little & tells me we spoil our grandson . They all love it , that 's what counts .
5 #### My 6 year daughter loves her new scooter . Great quality and very cute ! Would buy again !
5 #### Have not gotten a concussion since wearing this helmet . Very effective at its job .
5 #### Keeps time and fits . The word requirement is forcing me to add at least six more words before allowing submission .
5 #### For the price these are surprisingly well made and definitely do the trick for protecting your rifles from getting banged up in the safe or rifle bag . I live on the coast in a humid and rainy environment so particularly like the way the fabric is infused with what appears to be similar to what is on silicone cleaning cloths . I know this will be helpful in preventing corrosion . Do your self a favour and buy the six pack because if you just buy one you 'll be back reordering more anyway . They 're that good .
1 #### Not for 50 cal muzzle loader rifles ... like cva models . Like i was told .
5 #### First off , yes you can get several of the cheaper yoga mats for the price of this one . But to me , this is worth it . Cons : heavy Expensive Pros : thick and comfy wider and longer then standard yoga mat lifetime guarantee grippy texture top and bottom I love it , and it makes me want to do my yoga everyday .
5 #### Perfect , quality chucks . Came early and it my daughter perfectly .
5 #### good quality , good price , timely delivery . Just what I needed . It is a simple shell holder so there is not much more to say about it .
5 #### Easy to put together . My 6 year old loves it and rides it really well . Keeps up with her older siblings very easily . Well made .
3 #### I would say if you are new to fitness these are great . If not than do n't buy these . They will just sit in your basement .
5 #### Exactly as described . Clear plastic with 3 sliding sheets . They slide in and out easily , hold lots of earrings , makes it easy to see what you have and keep the dust out . Great buy .
5 #### One of my favorites , my other favorite is my blue one .
5 #### These are a very well made T , There pre - shrunk so do n't plan on any shrinkage with these T 's , If your a XL consider a LG they 'll fit fine , unless you like the neck opening to be a little large , well made T though .
4 #### Good buy , one size larger and you will be comfortable !
5 #### Cute but kind of weird in the pool so it sits in the shed ... still a good product !
5 #### I love that I can angle this as needed even as I ride , and even with the slight touch of a finger for when going up or down hills and need a tiny adjustment for that moment . Accurate distance , not the unrealistic " objects may be closer than they appear " which would be dangerous for bike riders .
1 #### I have used these resistance bands sporadically , at best . I generally only take these on vacation to help be consistent with my exercise routine . Two have failed at the attachment end ( to the handle ) . The first was the heavy yellow and today the red . If you have never broken an elastic exercise band , let me tell you ; it hurts . Even the small diameter bands can cause a great deal of pain . Will try other manufacturer .
5 #### We 've had this stove for upwards of 25 years , and it has withstood the test of time , weather , and all kinds of camping conditions . The stove has accompanied us on camping outings in Alaska , Canada 's wild lakes ( for canoe and kayak camping ) and on our average family summer camping vacations . It is lightweight , sturdy and a great way to prepare hot cakes , eggs and coffee in the morning . For larger families , there are of course larger Coleman stoves . But for a family of two to four , this item is perfect .
3 #### if you need room from your bow to thw string this will reach i bought this to shoot my wifes bow in the back yard goofing off i figure we could both shoot the same bow it worked for it but no adjustment at all .
1 #### I was able to use this ( along with other levels ) to mount a scope to a rail . However , I could not tighten it down because it would go out of alignment as the screw tightened . I tried different sections of the rail but got the same results . It worked as an aid for scope mounting but I would not be able to use it permanently to check that the rifle is level in the field without being able to torque it down .
1 #### My almost 2 year old daughter does not fit in this costume . The reviews said it ran small but I mean it runs VERY small . My daughter is big for her age ( 37 inches and 33 pounds ) but it 's labeled to size 6 ! No way an average 4 year old could fit . The bottom opening is super narrow . The hat came damaged- squished in transit . The hat is also HUGE ! It 's too big for me ! Bottom line -- it 's super small and do n't expect the hat to be usable for a child . It 's cute if it fits .
5 #### So comfortable , I do n't even feel like I have a sneaker on . Based on the other reviews I got a half a size up and glad I did .
5 #### Comfortable and quality mat that folds up for convenient storage .
5 #### Perfict fit for me . Great looking shoes at a great price .
2 #### Too small . They look great , but the Sebago three lace in similar style works better for me .
5 #### Nice low sting ball that are very easy on bats
5 #### This watch is femine , and will help your little girl to learn how to tell time . Plus the ballet slippers on the second hand is a special little treat . Easy to put on no buckle to deal with .
5 #### love the soft carpet on the one side . put two together and filled em up . pout a double sheet over it and it was super comfy , ca nt wait to use em again . the material seems to be strong and I think Ill likely get many more uses out of them .. good item ... great price . def ca n't complain . just get a air pump to fill em ... my lungs are n't what they used to be ... lol
5 #### I have n't worn any other brand of panties for years . They fit great and wash well . I do wish they did n't have the label in the back , though . They 're scratchy and I always cut them out . Otherwise : perfect panties
5 #### I 'm absolutely in LOVE with this wallet . LOVE the texture , color & the NEW LEATHER SMELL . I realize quite a few of you do n't appreciate the smell but if leather is tanned correctly , there is nothing to me that smells so good - well , maybe my horse - but that 's another story . Hope this helps as I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS WALLET!!!!!This wallet has everything I have been looking for . It has enough credit card slots I use some of them for my medical cards etc . It 's roomy but not huge . I ordered the Mahogany color . It matches my shoulder bag & my Burgundy purse beautifully .
4 #### Like all things it is n't as nice and solid as the old original games that I grew up with but its a fun game and we have enjoyed having one in our lives again .
3 #### Did not like the plastic cover over screws . But they work .
4 #### This is a very good music stand . Steady , has a lot room for all my sheets musics , has a separated space for storing pencil , tuner , eyes classes , etc . A good buy for the money
4 #### It 's comfortable in my hands and I would n't bother with the padded version . It 's built well and mine came with a door attachment . I got the ultra heavy version and was thinking it would be a total joke . I personal would n't call this thing ultra heavy , but it 's good enough for a decent workout .
5 #### I ordered these for denim and pink day at our school . I never thought I would get them on time , but if did and they are great . Thanks for the quick delivery !
5 #### nice ! ninja like stuff.lol . its cool . does nt scream attention but shows class.its d kind of matured stuff i like alot
5 #### I just love these wallets and they are impossible to find in any stores locally . I just started using this one because my old one is still in good shape . These wallets are pretty durable . I also love the color . One of these days I might update my wardrobe , including money and credit card holders but in the meantime , I will be using these Buxton wallets as long as I can still find them .
5 #### My daughter wears these ALL the time . They are her favorite shoe !
5 #### I love these ! I 've worn Chuck Taylor high tops for many many years . I work in an office and am continuously on the go . Theses are great .
5 #### These are great . I did purchase clasps for one end to attach to my pontoon boat , and have used multiple times . Extremely pleased and I had others inquire on them .
5 #### These are great support hose . They fit well and are very durable . I can wear them several times . I will definitely buy them again .
5 #### Very good sneakers , the most comfortable ever . And also one of the cheapest ! I 'd like to try some of the new Converse models
5 #### The razor scooters are durable and fun . I 'm the mom and I even enjoy riding it ! For the price , you ca n't really beat it . These scooters are a hit with the neighborhood kids too .
5 #### The Schwinn thrasher helmet is built well and light weight . I started biking to help me recover from an ankle injury and I needed a cheap helmet to protect my most valuable asset . This is the first helmet I have ever owned , so I am not exactly an expert on helmet design . Overall , I will give this five stars .
5 #### Shoes were a perfect fit ! Go them quick and will buy another pair for sure .
3 #### The shoe is too large . When you do lunges it hurts the heel . The shoe size from a local store is the size I ordered from Amazon however the size or fitting seems to be large
5 #### We love these scooters . They are built strong enough for adults to use and are compact enough when filed up to put in a school locker . They last a long time .
5 #### Great set of bands for daily usage at a reasonable price . Various levels of strength bands included to target different muscles . Received with in a reasonable amount of time .
5 #### I use this bag ( 16L version ) to hold my large tent stakes and hammer . It closes tight and I have no concerns with sliding the filled bag around and tossing it into my truck . Good solid nylon bag . They could offer more colors
5 #### Yes , they do smell , but put them in a ziplock back and you 're golden . They take a second to light and may only burn for 7 mins , but they do boil any amount of water I need . Under windy conditions , it will cut down on the effectiveness of the fuel . Make sure you have a wind guard .
3 #### Good quality sling but not sure what kind of a shotgun this will work on without blocking the front sight . Would n't work on my 12 g ribbed Browning semi . Returned it .
1 #### Stupid useless buckle . Watch slid off and got lost 3 weeks in .
5 #### Great quality and good value . Not a single disappointment with them .
5 #### Love my Hanes Alive . Always a great fit and so silky smooth .
5 #### Love these slip on shoes from Merrell . I still have the previous one I bought more than 5 years ago . These shoes are light weight & comfortable . Provides great support for all day use . I highly recommend it .
4 #### These are nice pants but they are WAY bigger then the size range .
1 #### Just put a Kansas City Royals shirt in my Wishlist last week - go to buy it today and you 've pulled all the Royals shirts ? You boners !
5 #### Extremely happy with this Timex watch , keeps perfect time , love the size , it 's so light that you do n't even feel it 's on , very easy to read , and like others have said , looks great on , just the right size black leather band . If you have a large wrist it may run a little tight , but it would be easy to have a different size put on , also I have kept it on while washing dishes , and it has n't fogged up at all .
5 #### I bought these for my sister . She loves them and said they fit great !
3 #### They came dirty in the box . Rather unfortunate , but otherwise what I was looking for .
3 #### This one was from Honduras . It was stretchy and thick . Had to wash it twice and dry it in the dryer to shrink it to a normal " large " It is not a nice smooth thinner cotton like he is used to . I never have to iron them . But this one is just ........ weird . It 's not going to get 5 stars because it does n't come close to the other Carhartt shirts we have bought in the past .
5 #### very comfortable and beautiful . they are my first converse shoes , I 'll come back and buy more . I 'll recommend this product to others .
5 #### I have had them before and truly love them . Well made and extremely comfortable .
5 #### I love Keens sandals , which I wear in warm weather for everything from easy hiking , everyday casual , and as boat and beach shoes . I just wore out my first pair , which lasted five years . They are very comfortable . The straps and cross pieces do n't irritate my feet as other sandals have . They stay on securely , have good arch support , and I especially like the full toe protection . The bungy - cord laces are also convenient . This new pair feels a little short ( width is fine ) , and I expect that to correct as they stretch a bit from wear .
5 #### Works great . A nice accessory to have for my camp fire dutch oven .
5 #### Fits nicely on a 5 - gallon bucket , providing a seat at a nice height for working with plants or other items near the ground . Used it recently to replace my dryer vent . Not soft by any means , but a little bit of a flex when used with the bucket . Plus it keeps the gardening tools or soil in the bucket dry while watering . A much better and more inexpensive solution than the expensive gardening stools .
5 #### We purchased this for our niece 's son David ... it brings back memories for me , I had a similar bike 60 years ago when I was 2 ... The quality is great , the colors vibrant , and best of all , David loves it !
1 #### Too large . Look nothing like the picture . Good thing these are n't for me . I wo n't be ordering any for myself from here .
5 #### If you are really serious about hand grips , and you want something that is not your standard sport shop model , this is where to go . I got the Trainer , and for someone like myself that has been using hand grips since childhood , it was too easy . Then I got # 1 and that was tuff ; but I decided to get # 2 and # 3 as well . I have just recently graduated from # 1 and using # 2 , and maybe in a year or more I can go to # 3 and get certified . Let me tell you this , if you can squeeze # 2 at least once all the way , you are good . You ca n't really understand what I am trying to tell unless you get one . So if you are person that has never used hand grips regularly if at all , then go with the Trainer . If you have been using hand grips for awhile , and looking for something harder , then get the # 1 . Remember to always squeeze hard ! ! !
5 #### Needed ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten ten tentotal words to complete this feedback . Real Dumb .
4 #### Works perfect for old Savage 340 and or Stevens 325 model rifles . There will be some mild modifications needs on some stocks but only 1/8 " to 1/4 " at most . I have 3 of these on old rifles and modern Burris 3 - 9x40 scopes .
5 #### You get a lot of your money . Seems very well built . The net is reinforced on the edges . All materials are nice and fit well . I did have to use a rubber mallet to reshape a couple female ends . Kids love it and it holds up well to hard kicks .
4 #### In the past I 've worn a 7 4E but the company 's info said to size up a half so a 7.5 Wide was ordered . A little snug but there s stretch with the elastic binding system and there 've been no blisters ... yet . Other than the size issue I 'm pleased with this sandal .
4 #### As described , but not as stretchy as needed . Pretty taut . Ended up returning because they would not stretch as far as described .
4 #### I had to return the first pair and buy a 1/2 size smaller . First time I 've had to buy smaller for Nike .
5 #### Love these for ridding my Harley keep me warm but yet are very comfortable the best pair of paints on the market for the money , they fit great and I get alot of complements form the lady 's , as to how they fit my butt . LOL .
5 #### Bought this for my grand daughter . She loves it . It 's tough enough for a little girl who is relatively ( read very ) hard on accessories . :) Keeps good time so far .
5 #### I have gotten so many compliments on these shoes and also have gotten stopped at the mall and asked where I have purchased them . Amazing price .
4 #### The photo makes the tinder look larger than it is- about the length of a dime . That might make it insufficient for a camp or cooking fire . But I believe in having redundant sources of fire making , so carry it in a kit with relighting birthday candles ( which stand up to wind really well ) , magnesium and steel , a lighter and water proof matches . The latter three will light the first two or gathered or shaved tinder . I also will light a small piece of styrofoam or plastic wrap in an emergency- not ecological and my last resort , but in an emergency I go with preserving life .
5 #### I bought this for my granddaughter for Christmas so I ca n't comment yet on the longevity . I thought it would be a good starter watch for her to learn to tell time since the schools no longer teach it . Very cute . I 'm sure she 'll love it . I wish , however , that it had a normal watch band .
5 #### Always buy these for my husband to work in the yard and for hiking . He is on his third pair in 10 years . I have seen him wear them to the office , if his back hurts , because they are so comfortable . Yes , I said " the office " . He would wear them every waking moment if he could .
5 #### I love these shoes ... I had been wanting to get them for like ever and now I have them and I ca n't stop wearing them . They are perfect ! !
5 #### thought this product would be gimmicky but after seeing it at someone else 's house , decided to purchase and would purchase again . It is much easier for children to use than regular plastic solid frisbees
5 #### Fits all my stuff for both brown and black shoes . Two brushes ... Creams ... Rags . Very happy with the choice
5 #### These are the bees knees or at least to protect them would buy again
3 #### My husband wears a 9 ( in men ) and I wear a 7.5 ( in women 's ) , we both agree a half size smaller would have been better for us both . The sides are starting to come apart near the toes . Sucks , cause we both only have had them for less than a month . We get complements though . And , both really do love these shoes . Just hate that they are already tearing up .
5 #### I 'm so pleased to finally find qualified pantyhose . For those of us that are looking but ca n't find any pantyhose for brown skin tone , thank you
1 #### WAY TOO SMALL ! I ordered a 38x29 . What I got was maybe a 36 or less . On Saturday , I plan to take them down to the UPS store to return them . What a pain !
5 #### Great comfort , rugged , and light . I like that I can put my Gore - tex shoe covers over them for bicycling .
4 #### I liked these shoes a lot . Very light weight . I did n't give a 5 because the color was a little lighter than I thought it was going to be but still a great shoe . Very comfortable
4 #### This is the second recoil pad I 've tried that was listed for Mossberg . I have a 590 Mariner which apparently is supposed to use the larger of the two sizes . It did not , so I measured the stock and located this pad . It did not line up to the bottom hole in the stock . I had to drill and make another one in the pad . The product seems great but the I should 've bought local to see if it fit . This also happened with me on a Rem 700 , I will no longer trust the fitment guides .
5 #### It 's nice to have an old friend like Wrangler who you can go back to time after time and get your perfect fit .
5 #### Ca nt say enough about the Carhartts , they are worth the extra few duckets , than the Dickies , them double front ca n't really take a beating , and the general type of fabric is thicker than the competition .
3 #### I 'm sitting on the fence on this one . I got it for my tall 12 year old niece ( she 's 5'4 ) . I feel that the handle does not go up far enough . My 4 year old loves to use it with the handle at the max level and she 's of course much smaller ! My niece liked it just so - so . Otherwise it 's a good quality scooter . I like that it folds easily and the metal rather than plastic .
4 #### Nice hat .. Spare hat for my old Guv'ment issue hat ..
1 #### Back in 2005 when i bought my 1st Bicycle i also got this light combo(Whereas my front light was gray in hue , unlike the black / gray one you see here)thinking it was a good buy , wrong ! This product is as shoddy as most " BEll products " are . The rear light went out first , then the front light shorted out after a minor drop . Later after having my bicycle stolen while using a Bell bike lock i 've learned not to trust the viability of " Bell products " ever again . That 's why i 'm now a " Cateye 's " and " Nite Ize " product fan . Learn from my mistake and avoid buying this product at all cost .
5 #### 7 days swimming on vacation I felt so secure and at peace with this around my neck stroking in the warm ocean . All my debit cards and 100 dollar bills fit . The thing floats , so even if it did break off , you 'd see and be able to retrieve it . No I never use the hotel safe , ha .
3 #### The large is fine but it is too stretch so it hurts . It is sad because they are beautiful . I hope they expand a little but I doubt it
3 #### When I looked at this wallet for some reason I expected it to be a bit smaller . The leather is very stiff I am hoping that it will loosen up a bit . Also , I have a drivers license that has to be in a special holder and it will not fit in the spot for the license . It looks very nice I ordered a red one too now I wish I had not done that .... but I will use it .
4 #### not as good at boiling water as gas stoves , but it 's cheaper and - why I chose this method for my backpacking trip - they 're lighter and easier to pack than a gas canister . PROS - small and light weight - they burn the perfect amount to simmer water just long enough to cook ramen noodles or oatmeal or something - they can be used to help start a camp fire , and that can be invaluable in a wet environment . Trust me , I was very grateful to have these guys help me start a fire after a very soggy day in the rockies ! CONS - They 're a little difficult to ignite ( large match is best ) - they can be easily blown out by wind ( just find some rocks to provide wind cover )
5 #### I absolutely love this ! The material is a little cheap on the inside lining but for the price it 's absolutely perfect . I wanted something to go out dancing with that was big enough for my phone and cards but not too big that it was in the way . Overall I think this is a great purchase if you 're not expecting something of high quality .
1 #### You will just love the double vision you get from the Bushnell Falcon 7x35 Binoculars ! I would recommend sawing them in half and using them as a telescope . I read the reviews on the web and everyone says the same thing about the double vision . Harbor Freight tools has a cheap set of Binoculars better than these . I called Bushnell and they blamed me because the only way that could happen is for them to be dropped . They never were dropped and were bad out of the box . Horrible product horrible company .
5 #### most comfortable , well fitting , with great arch support shoe I 've ever owned !
5 #### Great , budget , binoculars . I wanted a pair of bino 's to look at the airplanes from the windows at work . We 're right across from the airport so it 's not super far and I do n't have to track accross tons of open sky , so they meet my needs . They work well and the focus is intuitive and quick .
5 #### If you are considering buying docksiders , the Billfish model is the one to buy . I just bought my second pair , and they are terrific . The rubber soles and heels make them very comfortable to stand or walk in , unlike the basic docksider shoe with leather bottoms . They cost a little more , but are well worth it .
5 #### The players on our high school football team were all wearing it this season . It 's well made , looks good , and seems to be long lasting so far .
5 #### Bleached hi - tops ! Might take a few orders / returns until you find the exact right size . My first order was 1/2 size too large , did a free return , got the perfect size afterwards !
3 #### the size was listed as " 9D ( M ) " which I took as size 9 medium for women as my search as for " Converse high tops size 9 women 's " . would recommend the description detailing men's / women 's size .
5 #### My husband loves this shirt . Its one of his favorites and stands up well to his abuse and my constant washing .
5 #### Worked out very well for son 's wedding - spaghetti strap dress .
5 #### The price is very low ( fifteen dollars ) for 50 high quality life - size targets . You simply can not do better than practice your armed self - defense with these truly fantastic ' bad guy ' anatomy targets . Great stuff indeed !
1 #### Was terribly disappointed , the pants were way too large in the legs , my husband looked like he was wearing blown up clown pants .
4 #### I like Bali Skimp Skamp Brief very much . But 6 is too large . Please exchange it to size 5 . Thanks !
3 #### Good shoe , however , it came in a women 's size and I purposely ordered it in a man 's size . I specifically looked for a listing for a unisex converse because I have had issues with getting the wrong size before . I have also received a toddler size when ordering an adult size . Be more specific in your listing . This particular listing states in one section that it is a women 's shoe and in another place that it 's a men 's shoe . Grrr !
1 #### Ordered my husband 's normal T - shirt size ( XL ) and it was HUGE . I gave it to my sister to wear . She is size 4X and it fit her !
4 #### Good quality product . It seems to be helping my golfer 's elbow , but it has only been a couple of weeks . It was strongly recommended by a very good orthopedic doctor .
5 #### love them but big , , , my daughter size is 12 and in this shoes I think she should be a 9 //// very big on her
5 #### It is really a great watch . But the color of the leather is not same to picture , it is bit fade .
5 #### love it love it ! I own couple pairs of Converse already - but depends of style ( man sizing , universe sizing or woman sizing ) i wear different size . I got 7.5 and it fits perfect , ussually I wear 8 woman . They are also not very narrow so my feet feels very comfortable .
5 #### no more frozen face while working out doors in this cold weather . i m double up with another face mask i have and i stay nice n warm .
4 #### My husband coaches my sons soccer team and he wanted a goal he could set up in our yard . This goal is well made and seems sturdy enough for backyard play . I like the way the metal poles lock together because they are sturdy , but you can also take them apart to move or store the goal . The net is nice , but I do have concerns about how the Velcro strips that tether it to the goal will hold up . I suppose I can always use zip ties if need be . All in all , for the price , this is a pretty good goal .
5 #### nice product , bought it 4 yrs ago and it still looks great
5 #### Very easy to lose because they fly so far ! Also they do n't float so be careful on the beach .
5 #### I just wanted a net to use on my backyard ice rink . This did the job well . It looks like it will hold up for quite a while .
4 #### My third pair . Just wish a 28 inseam was more readily available .
5 #### Not the prettiest , but it holds my breasts as it should and is comfortable . In fact , it holds them so well you d believe my boobs have no sag at all after breast - feeding !
4 #### does what it 's meant to . Not the best if you prefer the chubbies , but perfectly adequate for anything smaller than a NUB . The larger clip is n't the most secure , but with a bit of grip tape it wo n't go anywhere . I 'll be glad to start taking this to the pool hall instead of lugging around a 4 finger tray anymore !
5 #### Excelente producto recomendado , el empaque fue el adecuado para el envo eso me disminuye el costos de envo para Venezuela .
5 #### I love converse ! I still do n't really get their sizing bc every pair I 've had seems to be different , but this pair is 6.5/8.5 , I am a women 's 8.5 - 9 and they fit perfectly ! I love love love them
5 #### 6'2 " 220 # boyfriend approved- solid with good height & back for him . went together fairly easy . the feet seem secure- when we tried to pull / twist off they would n't budge so they may be securing them better but we 'll keep an eye on them due to other reviews . the only thing i like better on the more expensive version is the material- though i prefer the grey to black & this will probably dry better because of it , it 's a bit slick and you can stick to it- a very minor complaint though- we really like the pack size for motorcycle & weight for backpacking .
5 #### The quarter rib on my Ruger Number 1 was slightly off center . My Zeiss scope did not have enough horizontal adjustment to compensate . I installed a slip over rail mount and the inserts in the Burris Signature rings allowed for more then enough adjustment to center the cross - hair with room to spare . An added plus is that they will not mark your scope .
4 #### runs roomy for size ; ordered down one size for better fit ; excellent quality for t shirt ; ; durable for all work places
4 #### Such a great mat ! Very durable and will last me a long time . Everything arrived and packaged as described .
5 #### We have used this kickstand for over 2 months now . This kickstand was exactly what we needed following my daughters transition to riding without training wheels . I was concerned at first about the kickstand being adjustable . However , I was very happy with this feature and found the kickstand still remained very sturdy . The build quality of the kickstand was superb . In fact , I would say rock solid . I had to apply a little WD-40 to make it easier for my daughter to use until it breaks in . Once applied , it was a lot easier . The kickstand installs easily in about 2 minutes . Highly recommend this product .
5 #### Always great quality when you order Pelican . There is a reason they are becoming industry standard to protect all sorts of equipment . Perfect for caring all my small delicate gear .
3 #### Simple . Comfortable . Band dries easy when splashed with water -- in the medical veils and I wash my hands a lot .
4 #### I have the right size , but wide sizes are n't offered .
3 #### My husband 's feet get cold easily and these slippers are wonderful . He loves them .
2 #### The insoles of the shoes where they met the upper rubbed on the ends of my toes . It took two steps to find they were uncomfortable . Also they were too wide for my foot .
4 #### Nice looking and pretty tough . I 'm tall with big , fairly thick / muscular legs . These fit nicely and look good .
5 #### Dr. prescribes this for tennis elbow . I have used it for a few week and it has helped tremendously . Simple but it works .
4 #### This came with four sights . The two largest were red and the two smallest green . The reason I bought this is because my eyes did not pick up on the RED fiber optic sight that came on my Stoeger M3500 . Just my Luck the one that fit my Stoeger was RED and the one that fit my Mossberg was RED . The package has a warning to not remove the fiber optic or breakage might occur . My whole purpose of buying this was to get the GREEN so I tried to swap them out and was able to without breaking any of the fiber optics . I now have the GREEN fiber on both my shotguns and it shows up MUCH better than the RED to me . The fiber is smaller than I would prefer . I have n't been in the field with these but they seem secure and probably wo n't come off under most conditions . If I do lose one I will buy another set ; the price is right .
4 #### Only complaint is that the lining of the inside sole is a bit lifted causing discomfort . Have held up great .
5 #### These are very heavy duty resistance bands providing a great workout to most any body area . Well made and durable . I have had these for years and still use them today . The handles are only very slightly worn with everything else looking like new .
5 #### Love it . I bought it for running but have given other uses too . Last weekend I was at the beach and it came in handy to carry hotel key card , debit card , and cash while dipping in the water ( sea and pool ) without complaints . I would buy another one if this one ever gives up .
5 #### I ordered one for my watertight flashlights . It is easy to apply and less messy than petroleum base grease . Hundreds of uses . I also use it for hinges , drawers , scissors , and other little trinkets . For my uses , this bottle will last a long time .
5 #### its exactly what i ordered fits securely in small spaces excellent for a bug out bag or emergency bag thx fellas
4 #### Bought these for my little girl . She wanted a pair in black so she and her daddy could be twins lol . So far she has n't complained about them . She wears them to play in from riding her bike , to riding her 4 wheeler to playing on her monkey bars .
5 #### They are as advertised . Comfortable and soft to the touch for jeans . I would recommend them to anyone who loves to wear jeans .
5 #### Great fit . Easy adjustments and looks sleek .. It seems durable . Protect yourself when you ride . Sun visor help block some of the sun rays when riding .
5 #### Take one Custom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat , add one 5 gallon bucket and one bum = an easy , inexpensive seating solution that then stows away easily .
5 #### These shoes fit perfectly I love them . I would highly recommend purchasing clothing and shoes again . I wore them all day and they were so comfortable
5 #### I have found that using the bosu instead of a regular step in my videos and it is making me work harder & drastically improving my results . I would definitely recommend it to anyone , but especially those who want to improve their balance or those who have plateaued / gotten bored using a regular step . It really takes the intensity up a notch and helps you to gain better balance . After several months of use i can honestly say it has held up great , no problems at all . It seems very sturdy & i 'm sure it will last a long long time . so the quality seems to be very good . The pump seems fine , i only really used it once . ( the bosu has n't deflated at all in all these months . ) edit on 6/5/14 - --although i have n't been using it much lately , i did get several years of pretty hardcore use out of my bosu . it is still in great shape and holds air for a long time ( only had to refill twice ) .
5 #### Bought these for my 80 yr old mother . They are her favorite . Great price too .
5 #### I ordered 9 and should have ordered 8 1/2 they would have been perfect . Even a little large I find I really like them . We spend a lot of time in RV and like to take shoes off when I go in , these will be perfect
2 #### I 've always gotten this size in Nike shoes with similar description , but these are too long- at least an inch and 1/2 .
5 #### My daughter loves them . Perfect for her hip hop dance class .
3 #### Thought these would be useful ended up being a complete waste of money would nt buy again . Unless the cleat is exactly the distance you need you wo n't be using them . Even if it is does nt provide much stability , especially when fueling . Go with regular dock lines cheaper and better for your boat .
5 #### All I can say is , for the money , these are the best thing on the market and I will order another pair as a spare or for others on the firing line .
4 #### Product as described have n't used this much but its easy to put on and off and it does work . thank you seller
3 #### Applying this lube under the walking belt on my treadmill is much easier said than done . The belt did not loosen enough to get my arm under it in order to make a good zig zag pattern that is called for in the instructions . I slathered it the best I could and retentioned the belt . It did not fix my problem , but I am sure I did not cause any harm by adding the lube .
4 #### These cubes have a slightly stinky fishy smell to them but it is not overbearing . The cubes burn well , and are very easy to carry . Great camping cooking in my opinion . No fishy smell when they burn ... but you do need some ventilation
4 #### The color is almost a light blue / grey / black . Not what I expected but not bad either just different . Good price !
5 #### I love everything about it and will buy another one when this one dies . It feels so feminine ; the band is thin and so easy to put on ; and it looks good with everything ! !
2 #### The tags were n't attached and the shorts seemed dirty . Were these returned previously or something ? I 'm not very pleased with this purchase . But Dickies are Dickies , and the quality of the shorts is still very good .
5 #### This is a very attractive shoe . It is true to size and fits as expected . Very satisfied with the seller - delivered on time .
5 #### It does fit ( as all converses do ) , a size larger than normal . Over all excellent ! I have several pairs of these shoes in different colors !
5 #### I use this watch everyday anywhere I go , I have received a bunch of compliments on this watch and will probably purchase another in the near future .
5 #### If you love the classic look this is definitely for you ... you should not wear them all day but they 're good for a few hours to add a nice style to your outfit .
5 #### FANTASTIC BEST PANTYHOSE ever bought DOCTOR recommended for varicose veins in legs for support compression to help with circulation fit is perfect size is perfect all the way around best buy ever .. and NO RUNS ..
5 #### I have pretty high arches and my calves always hurt at the gym with other shoes . I have been on the hunt for a good cross trainer that I can use to lift , take gym classes , and lightly jog / run on the treadmill . These have been wonderful ! I do n't ever have any pain in my calves or my feet when wearing these and they fit like a glove . Highly recommend !
5 #### I absolutely love these . I shopped for hours wearing them and they felt wonderful .... so comfy
5 #### Very comfortable shoes . This is my second pair of this style of shoe because I loved them that much .
5 #### I bought this for my mother - in - law after she mentioned she had trouble finding a watch small enough for her wrist . I looked specifically for reviews of watches that mentioned fitting a narrow wrist , and this one sounded like a good possibility . And she loves it ! It fits her small wrist well , with more band holes to use if she gets even thinner , and she says she likes the clear , easy - to - read face . And it 's attractive in a classic , feminine style without being fussy . Casual or dressy , it looks appropriate .
5 #### Great visibility at night . Frisbee is heavy and sturdy and flies great . Recommended !
2 #### I have a lot of bras that are 36C , but this is way too big . I 'm using the tightest hooks in the back and it 's still too large around my ribcage . Cup sizes seem okay .
5 #### Just what I expected . I love these shoes and I do n't know about the other reviewers but the shoes that were sent to me were authentic . I would know since I 've been wearing these for many years now . Once these wear out , which could be a while , I will definitely buy again .
5 #### Good tool on the trail , gets the job done . Simple , lite , EZ to read , lanyard hole for neck carry . All you need in the wilderness with a good map .
2 #### This is the 3rd cycling shorts brand I 've tried and without reservation the worst designed . The elastic in the thigh area is unbelievably tight but at the waist the exact opposite . I definetly wo n't buy any more of these nor do I recommend them .
5 #### This is an extra small bag , and it will not hurt your shoulders to carry for long durations . It rides on you like no other bag . Great weight distribution and easy access . I had a hard time decided between the medium and the large . We are going on a trip here soon so I was informed the large was the one . It is also the only size that has an internal padded and zippered iPad section . That is a cool feature . I have my large loaded it up with all sorts of things . Change of clothes , put my embarrassing fanny pack inside it , iPad of course , multi tools , pens , paper , Kindle . All of this fits great and feels good on your shoulder . I just wear the strap across my body and can slide the bag around to my back and off I go . Would be a good choice for hiking . For most the medium would be a good first choice . For extra travel needs , or iPad carry the large is the one . The size is not going to be a big deal unless you make it a big deal . The less that s in the bag the thinner it is . Thin and light is a good thing . Especially if you are walking a long way .
4 #### Very sturdy and great price . I got my through amazon and not a third party . The seat is heavy duty plastic with cheap(but strong ) foam padding on top . Mine has not gotten wet yet but the foam looks like it could get rained on and not hurt it . It popped onto my 5 gallon bucket with no problem . My only complaint is that the lid is really hard to get off . It would not be good for someone who needs to get in a out of the bucket frequently . The lid tightness may be different between bucket brands but the two different 5 gallon buckets I used both had a tight fit . The curved opening is just enough to allow something long to stick out of the top and still be able to use the lid as a seat . It is a good match if using a bucket organizer as long as it does not attach to the rim of the bucket where the lid attaches .
4 #### This is for the plus size girls ! ! I have tried a bunch of other snow pants , but they just do not come large enough for plus size girls . If you have a big booty like myself these will probably be your best options . I normally wear an 2XL to get them over my butt , but sometimes I have to go for a 3XL if I want them loose . I have seen a couple other reviews that they were a little bit small so I went with the largest size they had thinking they would be good . Well of course my butt was the issue again . I was able to wear these perfectly fine but they fit exactly like a 2X would normally go on me . There was n't any extra space . I assume just because they are men and do n't have the curves built into the pants . I wish they had these in women , and they might of fit a little better through my hips . At least with these you do n't have to worry about them falling down !
5 #### Bought this for my son to take with him when he went ice fishing . He loved it . Just what he wanted .
5 #### Love these . They have saved my sons knees already , he is 8 1/2 years old .
5 #### Large mouth bass seem to love this lure ! I 've bought a total of 4 so that I could give one to each of my fishing buddies because this lure works wonders and it looks really nice to show it off in a tackle box
5 #### they were comfortable and I forgot I had them on , and toes were free !
5 #### Purchased these for a wedding ... and now there my favorite casual shoes . Amazing comfort , easy to slip on ( when you 're too lazy to tie your shoes ... face it , we all have those moments . )
2 #### I was hoping to find some good light shoes for a holiday to avoid the overall ' tourist ' look , but was quite disappointed . They did not seem to be a particularly good quality ( though I have never tried this brand and was not really sure what to expect ) , but more importantly , I found them extremely HEAVY . There is also absolutely no support as well . So ... not the light shoe for which I was hoping . The sizing seemed to be off ( they were large ) , but I am not including this in the rating , as this may have been my own mistake .
5 #### Great value on this amount of tennis balls . My boys and I started playing pick up games of tennis in the park so I bought a ball carrier and all these balls to keep in my trunk . Great balls and good bounce . My boys ( 9 and 7 ) got such a kick out of opening each can and listening to the gentle pop of the pressured air come out with each one ... they loved it almost as they loved getting the new balls ! Positive : --Have been playing with them for a few months and they have a lot of bounce --They are a great price per unit if you do the math Negative : --nothing
5 #### Great helmet for the price . Do n't know what more to say .
5 #### These things are good , real life size and well worth the money compared to $ 1 each at a gun range . I like to hang about 2 - 5 on trees in the woods and have a war with the bad guys . Fun stuff !
4 #### Used for computer chair comfort and car drivers seat comfort . It works cery well in both cases . Especially durable and more dense foam than many such . I used the thinnwr one for 6 or 7 years . Still in use occasionally .
3 #### I 'm afraid I wo n't be able to wear them after I wash them .
4 #### I had to cut it to fit my watch , but it works great .
4 #### Really not wild about the color . ' Nude ' is not the same as other Hanes products , namely Silk Reflections . These look like granny pantyhose . I suppose if they are comfortable I 'll try a set of barely - there next time .
5 #### I like the smaller version a little bit more , but the larger Pro edition is also a blast !
1 #### These are NOT original chuck taylors ! ! ! I do n't know why these are even on line ! Got them and could n't believe it . Box said Chuck Taylors .... not not not
4 #### It works great , the instructions regarding replacing the slide stop could have been better . It does n't change the profile of the pistol at all for holstering .
5 #### These cases are exceptional . In comparison to other injection molded cases these seem to be the king . I 've had zero issues with them .
3 #### I 'm only giving these pants 3 stars based on personal preference . They were too heavy for what I needed and the extra layer just did n't work for me . I am very critical about wearing the exact right pants and I only wear the Carhartt Men 's Washed Duck Work Dungaree Utility Pant . In terms of quality , these have the same great quality as all Carhartt products and you can rely on them holding up in pretty much any circumstances .
3 #### Very cheap . Get what you pay for . No backing , not a solid piece of plastic ; rather , just a shell . Go more expensive .
1 #### Size says 4 - 6x . Outfit is a 4 , at best . Poorly made so do n't expect it to last more than one wear or two .
2 #### Not loud enough regardless of how hard you blow in it . I use a regular cheap whistle with a bead in it instead .
3 #### This band is very short and therefore much harder to work with than the medium bands from other companies . The handles are plastic instead of being cushioned with a foam handle like I 've seen on other bands . Overall it 's ok but not great by any means but it will do for now .
3 #### at first , it was great and comfy , but after start walking I felt like the right pair has a small stone inside or bump inside it which is annoying while walking . and I could not request for a return because of the high cost of international shipping :( but in general the material and manufacturing is excellent
5 #### Amazing basketball for the price . If you 're looking for an OUTDOOR basketball , you ca n't do better than this one .
5 #### Fit 's my kids head , hope it works when / if he falls off his bike . Not sure how much more I can review until he actually crash 's with it and we 'll see then if it works ( and take a picture ) . Again I hope that never happens . Fits well ( my kids are big ) and they still have room to grow with this one . Seems a good value for the price . Each review I write is solely based on my own experience and use of the product . I have not been paid , received free products , or discounts on any of the items I review . I like to keep my reviews short and sweet .
5 #### Fits great . Feel very smooth on my legs . They do not run easily and attach to the garters of my Rago Body Briefers . I love wearing them all day long from the time I get up in the morning until I go to bed .
5 #### I use this case to keep my eBike 's batteries safe . They 're fairly precious cargo , both expensive and somewhat delicate . Tucked away in this I 'm pretty sure I could throw it out the window to the road a story down and not have an issue .
1 #### I usually wear a size 8 and they fit fine . These are way too narrow . Thought they might stretch out but they did nt . Had to give away .
4 #### Scope rings do n't fit on stock rail provided by Ruger . You 'll have to get a different rail for rifle or different rings .
5 #### Better than I expected . Pros : Love the big numbers - so easy to read . Also love the size of the case - 40 mm is not small , a little big but not too big . The luminglow - on all the numbers and on the hands - is really great in the dark - seems to last a long time . The Indiglo Lightup is also a great thing - when needed . Cons : The length of the bracelet is kind of small , but I changed it for another one of my liking . The seconds ticking is a little noisy - but I do n't really mind it .
5 #### Works great with the intex bellows foot pump . Also can be rolled up with my sleeping bag and still fits in the stuff sack , great for camping or an overnight guest .
5 #### Great value , great performance and it has held up beautifully over this past year . In fact , the only time my man 's back has hurt this entire year was when when he misplaced this belt for a week .
5 #### What can I say , its a sign and exactly as advertized good find .
5 #### My daughter asked for a jump rope to exercise with . I did n't want to get her a cheap one so it would last longer . This one is just like the ones they use in PE at school . It 's perfect .
5 #### This product performs exactly as promised . I used 2 of these to run transducer and power cables on my kayak .
5 #### Great cycling shorts ! Just the right amount of padding . They look and feel great . I also like the price too .
5 #### The real deal . Nothing beats the original Wham - o. Flying it on a windy day is a lot of fun and my dog prefers it over most other frizbees I have used . Long flights , and often on a misthrow lands on it 's edge and rolls a long ways . Flys good even on soft throws . I have never seen my dog jump as aggressively as when he is chasing an original Wham - o. Must be the fine ridges on the surface of the top as the lift and flight are better . Maybe the patent on that has n't run out or whatever but no one else seems to have it .
5 #### Now finally my wife can get us tided to the dock without me checking the knot . Great for windy day they have just enough " Give "
5 #### A very thin , elegant watch , comfortable & easy to read . The only downside is a poorly designed clasp , secure once you get it adjusted but not up to the top notch watch design , overall , a 5 star bargain ! ! !
5 #### Bought this for my Grandson . He gives it 5 stars .
5 #### A little too narrow for me but is thick enough to be comfortable .
5 #### I have had this holster for at least 5 years and just bought a new one as the release strap was getting stretched from usage . It still worked , but took a little extra movement to release the snap . Not a big deal for most , but who knows if it will make a difference one day . I do not mind paying for a new one , the last one owes me nothing .
5 #### They look and feel great . Sturdy material for long lasting wear .
5 #### Bought for uncle who has cancer and went from XL to medium and loves Carhartt brand , which is always quality apparel .
2 #### This was way way too big and very thin . I ca n't use it because of its size . I also bought the leggings and they were too big but I wore them and they sagged on my legs . Also very thin to help keep warm with an added layer of clothing .
5 #### I have worn this bra for years and have always been pleased with the style and fit .
5 #### I 've started numerous fires with this in wet conditions and also used it to boil water . It 's worked great . It does smell fishy , but then again when you 're backpacking with a couple dudes for a few days in the mountains with no showers , everything has a funk to it .
5 #### All three of my kids wear K - Swiss Classics . The are very durable , comfortable , and keep their color relatively well with minimal maintenance . I'l be buying more soon .
3 #### Very Difficult to decide how many stars to give , I ordered wrong size ...
5 #### This silicone spray does what it says it does . I am not afraid to use it on jackets , shoes , tents , or any other item I want to protect . It helps keep my shoes and sandals looking new longer . It 's a great product at a great price !
5 #### Just received the unit and stepped out the door to visit the range . The headset is quite comfortable . I have found many other brands to be uncomfortable . Someone was shooting a 50bmg and my ears were protected . I wear hearing aids under the ear muffs and the protection was still excellent . The muff does push up somewhat when using a rifle , but not enough to move away from the ear . The attenuation is perfect , hardly noticing the drop in volume .
5 #### We got these for my son for Christmas who is in his mid thirties . He has worn these since high school , to all of the proms and even to weddings including his own:- )
5 #### These were a gift but my daughter said she has 3 pair of these in different colors and they are consistent in fit and quality .
1 #### Terrible . The wig is too dark and wavy for the Austin Powers look . The glasses are very cheaply made and the rubber like teeth do not fit or even stay put . The best item in the kit is the medallion .
5 #### Present for you young buy , he was very happy , nice hat , I have one myself in extra large .
5 #### As expected , Uncle Mike 's delivers again . Needed a second set of swivels for a different sling , and these fit perfectly .
5 #### Size really depends on the brand . I wear a 6.5 in Nike and they fit me perfectly . These shoes are comfortable , they wrap around my feet like a bandage but do not restrict movement .
2 #### I 've had this heart rate monitor for about 8 months now and if it 's not for the fact that I 'm cheap , I would 've tossed it long time ago . The watch itself looks okay , the band is plastic and cheap looking . The main complaint that I have about this watch is the heart rate monitor reliability . More time than not , my heart rate ca n't be picked up . I 've tried every trick in the book , but still have trouble with it . Everytime I put it on , I have to keep my fingers crossed and hope that it will pick up my heart rate , but most of the time it does n't . When it does work , very occasionally , the heart rate is pretty accurate . Just save up some more money and buy a Polar to avoid all this hassel .
3 #### The watch itself it fine , but the watch band is too small .
5 #### Good product , silicone water guard . Used it on my pop up for turkey hunting , no leaks , even at stitching & zipper . Stayed dry , comfortable & got a turkey
5 #### These things are the best bass finders when you are trying to figure them out ....
5 #### I love this wallet . The quality is good , and it has the perfect organizing features for my needs .
5 #### Very good lure ! ! I bought it again , I liked it so much that I had to buy two more . this bait can not be missing in your fishing box
3 #### Took other reviewers advice and went up half size and it was too large . I thought this was a more sock - like fit but it had a tongue that came up high on my ankle not at all sock like . Nice looking and very light weight with a rounded square toe that left plenty of room front foot and toes . These just were n't what I was looking for .
5 #### Good looking watch for a fine price . Leather wrist band is very comfortable . My only issue is the holes are too far apart so my wrist falls in between two of them but that 's not a problem with the watch . Keeps time well . The light - up dial and indiglo are perfect for telling time in the dark . Nice enough to look good with a suit but still comfortable to wear every day .
4 #### es la marca mas clasica que recuerdo y eso es lo que motiva a adquirir cualquiera que sea la prenda
5 #### Smelled very chemically when if first arrived but after a few days in the fresh air and a soap and warm water bath it is not particularly noticeable . Very comfortable knee pad for doing raised rear foot hip flexors . Much better than any of the cushions and pillows I could find around the house .
5 #### Great value , perfect size balls for my chalk bag . Good amount of chalk on each ball . Container reseals well keeps dust under control .
2 #### This item could be a lot better . It chaffs my ankles and even leaves marks , every time I wear these . I wish the inside lining was somehow softer so it could be much more comfortable to use . Also , when I use these with my Aqua Aerobic shoes , these weights keep pushing my shoes off my feet , pressing at the heels -- I wish there was a way I could keep my shoes on while wearing these weights . Othersie it is a good product , only if it was a little more comfortable to wear .
5 #### Can be 're - used ' : if you only use it for an hour or two , I found that if you wrap it tight in a small baggie , it stops generating heat . I took it out and crunched the bag , working out the clumps . It did heat up again for a short time . I will buy again .
5 #### This blow up buzz wing set it wonderful ! My son loves them ! There are elastic straps that Velcro in the middle that you put your arms through . The material is the typical rubber blow up kind of material . The air stays in and does n't seem to leak out . I would buy again
5 #### Ten years ago , my husband bought a pair of these Merrell shoes locally . They were the most comfortable shoes he has ever worn . Now ( 10 years later ) , after wearing these shoes on a daily basis , they have finally bit the dust . We bought the same version from Amazon to replace his old Jungle Slip - on 's , and the new ones are just as comfortable . Out of the box , there 's no break - in period needed -- he can wear them all day , with nary a blister .
3 #### They were nice nylons but too long I 'm 5'4 " and I had alot of the nylon at my ankles after they were pulled up . Unfortunately I decided to pull the excess on my right leg a little more when they ran . Oh well live and learn . At least they were n't expensive .
5 #### Great support for my lower back as I twist and contort during the day as an auto repair tech . I 'm 6'6 220 and a size 38 waist . A large fit perfect with plenty of adjustment left .
5 #### Large but my son prefers them to be very loose , appreciate the longer size .
5 #### Very nice bag . It does force you to stop carrying around all the extra junk that you really do n't need . I like it a lot ! !
5 #### I love them . They are comfortable and the color is great . I got an 8.5 , I normally wear a 9 . The 8.5 fits pretty well , I think I could have gone down to an 8 just fine though . I wear them all the time now and get tons of compliments .
4 #### I had to add a few layers onto the door stopper to get it not to slide through and whack me in my crotch . other than that works great !
3 #### A little disappointed that it came damaged . The listing stated that the packaging was damaged , but the item itself was also damaged beyond use . I had to pry the bent arm opening back to its normal position before I could use it . It 's fine now , but for the small discount , I 'd have purchased the new one to know the arm had n't been previously weakened by damage .
3 #### Classic design , but the manufacturing seemed sloppy . Not a fine job done . Also ran one whole size big . A 10.5 shoe was more like an 11.5 .
3 #### The back but has two seams and it makes the legs very uncomfortable ! ! ! The champagne color is gorgeous though and matched my skin tone perfectly !
4 #### Really good pants , good material and strong for the roughest of jobs . The issue however is the overall feel and size of the pants . I bought the Carhatt duck work dungaree pants along with these and the fit is better with the dungarees . These pants feel way too big in the front of the pants and in the leg area . If you love a lot of space in the pants then these are perfect for you .
4 #### My only complaint is that I wish it could be adjusted to a shorter length . I 'm 6 ' tall , and set at its shortest setting , it 's just a little too long .
5 #### Perfect ! Just what Inwanted and needed . Keeps my neck very warm and blocks the wind and cold . Quick delivery too ,
4 #### Have used it few days , good shoes , comfortable , nice support , a bit narrow ( if wider would better ) .
5 #### This runners pack is just as represented and was delivered very quickly . It is just the right size ( which is pretty hard to find ) . I was very pleased with this purchase .
2 #### I am sad to say that I am very disappointed with this item . So far I have only used the cookie pan , but I 've used it about two dozen times over the course of about 2 months ( mostly to make baked bacon , which is awesome by the way ) . It was great because it was so easy to clean , I was really happy with it . Now it 's suddenly warping when exposed to heat in the oven , even at low temperatures ( 250 - 300 degrees ) . Opposite corners of the sheet start to curl towards each other , rendering it unusable . I 'm not going to return the product yet because it 's possible the other items wo n't behave this way , and I 'm looking forward to making muffins . But I 'm really disappointed in the cookie sheet .
4 #### Reasonably good soccer ball . A little bit in the heavy / hard side , but I can tell this will last a long time . Looks exactly as the picture .
3 #### My son ca n't use them yet . they are too big . Expecting for him to grow and see if can give a different opinion .
5 #### works great , good protection , but wish it where a little wider
3 #### They look really nice and fit as expected . The material is good . However my 3 year old son barely wore them throughout the winter and complained they were uncomfortable .
5 #### Super comfy , true Size , I use them for boot Camp , cross fit and they are great , absolutely recommended it .
5 #### Used it for the first time this morning and pulled in three 2 lb rainbow trout . Great castability and strength .
5 #### These are by far the best shirts my husband has ever had . They fit perfectly , do not shrink or fade .
5 #### I 've always worn Hanes and Fruit of the Loom , but these are now my new go to shirts for work . They 're thicker and longer and the fact they are a bit larger on the sizing , the medium fits me perfectly , as I 'm in between sizes of medium and large . They are definitely worth the extra money for the excellent quality you get .
5 #### These black on black chucks look great ! I wore them in my wedding and had my groomsmen wear the standard white on black ones . Made for some great pics .
5 #### Got them for my girlfriend . She loves them . Says it 's like wearing slippers because they are incredibly light .
5 #### Great shoes - was looking for something to replace my barefeet so I can wear orthotics while kickboxing . These are light weight , hug my feet comfortably and have a thinner upper so I can still feel the bag when I kick AND they have good lateral stability . My feet are on the narrow side so it 's hard to find shoes that are snug enough . These are perfect . Oh , and they are really cute too .
5 #### I love Coleman products and this propane stove does not disappoint . Fires right up and you can get to cooking . Plus , the style of it just reeks Coleman . I like it a lot . You will too .
4 #### Love these socks . They fit great and stay put . I 'm a novice hiker and amateur photographer and ca n't stand fiddling with things like socks falling down . Now if I could grow an ass and not have my pants fall down I 'd be a happy camper . I 've bought socks from several brick and mortars only to feel taken the first or second time out . One store that rhymes with another name for mule sold me a " Lifetime " sock that falls down every time out even when new . Unfortunately , they wo n't give me my money back , only a useless replacement . Maybe I can use them for the marbles I 'm losing in frustration . Either way I 'll defiantely be purchasing another pair or two now that I 've tested these out . They 're also not overly thick , yet keep my dogs warm and cozy . The only thing that drops it one star is the price .
5 #### Works flawlessly , do wish mounting hardware had larger head to avoid stripping out , but it matches what is common in the industry
4 #### It 's a good scope certainly for the money ( cost ) but does n't have quite the resolving power or contrast of my brother 's $ 450 + Kowa scope . I use it for birdwatching ( waterfowl mostly ) & have generally been pleased for the one month I 've used it ...
5 #### ca n't ever go wrong with a pair of chucks ! they always say go a half a size down , but in my boyfriends case he had to go a full size down , and me i 'm safe with going half a size down .. so it definitly varys
5 #### The price and fit were right . It kept me warn while playing in the snow for a couple of hours .
5 #### May have to remove links for normal to small wrists . Love the two - tone color .
5 #### MY CURRENT FAVORITE LURE . IF THE LAKE HAS CRAYFISH . THIS LURE KILLS IT .
5 #### Love them on my daughter . They were just what she wanted !
3 #### Ordered what I thought was a womens 7 , but was shipped a mens 7 or a womens 9 . Thought I clicked on the correct size . At least my daughter can use them when she gets older . LOL
5 #### I love these shirts for everyday wear , not just for outdoors . They are great for hot days in the summer , as the venting and material do a great job of keeping you cool .
1 #### Well bought this pump from bargin barns on amazon an they ship it to me a day early I was glad then i open up the box I get just the pump nothing else no charger no hose a pump how can u use a pump with a dead battery that always should stay charged an if the battery dies its trash so I got no use from this wasted 20 bucks for a peice of junk
5 #### I bought two pair for hiking and liked them so much , I got two more pair . They fit comfortably snug and do n't slide down araound the ankles . They conform to the foot so there are no bulges or wrinkles to cause blisters . I 'm very pleased with them .
5 #### Best Christmas gift I bought this year . So fun to watch our kids toss the frisbee for hours , even when the short winter days end too early !
4 #### Great warmth out shoveling snow - did have a chemical smell to it at first that bothered me a bit .
1 #### I like generally like Galco but this one did n't do much for me . I 've pretty much bought every IWB holster out there and I finally found one I like .... needless to say this one is n't it . Not even close . Check out n82tactical.com . Best IWB ever . Seriously . Hands down . No contest . Thank me later .
5 #### Pretty sporty and fit perfect ! Make more colors available in Mens . Stand out in the crowd with your favorite color .
4 #### It works - I used it for a kids bike ( he really wanted a kickstand like a big kids bike ) It is pretty adjustable . It does kind of stick out a bit , so that may be an issue on some bikes , it barely is out of the way on his .
5 #### Soft , strong , great quality and stitching ! A Fantastic training belt for daily use or attractive for your " nice uniform " for testing / demonstrations . I am really a size 6 but I like to buy the next bigger size and wash / dry it once and shrink it up- that way when it gets nasty ( white with sweat - salts ) , I can wash it w/o worry of it shrinking up later .
4 #### He loved them but he said they were a little bit tight
5 #### Good product , good price , did what it was supposed to do .
5 #### Very satisfied with this goal ! It has been alot of fun to play ! Net came together pretty nicely , and is real sturdy and nice ! I am thinking of buying another one for the other side of the court .
5 #### Great for target practice with my kids bow . Cuts down the runaround and works very well with the Bear Scout Bow set .
4 #### When I bought this suit I was really unsure about it , but when I recieved it , it was more than expected . The suit is light weight but duriable , I drive a motorcycle so when the temp in the morning is in the low 40 's i want something warm and this provides that . I like that the suits legs about half way down have zippers so i do n't have to put suit on before my boots . The only set back is it does nt have velcro to seal the neck area . Over all I am glad I ordered this suit , does the job .
1 #### This thing is so bad I 'm not even sure where to start . The size is off , the fit is off , and the overall design is a huge FAIL ! ! ! ! ! ! To call this thing a boonie is a slap in the face to all legitimate boonies out there . The chin strap came loose within 3 minutes of its arrival . And the way they roll this thing up and tie it with the chin strap to ship it should be a crime ! ! ! I only gave it one star because you had to give it some rating to write a review . In reality it is closer to a -3 stars ! ! ! ! ! A complete disappointment ! ! !
5 #### I just bought a pair of these in Frankfurt ( my last pair of Keens is getting ratty after 8 years of a heck of a lot of use -- great sandals ) . I want to confirm that they run a little small -- I usually wear size 38 European ( I 'm not a big guy ) , but these in 39.5 European fit just right . Superb sandals though -- I jog in them , hike in them , go canoeing in them , yard work , you name it .
4 #### I like this set up for hearing protection and have not been back to the range to use them yet so I reserve not give the 5th star until such time as I have been able to test them in the field .
5 #### This watch is great . It has the hands identified so that the child can know which is hour / minute . It has a light which m daughter loved . The strap is comfortable and it is a cute design . Highly recommend it .
3 #### I love converse but can not respond t o this because I purchased the wrong size
3 #### way too large , if you are 10 order a 9 ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 12 get 11 etc
5 #### Perfect fit . Perfect look . Love the reinforced toe and control top .
5 #### I would never take these off if I did n't have to .... LOVE MY CHUCKS
4 #### Love these , super cute , but no support , did n't expect any though .
5 #### Kept our lil buzz flying for months before he finally caught them in the door and put a hole in them
2 #### Flimsey , does n't even begin to seal , wo n't stay latched . Inappropriate for anything even moderately heavy or moisture - sensitive . Steel ammo can can be had for less $ $ $ and exponentially better in all aspects except for weight .
5 #### Very happy with these pants . They fit as expected , and color matched as descripted
5 #### I kept searching these shoes all summer and then finally found the best deal on Amazon ! I lvoe them and I wear them every day ! ! Very comfy and lightweight ! !
5 #### i figured i should get the 1 because i 'd only be able to squeeze the 4 about one time . i probably should have gotten the trainer because squeezing this thing 10 times makes by forearms feel like they are gon na pop . it is a lot harder than i anticipated , but i am getting used to it now , these things are awesome . my only problem is the knurling is pretty aggressive .
5 #### This pair of shoes bought for a long time , I often wear it , it is easy to match my clothes , I like it very much
5 #### The last pair of Jungle Mocs I had was over 10 years ago . I bought them again because I just needed something to get on and off quickly when I drop my son off at daycare since they do not allow shoes in his room . Still as comfortable as I remembered them . I wear them all the time now .
4 #### This little watch is priceless . The dial is pretty and is easily read . The band is rather small , so if you have large wrists , it may not be comfortable for you . It fits me just fine and I love having it for a " work watch . "
5 #### Makes the task of changing the string so easy even a woman could do it . My wife made me say that .
5 #### My husband works in a freezer and the temps are -30 . This brand is the only one that holds up to those temps . I have ordered other brands in the past only to be disappointed . We order a box of each , foot and hand warmers every month , and the quality has always been consistent .
5 #### I usually wear 8.5 or 9 . I ordered women 's 8.5 but will get 8 if I order again .
3 #### Kept my sons neck warm during a recent ski trip , BUT it quickly stated to pill . I found little blue fleeces of fur all over my sons ski jacket .
5 #### these are the best quad lock rings ever . they hold solid on a picitini and makes the scope look 10x better .
5 #### Awesome tennis balls , unfortunately my son opened all 4 of them as soon as the came in .
3 #### Nice color but I could have ordered a size down .
5 #### Very comfortable . I always buy 1/2 size large in Keen and they fit perfectly . Nice casual look . Great for walking .
5 #### I ordered a 6.5 And I love them , they fit perfect with enough toe room I would order again .
4 #### Pellets , small rocks , lots of camping fun or backyard fun . Sturdy construction . just exercise caution when using , especially if you 're a first time user ..
5 #### darn fine jeans heavey denim and you know wrangler butts drive girls nuts so what more info do you need
5 #### They 're chucks ! What else is there to say ? Timeless classic shoes :)
4 #### Great fit . The only disappointment is the thickness of the stocking . The stockings are not as sheer as they claim . The white hose almost appear opaque .
4 #### The fuel took a little getting used to as it does n't burn as clean as kerosene when cranking up for the first time . I bought it for the dual fuel capability , not that I plan on running unleaded gasoline through it anytime in the future , but it 's nice to have the option . It served me well on my last two camping trips .
4 #### Pros : -Soft -Strong -Portable -Light -Durable -Thick Cons : -Too soft for dancing -Doesn't absorb all the weight when you jump on it , but definitely cut down on the noise for my neighbor !
4 #### I have had the fins since open water cert 's , and they perform well in surge and current . They are very long and barely fit in my large travel case , I did by the XL size . After about 50 dives , the rubber ends started to split from the plastic channels , so longevity might be an issue , at nearing 100 dives they are showing their age . Overall , I like the fins but due to the length , they do take up a lot of space . They do provide good thrust even in poor conditions . The yum yum yellow does stand out under water .
5 #### Support was perfect and made my legs feel better ! They were n't difficult to put on . Will buy more in future .
5 #### Without exception , every person I 've handed these too is surprised how nice / clear they are . Especially when I tell them I paid $ 21 for them on Amazon . I do see now however they 've went up to $ 29 . Bummer .
1 #### I was going to wear this under my wedding dress but there were so many things wrong with it ! I ordered a 34D in ivory . I m 5'4 and weigh 150 . The fit was ok . The waist part fit fine but the cups stuck out too much . The size of the cups were perfect but its like the band part gets wider at the top and there was a big gap . The cups shape though was pointy and looked odd . The ivory color is more yellowy than a cream color and it did not match my ivory dress . The corset looks ok on but the edges were so itchy ! All around , the top and the bottom itched and I only had it on for maybe 5 minutes and I could n't wait to take it off ! I could n't imagine being in it all day . I am returning and I do not recommend .
5 #### An American Classic ! Need I say more ? I want to find them in several more colors if the price is right !
5 #### Bought these for 12 year old granddaughter who had asked for them for birthday present . She was thrilled ! The feel of them around her ankles took her a day or two to get used to , but now she says they feel fine . She wears them to school almost every day .
3 #### I really like the shoes but they we 're the wrong size . I called to get the right side but they did n't have my daughter size . I appreciate all the effort in sending them on time
5 #### I needed a case to protect some electronics from being damaged during transit , I have another Pelican case that survived several drops and a flood while protecting the contents by floating . They are great cases , buy one .
5 #### Just what expect for a shoe that 's been around 98 years .
5 #### my grand son of 8yrs old LUVS it thank u santa ( amazon ) and grandpa
5 #### These are fabulous . No sagging , durable , soft and sleek . THE best at a great price .
5 #### Straight out of the box , these shoes are great ! Very lightweight and fits comfortably on my feet like a glove ! I love most especially that the sole is not bulky like my previous running shoes I hated those things lol ! I would give them a shot and they are great for the price !
5 #### Converse Chuck Taylor All - Stars always deliver style , comfort and quality . I love my new Chucks !
5 #### THESE JEANS FIT AS EXPECTED AND LOOKED REALLY NICE ON MY BROTHER
4 #### I would have given 5 stars -- what 's not to love about these classic sneakers?--but , this pair in bitter lemon was boxier in the toe than the same size I own in black . I do n't know if there are size variations amongst the different colors . Had to send these back , but it was worth a try at such a good price point .
4 #### I already had a pair of these from a uniform store for the police Academy . They are identical but cheaper . They fade after a few washes but they fit as expected . Nothing special , just cargo shorts with a painful button fly ( plan your bathroom breaks ! )
5 #### As always , my kids love these shoes . Great fit , durable .
4 #### I have to admit they are not the most comfortable shoes ever , but they look very cool . I expected them to be a bit large so I ordered half a size smaller , but could have even gone a full size smaller . Still , they fit well , and have room for arch support insert . Would not give up the cool factor for a little bit of discomfort-- that s just me .
5 #### If you are looking for shoes , comfortable , economical and lightweight these are what your baby needs I 'm amazed at how cute they look , when all eyes are used to them , their colors are vivid and fashionable . Perfect fit to your size . Fit well with shorts , skirts , leggings and jeans . 100 % recommended , they will not be disappointed to see their girls as beautiful wearing them .
1 #### This ball needed air straightout the box . My boys were unable to play with it and now I need to purchase an air pump . Will not purchase again should have brought from a local store .
1 #### just recieved it today and i played only one game and everywher you thrue the darts leaves big deep hols i thought it was a good board since it said it was a viper board for compitition but i see its not i guess after a couple more plays i do n't want to even look at it and the colors red and green wher the dart hits it it rips verry disapointed i guess i learned by this last one this is the second one i purchased i guess i would have to go personal to a sports store
5 #### I bought these for my son and he loves them . Much better price than I 've been able to find , now if I can only find a red pair in his size .
4 #### This kickstand is solidly built and should fit the great majority of bikes . The height adjustment works simply and flexibly . The installation was a little problematic for me , however . The bike I bought this kickstand for is a kids ' model from Walmart . It actually has a small plate at the rear horizontal frame fork . This is exactly where the kickstand should be attached and I suspect that the maker of the bike planned to include a kickstand in the first place if Walmart had chosen to do so . The installation therefore would have been straightforward if the crew that came with the kickstand had not been 1/2 inch too short . Fortunately , I found a spare screw in my garage that is of the right size . This saved a trip to Home Depot .
5 #### Great scope for the money . Fine crosshairs . Can pick off dimes at 25y with 22 . Easily adjusted . I have a couple Simmons now and both work well .
2 #### nice watch for he price but the armband fits too loosely and I am not a petite woman .
5 #### By far the warmest socks I have ever owned . My feet stay very toasty even during the Chicago brutal winter and the blizzard we just had . Feet stay dry and they extend slightly up the calf for a little extra warmth .
5 #### THE LEGS ARE JUST A BIT LONG AND RUB ON THE KNEE CAPS . OTHER THAN THAT IT IS A GOOD PRODUCT
4 #### A good substitute for Vionic sandals and flips ; with toe protection at a much better price !
4 #### Hey , lets face it , you probably wo n't go broke buying these binoculars and for the price I think they work very well . As others have mentioned , the lens caps have a tendency to drop right off but other than that they work pretty good . When I initially received them one of the eyepieces was sticking slightly and would n't move in and out in sync with the other when focusing but it seems to have remedied itself . I leave these sitting on an end table in the living room all the time and it allows me to get a close up view of an active eagles nest on the river .
5 #### The family has had several pairs of these for a couple of years . Great shoe and love it in all conditions .
4 #### Well made know . Would of giving 5 stars if the sheath was different . The knife was sharp out of the box . Packing was good . This is my first SOG . I did the paper cut test and pasted . If your looking for a knife that will tyak a beating I 'm 99 % sure this is the knife to have . Amazon used Ontrac as the carrier and they are subpar . The delivered to the wrong address . This knife was ordered under my wife 's account .
5 #### Great for all my yoga practices but mostly i use this one for " Hot Yoga " with my mat towel ! It stays the course !
2 #### This will work in a pinch but is not nearly as good as using a standard sling with hardware . I use it with an air rifle that I did n't want to drill and put hardware on . It has n't broke yet , but not sure I would trust it with a high dollar gun .
5 #### I love it when a book arrives in this kind of packaging . And it arrived right on time . And the book itself is wonderful ! I added tabs to each chapter and have completed the studying and knowledge review for 3 sections in the past week . Time to go scuba diving with someone who can pass off these dives . The only thing that would make it better would be spiral binding so it lays flat while studying .
5 #### second pair . Comfortable and great for people with bunion issues or previous surgeries . Sole wears great
5 #### Bought as a gift for my son who works on ships all over the world and in very cold climates . Fit perfect , light weight but durable and warm . Let 's you stay warm and not feel bulky .
5 #### These fit perfectly and were just as described . Sperrys are such a classic shoe and no problems with shipment . Would recommend for future purchases .
5 #### I purcased an identical pair about two years ago and loved them . I walk on the outside of my feed so I purchased a pair of Dr. Scholls gel inserts . The combo is fantastic !
4 #### I got 2 of these for my boys , 5 & 7 . We camped in 30 - degree weather and they were nice and toasty . There is no way the sleeping bag is ever going to fit back in the stuff sack though .
5 #### For this low price , one would expect a toy . This is no toy ! Definitely the real deal . I 'm not an expert but I have played around with binoculars and telescopes enough to recognize a solid , well - constructed , precision instrument.as opposed to a cheap plastic toy . It has a good clear view . I like the focus control that you tilt back and forth to adjust rather than the traditional knob which you twist . And the separate adjustment for the right eye allows you to dial it in to balance the focus correctly for both eyes . One other note : I have a small head and most binoculars are too wide to fold close enough to cover both eyes well . These Falcon 's do ! So they could be used by children as well as adults .
5 #### Good , may be a little overpriced but stabilizes the ankle holster a little more .
3 #### The bra is nice but it gives me a missile shape I do n't like that
5 #### My favorite shoe . Most comfortable shoe I have ever worn ..
4 #### This is loud , but it does the job and sure beats manual pumps ! It takes a few hours to charge , though . So if you 're going camping , charge this over night , the night before you leave for your camp site . That way you can have up to two separate pumps to pump your air mattress ( if you 're going camping without any outlets ) .
5 #### These are very nice and such a nice low price , I paid under $ 7 . It does not look as opaque as the photo suggests and it does have a feminine neckline ( sort of a scalloped lacy pattern ) so do not plan of buying this for a man like I did . It definitely looks like a woman 's top . According to the size chart I should have ordered the small but I ordered a medium and it 's perfect , just loose enough to be comfortable but still tight enought to wear under clothes . I am 5'9 130 lbs and wear a 34C - D and the medium was perfect . It is long enough , it covers my entire stomach . This is indeed delicate and care must be taken , I am washing mine in delicates bags , but well worth the small investment to keep warm in the winter . I 'm seriously considering buying another set of these for my emergency bag and to keep one in my car for winter emergencies . For under $ 7 you ca n't go wrong .
5 #### My wife said that they fit well and are of qood quality .
3 #### I was very happy with my shoes but now the sole of my shoes is vanishing after 6 months of eventual use on weekends .
5 #### Perfect fit . Perfect for maternity , nursing , and even if your not nursing . It 's so soft . As soon as I tried it on I ordered two more . Plan on getting all the colors .
5 #### Absolutely love these shoes and color ! ! They are perfect for running ! I run roughly 4 miles 3x per week . This is my second or 3rd pair of this exact style . Fit is perfect !
3 #### I bought them for the classic look and in that respect I got exactly what I expected . The part that I did n't like was how uncomfortable these shoes are . These shoes basically have completely flat bottoms with no arch support . After walking in these shoes for a couple hours my feet hurt just like they would if I had been walking barefoot . I had shoes like this growing up and they did n't bother me then , back problems and aching joints are something I seem to have grown into . I understand Chuck Taylors are a classic style that should n't be messed with but would anyone complain if they made the sole a little more comfortable or at least added a quality insole ?
5 #### I 've had my " Bucket Boss contractor 's briefcase " for about a week now . I 'm replacing an expensive leather satchel that is wearing out , and this seemed like a quick fix while I shopped around for another good ( expensive ) satchel for work . Instead , I think I 'll keep this ' Bucket Boss ' as long as it holds up , which may be a LONG time based on how well it is made . The briefcase is much roomier than it looked in the photos , it 's light , and it appears to be very sturdy and well - made . Mine cost $ 28 and it would have been a great deal at $ 50 . I especially like the fact that the flap does not have to be clipped shut to use the hand - carrying handle ( unlike some " messenger bags . " ) The " Bucket Boss contractor 's briefcase " is a great satchel and a bargain at the price -- highly recommended .
5 #### This shirt is very well made and will outlast most others that you buy . I bought a 3x tall , because 6'3 tall and have wide shoulders , so I try to get that size for most things expecting quite a bit of shrinking in the wash for such a cheap shirt . I 've worn this shirt numerous times and it has n't shrunk at all . The same as it was when I first put it on . Therefore it 's a bit too big on me , but that 's my own fault for not realizing that the material would be this good for such a cheap shirt . I plan on buying more in different colors in a smaller size .
5 #### Due to the four different sizes ( width 's ) in the kit there was a sight to fit the ventilated rib of my Browning and Remington shotguns plus one for my friends Winchester . With the spring steel clip , installation was a breeze .
5 #### Love the color and fit . Hat not as breathable as my issue boonie , but keeps head dry in light rain
5 #### I got this for my Granddad - Ohio State Fan and he loves the garden flag
5 #### Works awesome at close range . A lot better investment than the fly tape I bought . Plus its amusing ......
5 #### Excellent fit . Follow the advice to choose 1/2 size smaller than your normal size and the fit is perfect . Delivery was fast . Cost was lowest among other sellers . Would love to see more colors available . Would buy from this seller again .
5 #### This thing screams through ice , 6 " model . Do n't bother with a power auger unless you insist on lots of 10 " holes , need a ridiculous number of holes , or need lots of holes though more than 12 " of ice . I have drilled holes through 15 " ice , and do 15 - 20 holes in 10 " ice without getting too sweaty . Of course a flag is usually up before I 'm at the 5th hole ! Fairly light , comes with an okay blade guard . WATCH your pant legs , I 've put several slashes through pants without even noticing , brushed it against myself but was not cut . Through 2 seasons so far ( ~8 - 10 trips ) and blade is almost like new . You can consider a light oil to keep it from rusting in your basement . Replacement blades a little pricy .
5 #### Ordered these for my son . Glad they came in bigger size ( 15 ) because he has a hard time finding fashionable shoes that fit well and do n't cost too much . Will order more in the future . Seller is great , fast and merch . is exactly as presented .
4 #### gym shoes ordered the size , standard for the child , comers were one and a half sizes more . Take one size less ! Are sewed accurately , on a foot are convenient , the child is glad . Ordered the second couple one size smaller . Quality excellent
4 #### We bought it for out granddaughter , so my experience was only assembling it . The bungees do take some hand strength to fasten . It appears to be solid and well designed . I still revisit this if I hear more from granddaughter .
4 #### I always come back to Buxton for wallets . This one has a place for everything , and I do mean everything ! I really like the currency compartment -- there are two slots for bills and a center zippered compartment for coins , receipts , or large denominations . There 's also a change pouch in front for easy access . There are almost enough card slots , and there are a number of plastic sleeves if you run out of slots . For some reason the slots are not of uniform size and I had to do some finagling to make some of my cards fit . I also wish the snap flap went over the currency compartment so I did n't have to keep it zipped , but I 'll get used to it , and I 'm sure the leather slots will loosen up with use . After an exhaustive online and in store search , I 've decided that this clutch gives the best bang for the buck . Mine is red , and it 's a rich , not fire engine color . I 'm very pleased .
5 #### I just purchased this cooler for $ 13.00 on sale ca n't wait to give it a try ;)
5 #### I ordered these for my now husband to wear for our wedding ! They looked great and fit perfectly ! Also , props to LastPairs for being the only seller with a men 's size 13 ! That was a relief ! Thanks !
5 #### Good looking classic Chuck Taylors . Built quality is great . Fits as expected just because I know enough as to buy one size down my real size .
5 #### Great Xmas present for my 9 yo daughter . She loves this . Assembly was quick , and the setup and charging is very easy for her . She uses it almost every day , going around the block with her brothers / sister .
5 #### we love these to tie down our kayaks and find ourselves using them often for other things . i really like the rubber cover is moveable to tighten the strap and place it back over the buckle .
5 #### This watch is perfect . I needed a classy yet low key watch for training when I 'm in the classroom . This is it ! It is beautiful enough to be worn out for a nice evening date as well . Note : everyone e complaining about the screws being too big- those are for looks . They 're actually made to be pushed out with a tool or safety pin . I 'm the least handy person you 'll ever meet but after watching a YouTube video I was able to remove the links myself . It had to be taken down four links but it is so elegant and such a great buy .
2 #### I have Timberland boots that I 've worn for more than a decade that are both rugged and comfortable . These boots fell far short of what I expected from this company . First , they were much too large for my son 's foot . We ordered a boys 4.5 wide . I wear a women 's 6.5 . I put them on and they fit with room to spare . They were like boats on my son . Second , the material felt like recycled plastic . It was very stiff and unyielding to natural movement . Third , there was almost no support in the foot bed . The first thing my son said when he tried them on was , " These are uncomfortable ! " The only thing that seems to be as it should is that they do appear to be waterproof , although we did n't test them . I assume this because they made me think of a couple of boot shaped plastic bottles . So these are going back and I probably wo n't be shopping for Timberland 's anymore .
5 #### A great sturdy lock . My first gun lock and i can not see anything wrong with it . It works like it is supposed to .
5 #### I wear a size 3 pant and got this in a size XS , it ran a little big until after you wash it for the first time then it shrunk and fits me perfectly post wash
4 #### Needed them for my brother 's wedding because for some reason some people think Converse go with tuxes and I had no say in the matter so I shut up and did as I was told . Ca n't complain , though -- I still wear them , and though they felt a tad big at first after breaking them in they feel fine .
4 #### I really like these jeans . They are little to large . I have ordered a pair 37x29 to see if they fit better .
5 #### I walk a couple of miles daily , and this warmer is great on those really cold mornings . Comfy , easy to put on and very soft . I 'd buy this again .
5 #### Very nice sling . I could not find one better shopped at Cabelas , Academy Sports , Dicks non of their slings even came close . I 'm useing this on my Winchester 12 gauge and it looks great . It matches the realtree mossy oak on the gun . I would highly recommend this Sling . It looks and may be leather covering the padding . High quality .
5 #### Love this shirt on my husband . Fits great and came fast . We are very pleased !
4 #### My mistake really - this will motivate me to lose those 10 pounds I need to however . Really like these jeans for the price .
5 #### These fit perfectly as usual . This is my fourth pair ( all different colors ) and they are as perfect as my other pairs . I wear these to hike , bike , grocery shop , just about anything . When they get dusty or dirty I throw them in the washer and let them air dry . They look good as new . I would recommend these for anyone who is active and looking for a shoe that is as comfortable as a slipper !
5 #### My husband loves the fit of Carhartt t - shirts . The 2x tall is a perfect fit for him .
5 #### Bought these for my wife the teacher . She is now super hip among fourth graders . Good fit , good quality . Boss !
5 #### These bands are great quality and a good price . I use two and three of them together depending on the exercise and they work well in conjunction . Handles are comfortable and the set is compact enough that it does n't take up a lot of room .
4 #### I just love my new jeans and they fits just fine for me . They arrived on time just as I expected them to .
2 #### By the time we got the shoes and tried them on , went to return , and they did n't have them in the correct size he needed . So we are having to return them and my husband is left chuck - less . Perks : shoe looks great , awesome chuck - quality . Deffinatly go 1 - 1.5 size smaller then your norm though . I was kinda let down by how low their stock was . I tired to find something to replace this shoe in his size(13 ) , but all I could find was the classic black & white . He wants a little variety from the norm .
1 #### I 've not even had them a month and the bottom is coming off . I 'm not happy !
5 #### My son loves Chuck Taylor Converse All Stars , and these are so durable ! He wanted the high tops this time , so I got these for him . He loves them , and they came so quickly even though it was during Christmas season rush .
5 #### This water carrier definitely a better type of plastic used from the china one I bought a few months back . Ca n't wait to test it out camping !
5 #### Great . If you want order this just know your size . I 'm 100lbs , 5'2 " . I got A / B and it fits perfect . But would n't fit someone bigger
5 #### My daughter was going for fashion and individual personality more than arch support ! LOL . She loves them .
5 #### This balance bad works well for standing balance ex but you can also kneel on it to protect your knees if doing quadraped exercises or tall - kneeling exercises or half - kneeling exercises . It is well made and it still going strong for me . Easy to keep clean too .
3 #### This was my first sleeping bag purchase for a recent camping trip , the sleeping bag is very warm , that night was almost 30F and it kept me warm and toasty . My only complaint and this is just my opinion is the bottom , it is too narrow and it makes it hard to move around , also if you decide to zip it up all the way it feels too tight . As far as the length , I had no problem with it , I am 6'1 . Other than that , it is a good value for the price .
1 #### Only gave this item 1 star rating because of bait and switch . I was excited when it came in but when I got it , I noticed something was wrong . Either way , I went ahead and just attached the towel on my golf bag ... Long story short , picture on Amazon was not right . No mascot on the towel . Was going to get it replaced but it did n't have that option . Only refund . Other than that , towel was great quality and embroidered . Golf balls had he mighty D with the mascot on it ... Does n't have a brand type . And normal wooden tees .
5 #### This is the exact same knife I bought at bass pro a year ago- a quarter of the price . but the black is actually more like charcoal grey .
5 #### Great overall I was skeptical because of the other reviews I have owned 3 different pairs of timberlands had to sell because my foot grew a half of an inch . These fit perfectly 7 in kids fits an 8.5 - 9 in women delivered fast . I ca n't believe how dumb some of the other reviews that they were " fake " you could always return them then shoot !
4 #### its a broom for peetes sake and its made well ...
3 #### Sweet and sour pork is acceptable to eat but it 's my least favorite mountain house . I would n't turn my nose up at it but at the same time I probably would n't purchase this flavor again in the future .
5 #### Bought 4 of these scooters for my kids ages 8 , 7 , 5 , & 4 . We were sick of all the bikes taking up so much room in our garage . The kids LOVE these . My 4 year old even named her scooter , lol . They are easy for even the little ones to carry from the front yard to back yard and they fit easy in any trunk if you want to take them somewhere . They were worth every penny spent !
4 #### Great looking boot . Great fit and great price . Would receive 5 stars , but the stitching at the very top which is supposed to be a double line is only one line and on the inside it veers off course completely running off the leather at the downward ' point ' . Also , the front corner of the right heel has chipped off and I 've only had them for a couple months . I also alternate wear every other day . In my opinion , given the price , you will not find a boot with the look , feel , and comfort at such a bargain anywhere else . The problems listed above do not truly affect the boots integrity . Therefore , I would recommend these boots to anyone who wants a great boot at a steal .
5 #### Very dense , thicker than we were hoping which is great ! I will buy another but not for $ 40 + . They are too skinny for that price .
5 #### Always did like this style , and in black which was hard to find .
5 #### I love these pants ! Super comfortable , more of a relaxed fit . I originally bought a size medium , but while those fit I felt I wanted something a bit tighter , so I bought a small for the next pair . For reference I am 5'8 " and am about 153 lbs . The pockets are nice and big , which means they can sometimes bulge out or crumple oddly , but I do n't really care . These are fantastic ! And the fabric feels good , not super thin , but not too thick , very nice for casual wear or working out . For those that are looking for hip huggers , these are not it ! When pulled up correctly the cover my belly button , but because of the stretch you can fold the waste down a bit . Love them !
5 #### These jeans fit nicely . As with all Wrangler jeans on my body , though , I find it difficult to use the rear pockets as they seems to sit high . Good in that I 'm not sitting on my wallet . Bad in that I now keep my wallet in my front pocket as it was too hard to get it out of the rear pocket for my taste . Why the 5 star rating ? Great jeans that make me happy at a good price . This is not my first pair and I 'd likely order more .
5 #### A very handy tool to have for various needs around the house . Much needed item that I had to have
2 #### Ave quality , poor instructions , virtually no clearance . Consumers have gotten used to the idea that an average product is somehow excellent . There is nothing particularly strong about this product . It meets my minimum expectation overall . The clearance with a 40 mm nikon rimfire scope on a ruger 10 - 22 takedown is almost zero . It almost touches the barrell . This is a terrible oversight . The lens / dust cap will not fit ( it is that close ) so I have to cut and modify the lens protectors to get them on . The instructions do not give guidance on recommended positioning of the scope , centering ( or front or rear justified ) . I did not buy and install a series of competitive products to see if and what might be better . I can say that this product in its design and implementation falls short of what you should expect .
5 #### Great durable mat , a little heavy but grip is great . Lifetime warranty sounds great , we 'll see when we need to use it
3 #### Well ... if the light is turned on during daylight hours , and you do n't realize it ... thats the end of the light up portion of this frisbee ... other than that , it IS a frisbee
1 #### It does n't help in my tennis elbow at all . It caused more pain to my elbow and is not as effective as the exercises and stretches that my physio therapist taught me . Maybe this is too heavy and I should start with the red one .
5 #### I am so glad I found a billfold made like this . A friend of mine wanted one and I could n't find one anywhere in the stores . I 'm sure she will enjoy it .
2 #### These shoes are poorly constructed and I do n't expect them to last more that one summer . Would not recommend , and will not order another Nike downshifter series again
5 #### Favorite Nike shoe ever ! The flex sole is excellent for someone like me who loves the free feeling of sandals or being barefoot . These move effortlessly with the bend of my foot . I 've worn these for multiple activities and I 've had no foot or ankle pain . The white / green / dark grey color goes with so many outfits and the mesh breathes perfectly on hot summer days . Highly recommend !
5 #### I 've had many pairs of Converse over the years and Chucks are still Chucks . These seem somehow blacker and stiffer than my others , but maybe I 've just gotten used to wearing a broke - down faded pair . My only complaint this time around is that one of the lacing grommets is completely unpainted . It 's bright shiny silver in otherwise black - out shoes .
3 #### I swim lengths three times a week . The pool water irritates my eyes . The Speedo swim goggles are well made , but I 'm having difficulty getting them to fit properly . They do n't seem to be large enough to fit over my eye sockets comfortably and fog up on the inside . They do keep my eyes from getting irritated .
5 #### When the first pair wore out , my daughter wanted a new pair exactly the same . They are comfy , they last well , and they fit just the way you think they will . We love these shoes .
3 #### Did not come with a lanyard as shown on the advertised photo . The cushioned rubber is not the most comfortable feel on the lips if you 're used to having the whistle in your mouth the whole time .
3 #### So , so uncomfortable . Might not be bad as a flotation device . Company had great customer service that 's why I"m upping my score to a 3 not 1 star review .
5 #### I purchased this T - shirt in Large Tall for my tall , long waisted son , who has a hard time getting t - shirts that are long enough . He absolutely loves the fit !
5 #### I got these for my son , and he loves them . He looks great in them . I got a matching pair for myself , and now we run around tearing it up .
1 #### 75 % of these were hard like a rock and would not work . I did n't have time to return them . I was told that they get super hot and to be careful . The ones that did work were lukewarm at best . Worthless batch .
5 #### Handsome , slim watch . Liked it so much I bought another one in a different color . I 've been wanting a Skgen for years .
5 #### Works as advertised . Sounds like a horn used on the water . Love it for bear warnings .
5 #### A late review , but I 've been using this watch for more than a year now and I love it !
2 #### Thought they had the muscles in the chest and it does n't .... otherwise ok product .
5 #### Brice Henderson friend and business partner to Asher Barrington has always been a go getter so when his latest project was the one that could get him recognized his talent , he went all out . But what Brice did n't count on was a face from the past turning his world upside down . Lena Razzi a single mother to a little boy named Nicholas got a job as a replacement for a month at B&H Advanced Engineering but what she was not told was that she would be working for an old flame .... the one and only , Brice Henderson . When Lena and Brice came face to face it was a surprise to them both , the chemistry and attraction were still very much alive .... The former still loved the latter ans vice versa , they were both trying to stay away but to no avail . Lena never told Brice about Nicholas cause she never wanted her son to feel rejected by his father . But when Brice found out about his existence , he regretted the choices he made in the past .... Choosing success over family and relations . There was no turning back the hands of time only looking forward to the future with Lena and Nicholas . ONE WHITE LIE was fascinating . Love Dominic Corisi , Trent and many more making an appearance . This is my first book by Jeannette Winters , I 'm thrilled that she 's working with one of my favorite authors , Ruth Caredello and I ca n't wait for what they have in store for us with this amazing series .
5 #### My husband jumped back when he saw this color . Then we went out and he got compliment after compliment .
2 #### I was very disappointed when I opened the package . The shoes have been worn and used . I usually do n't write reviews for products , but for this , I must because they clearly state the shoes are brand - new , unused , AND unworn ! Do n't waste $ 50 on used shoes when you can get new shoes for the same price . Do n't take the chance of having used shoes sent to you . Save your money !
3 #### These shoes look really great . However , slightly loose . The problems with lack of support arose when I exercised . It feels like there is little to no support in them . Possibly this is a shoe more geared for an office environment or short walking distances .
5 #### To quote Mark Twain : " I was a grown man before I was smart enough to carry a pocket knife . " This is an excellent pocket knife , and I always keep this with me and it has come in extremely handy any number of times . It 's small enough to carry around in a pocket without any discomfort , and it sure has some great features . A couple of observations : - What is called a " wire stripper " in the knife really is n't ( but it could be ) - it 's a hook for loosening rope knots ( I guess its original use was to tighten boot laces ) . - The saw blade and reamer are wickedly effective and the large and small knife blades retain a nice edge . - Never had much use for the can opener , bottle opener , or corkscrew , but the screwdriver blades and scissors have gotten a lot of good use . - I foolishly damaged it on a camping trip but Victorinox repaired it for free . Great customer service ! Besides my own knife , I 've bought these as gifts and everybody loves them .
5 #### This was a great fireman costume . The fabric is really thick , so it was great for a cool Halloween night . It was very authentic looking , my son got plenty of compliments on it ! The hat could be better , it was just a plastic hat and pretty average . I purchased the 4/6 size for my son who wears 4T. The pants were a little long , but it fit pretty well .
4 #### Very cute - wish so much they fit me ! Ordered the same size I always wear in other brands but the center of the ball of my foot was smashed against the top of the shoe , so I returned them . thinking about ordering in the next size but the fit was strange so i 'm not sure .
5 #### This pin Is awesome it is definitely the 24.00 dollar one you see on sports websites and not the cheap wincraft one it looks great and is the perfect size for your lanyard or polo collar i was nervous it would be cheesy and crummy but its great to let the rest of the world now patriots are the best " they hate us cause they ai nt us "
5 #### I love these shoes and only returned because it was too small . I got my new ones a half size larger and they fit perfect . I 've always been a 7.5 and have purchased these in a 7.5 in the past but this time they did n't fit . Not sure if the sizing changed a little but the 8 is perfect . Wore them out the first day for a 2 mile hike and got no blisters and feet felt great !
4 #### These came in good shape and fit nicely on both an 11 and 14 year old . They seem sturdy enough and comfortable to wear .
5 #### Love this knife . It is always durable and handy to have . I have always bought Swiss pocket knives for work and do to my kind of work , they are very handy ..
5 #### Works really well . Holds much heavier items then a cigar as well .
5 #### Love this mat , especially of the wooden floors in a yoga room might be coming up a bit if there was a leak or something , that small milimeter can really throw your balance off on a thin mat , this evens everything out for me . It is super heavy and annoying to lug around . A great home practice mat or if you can store it in the studio . Or I like to use this as my camping / okay to get dirty yoga mat . I brought it to a 3 month long camping site and just would kay it near the fire for people to sit on a clean surface .
5 #### I 'm a size 7 - 8 in women 's , so I decided to buy a 5.5 in Big Kids ! Such a great money saver and my new Timberlands are so comfortable ! Quality is excellent . I ca nt wait to wear these during the winter .
1 #### I ordered a 6x they did n't even fit . I wo n't be ordering these again , Thank you for making them available , but they need to get their sizes figured out
5 #### I 'm delighted with this watch . It looks good , keeps good time and is comfortable to wear . I agree with some of the other reviews that the date display is pretty much impossible to read but I do n't use it so it does n't matter to me . For those who rely on a date display , I would suggest looking for a different watch .
3 #### These are OK - not the highest quality . It would be better if the links at the top were a bit stronger . We do not have kids hanging from the nets but the links weaken quickly anyway ...
3 #### I wanted something with a bigger face than this one has , so I returned it .
5 #### Ordered them for mom . Good price , fast delivery , great product .
5 #### I keep buying both the low profile and high top versions for my son as he grows , and he loves them . The shoe fits nice , has a good flexible sole for running on both pavement and grass , so for a toddler , that is a plus . Also , he can wear them all day , and is comfortable . I think the fabric is good for developing feet that need to stretch , but still give enough support . He likes these way better than the Saucony 's I bought him , which seemed to never break in , and were a bear to put on .
5 #### I ware these shirts everywhere I can . The pocket is nice to have . Not cheap butt worth every penny . Thank you
5 #### Love this shoes so comfy and great very everyday use . Runs big
4 #### this dress feels somewhat thick on me and the ties are kind of cumbersome .
5 #### I sized up a half size , and these amphibious cuties fit great ! I have been a Keen fan for years , but this is the first pair of strap on sandals for me . I tried them out last weekend on a trip to Central Oregon , and they were great for walking around town and trails , and as I waded in the Dechutes river . I felt very sure footed in the water despite the slippery rocks . It sure is more fun than going bare footed , and my pedicure was protected . I would highly recommend the Venice style to help minimize the look of larger sized feet ( I 'm a 9.5 normally , 10 in this style ) . Not all Keen styles fit the same , but both the Venice and Newport run 1/2 size small . Love the versatile blue !
5 #### The shoes are a little long , not too much but do n't fit snug like your traditional Nike or other tennis shoes . It 's not uncomfortable though , just takes awhile to get used to . I added a foam cushion pad in the insoles and it makes it perfect !
5 #### The mat is soft , well made and most importantly does not smell of weird chemicals .
5 #### Great for out in the tree stand . Does n't let the cold through and very soft . Great for the aluminum bleachers that get wicked cold at football games . No problems now .
5 #### This binocular is really nice . Sharp , easy to focus but , best of all , very bright image . I gambled on the junk Vivitar 7x50s for slightly less and they were a joke -- hard to focus , very dark image . So I bought this bushnell for barely a ten spot more money . Wow , very bright image , focus dead on and easy . As others have said , this is all the binocular a casual user will need . My wife 's 10x25 Nikon for twice the price ( also on Amazon ) are very nice and light weight especially if you need more power . But these Bushnell 's are the best value for sure . Bright and clear .
5 #### Background story : I waterfowl hunt but I have a field model shotgun that was n't built with spots for a sling and 99 % of the time I have no use for a sling because I hunt in dry duck blinds . I just got back from a trip down to Arkansas . Since I did n't want to drill a hole in the stock of my gun , I bought this sling before the trip . I hunted 3 days in flooded timber with this sling holding my gun around my back . Never slipped off , nor did it feel like it was going to slip off . Highly recommend this sling if you need it rarely like myself . If you hunt flooded timber all the time , I would recommend you buy a gun that is made for a sling . There is some adjusting you have to do to make sure it is tight around the stock before you throw it over your shoulder , but not much . Since the sling goes over the barrel of the shotgun , I also purchased a $ 14 hi viz tru glow fiber optic sight since my shotgun only has a bead . I was able to see that sight perfectly fine . Strap probably would 've blocked my bead sight .
3 #### These are the most perfect slipper - comfy shoes I 've ever worn . Alas , they never last for long . I wish that instead of providing two pairs of shoelaces that are never needed due to the shoe 's small lifespan , Saucony would spend more time improving upon the durability of these vegan shoes . Update merely 4 months after starting to wear them : the fabric in the shoe has torn and the outside is fraying badly as well . Not worth the money , but still the most comfortable vegan shoes on the market . It 's a damn shame .
5 #### True to size , sneakers are perfect , will definitely buy more for the rest of my family . Highly recommend you to buy from this seller ! ! !
4 #### When buying all stars make sure that you are being by the gender that you like . I mistakenly brought the unisex shoes but they still fit okay .
5 #### I remember my nephew having one of these when he was younger , and he still has it to this day . A very durable and fun transportation product for children , safer than a bike and more portable when folded in half . I like the adjustable height design , perfect for children of varying heights .
5 #### I buy a case or two of these every winter . They work exactly as advertised . For best results open the package about 30 minutes before venturing out into the cold .
5 #### My favorite style , by my favorite company ! Buxton really makes nice items that stand the test of time . I was so happy to see all the colors and styles available . I would not hesitate to purchase item again .
3 #### I returned due to wrong size . Sizing was very confusing on website
5 #### Very nice quality for the bucks . I 'm a 35 waist & bought the LG " just in case " as I 'd rather they be a bit loose than too tight ( with no room for a bit of " spread " ) . I 'm very happy with the look & the fit .
5 #### This is just what I wanted . I am 5'8 " and size 18 . I got the 44/28 . It is fitted without being tight and hits just below the knee . Like the photo . VERY happy with this purchase !
5 #### This is a good seal that was nearly an exact replacement for the old one that had rotten and chipped away over the years . The length was great and the nails for installation were of good quality and easy to install ( no bending ) . Good product .
5 #### These are great for getting lots of coverage since they let you cast a country mile ! Using on an ultra - light setup with 4 - 6 lb mono I 've pulled in tons of 12 - 14"+ trout on them down at my local fishing hole .
5 #### These are by far the best patrol boots I have ever worn . I have a narrow foot so the " wide " issue was not an issue at all for me . I work as a night lieutenant for my Police Department in Iowa . These boots are great for traction in the winter and keep my feet warm but not hot . The break in time is a few weeks but once you get past that point you will not believe you waited so long to purchase these boots . They polish really easy and only required a few coats of polish to get them there . These boots seem to wash off easy and still look brand new after a couple months of use . If you burn through the sole you can send them to Danner and they will put a new one on for you so as long as your upper stays good for a small fee these boots should last you many many years . One guy on my department cashed is out after wearing them for 13 years on the street . 13 years ! ! ! ! !
4 #### Solid and functional . I have a 26 " barrel and no problems using this rod for the entire length . I do however notice red rubbing off if I 'm not careful and rod hits the barrel . Overall , great tool .
5 #### Good old fashioned Carhartt work pants . I wear them for work all the time and they are rugged . I like the double knee for working outside .
5 #### I have a Leupold Mark AR on my 20 " H - bar , which is a great scope , but you pay for quality . I needed a small scope for a Savage Mark II .22LR . I first tried the Mueller 4 - 14x40 mm , but it was WAY to much scope for the rifle , and just seemed " cheap " . I sent it back , and for the same price got the 4x28 Weaver . Obviously it is less scope for the same price , but what you gain is a quality Japanese scope that is light weight , and bright . It 's not the cheapest rimfire scope available , but you get what you pay for . EDIT : I have since moved this scope to my Ruger 77/357 . Though not the kick of a rifle caliber , it is significantly more than a .22LR . I 've put about 100 rounds through it and it is holding up , and holding zero . Time will tell , but so far it 's a pretty sweet combo .
5 #### All the good stuff included without being too bulky for your pocket . The blades are sharp and the saw tooths are impressive ... I would n't drag it across my finger . A very nice army knife .
5 #### I suppose you just can not beat a good ole standby . If you want a fancy watch with diamonds and have the money to spend thousands on a watch go for it . If you want a watch to simply accurately tell what time it is , ya ca n't beat the time and trusted Timex . They truly do " keep on ticking . "
4 #### Very good quality . The fabric is thicker than usual women 's clothing which means I do n't have to wear anything underneath it . The hems are good double stitching , and the color is exactly as it was on the screen . I can see myself using this dress as often as I can . I am several weeks postpartum , but I see how this would fit a pregnant woman in a flattering way . It 's nice to have something stylish that I can also feed my baby in !
5 #### I love these shoes my second pair . I spend a ton of time outdoors and I have never had a pair last as long as my last pair .
5 #### I could not believe how great this was . I took this camping and luckily a friend of mine had a pump to help me blow it up . I 'm not sure how long it would 've taken me on my own . Once it was blown up it was great . It stayed inflated for the entire weekend and I slept comfortably each night . Deflating it took a little bit of time , but I was able to fold it up in packet back into my duffel bag . This inflatable camping pad was so much better than sleeping on the ground in my sleeping bag . I found that it was firm and it did n't wobble . I recommended this pad to several people .
5 #### this little sneakers is so amazing , very comfortable for my baby . it also matches my own red converse ... matchy match mum n daughter
5 #### I love this wallet . I 've tried many and they were too small or too large . Lots of space for everything , plus it 's cute !
5 #### Fit great , seem to be constructed solidly . Hope they hold up , they 're very cute ! The only issue I had was this product listing did n't specify " natural " white . On the drop - down menu I chose " white , " expecting to get bleached white color ( which it showed on the first picture I saw . The photo changed to the " natural white " color on the next screen , but the product description still said white . Ugh . Confusing . I thought I was getting bright white shoes , but these are the " natural white , " which look yellow . I was gon na send them back because of this , but they looked cute anyway , so I kept them . Ca n't help it once you fall in love .
5 #### generously portioned sleeping matterss , has held up well and been WAY more comfortable than any foam pad could ever be- and folds up much smaller for back packing as well
5 #### This net has held up for the past few weeks in a lot of wind and rain . My 13yr old assembled it himself in about 15 mins and had it up in the backyard and ready to play with . It is a very nice size and so far has held up very well .
2 #### I forgot why I quit buying these mocs , but now I remember . The sole breaks down quickly , leaving an uncomfortable saddle under my arch . Boo . From experience , I know this will get worse until I have to throw the shoes out LONG before they wear out any other way . It becomes crippling .
5 #### Very happy just wish it was a tad bit smaller for a better fit .
5 #### These are freaking awesome ! ! ! ! So pretty & just what I wanted !
5 #### I bought three of these , one in each color and Amazon want to rate them separate . So ... As far as scooters go this is the standard by which all are judged . Sturdy and even ( though definitely not advised ) an adult could ride it they are so ruggedly made . They are rated to 143 lbs . Set up is easy as they fold like a jack knife . Just unfold it , telescope the handle to the right height , and lock it all down and you are ready to go . Elapsed time under a minute . To store just reverse the procedure . It took longer to get it out of the box than it does to " assemble " . The best part is the kids love these . They can go fast with minimal effort . The learning curve for a 5 year old is about 10 to 15 minutes to be able to ride . In addition , we see young teens still riding them at the local skate park doing tricks . So not only does the product last but so does the fun . A must have for most kids .
5 #### RCBS is the best . Product support & customer service excellent .
1 #### Because they are for men , not for women . They may fit perfectly in men 's feet . I do n't know .
4 #### These are great shoes ! Comfortable , warm outside in the snow , good arch support , good workmanship . nice finish . A high quality shoe . There 's just one thing : when they 're wet , they can by very slippery on some tile floors . so be careful at going in from the rain at some restaurants and stores with travertine ( ? ) or tile .
5 #### Perfect ! I love these shoes , and have ordered two pairs so far for me and my fiance . Very high quality and legitimate ! I love how cool these look . I will buy again when I wear mine out !
5 #### Really like these fluke , put them on a jig and when it 's the right bait the bass will bite non stop . They are a must have in the tackle box with the other plastic lures . These are the smaller ones so you get ten of them too .
5 #### My son and I are very happy with this net ! It is well made and should last a long time . We used pliers to bend the hooks onto the rim like other reviews suggested and it stays in place and works perfectly !
5 #### Excellent cover for a shotgun left in a dusty environment !
5 #### I like the product . The product did not come with any instructions , but it did not matter for me since I have access to youtube and was able to use the videos on there as a reference . After a couple of weeks using it while playing tennis , I could notice my tennis elbow pain subsiding . Although not completely gone , I think it would completely go away if I actually took time off from playing , but that s is on me .
5 #### Works great to hold your dutch oven lid , also used to place my Griswold dutch oven so i could place coals under it
5 #### Love these shoes . I 've been buying Nikes for years now . I bought this pair for work and everyday wear and another pair for working out and active wear . They also last a long time in my opinion , especially if you take care of them .
5 #### I love converse . They fit like any other converse chuck taylor all star lo tops . The color looks identical to the color pictured .
4 #### Good price on this 50 - pack of targets . The paper is of nice quality . If you 're outdoor shooting you should n't have to tack the bottom of the target down ( unless it 's really windy anyways ) .
5 #### I ordered this for my physical therapy after having an accident and it works great . It really allows me to work my hands , wrists , fingers , forearms , etc . and has helped me quite a bit . I 've actually ordered the medium flexbar and will start using it as soon as it gets here . AAA+++
5 #### Smaller than expected but excellent quality . I will be buying the next size up .
5 #### Bought several of these for my children . They love them , they said they 're just like the ones at school .
5 #### Bought these for my brother and he loves them . It helps to try them on in a store and then buy them on here because its cheaper .
4 #### My grandson loves this scooter , and I would have given it 5 stars , if they had n't made it so dang hard to fold and unfold . The thumblock mechanism is very difficult for even an adult to handle . And my grandson certainly ca n't do it on his own .
5 #### Great boots . I was a little nervous buying boots over the Internet , but these are great . I 'll buy more .
5 #### I purchased these shoes for our niece and she loves them ! They look HUGE in the box , but the fit was perfect and they do n't look so big once they are on . They have held up really nicely though as she has worth them to school and quite a few walks since she has had them . The color is also solid black and does n't fade like you may see with other forms of this material . I would say that they are the usual quality that you expect from the timberland brand .
5 #### I bought these for my son . I love them because of the price and quality . He loves them because they 're very comfortable , protect his toes , he can swim in them , run in them ... they're good for just about any activity .
5 #### So Classic ! Good Looks ! What an awesome look for a stylish little man ! He calls them his " Super Shoes " . Super Shoes ! ! !
5 #### My ring shipped the same day that I placed the order and was received well before the estimated delivery date . It is absolutely beautiful ! ! It is a substantial ring without being overly heavy and is very comfortable to wear . I 've cooked and cleaned with it on and it is still free of scratches and the finish is beautifully shiny . It also runs true to size . I highly recommend this ring and this seller ! ! Will definitely do business with them again .
3 #### I do n't know why I ca nt get more than 2 months wear from these stockings .... my only issue is that I find they ladder easily ... oother than that I am pleased with the texture and the look , fit .. just ca nt deal with the ladders so quickly ...
4 #### It 's a kids Halloween costume it will do fine . . . It 's decent quality and my son likes it fine .
5 #### ok . After a year of tennis elbow that just kept getting worse and shoulder pain in the same arm to boot , I started by buying the easiest resistance thera - band flexbar and now have worked my way up to the heavy blue bar . Physical therapy techniques I was given had minimum impact . Now after a couple of months of using them , my elbow and shoulder pain is now almost completely gone . My advice if you have tennis elbow is start small and work up -- no matter how tough you think you are . The muscles and ligaments need to slowly heal themselves . Work with it , be regular , and be patient , and it will get better .
5 #### Great shorts great price great for any occasion work fun and golf i would recommend these to everyone great great
3 #### Nice item , just very tight and hard to put on and take off . it does not fit AR style rifles well because its a tight fit , not enough give .
5 #### I love that sound of the chain when the ball swishes through . Brings back memories of playing at the courts in the city .
2 #### Watch has wonderful features for teaching child to read a watch . Unfortunately it broke after two weeks . For price I expected it to last much longer .
4 #### Bought a cheap scope to throw on my daughters Rascal .22 but it came with dovetail rings . found these weaver mount rings for a decent price so I decided to get them . I have n't shot with them yet but they seem to be pretty well made . I like the double strap design and when I was tightening them down they did n't feel like they were about to strip like the screws on some of the other cheaper rings that are out there . I am happy with this purchase and would for sure recommend these if your looking for decently made , cheaper set of rings .
5 #### an excellent set . We really enjoy using this and everyone loves to play . It 's become one of our favorites .
5 #### This mask was more effective then I ever thought it to be . I removed about twenty seven 55 gallon bags of blown in insolation when I pulled the ceiling down . This mask saved my life . The filter clogged after two uses with heavy dust but was expected after hours for two day with think dust . Worked perfectly and I could breath easily .
5 #### Competatively priced and a good durable " safer " arrow for target practice . Happy all - around with them . Priced better than what I can buy these for at my local stores
4 #### These are good targets with indicators for areas of the body struck on each shot . They 're dark and the hits are n't that readily discernible at medium and long range . They also require a target backing of some type and a target stand , to keep them from blowing and generally moving around . Good value for the price .
5 #### I think the pearlized face is attractive and I find it easy to read . I like that the band is not too shiny . Since the band was too large I had a watch repair shop take out a some links ( my wrist measure 6 " ) . I have had good luck with the durability of Timex watches in the past . I would recommend it .
4 #### I got this because the larger Nalgenes I have do n't fit in my Jeeps cup holders . This one does and has all the same qualities as the larger version .
5 #### This thing is awesome ! I bought 3 of them , one for each of us and we used them last winter several times after a good wet snow storm . We built huge walls and had a ton of fun defending them against snow - ball fights .
5 #### Does what it 's supposed to do and is solidly made . It also doubles nicely as a trivet , especially for my dutch oven that has no legs -- I can use this lid stand to raise it up and put coals underneath . It 's a * little * bit tall for optimal heating with charcoal in that respect , but only a little . If you put it directly into campfire coals it would work great .
5 #### Keen shoes have never let me down and here is another great example ! My feet do not feel tired after wearing them at my 8 - 9 hour per day job . I am on my feet approximately 6 - 7 hours of each work day . I am able to wear socks as the seasons change ? Amazon made great time on the delivery too !
5 #### I 've gone back to consulting after 7 years of retirement . Sooooo , I 'm back in pantyhose . These are amazing both in fit and quality . I wish I 'd had them all the years I was working . Truly they are the best I 've ever worn .
5 #### Got it for my son in law . He loved it . Very hard to buy for , so this was great ! Awesome deal !
1 #### Too large and I did n't realize it was n't stretchy . Sent it back .
5 #### Folds up neatly - rides smoothly . Will make a quick trip to the car parked over a mile away .
5 #### I now have 4 pairs of Keen 's all in a little different style and color , love them all . I am a dental hygienist and wear them to work , they really " spruce up " the scrubs ! Always get compliments on the shoe , and if it is cool out I just wear socks with them , I know a little geeky but it works for me ! They are all so comfy and my feet never hurt by the end of the day . Definately worth the investment.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Keen - Venice - H2 - Sport - Sandals - For - Women / dp / B002NK8642 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Keen Venice H2 Sport Sandals ( For Women)</a >
5 #### She has been wearing these for many years . Hard to find locally .
5 #### These sandals fit and felt great right out of the box ! As recommended I purchased them 1/2 size larger than I normally would for a shoe . I love KEEN sandals for their comfort , support and the fact they 're waterproof ! I wear them to the office , for casual wear , hiking and even riding my motorcycle ( they have excellent grip when putting your feet down at stoplights , parking , etc . and I have a big heavy motorcycle ! ) . They 're also easy to clean and dry quickly . This is my second pair of KEEN 's . The fit and function of the first pair I purchased 2 years ago is why I bought a second pair . I 'm very happy with my KEEN 's !
5 #### Bought as a gift for my Granddaughter . She is crazy about them .
5 #### I buy these to play fetch with my dog . They have a soft edge so they 're easy on his mouth , and they fly really well ! After a lot of use with the dog they get deformed , but that 'll happen with almost any thing when a dog is involved .
1 #### Do nt buy , I can see the glue where the toe part is .. so upset
5 #### These tinder fire tabs work great . We have not used them in the rain without cover , but we have used them when it was snowing and they did the job
3 #### I wish they would come in wide sizes that would help me so much I love the shoes but my feet are to wide . and that 's always a problem buying shoes for me .
5 #### Got my money 's worth - looks the part - love the head - dress - looks so authentic
3 #### The Large size delivered were really Xtra large I needed for an event and did not have time to return
4 #### cost was fantastic . the bag is nice to store these in . i like that you can clip many of the bands to the handles . i use these while binge watching shows on netflix . arrived very quickly .
5 #### these shoes fit my husband size 15 foot very well , and he absolutely loved them .
5 #### I love this watch .. I have very small wrist and it fits perfect . Dial is big enough to see the time .
5 #### Really cute and bright . We get tons of compliments on them .
5 #### I used these on a recent dive , and they are a nice alternative to filling / purging my mask to clear fog . They act like windshield washers that you use your fingers to push around . One magnet goes on the inside , and one on the outside . When you move the one on the outside , the inside one moves in tandem . Not sure how long the soft felt on the magnets will last , so far no problems . With these , you do n't have to take your eyes off the reef if your lens fogs . The other divers on the boat were very interested in these . Do n't forget to buy two - one for each lens in your mask .
1 #### I 've always heard to buy a half a size smaller than your true size . So I did they were way too small . I returned them .
1 #### They said the screws were included on the packaging info -- they were not . I used zip ties to tie it off to my milk crate on the back of my kayak ... should hold for a bit until i get to the hardware store .
4 #### A pretty sturdy skateboard for the money . A great holiday gift for fans of Spongebob , Patrick and the rest of the gang from Bikini Bottom !
3 #### Stiff but should work Okay you get what you pay for
3 #### This will be fine for my 3 and 6 year olds . It would n't hold up to teenagers using it . You get what you pay for .
5 #### Lightweight , yet tough enough to take a beating , ( although if your laptop is in it , I would n't recommend it ) Many - Many pockets to slide things into and the laptop compartment is excellent
4 #### Used for multiple canoe camping trips and cooking during a kitchen remodel . Good ' ol classic Coleman products . Tried and true .
3 #### I returned this product because it seemed huge . I was looking for something to work on balance for horseback riding - this was just too big for me ( I 'm 5'5 " ) . It seemed like it would be fine for use on working on balance , was really easy to put together , but for me was just too large and it 's nice to have different size fulcrums .
3 #### I thought they would be silky - smooth they are not but not as bad as others I have purchased
5 #### First of all you are asking the wrong person so , I went to the horses mouth and this was my answer . Its the bra I have worn for years and it always fits . so , there you have it .
4 #### These shoes are very comfortable with or without socks . The only minor gripe that I have is that laces seem to wear quickly . For such expensive shoes , they should come with more durable laces .
5 #### Good price for the Quantity will save me about 20 % excellent witness for Zeroing your rifle at 100 yards .The Sticker system , works great to install on my AR 500 Steel Plate ! to see my impact and adjust my M.O.A
2 #### Do n't buy these shoes , size chart way off . Returning is useless . Junk !
5 #### I work in construction and these boot brushes are a must have on the jobsite trailer steps ! Durable , heavy duty even for the roughest of construction workers !
4 #### My elderly father loves this watch . He can read the dial and appreciates the Indiglo feature . He ca n't see the tiny date window but that 's OK with him . He tells me every day how much he likes his new watch .
5 #### This pump is really rugged and durable . It is also fairly light and works great for small tires or balls .
5 #### perfect for 1 , quick setup , and take down . comfortable when inflated fully
4 #### I ordered my regular size and that was fine however , they were way too wide , which was a surprise since I have a fairly wide foot . I ended up returning them . I was very disappointed - they were super comfortable and I know they could have been worn all day long without any issues .
5 #### Carharts are the best work wear . These are the real canvas duck , not the thin cheap cotton blend that is on store shelves today .
5 #### This is the ORIGINAL ACME Product ... ! The loudest whistle I 've ever heard . In fact the kids at school tell me it 's to loud
1 #### Do n't waste your money ! Too small and it ran literally as soon as I put it on ! So disappointed ! The color was also lighter than I expected ! I was overall very dissatisfied !
3 #### I had to use two to bring a .5 liter of water to an almost boil . It served the purpose but you can go through these really fast .
5 #### Good quality Bowstring wax . Very thick and easy to apply . Just rub it in really good after applying . About the same price as local stores . Shipped out and delivered on time .
5 #### I 've bought this watch many times in my life .. Love Timex
5 #### My husband loves them , and I think the color ( olive ) is stylish . Hubby has a wide foot and they fit him well .
5 #### This is the second Connoisseurs Silver Polishing Cloth I have purchased . The first one I bought over 3 years and there is still plenty of use left in it . This one is going to be a gift to my friend who works with a lot of jewelry . I 'm sure she will love it . I purchased this originally to polish my Pandora charms . I quickly discovered it worked on much of my other jewelry removing tarnish and returning my bracelets , earrings and charms to like new shine . It 's a two part soft cloth sewn together . One side is used first to remove the tarnish then the other side is used to polish and shine . It works well . It does n't need washed if it starts to look dirty . It will work until as long as it continues to remove the tarnish and polish . Mine is still working just as good as when it was new . Recommended for anyone who wants to keep their fine jewelry looking its best . Also good for those who do wire wrapping and other jewelry crafts .
5 #### This mini Griptilian I ordered by accident . I thought that I had oredered a Griptillian but realized later too late that it 's the mini and I 'm glad that I screwed up . This knife works so nicely and it acts like it 's an automatic . Great daily carry utility knife . I 'll probably end up getting the 3.45 " bladed Grip to compliment my Benchmade Contega ..
5 #### She usually wears a girls 8.5 or 9 , these run a little big so we got the 6 in mens ( 8 in womens ) . Arrived on time , a great , versatile shoe .
4 #### I previously had a less expensive stove . The bottom of it was open , with sheet metal edges . It came with four small attachable bumper feet , which constantly fell off . Someone broke into my car and stole it . Now it is their problem . This stove has an solid bottom , and feels more substantial . I would have given it 5 stars if Coleman had figured out a better way to connect the propane tank . The metal arm that screws into the tank on one end and the stove on the other always feels vulnerable . If feels like it would bend or break if struck or dropped with the tank attached .
5 #### It is very difficult to find pantyhose that fit my plus size frame . Normally the products are too small or too large . These pantyhose fit perfectly . I 've purchased 3 pair and I love that they do n't " ruin " easily ! !
5 #### My son in law wears them to work & is the only shirt he likes .
5 #### Carhartt makes high quality products and the prices are in my opinion reasonable .
4 #### Good light weight shoe ... had to add insole for more support .
5 #### I love these shoes . I exercise in them as well as just take them on longer walks . Feels good , looks GREAT ! !
5 #### Ordered these to protect my rifles while in the safe . They do fit very snug on rifles with scopes . But with a little stretching and pulling , I was able to get them on . I 'm ordering another set for the rest of my rifles .
4 #### The balls I got were not broken at all . I live in SoCal and they came from Illinois . I also ordered 2 guns and they all came in the same box wrapped to the teeth(no complaints here.)The outside was a kinda camo look and the inside was a good looking orange , pretty to see . Ca nt wait to hit the fields next weekend and ill update when we get back .
4 #### I 'm a binocular kind of guy ! Got 'em in my cars , at the office , in my street facing ' observation area ' . These are decent quality , low cost general purpose binoculars . Nothing special but adequate for most of us mortals .
5 #### Got for granddaughter , her color is purple , so glad I found this , she loves it
5 #### I love K - Swiss shoes . I had n't worn them in a few years and forgot that they tend to run small , If you wear a half size , round up !
2 #### If you weigh over 90 pounds , DO NOT get this . I am 130 pounds , and I had a hard time getting in it without water flowing in . The oars are cheap and the pivot point on the raft is not comfortable . Save up a little more money to buy the higher series version .
5 #### The Sherry brand has consistent sizing , and the boat shoes fit exactly as expected . Thank you for the quick delivery and best prices available .
4 #### My first impression of these shoes when I put them on was that they were heavy and hot . After wearing them a while , it felt like the arch support did not line up with my foot 's arch . Also , the strap that is on the inner side of the shoe cuts into my foot a bit , and I do not have a wide foot , They do seem very well made . The weight is from the thick sole , which is what makes them supportive and great for walking , and that is what I am looking for . I plan to wear them around the house some more to see if I can make them work .
5 #### My husband wore them all day and night at our sons wedding and danced in them half the night at the reception it was real late when we gave up and went home . He wore them in the wedding with his suit like all the groomsmen and groom did .
4 #### They definitely run big . Make sure you get at least a half size smaller than you normally wear . The shoes are nice
5 #### I had tried them on in a store first , so I knew to get a 1/2 size smaller when ordering . I have narrow feet and with the long lacing and my orthotics , I can get them just right so my ankle stays in .
5 #### I ve had a few pairs of Billfish Topsiders . They have never disappointed me !
5 #### Our dog loves this . Its easier to throw and easier for the dog to catch than the larger disc that Aerobie sells .
1 #### Great product , absolutely the best fins on the market in my opinion . BE AWARE ABOUT NO EXCHANGE POLICIES .
4 #### Great chair bad feet . This chair is incredibly light weight and compact . It is very comfortable for me . I am 5 ' 10 " and weigh 210lbs . Best camp chair I have ever had . Not to say there is n't some room for improvement . One of the feet broke causing the pole to sink into the dirt . I fixed that foot with some epoxy and duck tape ( from my kayak repair kit ) . Then one by one the rest of the feet were lost in the dirt . Pretty soon I looked like a deer taking it 's first step whenever the chair was not on concrete . When I told the manufacturer about my problems with the feet . They sent me replacement feet without even asking for an invoice . I wrote them directly instead of going through Amazon . Unfortunately I had moved on before they arrived ( Long kayak trip ) . I bought big knobbly feet for a hiking pole ( Pace Maker Extended Life Vulcanized Rubber Replacement Tips / asphalt Paws Ferrules ) and used them and it was great . With the new feet this chair is nearly perfect . I hope the manufacturer looks into putting something more like these on to keep the feet from sinking into the dirt . These chairs were never intended to be used in areas that have nice flat asphalt after all . With the new feet the chair is a perfect 5
4 #### Very comfy . If they had pockets , they d be awesome ! I bought these for me to lounge around in and my husband has stolen them . I might have to buy another pair !
5 #### These things are the best ! They bounce when I son runs which is the cutest thing . Thanks !
5 #### fits just like I wanted it to . loose around the thighs
3 #### Do n't expect too much for 25 bucks ! It is definitely worth the price but the optics are not great . When it comes to binoculars , you get what you pay for .
2 #### Meh . They got runs more easily than others of this type that I have bought . They were also long for the height range . I 'm 5'1 " , so I 'm on the short side but I have tights that fit my height in the same range . Definitely wo n't buy these again . The only nice thing is that they were very smooth and the reinforced toe was nice .
4 #### This shoes runs bigger . Order one size smaller than your regular size . I am returning a mens 11 and ordering a10 .
5 #### I love the Timex Cavatina . It is just about the only watch I wear . I have thin wrists and this looks good , matches my gold wedding band , and is reliable . The face is clear and easy to read . Because the band is fine thin leather , after two or three years , you 'll likely need to replace it , but it 's pretty easy to find a leather replacement band . I have dressier watch I wear for special occasions but this has been my go - to watch for years and I highly recommend it .
4 #### Saw this hat advertised , since I wear desert digital uniform at work , thought it 'll look good as an addition . Good looking hat , fits well , not a cheap made hat .
5 #### Very happy with this watch , easy to set , easy to read , comfortable to wear !
5 #### This is the first helmet I 've ever purchased in my life . I 've always just not worn them but now some of the rides I 'm doing require helmets . This helmet was light , secure , and comfortable . It did n't rattle around and I was able to find my adjustment quickly . The ride I went on was in the low 60s , So I ca n't comment on cooling or how much the black color attracts more heat , but for the price , I was very happy . If you 're on the fence about cycling as your new hobby , this is a great way to get a helmet and participate and you wo n't be crying when you see that $ 80 helmet sitting there not getting used if cycling turns out not to be your thing .
1 #### arrived broken , battery dead . did not light up will send back for exchange . This is second one I 've bought as the first one was excellent but we lost it though so bought a new one but battery was dead on arrival
3 #### After using a friends pair of hand warmers on a cold day I decided to buy some of my own . I took a chance with these hand warmers and they work okay ... but do n't expect too great of a warmth . Like all hand warmers , they take some time to warm up to the warm temperatures they 're known for . Shake it up and let it get exposed to the air . For best results you should keep it in your pockets so you wo n't loose any heat to the cold . Bring it out for some air and shake it a bit more once in a while . Overall it a decent product ... gets the job somewhat done but still leaves your yearning for more .
5 #### Have been wearing this brand for years . They really last .
5 #### Anyone looking for a different type of Redskin apparel will love this item . Loved the fact that it was n't the classic red .
4 #### All I can say is awesome and fits true to size .
5 #### original stren is pretty much all I 'll do nowadays . Proven quality , strength , and consistency .
5 #### My husband loves these shoes . These are his second pair . He wore out the other ones .
4 #### Real Classic Converse , a must have ! It fits too large , but I knew that before buying , I ordered a 5.5 size for my 6.5 regular size , and fits great !
5 #### This product is an amazing value . No only is it a print of an aggressor , but it has shadowing of a spine , heart , brain and lungs . Took it to the range today and just had a great time with it . A must have for anyone who loves shooting . I just ordered two more 50 - counts !
5 #### You can use this as a range viewer or enjoy watching the moon close up .
1 #### I normally wear a 42 B but I had to buy a C in this . It fit but man is it scratchy material !
5 #### I love the color , the kind of best red in the world . I also got another pair for my friend .
2 #### cheaply made , marks up scope , and won"t hold zero on high powered rifle . had to purchase quality rings to satisfy my requirements . probably would be good for small caliber rifle .
5 #### Gifted this . Been a year . Was going to repurchase figuring it was needed and loved as they are worn everyday but ... after a year they are still in great shape . Maybe another color .
5 #### I seriously have purchased these style shoes in 8 colors . I love the retro style and the fit is great . I seriously do n't think you can go wrong with these stylish old school runners . They come with 2 options on the lace colors . Fit great right out of the box . I wear these a lot when I 'm gon na be walking around a long time . As a nurse , I wore them to work ( with an extra all - day insole ) until I wore 2 pair out . I later switched to the saucony hiking shoe though .
5 #### These are great shirts .... I have three . The vented cape works well . I always remove the Columbia decals from above the front pockets though ... just do n't like being a billboard .
5 #### Bought for husband ; he LOVES them . Fit was excellent , color was true and best of all the price was good .
3 #### The benchstone and guide did n't seem to workout together . Contacted the company twice with no response . I can not judge the quality of the stone as I am not sure if I had the correct angle ... as the guide was not useful . Sending it back to Amazon .
4 #### This product was perfect .. very satisfied with these shoes.:)perfect fit and great color well made Converse is the best shoes to wear .
5 #### Love this scope . currently have this on a flat top mid length rock river arms ar-15 with traditional a2 front sight post and it is great . True 1x , so if you do n't really like red dot sights like me then this accomplishes a similar goal . The clarity of this optic is really its greatest strength , that and is weight at only 8.6 oz . At 3x I can see bullet holes punched in paper at 100 yards by a 5.56 projectile and am calling shots for a buddy with his cheaper 2x-7x tac scope . With some high mounted UTG quick release scope rings , the weaver scope co - witnesses perfectly with the traditional front sight post and there 's just enough room under the bell for a magpul mbus flip up sight . Really squared away my ar platform , love it .
5 #### great gift for my Granddaughter who is 8 . She can learn to tell time with this watch
4 #### I bought this for long - term field work this winter . It 's great because 1 ) 40 pairs ! and 2 ) warmth ! I 've found these products can vary in heat temperature depending where you have them - an insulated glove , they 'll get pretty hot ; holding onto them in the cold air , not so much . Let them warm up inside the car / building several minutes before going outside and they 'll do great .
5 #### i buy these for my husband for work . they stand up to heavy abuse - bleach and water just roll right off . i buy them from amazon because I can never find them in stock anywhere on island and amazon has the best prices !
5 #### These are quality Converse shoes . They are exactly what was advertised and expected . They fit the same as other converse . Nothing remarkable to report .
5 #### Very good and very comfortable and light . I would buy again again nice . The color is also very good .
4 #### Right one is slightly tight .. hope it will stretch out .. ! !
5 #### I am so far loving these shoes . I am not a runner , but I stand and walk a lot . These fit me perfectly and I have trouble finding shoes that fit . It you vary in size I would suggest looking at the size of the shoe that fits you best and trying out that size first . Another plus was the price . Buying these shoes direct from Saucony website they are $ 60.00 each I got two pairs for $ 59.00 :)
5 #### At first I did n't like these knives . But I lost my blue one on the beach and could n't stop thinking about it so I had to buy another . Super knife .
5 #### These stay warm at least as long as they say . This is the best deal for the most hand warmers . I slept warm with these in my hoody pocket .
5 #### Great shoes . I can vouch that this shoe in general is the best brand you can buy . A + + + + +
4 #### I have had this style before in a different color and have received many compliments on the shoes . They are great walking shoes ! I wear orthotics and these shoes are one of the best I have found to accommodate them for fit .
1 #### I bought 4 packs of these at Target , two in black , two in natural . The color was fine , black was a little sheerer than I expected , natural made my pale legs look naturally tanned . The reason I 'm giving them one star is because EVERY SINGLE PAIR got runs after the first use . Embarrassing . The fabric is cheap , and I was actually appalled at the difference when I compared these with my trasparenze and JC Penny tights . Wo n't ever buy these again , complete waste of $ 40 . I 'd rather buy one pair of $ 20 tights that will last for months than two of these that wo n't last one use . JC Penny makes amazing tights that last much longer . I think the brand is called Sheer Caress . H&M also makes really nice tights , but I have long legs and I always felt that the crotch of them sits a little too low for me . Trasparenze is also a nice brand , but they also run a little small and ca n't take a beating like the JC Penny ones .
5 #### My husband loves them . They fit good and look good .
5 #### I researched pricing for a simple watch for my husband and bought on Amazon.com because of the excellent price . He is thrilled with his gift .
4 #### Really nice tool . Only problem is that the large and small blade stick sometimes then snap closed when put enough pressure on them , got ta make sure you 're extra careful or you might lose a finger
4 #### I love this mat . It 's not THAT heavy , I do n't mind toting it with me to classes . I do n't sweat a lot , so have n't had any issues with slipping , and do n't know if I would when it gets wet . I use a citrus mat spray I bought here on Amazon , which I love , and it helped remove the " new rubber " smell . It did take a few weeks , and now there is no smell at all . This mat is great . I love the thickness and the width . My only suggestion would be to get the extra long version . I am 5'2 " and this mat just seems a bit short to me . I have to be careful of my placement or I end up hanging off one end or the other , more than I ever did on my cheaper , slightly longer mat . When I need another mat , I 'll definitely get the XL version of the black mat , I like it very much .
5 #### Carhartts and great work pants , do n't snag , hold up to rough wear and kinda water resistant + protect from a lot of sparks created when welding .
5 #### beautiful , but still a little pricey in my opinion . If the price ever drops I would definitely buy more .
5 #### easy to set up and looks great . love that sound
5 #### I have owned several pontoons and this model is by far the best yet . Big and stable , and long enough pontoons to stay stable in chop . Everything is well made , and this boat will certainly give me years of great fishing . Simple set up with and electric pump and manual pump to finish off . A bit heavy to carry at 70 lb , but honestly it is worth the effort . Handles a trolling motor and has plenty of weight capacity and storage to bring more than enough gear , equipment and the like . Would like to see a second rod holder ... but it is what it is .
5 #### This is the 2nd year I 'm getting these shoes for my little one . He wears a sz1 little kid and he loves them . They keep his feet warm walking to school which is about a 15 - 20 minute walk . I particularly love the color too does nt show nuch scuff like the lighter color did .. Great buy will buy again
1 #### I honestly hate this pantyhose . It sags even though it fits well around the wasteline . It 's wrinkly . It 's also itchy . I 'll never order that again .
5 #### I ordered 2 scooters from Amazon and my kids have gotten much use out of both of them . My son was 3 when we gifted it to him and he 's practically a scoot pro now ! Razor scooters are great and I will definitely order another .
5 #### fits as expected from my experience with dickies its good to order a size up
5 #### Awesome product . Super easy to use and seems durable . These have made docking / undocking my 17 ' boat a breeze . Not sure what other reviewers are talking about in regards to changing the knots ; my set was n't glued or knotted at all , but rather threaded into a single piece . Maybe they 're redesigned the product ?
3 #### Despite the fact that the recommended ages is for 2 - 5 year olds , this bike was too big for my 3 year old daughter . Her feet could n't reach the pedels . I do like the quality of the bike and I 'm sure she 'll love it in about a year or so .
4 #### My waist is 38 so I got a # 8 and it fits quite well . I do n't know how much it will shrink if I wash it , and I would n't recommend doing so . My first gee was 100 % cotton made in China and it shrunk big - time so I 'm a bit snake bit on the care . The price is n't bad , so if you get it dirty , buying another wo n't break the bank .
4 #### Solid t - shirt and has n't shrunk any . Have owned this shirt for five months and it has held up well . Will buy this product again .
5 #### Golf spikes , not much to say but these were a great price . As long as you have a tool they were easy to replace .
5 #### Dude those are branch loops for inserting flora for additional camouflage .
4 #### These were a little difficult to put on , but worth it because they stayed in place all day . They were a tad too tight in the panty , but are control top , so that is to be expected . They are still better than most I have tried .
4 #### Very good scope for the price . Good eye relief ( 4 " ) and very clear optics . The only negative I have is that the eye piece adjustment is easy to move and it makes it difficult to add a tight fitting flip up cap without changing the eye piece adjustment . It is a straight 4 power scope which is perfect for a .22 rifle .
4 #### Two settings : High and extremely high . Good stove , watch what you are cooking closely .
5 #### These are straight forward panties . no frills . the cotton feels great and I like the waistband and leg bands . the colors are very nice .
5 #### Purchase for spouse , and he says they fit well , and he loves color . ( Normally only can get dark denim . )
5 #### They run large . I had no problems exchanging them . It was quick and effortless . You got ta rock some Connies or you just ai n't walking right . LOL .
5 #### I love these shows and i 'm glad i got that at such a low price . Better than getting them from the store ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I bought these to keep in a go bag in case of an emergency . I have not had an occasion to test them out . However I have inspected them and they seem like they will work perfectly .
5 #### used them for the first time today on the new huck finn out of emeryville ca , have to say staying dry is the ticket . love these
3 #### These were brighter ( more neon looking ) than I was expecting . They appeared to be a paler yellow to me but the sizing was fine .
2 #### I bought 7 pairs of these work pants and I am extremely unhappy , I love the way they feel and fit , but 3 of the 7 pairs split wide open . They did n't split where you would expect , 2 pair split to the right of zipper , one pair , the ass split wide open about 1 - 2 inches from seem . 2 other pairs are now starting to rip at the back pockets . I think there 's a problem with the material because when they gave , They split about 12 inches all at once , it was a blow out , and its not because I have a fat ass either . I am hoping they stand behind their stuff because I plan to return them and buy more because they are comfortable work jeans .
5 #### Absolutely love these panties ! They stay in place and never ride up . Everything 's nice and smooth and comfy .
5 #### Wash in cold water and line dry and they will last a lifetime . Wash in scalding water and high dry and they last about a year . Wear these every day . They do not shrink . They will slightly lose color if washed hot and dried hot . Never get holes however ... collar slightly frays after 2 years .
2 #### Size way larger than expected . Plan to return item for smaller size if available .
4 #### Have n't had a chance to use it yet , but it looks really effective . Not too sure the rear hook is big enough and it is so light , it may be hard to cast without a special sinker that would still allow it to " float " .
5 #### Straight out of the box , these shoes are great ! Very lightweight and fits comfortably on my feet like a glove ! I love most especially that the sole is not bulky like my previous running shoes I hated those things lol ! I would give them a shot and they are great for the price !
5 #### They 're CT 's . What new s * * * can be said . Put on shoes , lift weights . The end .
5 #### I have never purchased shoes online . I was concerned they would be fake or used but I was completely wrong ! Very happy with this purchase !
4 #### Really good arrows just be careful of the nock breaking
2 #### too thin between the eyes , started unraveling immediately . it is warm though
5 #### Got these for my daughter to match my own . It 's quite tricky to speculate how they felt for her , since she hates shoes in general . But with the high tops , I do feel that their is more support as she is learning to walk . I just love the way they look ! Speaking for myself about the lack of arch support -- that 's why I like them .
4 #### My favorite stockings . I usually get a few wears out of them before they snag . Sometimes they do loose the shape around the ankles .
5 #### Got For My Mom she 's liking the set well made great price gon na get me a set
4 #### As with any jeans - two pair are not made alike - these are a bit snug - but are just fine .
5 #### I use this in mud instead if the paddle . does great . Would buy again and would recommend this product to anyone who fishes the flats .
5 #### Purchase for our home gym , both me and my husband use this product .
5 #### All Dickies products are of good quality to me . I bought two pairs ( one black and one grey ) of these several weeks ago and am very happy with the way they fit , wash , and wear .
5 #### Even after growing out of the costume my 4 year old son loves to put these wings on and pretend to fly around the house . They have held up for a year of being banded around and re - inflated at least once a week . The only down side to these is that they go on the shoulders via elastic pieces that connect by Velcro . The Velcro has n't worked very well since we first purchased them . On Halloween we actually taped them together .
5 #### I love Hanes Silk Reflections pantyhose . I have been wearing them for over 15 years , I have tried others but keep coming back to Hanes . I love the feel and looks of them they fit me perfectly and still look good after a long day . They feel wonderful on my legs and feel great under my clothes whether I am wearing slacks or a skirt . They are also very durable for such a sheer pair of pantyhose . As an Amazon Prime member I used the 2 day free shipping and received the package on time and in good shape .
5 #### My daughter loves these shoes . She wears a 5 in women and I got her the 3.5 unisex and they fit great .
5 #### grandkids love the shoes . they remind me of the shoes we wore in the 50s . move over nike converse is on the come back trail
5 #### Bell Sports 7015891 Standard Bicycle Kick Stand . bought this for my daughters bike , worked fine .
5 #### Nice bug gun to easily ' take care ' of the flying bugs of Texas ! Love it , kids get a kick out of shooting bugs and practicing their aim . Warning-- takes multiple shots to kill annoying red wasps .
5 #### Put them on and walked 3 hours with no problem ! Love them ! So light feeling
5 #### Do n't go on a hike without these and a way to light them , because they really do work . I keep them dry in a small zip lock bag with two pinches of very fine magnesium powder . That way they light easier and burn hotter , so if you tinder is n't 100 % bone dry it will still get it going because the magnesium burns very hot .
3 #### I have had these for about a week now ... and i am afraid to use it at full potential ... why ? well from the first minute i took it out of the bag , i could tell it is made of cheap material ... it just did not feel sturdy or durable enough to handle any demanding exercise or tension ... the rubber bands look like they can snap if you push them ... and if that happens it could be very dangerous as it might hit you and cause you injury ... i will continue to use and update this review .... but regardless of whether anything happens or not ... this is not a product i would buy again as it does n't feel firm or sturdy enough for the kind of tension workouts it is intended for ...
4 #### We purchased this for our 5 year old son - he loves it and plays on this all the time on cold / rainy days . HE has no use for it outdoors or when the weather is better - he prefers the skateboard . Older kids seemed amused with the board , but for shorter periods of time - 5 minutes here and there . The board is clearly not for everyone , but I have found playing a youtube video with some trick ideas helps spur more activity . It 's also a good way to practice balance for young ones .
5 #### These are so comfortable I am a repeat buyer . Very comfortable for work or play . Great quality build and non itchy materials . These wear well if you go around the house without shoes . I highly recommend Wigwam socks . FYI the ' charcoal ' and ' white ' photos show Ultimax but those are in error ; mine show Wigwam . These are not Ultimax .
3 #### Very very thin and not very durable . It looks like sheer underwear that can tear any second . No durability . Will not repurchase .
5 #### Works really well for cleaning the mag well during dust filled shooting comp in the California desert . You should buy more than just 1 as they get really dirty quickly , although you can resend them in the other direction to get twice the use out of it .
1 #### Update 1/8/13- Now having these for 2 1/2 years , I am downgrading this recommendation even more . It is incredibly frustrating that they can not do the basics such as having some kind of indicator showing when the device is on or off . Even without that , it should have a marking on the earphones indicating on / off . Lazy design , lazy engineering , lazy thinking . They really do n't deserve your hard - earned money ! I rated these earphones as " okay " but not great . At the gun range , they definitely keep the sound down , but it 's the little things that it 's missing . For example : 1 . It should have an LED indicator telling you if the earpiece is on or not . That 's annoying and can drain your batteries if you 're not careful , especially , since each ear turns on and off . In addition , it should at least give you an on / off indicator , even it it 's not an LED ! 2 . The overall hearing protector should have an adjustable head band . Not all head sizes are the same . I have an XL head and this barely covered my ears . 3 . Installing the batteries is a major headache , that they should definitely make more user - friendly . I have a graduate degree and this thing took me 15 minutes to figure out . Bottom line , for the money , I expect more . Either pay more for a better model or go elsewhere .
5 #### Clean , simple lines , sturdy fabric , solid construction . Used as part of band marching uniform . The relaxed fit is a bit loose in the seat , for slender young men , but gives more freedom of movement . Worthwhile purchase ; even used after marching season is over !
3 #### Footbed is different than the last pair I had for a number of years . Does n't fit as well ...
1 #### Very good grip when you first get the ball but after a month the basketball looks like it 's 10 years old . I will not buy this ball ever again and the street ball from Spalding is a little better for outdoors but still does n't last more than 6 months
5 #### Super comfortable and fit my small feet perfectly . I have flat feet so a lot of shoes are not comfortable for long periods of time . I can wear the shoe all day long and they are super comfortable . They are light colored so any dirt will be seen right away , but they are easy to clean compared to other shoes I ve had . Would definitely buy another pair in a different color .
4 #### It 's not as pretty as some of the other holsters . It seems like a simple flap of leather , with a hardcore clip . I am using a 442 , internal hammer revolver , and at first it did n't seem like it fit . Pushing a little harder it went in and fits perfect . If it molds that way on it 's on I will be stoked ! I do n't know much about leather and if I can wet mold it , or in time if it will mold to my weapon . Any suggestions ?
5 #### Great shoes ! Everyone of us in my family own a pair of these great shoes .
5 #### Looks and works great . I had a watch like this for the last 30 years only had to change the battery every 5 years or so . I hope this one is just as good .
4 #### Fits great , but legs are too long . It took three try 's to find a pair to fit the waist . I 'm a 36 x 32 and I eventually got 42 x 32 .
4 #### It works to consistently put ball in the air for baseball drills . There is a limitation on distance as other have said . But for younger little league players its fine . Saves the coach a lot of swings and errant placement of baseballs .
5 #### Love this knife perfect if you have small hands . I pared it with the keydex sheath and it looks and draws great . Great knife for the money and sharp as heck out of the box .
5 #### I have been a fan of carhartt pocket t - shirts forever , long sleeve and short . They are extremely durable and can weather the grind I put them through in exttreme temperatures here in Phoenix , Az . what is really special is the relaxed fit they have when you order your size , Comfortablity is a big factor for me and these allow a comforable fit without armpit tightness . So do n't hesitate and buy these , you wo n't regret it .
5 #### Shirt is thick & very good quality . Rugged Outfitters has a great customer service department & they take care of customers !
5 #### This works very well for me . Its great when traveling to maintain fitness since it weighs about a pound , and I use it as part of a weight and aerobic workout at home as well . It is a nice change of pace and allows you to do some expercises not easily done on equipment . As another reviewier rightly observed , its not a substitute for heavy weights to failure . Its a high rep toning device that will mininimize backsliding when you can not work out otherwise and add to a full workout with a little something different . For the price it certainly earns its keep .
4 #### The binoculars are great , only issue was the rubber on one of the eyepieces was wrinkled pretty good due to the cover crushing it for some reason , I did n't bother to send it back because it 's not a big deal for me , but other than that good product .
5 #### Had to have it overnighted because of a Christmas mix up and received it on Christmas eve in time for my son . He is only 3 and all he wanted from Santa was a pogo stick . He needs us to hold it for him , but he loved it .
5 #### This is very well made , has more pockets than you may realize ( including a big one on the back ) , and Nerf darts fit perfectly . It fits a large range of kids , including the average 6 year old . It should be good for several years of growth and looks like it can take a beating without damage .
5 #### My husband and I snorkel a lot and these hats , with their bright colors , enable us to find each other quickly in the water . They are small and not waterproof but do the job I wanted them for .
5 #### My daughter has been wanting a pair for a couple of years now . The price thru amazon was low compared to pricing in stores . This is one of her Christmas gifts . My daughter loves them and they fit perfectly . Arrived very early .
5 #### Love this long underwear . It 's my favorite and I 'll buy it again it again . Just do n't wash them in the washer , use Woolite and hand wash and it will last forever . I still have a top that I bought 15 years ago . They are warm and light weight/ thin and I will never use anything else when skiing .
5 #### This is a nice little sling - shot . It 's great for pinging in the back yard and for occasionally spooking rodents . Just give them a smack and they immediately leave .
5 #### When I 'm not in a shirt and tie I 'm wearing one of these . Very comfortable , high quality , long lasting !
4 #### super comfy and cute , but runs large . I was going to send them back but decided to keep them . They are very comfortable and I 'll wear them around the house . They kind of ' hang ' on me . They wash well .
1 #### Pros : Received item in two days . Cons : Not the same item they show on picture . It 's about half that size with grove between screw holes and not to one side as shown . My guess is this is a front mount , while the picture is that of the rear mount . Disappointed .
5 #### I have a high - deductible health insurance plan , plus I 'm cheap . I developed tennis elbow last year and went to see my orthopedist , who healed my previous tennis elbow ( other arm ) with a treatment involving blood withdrawal , then injection of blood platelets into the injury site . He said this episode looked less severe and prescribed NSAIDS and physical therapy . The PT would have cost me about a thousand dollars , so I did some web research and discovered the Tyler Twist . I ordered this bar in medium resistance and things started getting better immediately , as in first day ( and I had been hurting for four months . ) The tennis elbow is nearly gone , although I notice that long sessions at the computer , using my mouse , will aggravate it a little . I continue to use the bar . I was uncertain whether I had ordered the right resistance and considered ordering a stronger bar , but then I made a small discovery . Let 's say it 's your right elbow that is the problem . In the Tyler twist , you are gripping one end of the bar with your right hand , then you grab the other end with your left . If , instead , you grab the bar in the middle with your left , then twist it the same amount as you had been twisting before , you will encounter greater resistance than you did before . It 's sort of like buying a stronger bar .
4 #### This thing actually works . I found it superior to a traditional flyswatter because I did n't really have to move . I let the buggers come to me and popped them from angles I could n't manage with the old long - handled swatter . I deducted one star because it should have fins to keep it from twisting in the air . However , it does n't have time to twist when traveling the short distance of the supplied tether string . In that range it kills flies quite reliably , but it would be neat and fun to zap 'em from longer distances . It 's accurate up to 5 - 6 feet , but by the time it goes that far , it 's moving arse - end - first , so to speak .
4 #### these muffs are decent at the shooting range . i 'd prefer something a little larger and protects a bit more . i 'd suggest the next step up , if used at the range .
5 #### works great feels good in my hands will recommend to anyone
5 #### Just like all the others , this is the best wallet on the market . Made well and fits all my needs . Who needs a checkbook in the wallert anymore . I just keep the checkbook in a zipper in my purse for the few times I need it . I like the change purse without a zipper . This should last many many years .
4 #### A very nice shoe valet . Very well made . Price was good and shipping was fast . Only criticism I have is I wish it was just a little bit bigger , but I was able to fit every thing I needed into it ( tightly ) . Overall very pleased with my purchase .
5 #### Great scope for my 30 - 06 . Has adjustable optics and easy adjustments for sighting in . Pricing was reasonable .
3 #### I love the way these look ... they're a tad small for me ( I hope they expand a bit with wear) ... but I 'm just not sure how often I 'm actually going to be able to wear them . I ca n't walk more than 1/2 a mile or so without the backs of my heels getting really aggravated and then blistered . And that 's with socks on . Wool socks . And even blister Bandaids do n't help all that much once the area is aggravated . Really disappointing ... I hope that goes away because I do really like the way they look . Not sure why the manufacturer ca n't make the heel area more comfortable .
5 #### Works great . I 've destroyed o - rings very quickly just by taking things apart repeatedly . A thin layer of this grease makes a huge difference .
5 #### I got tennis elbow weight lifting and was in a lot of pain for about a month . Saw a review for these along with some exercises to do that could help so I decided to give it a try ! Two weeks after getting it , and doing the recommended exercises ( 3 sets of 15 reps a day ) my elbow is 80 % better and I got back into weight lifting . I 'm hoping that another 2 weeks will get me to 100 % . I am happy with this ! For 20 bucks , you ca n't go wrong ! Started with the red one and worked up to the green . Wish I had gotten bigger ones as well ...
1 #### I should have gone by prior reviews of this show design , I ordered a size larger than I wear because folks said it runs small . The larger size was too small , it does n't have the elastic in the area where you insert your foot , there is no give . I returned them , tried another pair and the same thing . Had to return those as well . I 'm done buying Merrell online~
5 #### These seem to burn a lot cleaner than two other brands I 've tried out . Very happy w/ em . The foil pouches are n't sturdy , easy to tear a bit by accident . Trioxane smells pretty strong so do n't like having open units in storage . Good burn time .
5 #### Got these as a gift for my husband for work ; he normally wears boat shoes or loafers , and sometimes has knee pain after walking around a while . I knew from personal experience that jungle mocs were super comfortable and well cushioned . H e LOVES his , wears them constantly , and they fit perfectly . They also blend well with most any casual outfit .. several steps up from plain gym shoes
5 #### A great product . Just fits my smallish wrist and quite elegant - looking . Love Timex products . No other watch at this price range lasts more than a few months .
5 #### Great shoes . Look Nice and a comfortable walking . I love them .
5 #### Just like mine , just smaller . I bought them to have a pair looking just like my large scale ones . They look great .
5 #### Having purchased Converse Chuck Taylor 's in the past , I knew they ran big . Very good quality ( for Chuck Taylor 's ) . Recommend you purchase 1 to 1 1/2 size smaller than your shoe size .
5 #### My daughter learned how to tell time very quickly and easily with this watch . She likes the slip on strap - the material is comfy to wear and the adjustable strap makes it easy to size her wrist ( she 's 9 but has a tiny wrist ) . The butterfly that moves around as it counts seconds is a big hit ! I was concerned the butterfly would make it difficult to read the watch but that is n't the case at all .
5 #### Great water bottle . I keep it full in my brief case .
5 #### Purchased these for our teenage daughter . She loves them . For both casual wear and sports .
5 #### Wow ! This is a very nice goal . I had to upgrade because the kids were blowing holes through our picket fence when they missed the smaller goal we had for a few years . The dimensions are correct as stated . The poles and net are heavy duty and can take the strongest kicks so far . It took a better part of an hour to set up as the directions were not exactly correct ... and it was very cold ! Anyway , the kids are totally happy with this goal and I will not need to replace it for a long , long time . Good job , Franklin .
5 #### Just a great mat for the price . Quality is top notch . I would buy again no question . Used as a yoga mat
4 #### My husband LOVES Carhartt , and he was badly in need of a new jacket . I bought this one to replace a " Wall 's " brand jacket , which was similar in material , but sold at Wal - Mart for far less money . The Wall 's jacket had lasted him a really long time ( battery acid finally sent it into the garbage ) , so I had hoped a Carhartt brand jacket would last even longer . It 's been just under four years now , and it is n't quite living up to my expectations . The cuffs are fraying and separating from the jacket , which has little holes all over it ( not from battery acid this time , just from wear ) , and it perpetually smells like a campfire , despite the number of times it 's been washed .
5 #### love them ! ! they work great and last my entire work shift . I also end up selling a couple packs to my co workers . Perfect !
5 #### Love them ! Just what I wanted and they fit perfectly ! !
5 #### Great product very comfortable and versatile . Price is about what you expect . Same as anywhere else but if you know what you want its a great deal !
4 #### I have had this style before in a different color and have received many compliments on the shoes . They are great walking shoes ! I wear orthotics and these shoes are one of the best I have found to accommodate them for fit .
3 #### I was disappointed that it was soo small . Without reading the dimensions I thought it would be similar to the rod racks I 've bought in the last . Truth be told , I can only use it with shirt ultralight ( ( less than 5 ' ) spinning rods . It would be good for ice fishing rods
5 #### The first one I ordered worked perfectly on my daughter 's 16 " bike . So I bought a second one and was pleasantly surprised to find it fit my other daughter 's 12 " bike without modification . Spray some lube on the pivot point because they come a little stiff , but loosen up easily with a little WD-40 or silicone spray . The shortest setting for the adjustable screw will just fit a bike with a 12 " wheel . Both bikes have two tubes coming off the bottom crank , that straddle the rear wheel . The kickstand fits between these two tubes . On the 16 " bike , there is a support bracket between those two tubes that had a hole in it for a kickstand . Perfect . On the 12 " bike , there was no hole , but I was able to install it in front of the cross - plate with ease . See my pics for clarification .
2 #### This is my 6th pair and they are the best thing ever for my plantar fasciitis and resultant neuromas . Unfortunately , the ones I ordered from SmartDestination must be seconds as they kill my feet . The hard plastic insert rubs on the outside edges of my feet . I am unable to exchange them as I waited one day too late to use them in my walking shoes .
3 #### I only use it for 50 to 100 yard range , so I am not too concerned about lack of clarity at max zoom settings . Do buy a good tripod , though .
4 #### I am sad to say this does not compare to the older versions of this wallet because of the quality of the leather . I had to keep smelling the wallet to detect that unique " leather smell " along with checking the back for the " genuine leather " stamp . I found that the card slots were just fine and the more I use them ( :) ) ...... they stretch just a little . However- when faced with never having this version again I will take it every time and continue to buy .
5 #### I use this holder on a 2.25 inch Safariland leather duty belt with a Surefire Peacekeeper flashlight . The holder holds the light extremely secure and the light only has come out when I wanted it to . The holder did cause some black finish to be worn off the tailcap of the light which is worth mentioning . That being said , I use the holder and light on duty and do not expect my equipment to be pristine .
1 #### I am extremely disappointed in this product . As others have mentioned , they stated that the line " broke " upon returning to their vessels or others have stated that these lines a meant for " temporary use " . Upon reading these remarks , I decide to test them . - What was surprising to see was that . these loops and lines are not 100 % closed ..... meaning , they are just a normal line tied together with knots on each end . I decided to test the strength of these knots . What I did was stick my finger between the knots ..... and to my shocking surprise .... IT CAME LOOSE ! ! ! ! IT CAME LOOSE WITH NO EFFORT ! ! ! ! ! - The loops are not closed ...... it 's just an open line with a knot at the end - The Plastic piece that closes the loop at the end is thin plastic ..... you might as well just make a slip knot What 's even more disturbing , is the end pieces of the nylon rope are wrapped in what looks like clear tape ? ? ? Obviously in time with the sun and water , these lines will eventually fail . Look at the photos and decide for yourself .
5 #### This was a gift to a grandson and he likes them .
5 #### It 's comfortable , it 's simple , but it 's effective and it 's just what I needed , I 'd recommend these shoes to any one !
5 #### Well built , seems very sturdy . Will be taking in the water within 2 weeks and will try and update the review . Using it to attached my GoPro Tray to my BC .
5 #### Love my shoes ! Can not believe the price I got for these , probably because it was an odd side , but I 'm so not complaining ! ! ! !
5 #### My girls love converse ! ! Look cool and comfy once broken in !
3 #### I like the material and the finish appeared to be up to Wrangler standards , I just wish they had been the size i ordered . The tag reflected the correct size but they were definitely not . The description states " Relaxed Fit " but no where on the tags or jeans was this labeled and all the rest of the jeans I have ever purchased had the " Relaxed " on them . These were in the big and tall group which really surprised me . Maybe where ever these were made they have trouble reading a tape measure that is in inches instead of centimeters . The price was excellent and I noticed that that has already gone up . I am really glad that there was free returns offered on them , as I have already returned them . I was really disappointed as I need some new jeans to kick around in and thought these were going to be the ones . sadly disappointed . If you are going to order these I would recommend ordering at least one size larger as they appear to be slim fit as opposed to relaxed fit . I am guessing that there are no individuals where these are made that need or require a relaxed fit pair of jeans .
4 #### Oars are very useful for use by a child in a pool or shallow waters , can not be used in serious boating .
5 #### better get the skinny here 1st . this sounds crazy ... but this unit is not as powerful as the other unit called " roadpro " . a word to the wise .... sometimes less = more . if you try both units ... you ll see that this koolatron takes up to 40 % longer to cook ... and it does nt get quite as hot . oddly enuff ... koolatron is the one to buy . WHY ? draws less amps . therefore it takes longer to do everything . to all that are considering the nebulas world of 12v ..... whatever .... you ll always know that everything kinda sucks . lights do n't get very bright .... 12v winches have to be geared properly or they lack power .... etc .... same here . this is a good little unit . do n't expect 30 min gormet meals ...... plan ahead a bit and this unit should be all you need .
4 #### For me the shoes are too wide ( when I can find them I wear narrow shoes ) but still are really comfortable .
2 #### I 've been needing a nude shade and this one seemed to fit the bill . However it is really thin and will probably run immediately . Also I 'm not too sure about the color for my skin tone .
4 #### People do n't seem to like these for some reason ... but , I really do . They are so easy and comfortable . I would love to buy these again . Laces suck ! These are durable and enjoyable . The only issue I had was trying to use them to speed walk to an event for an hour or so session , when they were new , was n't exactly ideal . That 's really not what they 're for though . Awesome to have these around . UPDATE : 5/24/2017 I ended up having my first pair for 3 and a half years ! They were so comfortable that I just bought another pair . Excellent , excellent shoes .
5 #### I got this upon a Youtube recommendation video . I have RSI from guitar playing / Computer work . My elbow was getting pain and I had noticed there was a swelling that grew . Doing my online research , I narrowed down the symptoms and realized I should try this item . Of course it 's a rubber stick , but the tension and exercise method allows you to stretch your muscles a way that would n't be possible without it . Following instructions and methods on the videos , I used it for a little over two weeks . My Swelling went down ! ! I am happy to say all the pain is gone from the RSI and elbow area . It really works . The exercises are effective . I want to try the other strength versions of it if I get the RSI again . I am a professional musician and I ca n't be out of commission with those that depend on me . This was a life - saver . I recommend it for anyone with the same type of repetitive stress injury and swelling you get from over - exertion .
5 #### Had the smaller rods and brush needed for .17hmr and hornet . Great price and superfast shipping . Was even delivered Sunday by noon . Go USPS .
5 #### This is a great knife . Used it while camping a couple weeks ago and filleted a rainbow trout I caught on the fly and it performed wonderfully ! This is a great deal for a great knife .
4 #### Good quality . Easy to adjust to the right length for small bikes . But very heavy solid steel . OK for children 's bikes .
4 #### I received the mount and I installed it on my grandsons Rossi rifle so we could mount a scope on it . Someone had written they had to grind off part of it to make it fit . It fit without any altering .
5 #### Made a GREAT gift ! The person really loves it and wears it daily ! His old boonie hat bit the dust and I immediately thought to get him another one !
5 #### I bought these coats for my little girls because they wanted a coat just like mine . It was hard finding everywhere else . When I received it I was impressed at the quality and best of all my girls loved their coats .
5 #### Love these ! I have 3 pairs ... they're so comfortable - I 'm on my feet all day & my feet actually do n't hurt at the end of the day when I wear these :) I 've learned to get these 1/2 size smaller .... I'm normally a size 7 and the 6 1/2 fit perfectly
5 #### This fit me perfectly . Stats are helpful . I 'm usually a size 8 in pants , I 'm 5'6 " 145 pounds . My thighs are 20.5 inches .
5 #### We bought these for our trip to Disneyworld . My kids love fireworks but hate the loud booms . We decided to buy these and were thrilled when they arrived and we realized how light and durable they were . We threw them in the bottom of the backpack until it was time for the fireworks , and the kids loved wearing them . They even got some jealous looks from other kids !
3 #### Does n't stretch as much as I would like it to , so it is hard to put on , but keeps ears warm
5 #### I always order a 1/2 size up in workout shoes .
5 #### This is my 3 rd pair from amazon , I could wear these to bed . most comfortably on my feet , I wear them to work and after 12 hours my feet ARE NOT TIRED .
4 #### Size fits my 2 1/2 year old fine but I doubt it would fit a 3 or 4 year old so it works for mine but I would advise against the toddler size one for a 4 year old or large 3 year old . Other than that it is a simple easy to put on costume and the cape detaches so that makes things easy . Overall I am satisfied with this product and at a good price less than I would have spent on same item at the Halloween stores or Target .
4 #### Nice wallet for the price . The credit card holders are definitely a little tight but there are plenty of other sections to put cards that wo n't fit in the slots .
5 #### My son is in college , and he wears these frequently with his cadet uniform when they have more " casual " days with khakis and polo shirts . He goes through a pair of these each semester - yes , he is rough on his shoes . He loves them so much , he wears them even when he is not in his casual uniform . He wo n't wear any other brand , so Sperry has gotten a lot of his and my money over the last 3 years , and is getting more this senior year . I got these for a great price break , and could n't pass that up .
5 #### These have always worked great . They seem to stay " fresh " even season to season , so it 's okay to stock up . People freezing without hand warmers will be jealous and probably become your new best friends if you share . That 's why the case is worth it .
5 #### My son loves this chair as it is sturdy and comfortable . It might not seem that way , but it is . It arrived on time and the packaging was great . Thank you Amazon for selling such wonderful products and making it easy for parents to shop .
5 #### If you have ever had a pair of Chucks you know all about the comfort or non comfort . BUT ! ! EVERYONE has to have at least one pair of Chucks in their closet . Would definatley buy on Amazon again . They ran a size small
5 #### In a nutshell ... I get golfer elbow about 3 times a year from my line of work . ( Not golfing ... I wish ) . I do the recommended exercises for a week and the symptoms are gone . I 've tried all the other items and advice and resting it is not an option . I know it seems weird exercising a sore tendon to fix it ... But it does . Get one and have a go at it . If it does n't cure your problem you 'll have a great sap for personal defence .
3 #### A little disappointed . Not nearly as comfortable as my last pair . My feet hurt after wearing them a couple hours . My last pair I would wear hiking all day . The sole seemed cheaper , like plastic , and more rigid . Nice and breathable though . My last pair was leather instead of nylon and made my feet sweat .
5 #### Another great Case knife ! Have about half a dozen baby butterbean / mini canoes I 've collected over the years , and this lives up to the great Case knife company reputation and tradition .
1 #### Ordered in August , work in a dental office , no abuse to these shoes .
5 #### I love this ring . I had read some reviews noted that it some people were saying it ran a little small in size , so I ordered one size larger . It is beautiful , fits perfect .
5 #### Shoe feels " stiff " but will presumably break in nicely . Hopefully they will wear well over the duration .
5 #### I 'm very pleased . I work driver and for my work this watch is perfect . Very comfortable bracelet , good classic design , easy to read , INDIGLO function is very helpful in the night . Good product does n't need a commercial . I 'm very pleased .
5 #### I purchased these for deer season , when the temperature in the mornings were between 15 to 30 degrees . I placed them over my boots with a hand / body warmer that last 18 hours and you would n't believe how toasty my feet were and how easy it was to sit and wait . if you sit in a blind , put everything in a back pack and enjoy . If you sit on the ground , put everything in a back pack , take a chair and get to your spot before daylight and enjoy ! ! !
3 #### I do n't know why I ca nt get more than 2 months wear from these stockings .... my only issue is that I find they ladder easily ... oother than that I am pleased with the texture and the look , fit .. just ca nt deal with the ladders so quickly ...
2 #### The connecting bracket is sturdy enough and easy to install . The stand itself consists of a flimsy tube with a flimsier , poorly fitting extension secured by only one set screw . Even at full length it does not quite extend far enough for an adult size bike , and bends a little as it takes the weight of the bike . I 'm sure it 's only a matter of time before someone leans on the bike and bends the stand beyond use . I think it would be sufficient for a very small child - size bike which did not require any extension , but this is not for larger or heavier bikes .
5 #### Amazing quality and the small details help make it look just like a real fire fighter suit . My son is a 4 T and we purchased the 4/6 and it fit great with room to grow . The hat is also very good quality and stayed on his head . We received many compliments and people asking where we purchased this .
1 #### Very disappointed With this . Poorly built watch . Crown dropped on ground after few days of use . Now useless .
5 #### great support for running , I have worn this ugly bra for 20 years , it has the best support and comfort .
5 #### Bought this item due to being a fan of this type of cloth . I have purchased over 10 of these clothes for my survival gear through various dealers and have mever been disappointed . The pricing is more than reasonable and the customer service great ! Will use this merchant again .
5 #### I ordered a 1/2 size smaller than my usual size , and they are perfect . These shoes are hard to find . Great customer service as well .
5 #### If you like heavy duty , high quality , well proportioned fit and good value , you ca n't beat this shirt . I have several .
5 #### They fit great , look great , are quite comfortable and are just what I was looking for !
5 #### This is the best pocket knife with tools I use regularly . I get so used to carrying it I keep donating it to TSA and have to repurchase another one .
5 #### I love them ! They fit perfect and are very comfortable ! !
2 #### These things stink up your entire bag / wherever you store them . They also turn the plastic bags I kept them in yellow . They smell like rotting fish . I had them in my emergency backpacking bag and they basically destroyed everything in it . =/
2 #### These are not true control top . And the elastic band is narrow and slips down throughout the day . The knit of the hose is not what I expected . Usually Hanes is a top quality product but this feels like a knock - off .
5 #### Finally , great quality , panties that fit properly and at a great price ! I recommend them with 2 thumbs up and 5 stars ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Carhartt is good stuff ~ he loves the fit and the color
2 #### I ordered a size 4 in kids , and received a size 4 infants . They 're tiny . I guess I needed big kids ?
3 #### These are not as tight as swim caps should be
5 #### Have pretty much worn only this bra for years now . ( Boring , I know , but it fits and supports the girls ) They have all held up for years ! I wash in them in the washing machine , then hang them to dry on a doorknob . It 's got a pretty big strap in the back , but again-- it fits and supports , so beggars ca n't be choosers . I have a really hard time finding bras that hold me up . For some reason , I am a 32 DD in white and yellowish color , but 34 D in the black . ( I read somewhere some of these companies make different colors in different countries so the quality control is poor ? Do n't know if that applies here or not . ) Bottom line is , I 've tried lots of fun bras , but this is the only bra I 'll wear out of the house .
4 #### my son loves this boots a little big but I order like that so he can wear for a little longer , great quality nice color
5 #### Living in California it is not easy for a Patriot Fan , the pin is elegant and definitely conveys that I am a New England Patriot . The pin arrived on time and the images on line and what we received match .
4 #### Nice shoes - but WAY too large . I am a 6.5 women 's and ordered a 6.5 women / 4.5 men . The shoes were at least a full size too large . I am returning them and purchasing a smaller size .
5 #### Loved the watch face but had to replace the band .
5 #### The product holds the cases great . It does what it 's supposed to do . I will stick with RCBS equipment since it just WORKs like it should !
5 #### This sling does the job . It can be attached temporarily and removed while still / stand hunting to prevent it getting caught on something or making noise . Very easy to attach and detach .
5 #### Absolutely Love them . Quick shipment , perfect fit , color and comfort ! Love them . Ca nt say anything negative about them . Hope everyone else enjoys
5 #### I love these . They fit just like the 20 year old red pair that I continue to wear .
4 #### For what it is- a very inexpensive nylon sling- the Allen delivers the goods . I bought two that I 'm using on a pair of inexpensive air rifles . I do n't think I 'd trust my good shotgun to this sling , but for the money , it 's not bad .
5 #### I 've already used for some time and no complaints tengop
5 #### Exactly as advertised . Fits on my shotgun perfectly . I use them for a paracord sling that I made . These shipped fast .
5 #### Very nice looking shoe and very comfortable ! ! You can wear them all day and no problems . I bought them for my daughter and she loves them .
4 #### Good map books . These are great for traveling and trip planning . They show places of interests that you might not know about otherwise . I have these atlases for several different states .
5 #### This is my second time to order , it is strong and somehow flexable , very confortable for big foot ! I expect more life , it is for only 6 month then have to buy another pair Expensive some how , should be . Arround 55 usd
5 #### Great shoes . Fit perfectly . Comfortable right from the start . Light weight and perfect for a 12 hour work shift . Good price also .
5 #### I like the two - sided cloth for polishing my silver flute ... isn't too harsh on the finish of the flute but takes off all the fingerprints and smudges . Makes the flute nice & shiny !
4 #### This goes on easy and has no issues so far . I have been using it for one month without any complications
5 #### I purchased this for my 4 year old 's witch costume . It 's a great height for a child and the straw bristles are great . Yes , they are a tad sparse but this item is under $ 9 so what does everyone expect ? ? ( other bad reviews ) It 's a costume prop . Very much worth the money . I would recommend . I did not have any problems with bristles falling off . They seem sturdy enough for a costume . I 'm happy I took a chance on this because it will make the perfect addition to my daughter 's costume :
3 #### The shirt itself is of excellent quality . The material is fairly thick , and the stitching seems to be quite well put together , and robust . The shirts do run large , and are quite a bit longer than other similar shirts . I am 5'10 " , 180lbs , and feel that I might be better suited with a medium than a large , though I am concerned that the medium may be too small .
4 #### Just like the ones you purchase in a Dept store . I used to purchase med but I purchased small instead and they fit perfectly .
4 #### I really like this mat and probably will not need another for 15 years or so , maybe longer if I keep my toe nails trimmed often . I broke down and bought this one since it is very durable . I wish that it was 4 " longer ( 75 " instead of 71 " ) my old mat was 72 " . Since I am 5'11 " it is right on the edge of being too short , width is ok and comparable . The 85 " version is waay to pricey at $ 130.00 or I would have bought that one . I also wish it was slightly softer but that would sacrifice durability . It is like a conveyor belt material which will take some getting use to . It is very heavy as well so a normal mat strap does n't work that well . You probably should get the matsak or yogarat backpack around the same price . I have heard that the lighter colors need more cleaning but I bought the traditional black pro mat . Overall I am pleased with the mat and will look forward to using it for years to come .
4 #### I got what I paid for . They are not a bad product for the price and they do what I need , so there is no complaints .
5 #### These are a little large , but I know that when I buy Chucks . My son loves them , and the red is bright , and looked great in pictures !
5 #### True to size . Wash and dry in dryer . Does not shrink .
5 #### Color and got was perfect . Delivered next day with Prime
5 #### They said to order a half size down so I did and the fit is good . These shoes do not have arch support . This is what I expected , so I am ok with that .
3 #### I HAVE A LOT OF TOE room ! BUT I Am A CAVALIER GIRL SO IT 'S FINE IF THEY DONT FIT SNUG that way they will not tear as easily , too quickly .
5 #### At first , I was really skeptical because of the price . Similar looking hand grips had reviews that complained of peeling plating on the metal , loose grips , etc . However , price aside , these are head and shoulders above anything else I 've tried . The spring is very sturdy compared with other grippers . The handles are a lightweight aluminum and have a very fine machined grip grid ( like very fine sandpaper that does n't tear up the hands . The handles are attached very strongly to the spring . I can detect no wiggle or give at all . They are also very thoughtfully machined and precision rounded and stamped on the end . I mean , if hand grips can be considered a work of art , then these fit the bill . As stated , these are USA made , which I appreciate . If you 're looking for the best gripper out there , look no further .
4 #### I like this dart board but I am concerned about how long it will last . I will update this when I have more time with it .
2 #### Was very hopeful my children could enjoy this trampoline inside during the hot , hot summer afternoons . Unfortunately the trampoline was very difficult to put together . Several of the legs did not want to attach and it seemed warped from the beginning . After just one week of use one of the legs completely folded and bent in on itself . The entire trampoline was completely unsafe for use . However Amazon was excellent and their return system worked perfectly , very fast and efficient . I would not recommend this item to anyone .
4 #### Great band , just like the one I use at the gym . I did n't realize I could have gotten this a little cheaper at the store . I had been looking for them and did n't see one until after I had purchased online . Saw them at TJMAXX for about $ 7 .
5 #### My 13 year old loves these and I loved the price !
4 #### I bought because it was so well reviewed here and I was not disappointed . It was easy to installing , taking under 5 minutes . It is solid , strong , and does the job . I agree with the other reviewers that it is very still and my kids can not do it unassisted . I saw a review suggesting that a good application of WD-40 will loosen it up , so I will try that . Other than the stiffness , completely satisfied .
5 #### Husband 's fave shoe ever , all the other geeks at his work are envious . I purchase him a couple of pairs each year and he wears them out . The price is by far cheaper than in any store - like 20 bucks . Worth Amazon prime membership just for his shoes !
5 #### Rest assured . This product is a winner . It is beautifully made and functions as it should . I have used it through hard circumstances and it is up to the job .
5 #### I 'm an RN and work nights as a float ( ER , Med / Surg , Rehab ) . I walk a lot during a shift . Have a pair of Merrell sneakers that I 've worn for years and love them . I saw this , liked the fact that they were pull ons and love the camo pattern . These are VERY light and comfortable . Like working in slippers . I 'm actually thinking of getting another pair or two in black and brown to use as casual wear .
5 #### The item fits the description . The quality is excellent , fast delivery . The first time I had bought jeans not further processed in a sewing workshop . Convenient and comfortable . I recommend ! ! !
5 #### I went a half size smaller than I normally buy and they fit perfectly . Nice red color .
1 #### This bra is well made , but that is it . It flattens the breast , doesn't give any shape , make breasts look wide and push it to the arm pits .
1 #### Horrible purchase . Waist fit fine , the rest of the shorts were 10 sizes too big !
5 #### This is a review about the green ones only . For some odd reason on Amazon , different color shoes are often actually different styles entirely . Look at the close - up photos to make sure what kind you are getting . The green ones are made exactly like the regular Jazz Low Pros except they are vegan . I have had a pair for over a year now . They have not worn out yet but I use them for muddy garden work , running the trails , and every day use . So I ordered another pair to keep clean to wear to town . Great shoes , lightweight and very comfortable . Nice round toe box . If you have high arches you will most likely need to buy those inserts with arches to put in the shoes , because the shoe is flat on the bottom . I do n't have high arches so I love these shoes as is .
3 #### These gravity boots would recieve more stars if they had better cushion to support the front / top of the foot , when hanging after a few minutes you really feel the weight of the body painfully pressing on that spot .. Can not get a full stretch because of this ..
5 #### These are by far amazing ! ! I have utilized other bands before but these have redefined the way I feel and look at resistance bands ! The many different variations for added resistance as opposed to having to utilize a certain band is absolutely genius ! The Caribbeaner clip and single pair design is fast and flawlessly designed ! Switch resistance in and out in a flash and you are good to go ! The space saving , weight avoided and durability is PERFECT if you 're looking to get your money 's worth while getting the most out of a home workout ... such as P90X ! ! ! Highly recommended ! :)
5 #### Very comfortable ! I have a brown pair as well . Easy slip on and off . Well worth the price ! They fit perfect too .
5 #### I purchased both the Trumark and Marksman Steel Shot . The Trumark is perfectly round and polished smooth While the Marksman shot had flat spots and an oily residue . The Trumark Shot is worth the extra money . To always have a few steel shot handy , I recommend gluing a small Rare Earth Neodymium magnet to your Slingshot .
4 #### For smaller ( 4 - 7 ) children just gaining interest / ability in sports this is a nice goal . It was easy to assemble with the provided instructions and is sturdy enough for the force exerted on it by small children . It is also light enough to be moved around by a single person with no difficulty . My one concern in purchasing this was that the velcro tabs that hold the net to the frame might fray , but so far they have held up .
3 #### I 'm not a very strong person , but I was able to use all of the bands connected together and did n't feel adequate resistance from the bands . I also noticed the bands are too long for some of the exercises resulting in the need to anchor them on a door or exercise tower / apparatus . The quality seemed acceptable , but the bands left a slick residue on my carpeting just from handling the material . Overall : 3/5 stars , not enough resistance from the bands - these seem like toys compared to the ones found at fitness centers .
5 #### the grip 's fit perfectly , and they make a big differance the way my rockisland compact feels when you hold it .
2 #### This is not what I expected . Very flimsy . Threw them away as they could not be used for effectively holding water .
5 #### These are great quality binoculars , nice clear images for the price .
5 #### Easy to use not a lot of effort . Only took about 5 minutes to get good sounds .
5 #### This is the best mat I have ever found . Support is wonderful & It gets better with use ! I would put this material in my house over carpet because it feels awesome . I am 6 ' 4 " an it works great . A little heavy and slick at first till broke in .
4 #### Carthatt is a staple in my closet . Fabric is great , very comfortable and true to size .
5 #### Got these for my son and he loves them . He had been looking for a pair of sperrys that came up a little higher on his foot and these have the three holes and come up a little higher than his old ones so he realy likes them a lot . He has not worn them a lot but says they feel great on his feet . i m sure they will hold up just as good as his old one have . they are realy nice shoes .
5 #### These DMT stones are great . Have been using these and a couple of the smaller ones for sharpening woodworking tools . Razor edges consistently using sharpening jig
3 #### It 's okay but nothing great . I like my cheap plastic gripped old one .
5 #### This is a quality Boonie hat that I use for going fishing . Good sun protection coverage for head and neck ...
3 #### I do n't like the material , they make me sweat . But they are cute and for great . , I just wish they would breathe a little !
5 #### Love these . Comparable to the rep ran brand that sells these for double
5 #### I got this for my three year old . He is learning knife safety . I should say spoon safety because he prefer a to play with the spoon only :) This is a fun little toy , easy to open and close . It is larger than it appears in the picture but I was expecting that after reading other reviews . Definitely geared more toward younger kids . My six yr old thinks it 's cool too but says it 's " a baby knife " .
5 #### A Classic sneaker that fits well and keeps your feet from slipping on wet surfaces . I really like these sneakers
4 #### It is quite light weight and I do n't feel it at all when it 's on my key chain . Although the little chain that is attached to it breaks easily . Takes me a few strikes to start a fire and I can only do it with a knife or scissor and not anything like a key or piece of metal that is not sharp .
5 #### Comfortable , well fitting helmet accomodates large and XL mens size . Visor really cuts glare for sunrise trips along a north - south path .
5 #### This ball is fine for small children learning the game . Not professional grade , but good enough for the school yard .
3 #### I think you have to be drinking beer when using it to get really excited about it . It is OK , but not anything to write home to mom about .
5 #### Our 6 year old LOVES these shoes ! ! ! He runs , climbs and plays all day at school in them ! Great shoes !
5 #### Love my new Nike 's . It 's been years since I 've been able to wear them ( sizing changed years ago and I just could n't wear them any more ) but now the new styles and sizing are perfect . Lightweight shoe with tons of style . The Fog color is just what I was looking for ... not black and not neon ! I wore them to participate in Relay for Life ( 24 hour walk ) and they held up great !
5 #### Exactly what is what my husband was looking for . He wanted this game for so long . He had been looking for it at the mall . He could n't find it . Finally , the day before his birthday it arrive . Perfect timing .
5 #### Got for my mom she LOVED them the Hanes one she got hung sideways on her and was uncomfortable , but she LOVED these ..
5 #### Like any pair of chuck 's these fit as expected . The black on black looks great . Highly recommend it .
5 #### I have been using a Bosu in my fitness class for a while but due to my work schedule recently I have not been able to attend the classes anymore . I missed my Bosu class so I decided to get one at home . It feels just as the commercial version I use in the class . This is very good to train my balance and core muscles and also kind of fun , too . This one and the Physique 57 are my favorite workout routines now .
5 #### Before using this , my rear - end , and legs fell asleep after 2 - 3 hours of sitting in my kayak . Now , I sit in the same position for hours and my back side no longer becomes fatigued . Thanks for a great product ! Keep up the good work !
5 #### I 've owned many pairs of these . I love them . This was a problem free transaction and the best price I could find .
5 #### I 'm a personal trainer and I use this set to help strengthen clients . It 's a great purchase !
5 #### Need lots of room as this thing flies far ! It gets caught on branches easily because of its shape so avoid trees !
5 #### I do n't wear heels much so this is a welcome companion for me . I like sneakers and this completes my footwear experience even more .
5 #### I have bought a lot of these and used for re sale purposes and they are really cool to use
4 #### I bought the stove this spring and I have used it all summer . I found that it was almost impossible to adjust the valves to get the stove to simmer . Save yourself some frustration and read the SolMan636 review and clean the valves . It is much easier to adjust the flame after I cleaned the valves . I should have cleaned them when I first received the stove .
5 #### I 've worn these jungle mocs for many years and have always been pleased with them . I wear two pair ( one for work outside and one for going to town .
5 #### The 34x36 jeans measure 34 inches at the waist using a tape measure . The wrangler jeans at the superstore say they are 32 waist but actually measure 33 inches . I have worn these jeans and they are roomy in the thigh which helps when you are working , squatting , climbing etc . They seem to be made of a heavier material than the wrangler jeans at the store .
5 #### I also bought a pair of the same size Carhartt jeans on Amazon at around the same time I bought these . They are both nice jeans , but personally for my body the Wranglers seem to fit my form even better . I like both but will probably buy these Wranglers exclusively going forward . The material seems thick enough but not too much as to cause discomfort or scratchiness , and the cut is great for me . I 'm impressed . Just a warning , I just clicked the link to the size and color I bought and within about a week and a half they are offered now by a different seller at almost twice the price I paid . So , if the price seems too high for you , be patient and keep checking your size every few days . I 'd bet the prices vary greatly depending on whether amazon sells them or if they run out of your size and another seller sells them .
3 #### My son has worn Wranglers before . He told me that both pair are an odd fit . Almost like they were irregular .
5 #### I ordered 9.5 size of this but when it arrives i found it too large ! Usually 9.5 fits my feet perfectly . 5 stars is for quality of the shoes after all it is converse but this size issue .... I do n't know !
5 #### CANT BEAT A TIMEX , VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE . IT IS A LITTLE TIGHT ON MY ARM BUT I CARRY IT WITH ME .
4 #### I like them , but they blister my achilles area of my ankle if I walk too far . Good for general use but not hiking .
5 #### these are the best on and off very easy very good looking they do n't rattle compliment my rifles have them on several types of guns and have n't had any problems would buy more when needed come 2 to a pack
5 #### I got the bra not knowing my exact size that I wear(i have been wearing those 1I he bras without the underwire ) I did a quick measurement and went with what i thought was best . I think i should have went with the size up but I 'm still able to wear it . I do like it a lot . I have never had a bra that hid my back rolls like this bra does . It lifts the girls up pretty well too . It does make them look pointy but that 's ok . I would definitely buy again . As I 'm losing weight I will continue to buy the next size down . I 'm happy I ordered it
4 #### The Bosu trainer is a great tool to strengthen legs and improve balance . I have found using the Bosu at work has helped improve my much abused knees . It is also great at improving balance which has helped me in my martial arts .
4 #### These are really just a cool sneaker that is a Nostalgia thing really , They feel like they did in the late 60 's and 70 's ! They look cool and have no support whatsoever ! That 's alright they never did ! If your looking for support and arch protection and comfort than go get some New Balance or Nike sneakers . But These are what they are ! Cool looking blast from the past .
4 #### This dartboard is great for the price . The main problem is the about of bounce outs that happen . Not a bad dartboard , the darts included are totally crap , do buy some of your own darts for this board .
5 #### I love them so much cheaper than buy from the converse website . I love them , super durable . I have wide feet so I figured I should size up but half , bad idea . I am an 11 in women 's but a 9 in men 's , I got a 9 and a half . It is a bit big on my I would but your regular size So comfortable .
5 #### Love these shoes ! So stylish and comfortable . Just got back from a trip to NYC , Black and white Nikes and yoga pants are in high fashion right now !
4 #### Just as described and I love the handles so I can switch or add pounds .
5 #### Easy to put together and use . It is relatively heavy ( because it 's sturdy ) , so it requires an adult ( or a couple kids ) to move it around .
5 #### This product is seemingly well made , and works well for the use it is intended . Nothing fancy , but does n't need to be . Like this company 's LID LIFTER , this item is ALSO made overseas , which is unlike most of the time honored , well made ( In the USA ) products . Wish they could renderer this slight flaw .
4 #### Bought 2 . 1 for a 26 " and 2nd for a 24 " bicycle . A little tricky to set the wiring and get the computer to exact tire size for accuracy but once done it 's done . Display is easy to read . Did a 25 miler and compared units on both sized bikes . The was a slight mileage difference of about 1/2 a mile so I 'll tweak the 24 " size a little more . Over all a good buy !
3 #### Not the rubber mask that was pictured . It 's a newer , more hard plastic . I was looking for the rubber mask , but I will make due .
5 #### Bought these so my husband could slip them on and off when we go skiing . He loves them and says they are very comfortable with great traction . They are good for really cold weather and keep his feet very warm . He now wears them to work when it snows also .
5 #### This thing works as advertised . I can feel it working , and I even made up my own variations . I have had chronic golfer 's elbow ( for a year ) from shoveling a monster snow in Jan. 2016 . It never healed . I lost a lot of capability to lift things without significant pain . I did some research and found some exercises to hopefully cure it . This is a case where pain is required -- to break down the fibrotic scar tissue and replace it with healthy tissue . It 's a 6 - 9 month program , and I 'm a couple months into it . This Flexbar gives me one group of the exercises that I do . And it 's working . Significant improvement . I also use a baseball bat for isometric forearm supination and a barbell for eccentric wrist flexion . I can do all this while watching TV , and that way , I actually do it for a much longer period than I would otherwise . The green works for me . I would n't want it any easier / lighter , and I do n't think more is needed .
5 #### I got this for the range . I shoot at 100 yards and it is perfect for me . I could spend much more but do not feel why I would .
5 #### Work great . Really help me in the morning when i am stretching . Never used one of these before , but i am glad i bought it !
5 #### This bra quickly became my favorite . I wear it practically every day . It 's so comfortable and seamless ! I can wear thin shirts and there are no bra - lines showing . Love it .
5 #### I am normally a Leupold snob for hunting scopes , but I was talked into trying this scope by my brother . I have a Weaver T-36 on one of my target rifles and like it , so I decided to give this scope a try as a general purpose AR optic . Compared to my Leupold with similar specs , I quite literally can not tell any difference between them -- even in low light . The glass is clear and bright all the way to the edges . The reticle is fine in the center for precise shooting and course on the edges for rapid target acquisition . Adjustment clicks are positive enough , and the scope holds zero perfectly . At this level of magnification , there appears to be no reason to spend the money on a Leupold . I like this Weaver scope so much , I ordered another one for my .30 - 30 .
5 #### The fact that they always look pressed and that you can wear a belt makes these my husbands go - to shorts this summer .
5 #### This work exceptionally well . We are really pleased with them .
5 #### nice summer shirt . quick dry and very light to wear . highly recommend
5 #### Fits the Remington 597 perfectly as designed . Has two rail slots at front and rear of mount to aid in proper placement of your rings .
5 #### The shoes came and were perfect . Nothing like a new pair of Chuck Taylor 's ! ! !
5 #### Nephew needed another pair for work and these were like the ones he had for over a year and were worn out !
5 #### The intended recipient loves this . He uses it while fishing and I will now have to buy him one in every color . Thanks a lot .
5 #### Solid and easy to install . Used for replacing hind scooter wheels on our pair of scooters . Both lasted through a year of moderate use .
5 #### I love these sneakers , depending what you wear it makes your outfit pop , I have cats so cleaning cat hair is a breeze , not recommended to wear during rain or snow . Also if your someone that walks alot I recommend some inner soles .
5 #### Sperry Top - Siders are my husband 's favorites - they fit him comfortably - and he often can not find a comfortable shoe - so when I can find his size and the color he is looking for , we buy them . Regularly , in a size 10.5 Wide .
4 #### nice dress shoe and very comfortable for a hard shoe
1 #### I am a plus size and I got 5x because it went with my height and they are still to small . So they are definetly not true plus size stockings
4 #### It looks a bit nicer on the picture . Its very light in such a way that when I held the box I wondered if there was just paper filling inside . They are comfortable for the most . Good looking training shoes overall .
5 #### So comfortable for lounging and working out . Neat also , so I do n't have to worry about appearing sloppy .
5 #### This is a great inexpensive pair of binoculars for watching backyard birds or for taking camping . Quick and easy focus . ! Soft carrying case . Lense cleaning cloth . The lense caps are a bit of a pain since each one goes on individually , but this is minor . I use these binoculars everyday to watch the hummingbirds in my backyard and I am quite pleased with the clarity they provide .
5 #### The best we 've ever bought ! Everything about it is perfect . We will enjoy it for many years to come . Thanks !
5 #### OMG want this five years ago if you have golfers elbow or tennis elbow buy this you wo n't be surprised .
3 #### was alot thinner than what I thought . They are actually see - through . Not what I expected .
4 #### Fits a bit large for my son . Used a sizing chart and the shoe was way bigger . Also there is a sign of thread being exposed after only a few weeks . I am waiting to see how durable it will be .
5 #### Great for keeping the rust , dust and other s * * * off of my guns . Keeps the big dings and scratches out of the wood and metal while trans versing from the woods to the field and back into the safe . I use these for long term storage .
4 #### This costume is gorgeous , well made , fits great , and is adorable . It would have 5 stars if the ears were n't so pathetic . I bought different ears to use with the costume and it was perfect again . Wore it all through disney world and it is still in great shape !
4 #### Awesome . Reminds me of the binder my mom got me for my cards a while back . Nice leather with a soft padding . Only thing missing is pockets on the inside . So one star has to go . But still good
5 #### Great shirt , I have ordered several long and short sleeve . I short , about 5 ' 7 " and the Taiwan made versions fit me better when I let them hang out . The Honduras made are too long and needed 2 " removed from the bottom in order to let them hang out when wearing them .
5 #### Very satisfied with this flex bar . Very practical , useful for exercise and mild strength training for the average user like myself . However , I suspect that the tension will be much too easy for the advanced user .
4 #### I purchased the Bushnell Falcon binoculars because I needed to replace an older pair of Bushnells that sat in the sun too long and you could no longer get the left eye to come into focus . I did n't want to spend a lot of money and I did n't want a big bulky pair either so after doing my research I settled on the Falcon 7x35s . Pros - inexpensive , well made , lightweight , carry case , Bushnell quality , quick focus paddle Cons - kind of big , case is cheap nylon , flimsy strap , lens covers do n't fit well With me I can overlook the cons that I listed because I am more interested in the actual operation of the binoculars . I was very impressed with the field of view and the magnification . For the price I do n't think you can do any better ! They are really lightweight for the size and even if they work for a couple of years they are worth the cost . They came well packed by Bushnell with everything you need right out of the box . I 'm sure you could spend a lot more and get much better quality but I do n't think you will be disappointed with this purchase ! All photos in this review were taken by me . I hope this helps you make an informed purchasing decision . [ ... ] Thanks for reading !
5 #### Of course , I can not know if the filtration is as advertised as I can not test them in a lab . But after a day of spraying , I never smelled any of the chemical come through into the mask . I was surprised as to the fit of the mask . I have a difficult to fit face and facial hair so I did not expect any mask to be a one - size fit 's all . For me , anyway I just had to trim a bit of m hair and snug up the straps to get a good seal . Every respirator has limited air flow making real labor a test of the flow . I was mucking around in 10 foot high cattails and mud , carrying 40 lbs of chemical on my back on a hot day , with protective clothing . It was able to keep up with my heavy breathing better than I thought it would . It is not any more uncomfortable than most respirators , light , and the strapping system is easy and not annoying . For the price , I 'm delighted .
5 #### I thought of buying this for my 10 years boy to use but when I received this item , I changed my mind . It is not a toy in terms of feel . Looks threatening and is powerful . The frame is big probably because it is made in USA meant for American size and the material used are of excellent quality . The fork is one piece thick aluminium or alloy like and is so strong it does not bend under pressure .. I only used soya beans to kill crows from a distance of 10 m. The sting is good enough to sent wild dogs fleeing the opposite direction . A really good product with a good price . Strong and simple to use .
2 #### A little disappointed in how long they lasted . Tread is mostly worn down flat , inside material has also worn down to the plastic in more than one area . I 've had these for a little over a year and worn them daily . I 'm a pretty average 200 lbs semi - active guy .
5 #### Simple and well made . Keeps the lid off the dirt .
3 #### decent scope , but for the price the scope should have covers , at least cheap ones .
3 #### The slots are not quite big enough for credit cards .
5 #### We have bought Carhartt for almost as long as I can remember ..... well , not quite that long , but it is an excellent product and sometimes we have a problem finding them locally , especially in the " off season " and when you do find them they can be a little pricey . Decided to try Amazon and was pleasantly surprised to find they were on sale ( ACTUALLY on sale -- a store here says they are on sale , but they jack the price , then lower it by $ 5.00 ) . Stocked up with a multiple purchase !
5 #### Holds lots of ice , pop , lunch meat etc . husband a regional truck driver so just the perfect size for his 2 days of road time each trip . He took the top little door piece off so he has a place to set his steel coffee mug which does not fit in a cup holder . These last a few years before the handles pop off and we feel that we more than get our money 's worth from each cooler !
4 #### Freakin sweet I love this dart board it adds a nice touch to my apartment .. however the cork seems to leave big holes after throwing a couple of darts suggesting that it will wear out soon and the darts will no longer stick but I have n't encountered that problem yet so we 'll have to see also its kinda heavy but I think they 're supposed to be a decent amount of weight .. great buy though for quality .
4 #### seemed like a reasonable deal for a bag of balls .
4 #### i bought the product to protect my carpet floors from getting really worn out when i work out at home . this exercise mat does the trick ... glad i bought it .
4 #### I love Keens . This style of sandal is great looking and super comfortable . The only problem I have with these shoes is that they make my feet smell . No other shoes that I wear make my feet smell , but then again I wear them all day every day all summer long . I do n't even care that my feet smell when I take them off . They are just the slightest bit narrow on my foot , but it does n't affect the comfort of the shoe .
5 #### I have had Keens before and I love the comfort and your price was absolutely great ! I Would buy them again
5 #### Very nice shoe for my 13yr old - but is a little bigger than his sneaker of the same size 9 1/2 but he loves them otherwise
5 #### I got these for my brother for Christmas , and he loved them . What more can i say ? Converses are awesome for anybody !
5 #### Do n't know what 2 say about a water bottle . It holds water , does n't leak & my 9 year old thinks its cool . What else do U need to know .
1 #### Bought some brush tees a few years ago and they lasted for multiple seasons . These new ones have the bristles falling out after only a couple rounds of golf . Not sure if they cheapened their product or got a bad batch , but I 'd save your money and look elsewhere .
5 #### They are awesome . Cute and my daughter loved it for my grandson
4 #### I 'm not a pro at binoculars and do not need any heavy duty , super long range , black ops sort of thing , so these fit the bill nicely to go into my BOB . Recommended ? For the price , sure .
5 #### I use this for my PCP Air Rifle . What can I say ......... it 's silicone grease . It works . This can should last me the rest of my life .
5 #### We got these for my niece 's wedding and while I got the same size as I did from a local retailer these were noticeably larger . The kids do fine walking in them ( which was all that was required for the wedding ) but wearing them to play in causes them to trip as the shoes are a bit too long .
5 #### well made and finishing , high quality materials , easy to connect to the lure , robust and last long enough to take on to any fishing trip !
2 #### What can I say beyond , I do n't like this sling and I would n't recommend that anyone purchase it . The sling appears to be well made and it 's not reflective of Allen Company 's other products . The main issue is that the pad is located in the wrong place . It does n't matter how big or small you are , it just does n't sit in the right place .
4 #### Good basic swivels at a good price . They work fine .
4 #### This is a plastic saints sign that is about 12 inches by 12 inches so pretty small but looks nice in a small bedroom . It feels somewhat cheap but that s ok as it will be haning on a wall . Paint does not easily flake off . All in all a good purchase for my nephews bedroom wall .
4 #### My son was ecstatic to get this magic hat . He had recently been to a birthday party where they had a magician and he ran around with his plastic top hat for days . When that got crushed we decided to get him this hat for his birthday . He loves it and may just become a magician !
5 #### I love the Carhaart tee shirt 's heavyweight cotton material . These shirts might cost a little more than other brands , but you can expect to wear your Carhaart shirts for at least ten years !
5 #### I have had this for quite a while and it is working like a champ . I got water inside and the indiglo got dim . I took the back off and set it on top of my 70 pint dehumidifier for a few hours and that got riid of the humidity and the indiglo is working fine again . I really like this watch . I 've had other many other Timex over the years , but this one is my favorite and I really like the mother of pearl face .
5 #### I bought this for my three year old daughter . She LOVES it . It fits on her little toddler wrist perfectly , and is easily adjustable . It 's super comfortable for her if you get the tension right . She 'll wear it for hours , checking the time every few minutes . It 's a great way to teach her to read the time . So far she can read the little hour hand fairly accurately , and we 're working on the big hand . It 's fairly durable , although I do n't expect anything I give her to survive indefinitely , toddlers are tiny balls of destruction . It 's easy to adjust and change the time , just like any analogue watch , using the side dial . I have n't taken it in to water , but I imagine it can be splashed a little . We have her take it off before bath - time or going in a pool , just in case . The best part about her having this watch is that now she does n't ask to wear my $ 300 Garmin GPS watch .... so that 's nice . Here kid , break this one ...
5 #### Big Timex fan . Pleased to find this at a lower price than regular retail .
4 #### Made well with good " bungee " elastic . Workes well for docking my pontoon at both ends without keeping it rigid against the dock . the end loops can be adjusted to keep it maintained tight to boat cleats . Seems to be made weel enough to actually last more than 5 minutes like a lot of the junk out there . Worth the cost .
5 #### I am very happy with this purchase . The knife is exactly as described . Nice workmanship and very sharp . The solid nylon sheath fits a bit tightly , but it is still very nice . A very , very nice boot knife . Highly recommended . The knife arrived in great shape and lightening fast .
3 #### I am not sure if I like this whistle with or without a ball inside ! You have to blow hard and it is fairly loud ! I have not seen or used a whistle in a long time . They used to be strong looking and made of metal . This plastic whistle looks kind of cheap , but I think it will last . On the back inside , it says made in Canada . I am not sure what I will use it for yet , but I saw the maker on TV and I just wanted to get one . I think someone said the more expensive one was too loud !
4 #### Nikes usually run small and I 'm a 7.5 , so I ordered these in an 8 and they were actually very roomy . I love them but they are definitely bright orange / coral and not bright crimson like the description said . I thought they 'd be more red in hue to wear with my Ohio State clothes , but instead I use them for running .
5 #### Another great Merrell product added to my collection , easy to slip on and comfortable for all day usage , will add another to my collection
5 #### Keep these in my edc kit . Small and light so they do n't take up any space and work great to get a fire started
5 #### Ok you put the spray on , and as soon as you get in the water your mask fogs up anyway . This just wipes it away . This is such a great product .
2 #### I picked mid size , its way 2 big for me ! ! ! Normally I buy shirts for mid size they will fit nice to me . but this one I picked mid size , its way 2 big for me ! ! ! I MEAN WAY TOO BIG . I gave it to my friend cuz he s a pretty big / tall guy . He told me he pretty sure this is n't mid size . Its kind like a L or XL to him . Giving 2 stars cuz it the shirt feels nice .
5 #### I bought this for my granddaughter and she loves it .
5 #### First of all , I have a big head . If I were to wear a fitted baseball hat I need size 7 7/8 or an 8 . Impossible to find those sizes now . Anyway this helmet not only fits my head because it is adjustable but it is the most comfortable helmet I 've worn . I have tried on other helmets in the $ 50 dollar range that are n't nearly as comfortable . Some of the other reviews said some of the pieces fall off . I have not had this problem but even if I did the pieces they are referring to are only cosmetic . Heck , I would almost like them to fall off mine so I look tough . I liked it enough I just bought one for my wife too . Her head is much smaller but since it is adjustable it fits fine on her too . For the price you ca n't beat it .
5 #### I love the white version of Converse . The shoes look great , the white is immaculate , and I find them as a version between ' wearing with jeans ' ( casual ) and ' wearing with a dress ' ( sort of elegant ) . I ca n't wait to combine them with all types of cloth styles .
5 #### I 've tried other seat lids but none of them fit properly , this one does . As another reviewer reported , it takes a lot of effort to remove it from the bucket once you get it on , way too much in my opinion , so I trimmed down the outside tabs on the seat that hook over the outside diameter of the bucket and now it works perfectly . It stays put and pops off with just the right amount of effort . If I ever need another , this is the one I 'll be getting .
5 #### Fantastic fit ! And the price is great ! I have been wearing this style for about 3 years and have spent $ 50.00 online price was $ 35.00 . I highly recommend it . Shoulder straps could be wider they tend to cut into my shouldershowever I change the straps which is worth it for me because the fit is wonderful .
3 #### I like the fit of this brand , but the color " Barely There " is too tan for me . The color is much better suited for light tan skin color . Because I like the fit and feel , I 'm going to try my luck with " Nude " .
5 #### this wallet is absolutely perfect ! it holds everything I need , and keeps it all organized . As for size , I would call it a medium sized wallet , it would n't be good for a small purse .
5 #### Great price for a piece of rehab equipment that my wife uses for her Physical Therapy patients . She is very satisfied .
5 #### Exactly what I was looking for . I bought these for a wedding I am in and this was one of the last places to have this color being the hat it was discontinued at the Converse store . Shipping was timely and product is exactly how it should be .
5 #### bought this for a chrismtas charity- the girl specifically asked for a pink razr scooter . under $ 40 and prime ! amazing ! Saw this at Target for $ 70 . had i not have bought it on amazon i would nt have been able to get this for her due to the gift cap ! ca n't comment on its function bc i did not actually test it out .
5 #### Favorite Nikes ever . I already owned this style and was ready for a new pair so I went with these . Love the color and they fit great .
5 #### Great for use in the cold weather when skiing and shoveling snow
5 #### I was relieved to find that Amazon offered these jockey briefs . This was the first time I had to buy them online . For me it is easier to shop online , but I tried the local stores and they no longer stock this size . I will have to start my shopping with Amazon in the future .
5 #### Wranglers fit me well , and these were no exception . If you can wear wranglers , these are great .
5 #### Fits good easy to blow up looks great with the costume .
3 #### These are okay , but there are better options . I purchased Cabelas branded gun socks in 2009 that were better than the Allen gun socks in 2017 , and the quality is not as good . Allen is still good , and the price per sock in the 6 - pack is hard to beat . I also purchased Arcturus 47 " Gun Sock for Tactical Rifles , and those are huge , very easy to get scoped rifles ( traditional or AR / AK style ) in and out of .
5 #### I love this watch ! This is my second one . It has a expensive looks , and love the indigo . Comes in handy in a dark room . I 've checked around and this is a great price . I highly recommend this watch .
5 #### This was a replacement pair for a pair that I first purchase from an expensive show shoe store over two years ago . I finally wore the first pair out ( no shoe lasts forever ) and simply replaced them . They are comfortable and give very good support .
1 #### I bought these as starter birdwatching binoculars for my son who recently got into the hobby . I got these primarily for the price and the decent reviews , hoping that Bushnell had improved their quality over the last 20 years ... but , I was n't surprised when my son said that the focusing mechanism broke within 2 months of his receiving them and it was n't due to misuse or dropping them : the plastic housing for the set - screw cracked , which no longer allowed proper focusing ( and I could n't repair it ) . Actually , I should 've known this would happen with Bushnell because my initial birdwatching binoculars were Bushnell and I remember them becoming fairly useless soon after I started using them on a regular basis . It 's been Nikon or Minolta for me ever since ... I guess I should 've started my son on one of those as well . So , on to the " store " for something better for the new birder .
5 #### I bought a whole bunch of Nalgene HDPE bottles , in different sizes , mainly for camping and hiking : 30ml ( 1 oz ) and 60ml ( 2 oz ) for spices and dried herbs ; 125ml ( 4 oz ) and 250ml ( 8 oz ) for ground coffee / dried onions / nuts , almonds and dates / cooking oil ; and 500ml ( 16 oz ) and 1litre ( 32 oz ) for rice , lentils , pasta and other dry foods . So far I 'm really pleased , the sizes are perfect and they seem high quality . My new camping spice kit is perfect ! I 'm attaching photos of all the bottles so you can get a sense of the different sizes ( in the photos - the 30ml one is filled with ground ginger , and the 60ml one in filled with ground black pepper . that 's why they seem " dirty " ) . ( I 'm attaching 10 photos , hope all of them will be attached to this comment )
5 #### Sooooo much better on my knees and elbows . This mat is worth the money . A friend has owned one for fourteen years and it is still in like - new condition .... wish I would have spent the money up front instead of buying those cheap dime store types .
5 #### These great for leg training sessions . You can be one of those dbags and not tie the laces or you can loosely tie them to avoid tripping AND still look cool . But I did n't get them to look cool ( even though they do that job very well ) , I got them to stand evenly on the floor while squatting or deadlifting . They can be a bit awkward for standing calf raises , but I am being picky here . Overall , great training and everyday shoes .
5 #### This Timex Expedition Metal Field Brown T44921 is a great looking watch . Although I do n't understand how the unique face is n't classified under Timex 's " Easy Reader " collection , everything about this watch looks and feels much nicer than a $ 30 timepiece . The large numbers and hands glow - in - the - dark and the Indiglo is very bright- brighter and easier to read than you would expect from such a dark face . My only gripe is that the crown is larger than it really needs to be and sticks out past the crown guard a bit .
5 #### This is a sturdy case inside and out . The foam inside is easy to remove , which allows you to customize the interior to securely fit whatever you wish to store . I bought two of these and they stack nicely in the closet . Great product and worth every penny !
5 #### Buy these shoes for my wife . They are the first sandals keen and she is very happy with them . In summer , use all the time .
3 #### Just the way it is , when buying offline . Not sure if you have it right , fit but just a little baggy
3 #### Does not have fabric lining ! It 's just ok . May return , have n't decided yet
5 #### I bought these shorts primarily for playing soccer . They have been perfect ; right size , quality , and keep you comfortable . I would definitely recommend it to others .
5 #### I used a Devils Horse for many years to entire spring large mouths . This and the perch color are my two favorite colors and they do catch fish .
5 #### Love my Super Birki clogs ! This is my second pair and I expected them to be stiff and a bit uncomfortable at first but they were not . They actually feel better than the 3 year old pair that I wear every day because the new insoles are giving me more support . Family members think I am nuts for spending 90 bucks on a pair of plastic clogs , but they do n't know what they are missing out on !
5 #### I 'm very color obsessed , and the henna is a great color . It 's a warm terra - cotta , a little richer and more orangey than you see in the picture . Love it !
4 #### Who does n't love a razor ? So happy to have this to give as Christmas gift
4 #### ran a little big , wish I would have went a 10.5 instead of the 11 . I wear a 11 in 95 % of my shoes
5 #### I have purchased these socks for years . I thought the price was high but the reduced fatigue and durability of these makes them VERY economical . Great product . It was shipped on time and packed well .
5 #### Purchase these for my son . Excellent fit and excellent jeans he really likes them .
5 #### Just make sure to go up in size or however it says it in the description . I got these for my girlfriend and she loved them and said they fit perfect .
5 #### I 'm a football official and have tried four different brands of whistles . This one is by far the best . Requires little effort to get a loud clear sound that can be heard across the field . I ordered five more to have as spares .
5 #### My dad loved this sign , it hangs in his Steelers garage , and looks great !
5 #### I bought these boots for my son for his birthday . I was very pleasantly surprised when I received them , they are very nice looking . They are really exactly what I was hoping for .
5 #### These are a great fit for my 4 year old who has very long skinny feet . He can wear them all day at school with no problem !
4 #### Great shoes . They fit larger than expected though . I suggest going down a half size .
3 #### I like my shirts a little large on me . I generally go XL to provide more room , but this one is REALLY big . I would have gone a L instead . If you get a L and should have an XL let me know . I 'll trade you for this one ! Only been worn once .
5 #### For the price they are a nice pair of binoculars
1 #### I purchased this model new in the box factory sealed . It looked fine except the front sight was not straight up and down . Upon firing the accuracy was very poor . No amount of sight adjustment would correct the problem . I sent it to the mfr . who replaced it with another gun . This one 's finish was a mess , serial no . illegible and the front sight ... also bent ! Someone at the factory had tried to bend it straight but ended up making it into the shape of an " S " . The rear sight was bent way off to one side as well . Perhaps an attempt to sight it in . Totally unacceptable . I am hoping that the mfr . will correct this for me . I have been a loyal customer of Crosman for years but they are apparently really going downhill . Sad , another USA company going down the tubes for such a simple thing ... poor quality control . No good reason for it . This pistol is not worth one - fourth the price it lists for . Will update if I get relief . Until then , BEWARE . Also , I made the mistake of not getting this via Amazon , who would have easily saw to the replacement or refund . UPDATE Dec. 2008 : Mfr . very cavalier concerning the matter . At this point it will cost more in time / postage for me to return it again , possibly to only get a worse sample the third time around . I 'm done with Crosman .
5 #### My son has not worn the boots yet , but they fit well and the wide are actually wide . They are attractive .
5 #### I have about 5 pairs of Chuck Taylor 's and as always these are great . They arrived on time and there were no issues with the order . They are true to size , but make sure you have tried on a pair in an actual store so you know what your actual size is .
4 #### it gives a sharp annoying sound to the people around me but i love the color . if you want a simple whistle that wo n't give up on you . here you go
2 #### Does not fit my rifle as ordered . I have other Limbsavers that I am happy with so suspect it was supplier rather than product .
3 #### I Wanted something that 'd WARM UP as , , , , LOL so this is strange , , , for my CAT ! ! She loves sitting on my heating pad which of course is not to leave on if I am not in the same room . LOL Are you done laughing ? I ca n't say my family / friends are ! I 'll hear about it for QUITE some time , , , , , , perhaps FOREVER ! ! It is though very comfy to sit on , , , so instead of a 1 , I 'm changing my stars to a 3 based only on how comfy it is . I 'll use it when I have to sit on a bleachers etc at an event . As said it 's very comfy , however it did NOT warm up though I had sat on it for an hr .
5 #### These shoes are perfect . Honestly , if you 've ever worn Chucks before , than you know what to expect . The trickiest part can be figuring out your size , but the size chart makes that easy to do . I already knew what to order , so I 'm very happy that they arrived quickly and exactly how I expected . Would definitely buy again , this time in another color .
5 #### Holds the lid for my Dutch oven off surfaces nicely and folds up too . It do n't get no better .
2 #### I bought this shoe as a longtime ( since the 70 's ) Topsider customer . The finish was good the stitching was no problem but the shoes did not fit . I do n't know if it is the style or the manufacture but having worn a medium width shoe forever and the last pair of the Mako style was purchased 6 months ago and the fit was fine how can a medium become a narrow ? I 've always told my wife buy shoes in person , I should have listened to my own advice .
5 #### Love these shoes . My feet feel so much better . Lots of padding and light enough to run in .
4 #### Hightops are always good , plus the all black color palette that sort of looks unusual compared to a regular white/|insert other color| color combination . Got here quick . Fitted as expected . Good one .
4 #### I have n't worn these on a hike yet . But they fit perfectly & are very comfortable . I always buy keens for my hiking sandals & boots . They last long & take very little time to break in .
4 #### I walk around six miles over concrete and asphalt five days a week for work and these shoes have held up very well . I am not bothered by the rather flat insole but those who need more arch support may want to look into inserts .
3 #### My true shoe size is probably a 12 1/2 E but the 13 Wide with a shoe insert ( Dr. Scholl 's ) fits perfectly . The shoe is very comfortable and arrived in a timely fashion . I am very pleased with the whole process .
5 #### I like this solid metal design much better than the cast aluminum , because the cast aluminum broke almost right away . This one lasts for ever .
4 #### I have been using the Thera - band for seven weeks . I forget to use it twice per day and so I am giving myself more time to completely reduce the pain in my golf elbow that I did n't get playing golf . I turned several screws years ago with my left hand . After several cortisone shots I decided to try the Thera - band and I have n't given up .
5 #### This little scooter is solid and runs well . My grandson is enjoying his sidewalk runs .
5 #### After trying a different brand at first , I quickly discovered how well made Uncle Mike 's sling swivels are . I really do n't even consider buying any other kind now , because I 'm confident in what I 'm going to get . They go on easy , lock securely and are easy to remove . I like the way the silver ones look better , but these were going on a solid black stock so I went with blued . They 're fine too . A quality product that will most certainly do exactly what it is supposed to do .
5 #### I am wearing the watch now . I like it . It feels and looks good .
5 #### This was a gift for a friend out of state . It arrived on time and in perfect condition . Everything I was hoping for . It was a great gift .
5 #### I just put a new battery in my old beat - up East Reader Indiglo . Came here to see if it 's still made , because someday this almost perfect watch will have to die ... maybe . I guess when you make the perfect watch , no need to change it . Thanks Timex !
5 #### I was looking for a suitable wallet for months and this one was exactly what I wanted , very pleased with it .
4 #### I liked the color when I put them on . However , Got a run in them when I put them on . The run did n't show and still looked good with my dress .
5 #### So far so good , it holds the boat and has always come back from the bottom !
1 #### I wish i would have read the reviews . the photo on the entry looked like the real thing , it is about as flimsy as a cheap paper plate . not sure i will even use it for our oz production .
4 #### Really like the look of these classic shoes . The color is great ! BUT I usually wear an 8.5 ( and knowing this brand tends to run big ) I ordered an 8 AND they 're still too big :-(
1 #### This product did not come as shown in the picture . Even with a second one , it is definitely not like the one I bought in the store . Very disappointed .
5 #### Good clear face , dark numerals and hands , very easy read . Has an expiation band . Very good watch .
5 #### Great blow up mattress . As others have said it does take a while to blow up by mouth but that does nt bother me at all . Some other reviews made it seem as though you have to have an iron lung to blow it up . I filled the mattress with air in 5 - 7 minutes and took about just as long to deflate . Deflates completely to a very compact size . I even was able to fit it in the bag with my tent which is awesome ! very comfortable .
4 #### Nicely done ! Costume was a BIG hit . The only downfall / shortcoming is that depending on your setting , party , Trick or Treating , family gathering , etc . The wings bump into everything as they do not retract .
5 #### Arch is higher than a prior shoe I had . I had wart hogs . Has had 3 - 4 pair and they last me 2 years and I work in them : from my husband
5 #### Very durable . Heavy weight cotton , holds up to washing and wear .
5 #### great control fit especially if you have wide hips and thick thighs
4 #### It a nice warm thing . It is not made for anyone with a long neck I guess .
5 #### What more can I say ? Well , I guess I have to say more . It 's white , and it 's powdery , and the bag was not ripped .
5 #### My husband LOVES these for work ! All he wears . Excellent quality , last forever
4 #### So far bag as been awesome . It is very responsive . I really have n't found any fault in it . The only fault , I have is I emailed the company and never heard back .
1 #### Sleeves a fraction too narrow so these were rendered useless . Glare is irritating and sleeves are thin . Gets 1 star for fast shipping . Greatly dissatisfied .
5 #### The extra small AmeriBag is the perfect size for me . The first bag I ordered was in medium in the taupe color and was too large for my needs . As an everyday bag I do n't want something that can fit everything . The smaller bag is just right and holds everything I need to carry with very convenient pockets .
5 #### I never go fishing withoug have one rod and reel on a dropshot setup with this finesse worm . My absolute go to tackle when the fish are snobbish .
5 #### This item is good and it works well . I would advise others to purchase this item as well . It is a fine item .
5 #### Fits perfectly and tells the time accurately . Nothing else needs to be said !
5 #### Great costume , but the head piece it came with was floppy . I purchased a head piece from another seller
5 #### perfect fit , love carhartt clothing , wears well , better than most .. thanks
4 #### The shoe reviews said the shoe fits big but I ordered my normal size . I had to size up in order to have my toes fit comfortably . The toe guard is great but it curls back and rubbed on my toe . The shoe overall is great and I plan to order a size up .
5 #### Works really well to clean water deposits on a boat and gives a great shine . Works great on light scratches too . I use this on a boat to clean and polish it after taking the it out of the water . Easy to use and easy to wipe off . I 've tried other similar products but this works the best .
5 #### I am a proud marine sister and I love this shirt ! it fits great !
5 #### Awesome product ... works as advertised . I 'd recommend this to a friend .
2 #### I had this coat for about a year and a half ( like other reviewers ) and then discovered the waterproofness fades after a year and a half . I did bring it everywhere , but it does seems to be that it SHOULD have lasted longer . Otherwise , it is a nice , light , nice fitting jacket .
4 #### Hard to open . Grip slot is slick . Good price though . Next time , I will buy a cooler that I can open with 1 hand . You will definitely need 2 hands to open this cooler .
5 #### Loved this product . It is curved down which I did n't expect . Yet it is very sharp and its design is useful .
5 #### For some reason I 've had problems w the sizes w Merrell . With these , they got it right ! Great color n comfortable
5 #### I played soccer for the better part of my youth . I coached youth soccer and played some college . I was hesitant about buying this ball because of its low price . When i received it , i immediately deflated it and re inflated it . Then did my spin test . This is simply just tossing the ball into the air just over your head and spinning it . If the ball wobbles as it spins , it is not a good ball and will result baf bounces and poor flight . This ball spun without wobbles . Itbia an amazing ball for this price .
5 #### I am delighted with this shoe . It is comfortable and I know it will wear well . Merrell is my go - to company for great fitting shoes . I wish they made dress shoes .
1 #### I 've not even had them a month and the bottom is coming off . I 'm not happy !
5 #### Perfect slip for the GUY who likes the soft and silky . Straps stay in place , stays soft and silky after many washings , would recommend to both --- men and women . THE BEST SLIP EVER !
3 #### No doubt a good quality t - shirt , but it is super heavyweight . I was shocked . It 's really much thicker and heavier than most other t - shirts . It would not be good for layering under other clothes unless you were looking for a lot of extra warmth and the other shirt was oversized .
4 #### Shoes are fantastic but I feel like the toes are quite narrow , and I have narrow feet to begin with .
5 #### I received this order quickly and could n't be happier . This is one good case for your favorite weapon or expensive camera . I have two of these boxes for these purposes . This is the best storage container on the market today , all others are inferior . Hands down if you want the best ... here it is .
5 #### cool shirt for someone who ids 5'7 " . I washed it to shrink it and now it is a cool un - tucked shirt
5 #### Terrific disc for informal tossing or ultimate . The blue LED effect is gorgeous -- looks like a flying jellyfish or UFO . Recommend .
5 #### Love these shoes , I normally wear a size 11 in womens but in these I wear a 10 .
5 #### I purchase these for my partner ; he is on his feet all day at work . Initially , before buying these , his feet hurt and he would complain a lot at the end of the day . After his first pair of these , he was hooked ! He has been wearing the same brand daily for the past 5 years . He has tried other brands , but always asks me to reorder this one .
5 #### This watch is nice and sturdy . It 's attractive and keeps great time . The indiglo feature is fantastic . I really appreciated that they pulled the " winder " out to protect the battery .
5 #### Ordered half a size larger than my usual shoe size and fits perfectly .
5 #### I love wearing my new Lions pin on my shirt !
5 #### Perfect for my red neck camping kitchen . I hang it on a tree over the rinse pan . ;)
5 #### great little dagger no problems with seller i would highly rec .
5 #### Favorite Nike shoe ever ! The flex sole is excellent for someone like me who loves the free feeling of sandals or being barefoot . These move effortlessly with the bend of my foot . I 've worn these for multiple activities and I 've had no foot or ankle pain . The white / green / dark grey color goes with so many outfits and the mesh breathes perfectly on hot summer days . Highly recommend !
5 #### these shoes are very cute and comfortable realmentes find them at a very affordable price more to give away this Christmas will be the perfect gift for my brother .
4 #### I use this to secure my PWC to the dock . The bungee is really nice , it definitely reduces stress on the hull when you have large waves . It will hold up to about 2 years in the sun which is pretty good so I 'm happy with it .
5 #### The only thing that would make this better is if it were real leather . I love the color .
5 #### I love the product . the only thing is I wish they made the material slightly more durable I am a big big gal and after a day of performing the tights have runs where the knit or whatever unravels .
3 #### Had to send back because they were too big . Great quality tho
5 #### I purchased Carhartt t - shirts from Amazon because they are made in the United States by union workers . The shirts arrived and like other reviewers mentioned , they are a little on the large size from what size is ordered . These t - shirts are made of a heavy weight cotton cloth so I 'm expecting many years of wear out of them . Thanks !
3 #### Okay for Halloween costume . Udder was a weird grey color not pink . We had to paint over it .
5 #### I have purchased these for many years and they are wonderful ! ! The price is high , I think , but worth it ! ! !
4 #### I really like this knife . With the MOLLE compatible sheathe it really is an excellent addition to a chest rig or leg drop platform . The pouch on the sheath can hold a number of small and useful items . Sharpener , flashlight , small multitool , whatever gets you hard / wet . Its a really good tactical fixed blade .
5 #### I have bought several pairs of chuck Taylors for my daughter from amazon and they are always on time fit perfect and brand new .
3 #### I 'm glad I ordered a size up than my actual waist size . I have it on the very last notches , and it 's still pretty tight . I use a nylon BDU belt as a supporter . If I used a thicker Velcro or leather one , I would 've had to return it .
3 #### Had to go half size up from normal shoe size .
4 #### I have always had good luck with Merrell shoes . Good quality ..
5 #### I purchased a pair of navy blue high top Chuck Taylor 's . I remember wearing Converse when I was growing up . At that time I ( my parents ) paid $ 6.50 a pair . Anyway , they are a bit more in price , but they still feel the same , look the same , and I found out if you get some gel insoles , they feel great . Will I get another pair , YES ! !
4 #### Good product , but a bit flimsier than expected . Can only really be used for small balls . Was hoping could use for other backstop .
5 #### Nice product . Probably cost a little more than its worth but hey , it keeps your neck cozy on cold days . Only negative that I did n't anticipate ; if you order the cream color , it ends up looking like one of those neck braces people wear after getting rear ended . Just a heads up to pick a different color !
5 #### fuel tabs that work why write a review on them , do n't realey know why the do the job they were made for
5 #### love this ball . The quality is superb even after daily use and abuse . Do n't let " reviews " make the decision for you , for under $ 20 just buy it and try it out . Worst case scenario is you donate a practice ball to your local park district or school . Best for pick up games , or as a practice ball .
2 #### I 'm accustomed to Dansko , Sanita , and Allegria shoes , which are all very comfortable , but require a break in period . I 'm ok with that . But these never seemed to get broken in . Maybe my feet are just used to soles on my regular brands . I 'm on my feet 9 hours a day , on concrete , walking around and up and down stairs , for several miles a day , sometimes with long periods standing ( I 'm an adult - education instructor ) . I have heard so many great things about chucks and really wanted a different shoe I could wear from time to time , and was hoping these would be it . I wear a 10 ( 40 ) in women 's and the 8.5 chucks fit my foot well ( thankful I read the other reviews and knew what size to order ) but they just are n't the shoe for me .
5 #### I love these shoes . I am rather basic when it comes to Nikes , I do n't need all the cool colors , so these look amazing and feel amazing , like they were made for my feet . I definitely suggest purchasing them .
5 #### This is my EDC knife and easily my favorite knife I own . I love the axis lock system and the feel of the handle . You ca n't beat it for the price .
5 #### Unlike the reviews I read , these belts are perfect for kids . If you do n't want them to shrink , do n't wash them ! Oh wait as a martial artist , you are n't supposed to wash your belt . If you buying it for a costume item , it is traditionally wrapped around the waist 2 times , hence being too long .
4 #### They look like decent pants for the price although the size medium was definitely too wide for my slim 11 year old ( 4'10 " & 75 lbs ) . There are Velcro strips to adjust the waist , but he would still need a belt .
5 #### I like using this stuff . It has a viscosity similar to Vaseline . I 've been using it for a number of applications when I want to seal something . Its good at helping rubber seals snug together by reducing friction during the tightening . I use it on the O - rings on my acetylene welding torch tips ; plumbing washers and gaskets ; etc .
5 #### These are huge ! They were much bigger than I thought so I was pleasantly surprised . This is n't the small tiny version - this is a normal size . Easy to use and understand directions .
5 #### Honest I want to wear some of my other shoes but , these are always staring out of the closet saying " I 'm comfortable " . They have become my go to shoes and I did n't plan it that way . I do n't want to get married , but we are happily living together .
4 #### Solid shirt . Thicker than normal material , good seams . Some of these other t - shirts feel like thin girly shirts compared to this . It does fit a size larger , I bought a 2xL and it sits on me like a 3xL like a football jersey - buy a size smaller when ordering . Color has faded where the sun hits it , on myshoulders and back mostly but the shirt itself has n't torn or come undone . One weak spot I noticed on all my t - shirts is the pocket . I wish they had double stitched the pocket because the stitching comes loose and holes develope . Other than that its a sturdy comfortable shirt .
5 #### the chain its a little too thin . I will be buying a new one for it but the diamond is beautiful
5 #### I ordered this costume for Halloween . It fit nicely , but I am a woman 5'7 " 134lbs . I 'm not sure how this would fit a man !
5 #### I use it as my hiking and camping hat . Its holding up great . Only thing I do n't like about it would be the adjustable strap piece is flimsy but overall great hat .
5 #### I love this frisbee . The edge makes it easier for my dog to pick up regardless of which side it lands on .
5 #### Perfect hat for summer . I work outside opening and closing tank pads . That 's concrete and steel in 100 + degrees . This hat stays on my head .
2 #### I was so excited after reading all these reviews . A $ 22 great board . Well , the good thing about the board is just that , the board . It 's made of good material and heals nicely . The metal is way to thick which encourages bounce backs , the color of the numbers are nearly unrecognizable . That 's no big deal , I painted mine white . There was about 1/16 th inch gap between metal and board which ridiculous . It ca n't simply be re - anchored .... because ... It was all warped and so something was inevitable to be " off " . I gently removed it and took a picture . If I had to do again , I would probably buy the same board . Obviously , I 'm one of the unfortunate . Oh , mounting instructions would have helped . 3 nails a few screws and some bracket I had to figure out .
5 #### The great thing about Converse All Stars is that you do n't have to worry about trying on a million different pairs . Once you know what size you wear , it is very easy to order them online or purchase them from a store without having to try them on . I absolutely love these shoes . Personally , I have around 50 pair . These black high tops , I ordered for my nephew because I feel like every child should grow up with a pair of Converse in their closet ! This is a nice , classic look that can be worn in a variety of ways and for a variety of activities . Overall , I am super pleased with these shoes . My nephew was crazy excited for his new high tops and they fit exactly as we knew they would !
1 #### I had high hopes that these would work in my mask , but after two attempts I removed them in frustration . They simply did n't do what I expected them to do . They moved around in the mask , even though I followed the mounting instructions to the letter . What I discovered is that they work perfectly when mounted to an absolutely flat surface . And , ( here is a * * * news flash * * * ) , no underwater dive mask I have ever purchased has a perfectly flat lens . I suggest you save your money for a mask with optically ground lenses and you will be much happier .
3 #### Not what my wife wanted me to buy ! No butt , just perfect for working in the yard or on the car .
4 #### This thing is HUGE!.The shape is not the most practical . It is about the size of a king - size pillow . The problem is that the zipper is on the long side , if it is not full it makes for an awkward closure . This will fit multiple changes of clothing , the problem is that then you 'd have to find a place for the bag .
5 #### Bought this pair based on my experience with another pair I purchased some time ago . Previous pair was comfortable , looked good and wore for long time . This pair fits that bill also . Merrill brand is just dedicates itself for value .
5 #### came new in package.did the trick , good seal , not at all dry . I can say i m very happy with the product
4 #### The leather strap fits a thin wrist perfectly , something I 've had trouble with in the past . The watch is light weight and you hardly notice that you 're wearing it . Seems hardy enough with shock and water exposure . The glow - in - the - dark dial is convenient but the date window is tiny . The dial is small and some people may want a more dashing dial . Not a stylish or good - looking watch but serves the purpose and is cheap
1 #### I 'm conflicted over this review , as I loved this product until this morning when I ended up at the hospital getting stitches in the back of my head after the Velcro strap ripped off , sending the d - ring and carabiner flying into my head at 100Mph . Great bands , just be very careful using the Velcro strap .
5 #### Great scooter for my 8 year old . My 13 and 11 year olds enjoy it too , it would be the right size for kids anywhere within that age range . Nice smooth wheels . We avoid the models that have a wheelie bar .
5 #### My husband loves these and they are very good quality !
3 #### Ordered a second Men 's 9 and it is not like the pair I ordered a few months ago . This pair is at least a size 10 . Frustrating
5 #### Waiste was a good fit . If you are thin the thighs are large .
5 #### The jeans fit right and at a good price too . Shipping was fast . Very happy with this purchase .
5 #### The watch is very beautiful and shiny . I love it so much . Never regret buying it . Love Skagen my favorite new brand .
3 #### Tight , or maybe they were meant to be compressive and I did not get that memo . If that 's what you 're needing , Jackpot !
5 #### Excellent product for starting fires or cooking with while out in the bush . Easy to carry as they are light and compact and come in their own sealed containers so you do n't have to worry about them being waterproof . In fact , these will actually burn in the water and during a downpour . What 's not to like , right ?
5 #### I have had two of these in the woman 's sizes and they last forever and never loose time and are really tough and I just love them ! But they are almost impossible to find now , and when you do they are outrageously priced , so I thought I would try the man 's size at a quarter of the price ! It actually will fit a smallish women 's wrist pretty good ! I just wish they would make more of the woman 's sizes in this model , but for now the men 's is working pretty well !
4 #### Great looking . The waist size was right , however the length was too long .
5 #### Love my chucks You ca n't go wrong with a pair of chucks My go to shoes ! ! ! !
5 #### Love this waist pack ! Perfect size for my key fob , phone , and doggy poop sacks .
5 #### Somewhat slippery at first but this mat is incredible , it is worth the extra money compared to the $ 10 mats that rip and smell and slide around during practice .
5 #### well made of heavy cotton , with double stitching , definitely recommend to anybody looking for quality
2 #### The padding is n't really padding so much as it 's fluff that disappears when you sit on your bike . The emblems wore off the legs after two washes leaving the shorts looking sad . The spandex on these shorts does n't breath leaving you soaking in your own juices . At least they 're cheap ...
5 #### They 're Chuck Taylors . Been around since the fifties . The classics never go out if style !
5 #### Always great having new , fresh tennis balls whenever you 're practicing any aspect of your game , or playing a few sets . Good deal and very handy to have new tennis balls at your disposal !
5 #### Only got to use it for two nights , it stayed inflated and it was comfy . I 'm 5'6 and I had plenty of room to stretch my legs . Great for the price .
4 #### Good product , good price , worked well . I am an XL in all my clothing . This fit well at XL .
5 #### When we received the set I was pleasantly surprised how heavy duty it all was . It came in a nice carrying case , although this is n't something we have used since we have our set always put up in the yard . We set it up the stakes by digging down and using concrete to hold them in place . We put the stakes into large ice cream tubs and then buried those down into the ground and them covered it all with dirt . They still tilt when hit several times by the horseshoe , but that seems to be a set up error by us . The shoes themselves are exactly like the description provided on Amazon . This has been a great addition to our backyard and is still in excellent condition after a lot of use . The set is well worth the price . I would definitely purchase again .
4 #### Straps do not adjust and my right one keeps slipping down . Otherwise , it is great !
2 #### Nice shoe but they seem to run about a half size too small . As a result they are very uncomfortable . I would have returned them but I purchased them and did n't wear them until spring .
3 #### This is the newest incarnation of Coleman 's Rechargeable QuickPump . I 've had two nearly identical models over the last 8 years . I was hoping they improved it to be quieter , but not at all . Maybe worse . ( I checked . Wal - Mart has it . ) The noise level can be annoying in your back yard or home . More so at a campsite where people are trying to get away from noisy and rude . To me , its piercing whine screams " careless design . " Consider using a good quality foot pump ( good ones can cost $ 40 ) . They never run out of juice , although they 're not as fast or easy . I do n't use the " deflation feature . " Large - valve mattresses will self deflate in a few minutes . PROs : ~~ > Fast inflation of " Boston valve " type mattresses , such as&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Intex - Downy - Twin - Bed / dp / B000HBO4M2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Intex Downy Twin Bed</a > ~~ > You do n't have to feed it batteries , like the D - cell version ~~ > Coleman now sells replacement nozzles at their site .

5 #### For 9 $ its what i wanted the stainless ones will have to wait !
1 #### I like these sandals but received the wrong size , so I returned them . When trying to re - order the correct size I see that the current price is higher and there does n't see a way to exchange for the right size at the same price .
5 #### Nice big thick Matt works well for me . I 'm 6 3 270 and it 's perfect
5 #### This is the only kind I buy anymore , the shape is wonderful , it does n't sag ! I can even use it for exercise without too much bounce !
5 #### Not much to say about chuck taylors , best selling sneaker of all time which is why they keep them always in production , extremely comfortable even though its a flat sole , they always run one not half size bigger wether its men , women or kids ( i have bought all of them and always the same thing ) and i got these in white and love them , have 7 more at home different colors , ca nt go wrong with these , they have stood the test of time ! ! !
2 #### For a " beginner " watch for a child learning to tell time , this watch could confuse them . Instead of the minutes past 30 being marked as 35 - 40 - 45 - 50 , etc . They begin to count down , so 25 - 20 - 15 - 10 . etc . VERY confusing for a 7 year old . 3:40 was looking like 3:20 to her , thanks to the markings on the watch . It made me sad to see her so frustrated . I used it as a learning tool to teach " 20 minutes till 4 " but that was over her head as she is still trying to grasp counting minutes on the clock . I will be buying her a new watch that does n't confuse her .
5 #### Got a medium for my 7 year old . He wears size 8 pants and this costume fit him perfectly . Overall , I 'm very happy with the price and quality of this costume . I would certainly recommend to anyone who has a kid that is into superheroes .
5 #### It met the expectation I had for it . Easy to pop up , easy to operate .
4 #### Works reasonably well and provides great fun . But do n't expect this to do anything serious . Recommended as a toy .
5 #### I am a female CrossFitter with a fairly week grip , but quite strong legs . This has become a lifesaver on heavy dead lift days . The CrossFit box I go to quit buying chalk because people were going crazy with it . I have come to like this better than when we had chalk . I recently hit a 365 # dead lift using this . I have recommended this to everyone at my box . LOVE this product !
5 #### Bought the slingshot to scare away raccoon night visitors to my Japanese Garden . Works well with small ice cubes . Wo n't injure the raccoon , but gives them a fright , so they leave . The ice cubes melt so you do n't have to clean up pellets in the morning .
4 #### A nice lightweight shoe . Not a lot of cushion so I would n't run long distances in them .
5 #### I 've had the bands for over 3 weeks and they 're absolutely perfect ! The door anchor wo n't damage your door , and it works great I use them 2 - 4 days per week and they show no signs of wear at all . The carabiners make it easy to switch between bands quickly , give you the ability to use multiple bands , and provide a secure attachment to the grips . The carrying bag is a nice addition as well .
4 #### This was for my 3 year old and she loves it . I was a little disappointed that it does n't have a clasp- only an elastic band that can be adjusted ( not easily ) . The elastic band actually works well for my daughter because it 's easy for her to put on and take off once I got it adjusted . The band colors and designs are not as clear / bright on the actual band but it 's cute and she loves it . The face is plastic and we 'll see about durability on a 3 year old .
4 #### Excellent hand gripper and the quality is just great . However , I am taking 1 start off , as the grip is very rough and using these will cause callus on the contact area of your palm . I have done what other reviewer did and put a neoprene / rubber grip cover from a cheaper hand gripper on these and that has done the trick . I wish the company could have included a pair as an option for people who do n't want their hand to be rough with callus . At least , at this price a 20 cent option would have been great . Other than that , it is great product . I almost bought no . 1 , but I am glad I did n't . Trainer is just perfect for me at the moment and I am sure there is no way I could have used no . 1 . So , stepping down is a better option in this case .
5 #### Can not beat these for travel . Takes almost no room in luggage . Good when you need back up comfy shoes as heels respite . Stay securely on feet . Great for airport security . The toe guard is genius . This is the best feature . They weigh only a few ounces .
5 #### Bullet proof ... been using these for campouts for about 10 times now and no issues whatsoever . Very firm and the butt does not sink in the middle like some of the other cheaper ones I have pruchased . Do n't bother buying the self infallible ones ... they do n't work at all . You do n't even need an electric air blower . I blow up two of these each time we go camping . One is has a rough texture to help from slipping and other side is smooth plastic . Easy to take down and roll up again . Gave this to my scout son for his camping trip now . Is big even after fully rolled up however but no bigger than any other and like I said held up very well so far .
5 #### Product arrived exactly as described . I think by now , it 's common knowledge that converse sizing is slightly different to other brands . I 'll usually wear a 9.5 , sometimes 10 . Ordered a 9 here and it 's a good fit .
2 #### I was a bit disappointed in this , hoping for something with a little more weight and solidity to it . It 's nothing more than a piece of plastic , punched into a clock shape . No , it does not work , the hands are printed on the plastic . For the collector , it 's passable as long as one merely looks at it from a distance . Touching it would spoil any illusion ...
5 #### Nothing else compares to these for the price ! I had a 20 year old pair that was finally falling apart , found some inexpensive " micro - fiber " ones , but was NOT happy with them . Searched these out online , and have been very content since . They re super thin , so they fit under clothes that already might be a little tight , and they breathe , so you do n't get over heated . Nothing else like them for that extra layer for warmth .
5 #### Bought two pairs of these for my husband for work , rhey feel very sturdy and are the perfect length for him during the summer . He is the kitchen manager at a pizza restaurant so he works it a hot kitchen all day and hates wearing pants in the summer so these shorts are perfect , they also look pretty professional .
5 #### Loved their approach in this book and that it was a " paperback " . Easy to use and inspiring me to use up my beachcombing finds .
4 #### Bought the wrong size but I wear them with fuzzy socks overall good product
5 #### I love this ! Very sturdy , packable , carries left over fuel without leaking , hot steady flame , ( I use the Yellow Heet ) . Another quality Trangia product at a good price . How can you go wrong . Highly recommended .
5 #### These Allen gun socks are a great way to protect your firearms when they are stored in a safe or elsewhere . They prevent dings and scratches when guns bump into each other or other objects , and are silicone treated to protect against rust . These gun socks are long enough to accomodate any rifle , and stretch enough to cover scoped rifles ( without pistol grips ) . They are a little pricy and unfortunately are not made in the USA , but I expect these to last a VERY long time .
3 #### I am usually a size 7 and the size 7 's were to big for my feet .
5 #### I spent 15 days in New York without any problem !
5 #### The product was exactly as expected . Shipped very quickly and arrived in perfect condition . When compared to similar products , very price competitive and good quality .
2 #### My daughter had a competition / conference in which she needed to wear a pair of flesh - tone panty hose , and we bought these thinking that they would work perfectly . However , when she received them , she did n't like the way they felt on her skin , so we ended up going to the drug store and buying her a pair .
5 #### This is a great toaster oven set and we are very happy with them . I 've been using them regularly for several months now and they look almost brand new still . Nice value for the quality of the set .
5 #### While I prefer the full size griptilian , my job would nt accept me carrying a pocket knife with a blade 3 or larger , so , this fits the bill . A good quality blade in an easy to use , comfortable form factor . Good steel , easy to sharpen .
5 #### Fit as expected . I wear a size 10 and a size 10 fit me perfect . Delivered on time via amazon prime . Good quality and feels great .
5 #### This boat was an instant hit w/ the kids over the weekend . Took awhile to blow it up ( forget the hand - pump ) but it was all worth it . You can not beat the price and the kids had hours of fun in the pool w/ the boat .
5 #### I bought it for tapping out pins on my pistols and this hammer fit the bill to a T. Perfect weight and balance .
5 #### These are the only belts I buy now . I coach youth flag football and over the years I have tried various flags . At first , I went for cheap flags , but quickly realized that they would break on me ( specifically the clips ) . I own 15 of these flags and I have never had an issue with the clips , or with the flags fraying . My oldest sets have gone through four seasons with no issue . These are great .
3 #### Not easy to use as their indent is very little and had to clean them out a little and use Super - glue ...
5 #### This was gifted to a seven year old who 's always had to use leftovers and finally got his very own , brand new . We 're still getting used to folding it and it 's sometimes a fight we lose but that 's on us and not the scooter 's fault at all . It 's got a good non - slip grip on the foot rail , heavy duty foam covers over the handlebars and perfect for 4 ' 2 " people . Naturally it balks at small rocks and stuff but learning how to avoid them comes with time and is part of the ride . Great quality for the price .
5 #### These brackets fit my boat perfectly . I made my own bows out of thin oak lumber , I ripped down and varnished . The brackets were easy to install , and hold the ends of either wood or fiberglass bows .
5 #### I love this cooler ! if it had cup holders it would have been out of this world awesome , but it kept my food cold for three days so I 'm happy .
5 #### Really quiet and comfortable fit . Can put in earbuds and listen to MP3 while mowing .. Would buy again .
2 #### These fit , but are n't relaxed fit . Exchanged and recieved same . Additionally , one pair was the wrong size . It had a waist tag with a different size label than the interior label , which was the actual size . Another pair had nubbed thread flaws on the front of the thigh . Altogether , these seemed like factory seconds , while not being sold as such .
5 #### Thnk you for quick delivery the wist band came in handy . I run so do n't like carrying my wallet.and very useful at the amusement park.very satisfied ..
4 #### It does leave a smell in my container , but a simple wash with water will do . Lights up well and I use it as a backup to my other methods for camp fires .
4 #### have used it inside and outside . good quality . A mat underneath it is helpful
5 #### Love this , seemed to heal my golfers elbow . Felt really good too , and I use it to massage by gently beating myself with it .
5 #### Works perfectly and with the night light , no more waking up an hour or two early because I misread the time . The band is a little snug but being leather is stretching out nicely to my wrist ... and it I can wear it in the shower !
2 #### This product has a very " toy like " feel . The case is flimsy , the buttons feel funny , just toy - like . It only works when positioned horizontally on your belt . Seems to work OK , but do n't dare drop it or it 'll break . The light plastic case has a heavy metal weight glued inside . Why not spend $ 8 more for the superb Omron HJ-112 ? The HJ-112 has dual pendulums inside so it counts accurately whether on your belt or in your pocket . And it 's built like a tank .
5 #### I loved wearing Chucks growing up ... I really am enjoying them again . They look nice , and feel comfortable .
4 #### This is a really nice deal for this knife . I bought my first one and liked it so much that I bought 3 more for my stock . I would have designed the sheath differently but other then that it 's a really good knife . ( Needs some sharpening right out of the box and balanced for throwing too . )
3 #### Not nearly enough to satisfy your general outdoor needs . YOU need to increase the quantity and size of each bone .
5 #### My son is 10 in a 8/10 but they are getting snug so I ordered up . It fit perfect and he loved it . It looked great for 50 's day at school .
2 #### Buy the Carhartt instead . This does what it is designed to do and it does it well ( keeps your neck very warm ) but the fleece quality is sub - par . It " pills " and just had a cheap , thin feel to it .... I purchased the Carhartt neck gator also , and it is made of much better ( thicker ) material ... my wife and kids have them too and all love it . There is a huge difference when your neck is kept warm in cold weather ... it keeps your whole body more comfortable .
3 #### this book tells alot about the coming mess in America and how to try to live through it . Enjoyed reading this book but needed more information .
5 #### I HAVE BEEN BUYING THESE PANTIES FOR YEARS , LOVE THEM . WEAR FOR A LONG TIME AND FIT GREAT
5 #### I hiked 3 times in these socks without washing and my feet stayed dry and the socks did n't get stinky ! I love these socks and will be buying some for my fiance for our future backpacking trips !
2 #### These are very small and expensive . Two cubes would not boil 16 oz . of water indoors out of the wind . There are better fuel choices . I do n't get the 5 star reviews .
5 #### I ordered these pants for my Husband . He says they are very comfortable and they fit great ! Loves the color . He loves Wrangler jeans . Great quality ! I 'm going to order another pair of Wragler jeans in a different style for him .
5 #### Durable scooter and a good bargain . Though it is pretty easy for a brother or neighbor kid to pull the streamers off . We eventually just gave up and threw them away .
5 #### Bought as a Christmas gift , it 's been a hit ! The pink was a selling point for my girly girl daughter . She likes to fly around the porch and almost hit my feet a lot . Very cute , basic scooter that she can enjoy hopefully for years to come . It 's been almost a year now , and it 's held up well to almost daily use . A good buy .
5 #### Easy to use , good quality and stores and transports easily !
5 #### I love this jacket and so does my 4 year old son ! It is very soft and he has plenty of room to grow !
5 #### I originally received one of these frisbees ( or flying disc ? ) as a gift back in 2013 . I used it in parks , at the beach , over parking lots , everywhere . I changed the battery 2 years into it and now finally the button started to turn off on its own . With a 4 year life span , I was impressed with its durability given the brutal treatment it has received . With that in mind , I decided to replace it with the exact same model , and I could n't happier with my decision . The blue led is bright and perfect for night time fun with friends . The plastic is durable with some flex which helps it survive hard crashes onto pavement . My original disc did warp a tad after years of use , but it did not affect its flying ability , Of course , if your intention is daytime ultimate frisbee matches , you would be better off with a Discraft Ultra Star . The Discraft is made with a harder plastic and flies farther for more competitive action . I keep both in my car , but I have a lot more fun throwing the Nite Ize .
1 #### Started smoking and the plastic part around the bulb began to melt . I guess you literally need to submerge it in water when its on .
5 #### Nice targets for my AR ..... to big for the indoor range though .... However they work fine outdoors . I m must fill up space , so get these targets and happy shooting .
5 #### this was purchased for my 9yr old son who deals with ADHD , PDD , and Aspergers , and is having a very difficult time focusing with all the distractions in his classroom while doing assignment worksheets . He 's in a classroom where 2 grades are combined . So far these have been an answer to prayer for his meltdowns and shutting down because the distractions really bother him .
5 #### My quads and knees are large , so I usually have trouble fitting into kneepads since most people playing volleyball are of lighter build . However , these kneepads are comfortable and easy to move in . They provide a nice balance between thin profile and enough padding .
4 #### No arch support , but that 's too be expected with Chucks . Works great with my own orthotics , although I did have to insert an additional leather piece next to the inside arch so orthotic did not quickly wear through or tear the canvas fabric . I wear a 12 normally , so the size 16 is for the ' big shoe clown ' effect . A little sock stuffing in the toe and fits great for me .
5 #### Love this rope for back exercising and core strength . No stress and easily done with a chair or using the floor .
5 #### Very simple and easy to use , but if you plan on securing to public docks and worry about back end , might want to make sure you carry a long dockline as well .
5 #### I bought this some time ago and is very happy with my purches . I would surly tell my friends to buy one .
3 #### Bought this holster for my Raging Bull .44 Magnum ( 6.5 " barrel ) . Overall a good holster ( and one of the few you 'll find for a Raging Bull ... ) PROS : secure snap retention ( retention strap can be adjusted ) , good fit , snap offers good retention and wo n't easily un - snap CONS : rear sights stick out a bit and are n't covered , readjusting the retention strap just a couple of times starts breaking off little pieces of the velcro , belt loop should be just a TINY bit bigger to make it easier to mount on to your belt I really wish there were more accessories for Raging Bulls . Bianchi as well as other holster manufacturers should make some holsters designed specifically for Raging Bulls instead of multi gun holsters .
4 #### Little heavier sole than some of the other women 's Keens , so there is little more support . They fit well , do not chaffe in the heel either . Colour choices are nice too
5 #### used these at la downs race track and they worked great . very good quality and I would recommend these as a cheaper buy for anyone needing this type product . I must say i ve owned several like this in the past years and there better than any i ve had in the past
5 #### This thing is actually working to eliminate ( or at least greatly mitigate ) my golfers elbow . Before I started using this I was unable to do arm curls in any weight that was useful . I am now up to where I was some months ago and expect to continue upward .
3 #### Had to send these back and get a full size smaller
5 #### I love these shoes . I am rather basic when it comes to Nikes , I do n't need all the cool colors , so these look amazing and feel amazing , like they were made for my feet . I definitely suggest purchasing them .
5 #### Leg length was a little long but pants are good and heavy should wear well
5 #### I love this watch -- it is the perfect face size for my wrist and thus far has been extremely durable and reliable . I 've had this watch and used it daily for several months now and it has surpassed my medium - low expectations . I 've dropped it and knocked it around a bit , and it has held up great . Keeps good time , and the band is still going strong despite daily use and abuse . Worn this swimming a few times as well with no problems . Great watch , and looks a bit more classy in reality than it does in the picture .
5 #### These sneakers give me the motivation to workout because they feel so good and are great for any training
4 #### Well , I ordered the wrong size by accident ( 8 M - men 's shoes , instead of women 's shoes ) , so , they were a couple sizes too big for me . However , they fit my mum perfectly , and she likes them , so , no complaints . :) I love Converse shoes , but I think , next time , I 'm going to go to a store and try them on first . For those who know their shoe size beyond any shadow of a doubt and know how to pick it out in a drop - down menu , these shoes are great ! For those who are mystified by shoe sizes , you might want to do some research before ordering them online . All in all , the mistake is my own . At any rate , great shoes !
5 #### Have not used the stove yet however I have owned many Coleman stoves and they are great . The order came in when promised , no damage , looks well made
5 #### My wife loves these shoes . We have both been wearing sketchers and new balance for several years and recently we have both purchased Nike . There is a reason why Nike is still number 1 after all these years , you just ca nt beat their comfort .
3 #### I will blame myself for ordering a bag this size , but it was too small for what I needed . In addition , the strap was not long enough for it to sit comfortably when I used it crossbody . I have the next size up , and ti 's a better size . I like the material and color , but that 's about it .
5 #### I had owned a Buxton wallet for a very , very long time . It became time to replace it . I found a new one on line and ordered it . It arrived in LESS than a week and it was exactly what I ordered . I could not beat the price either . It was less than what I had paid for my original Buxton . Thumbs up to amazon for the Quality of its venders and their services ! ! ! ! !
2 #### My son LOVED this , but it came with a hole in it and we have to keep blowing it up . One of the elastic straps broke within the first few days too .
2 #### The quality is OK . The size is very small . The company should have quality control before they go out . I will return them
1 #### Every size i buy is too large . The first time i got my normal size , women 's 8 , and it was far too large . I just bought a child 's size 6 , again too large . I do n't understand the issue with the sizing . Super annoying
3 #### this is a great mask for numerous sports and costuming needs . pros- fits the face well , and if you happen to have a larger head and nose ... like i do it still fits well . the 5 straps hold it in place securly in a sprint or jumping around . it can be easily modified . cons- it does restrict vision , you lose some periferal vision and the top of the mask needs slight ajustment depending on the shape of your head . one of the first things i do with this kind of mask is open the eye holes a bit for periferal vision .
5 #### What do you do when you have 4 or more kids of the same age in your house . Here take this parachute and go outside . Putting a ball on the top and letting them bounce it out is a fun game . Or bouncing the ball and trying to keep it on the parachute for a more difficult game . This one is not quite big enough to walk under and pull it down while you are inside . Well it would work for small kids , not with an adult in the group .
5 #### ... love the fit , love the color , love that they are comfortable ! !
5 #### Nice strong hammock - if you like hammocks get this ! i made a hammock tent from this . this very light !
5 #### Exactly what I hoped for . The relaxed fit is that . Not tight fitting at all . Perfect for the over 35 crowd like me .
4 #### This is a comfortable shirt , but is way bigger than expected .
5 #### I bought this watch for my wife . She had gone through several other Timex watches and non of them seemed to hold up more than a year . This one is going on a year and a half and still going strong .
4 #### size small felt somewhat large but it keeps me warm .
5 #### We got this watch for our granddaughter 's sixth birthday . It was a big hit . The elastic band fits her beautifully and the ballerina design is perfect for her . The watch face is just right for learning to tell time . Everyone was excited with this gift . The warranty is great for young ones too !
5 #### My son loves these for powerlifting when he needs a more rigid sole Size was true , fits good , feels good , decent price , delivered right on time Would order again
2 #### The size was larger than appropriate and after handwashing the stockings , they stretched to an extreme length . Very disappointed .
5 #### Classic and always cool , how can you not want a pair !
5 #### Very high quality . -natural look inserted into bikini top . They really push up well ! Super happy !
3 #### Great material , get two sizes larger than you are used to if you have a longer torso .
5 #### I have a thing for converse they are just fashionable , comfortable and beautiful . They fit as expected and every time I wear them I feel like I 'm walking on a runway . They are a must have .
3 #### Arrived in a box that said it was new , but the knife has scratches all over it . Does n't seem very new . Otherwise it is as expected . Would n't care if it was for me , but giving a scratched up knife as a gift is pretty crappy .
5 #### We are absolutely in love with Razor scooter . Provides years of fun . I actually went back and got 2 more . I use it , my son uses it and sometimes grandpa . I got one to keep inside and 2 for outdoors . My son just enjoys using this scooter . Its very easy to put together . Snaps in a few seconds and that is all you need to set it up , Its very sturdy and durable and comes in different colors . This is definately worth the investment . Lasts fr years .
5 #### My daughter loves these tights , fit perfectly and pretty durable
5 #### These will be a Christmas gift for my son . I think it 's a great deal so I bought 2 pairs .
5 #### Arrived on time and as expected . Good fit and quality .
5 #### These were a hit with my training partners . They work great and help make training more realistic .
3 #### I always wear a womans 9 in Nikes but these are bigger than usual . The right one almost slips off my foot a bit . They are really light and not as sturdy as what I was looking for but over all not bad .
5 #### Great for Street hockey , easy for the kids to move around .
5 #### I really love these shoes . They are attractive and very comfortable . They work well for my daily workout and fit well .
5 #### I use this when training Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts . It is light weight and durable , making it the perfect throw bag for this purpose . The rope coils into the bag easily and I have not had problems with it getting tangled .
2 #### This is a little baggier than I had expected for a base layer . It is exceptionally thin . Has feminine detailing that some people might like and others wish it was n't there . I find it does n't keep me nearly as warm as other silk under layers . The quality seemed unremarkable . I tend to wear it for pyjamas instead of under clothes because of the fit .
4 #### comfortable fit . wrinkles a lot coming from the dryer ... needs ironing
5 #### These shoes were purchased as a gift to my granddaughter . She loves them , and has no complaints at all .
4 #### I really liked this jeans and fitted on me very well and I recommend who want he can buy and will fit on very well .
1 #### After less than a week the sole ripped off on the outside of the shoe
5 #### Nothing cuter than seeing your baby girl in her pink converse ! Fit and quality are excellent . We were very pleased !
5 #### Attractive and quality timepiece for the dollar spent ! I 've paid more for less . It appears dressier for a field watch . One could dress this watch up or down . Throw a navy leather band or a gator on this watch , and it could work . Not bad . Not bad at all . This watch has a nice weight to it . It 's not heavy , but feels well made .
2 #### I love these pantyhose , except for the fact that they 're too short . I 'm 5 ' 10 " so I always have trouble finding things that fit . Too bad . They are very silky and nice .
5 #### These are extremely comfortable and well fitting jeans and they have them in my size too . 31X30 is hard to find with pants and jeans ,
5 #### Really a nice design . No need to worry about slight miss alignment of rings due to floating spherical bearing .
5 #### I ordered this 3 days ago and I got it today .... magic ? I think yes . Hehe I 'm happy and they fit perfect
4 #### I priced these at a lot of local stores and other Amazon vendors . This was by far the best deal . The cords are good and sturdy , connections and accessories work well and all zip into a bag you can toss somewhere .
5 #### Carhartt shirts and Dickies jeans have always been my favorites for comfort and durability at a price that is great for the quality and durability . I live , play , work and will probably die in a Carhartt .
5 #### This was so worth the purchase . We went on vacation to a very cold location and these were a life saver . We put them in each pocket of our coats in the morning before leaving for the day and they stayed warm and at times very hot even hours after opening . At the end of the night they are still warm . This is certainly a must have if you are in a cold climate . Excellent product and would repurchase again if I ever were going to travel to a cold climate again .
5 #### This really is the ultimate frisbee ... it has the power / flight capability similar to an Aerobie , but is dead easy to throw . You can even try and throw it wrong and it levels itself out in flight and goes nice and straight . The rubberized grip / edges make it really comfortable to catch / throw and is about 100x better than solid plastic frisbees and a HECK of a lot easier to play around with than a real Aerobie with folks that do n't want to have to learn a lot of technique . If you like parks , stop reading this review and just buy one and keep it in your car . It is awesome .
5 #### Needed a new basic watch with day / date for work- I am a nurse practitioner and wanted an easy - to - read model . I am very sensitive to metals / nickel and have had no problems with this watch . This watch is totally cool . It 's like a bangle bracelet since it has a men 's size band . No clasps . Just stretch links . ( I think it can be easily adjusted by a jeweler ) Honestly it looks like an expensive retro - style watch . The face illuminates when you press the dial button . It was a little frustrating to set initially since I had to wind through a few days to get the day / date right . But- I love this watch so far . Much classier than my plastic Swatch ( RIP ) .
1 #### I do n't know what about this cap suggests it will keep hair dry - or maybe it does n't say that and I need to read more carefully . Pro : does n't snap like elastic swim caps , therefore does n't pull hair . Con : does n't work .
5 #### Exactly what we expected . Arrived in a very timely manner .
2 #### This is a cheap pedometer . I ca n't speak for how well it works because it broke less than 10 minutes after I opened it . Setting it up was relatively easy . There are no labels on the casing . So once it was clipped shut , I had no way as easily identifying which side to open from . Sure enough , I opened up the wrong side and exposed circuitry . I snapped it back shut , but now it does n't work . It was my mistake to open the wrong side . But that would not have happened if the casing was clearly marked . How hard can it be to clearly identify the side to open ? How about using some labels ? Let this be a warning when opening up this pedometer to check the readout . If you try the wrong side , it opens too easily and never works again . Poor design .
4 #### After rotator cuff surgery you really have a long haul to improve shoulder strength and get back flexibility . I liked this flexbar because I could do tons of reps while watching TV - building stamina is important , but how many hours can you do your PT exercises during the day ? This really got me to increase reps and improve strength without having to drop everything and set up an exercise space .
5 #### I bought these in a Medium for my daughter , she 's 5'3 " and about 110 pounds she likes them a little on the loose side . She wore them skiing and really like the way they fit and they kept her warm and dry .
5 #### My older son had a pair of these , so when my other son was born I knew I needed a pair for him . They last , material is strong enough to keep up with a toddler . No complaints here ....
5 #### Fits true to size . Well made . Comfortable . Would but again .
5 #### i could n't ask for a higher quality for the price . this appears to cost much more than it did . delivery was on time and that was at the height of the holiday season . I would highly recommend this to friends and family .
4 #### It was super easy for 4 man tent . Lasted few years . I bought another can to reapply proactively . seems like it lasts .
5 #### Really tasty hearty and almost enough for two people . I think there 's a lot of sodium in general in these Mountain House products ; take care .
5 #### Husband loves carhartt . This product fit as expected with no issues !
5 #### A good product that hopefully you will not have to use .
4 #### My husband has wide feet and while these are a lighter color than I would normally buy for him , the style was great and they did n't make his feet look wide . He wore them yesterday for the first time and reported back to me that they were pretty comfortable for the first day .
1 #### It was big he just used it is damaged leaking air :(
3 #### Good product which I feel will last some time . I do wish they had a little better instructions but overall , mission accomplished !
5 #### Wanted to do a tune - up on the boat I bought last season . I changed out the plugs and wires and these worked just fine - boat fired right back up . These arrived very quickly , and seemed to be of high quality . Thanks so much . Anyone who is looking for some spark plugs for their Evinrude Xp150 ( and probably other applications ) , look no further .
5 #### Shoe runs a little big but that s good because my aon still has room in there for when his foot grows . just need to order half a size smaller .
5 #### I keep it on my fishing bucket so I have a place to sit . Great sturdy product . Though mine is on a Lowe 's bucket , and it fits very loose . Do n't know if Home Depot or other buckets would be tighter ..
5 #### Shoe runs somewhat large ; perhaps about a size larger , but we knew when we ordered them . My granddaughter loves them and we will keep for Fall when school starts .
5 #### very good lure caught 10 fish on this one so far this year .
5 #### The product is amazing but after washing and drying the fit is no longer perfect . After washing they became too small in the waist and length . They are very durable and he loves them it would just be nice if the initial fit lasted as long . Its even annoying to have to buy larger to anticipate the shortage
5 #### I love these shoes and have worn them for a long time . That are comfy , thinner on the top & sole and are very cute !
4 #### This sleeping bag completely met my expectations for it 's price point . You can get similar performance in a lighter weight bag , but would pay much more for it . Great for routine camping , but a bit heavy for serious backpacking .
4 #### Good pads , overall great deal for the money . I wish L or R can be labeled on the pads because it took me a while to figure out which one is left which one is right , they 're not symmetrical .
5 #### I have a hard time finding decent quality total support hosiery that still are sheer enough to work under skirts . These fit the bill . I 'm 5 9 " and needed size D.
5 #### These shoes were an excellent fit so true to sizing chart . These shoes are $ 249 dollars in NZ and i managed to purchase for $ 148.00 . My husband was pleased with my choice . Thankyou
5 #### You can break it in by sitting in the sun . It can be slippery until it is broken in then it is nice firm and sticky .
1 #### Sent me wrong size and charged for me to send back very unhappy
5 #### I purchased 2 sets based on all the reviews on these . I am very happy with them but they are a tad big for my kids still age 3 and 6 . I know they will grow into them but they still wear them and they never fall off . They have a really nice feel to them and the gel seems to work good . They do come with its own carry net to store them and that is a bonus . I would recommend these to anyone .
5 #### These shoes fit perfectly to my 9 1/2 foot ! They are comfortable and easy to slip in and out of . I am going to buy another pair in other colors !
3 #### I ordered this for Halloween in July because the price was right . I always thought malificent was the coolest villian . I splurged and ordered the horns separately . I am SO glad I did . The horns that come with this costume are junk . I actually thought they were packing material . No way would those ever have worked . The costume was comfortable , and lasted all night- more than I can say for most Halloween Costumes . The collar is also very flimsy and will not stay up . I may reinforce it with some stiff fabric if I wear it again . If you order this , make sure you find some proper horns , or you will be disappointed .
5 #### This was on my Grandaughter 's birthday list . She loves it . It was easy to put together , is light and easy to move . She has already enjoyed playing with it .
3 #### normally wear size 5.5 but I had to return them . Reordered 4.5 and still too large . Going to store for proper fit .
5 #### These added a super cool casual but matching vibe to the boys attire at our wedding . The boys were stoked to skip dress shoes and everyone commented that they loved them .
4 #### A bit flimsy but an ok sign for the price . I 'm sure would make any Bears fan happy !
4 #### They were just a touch too big , but I think if I would have ordered a size smaller they would have been too tight .
5 #### Good shoes , they fit as they should , they look good , and my son likes them , and they even showed up right after the hurricane Harvey destroyed our area .
5 #### Although I have not wore many , these are and have been my favorite style and brand . This was my 4th pair .
4 #### Got it for my 6yr old daughter . She love the watch , but i have to tighten them everytime she puts it on . The band adjutment can be improved
5 #### Have used this on several car camping trips for over a year . No problems so far . Seems fairly rugged . Easy to clean - although I have n't had to deal with any major messes yet . It 's true you do n't have very fine control over just how hot the burners are , but I have found that I do have enough control to do some actual cooking without burning food . This does more than just boil water . I 've never used the more expensive types of camp stoves , so ca n't really say whether they might be better , but this has worked well enough for me that I ca n't imagine why I 'd want to spend the extra money on a more elaborate grill that might be more fragile . I 'm happy with this one .
3 #### Good for non - aerobic workout . Mesh was very comfortable but no support for lateral movrment .
4 #### So cute . Great gift . Wish it was a bit more breathable . My son loves it but he does not sleep in it . Uses it for a special spot on the top bunk . Very cool item .
5 #### Although my husband just wanted a slightly padded seat , we ordered these . He said they are great . The wore them on bike trips of 20 + miles and had no problem . They do run big . He usually wears a large and had to exchange for mediums .
5 #### Note - I usually wear a 9 and have to wear a 10 in these ! Once you know the sizing , though - they 're awesome . I wore them for 2 weeks straight and hiked all over Guatemala and Honduras and the Bay Islands . Not a single blister or back ache . They 're amazing . You do n't slip on wet surfaces , your feet stay in them , your toes are protected . The only drawback is that it 's a little hard to get a stone or sand out , but that 's a decent tradeoff for comfortable feet in my opinion . If you get them dirty you can hose or scrub them off and they look great - they can really take a beating . And they actually look cute on - I get tons of compliments whenever I wear them , which is often . They 've become my go - to sandals now ( what flip flops ? ) . They 're worth every penny .
5 #### I love these shoes and have worn them for a long time . That are comfy , thinner on the top & sole and are very cute !
4 #### I liked this dress so much that I ordered 3 - black , grey , and purple . They are comfortable , yet suitable for going back to the office postpartum . Easy to feed baby when home and pump while away from him . I 'm 5 foot and my only complaint is that it 's a bit long , but they can be hemmed so no worries .
5 #### Perfect for rehabilitation . I used it for a shoulder . Perfect .
5 #### Fantastic , I love this Bra , it is the only one I ever found that fit someone who is small around but larger in the cup . I wasw payting $ 45.00 at Gottschalks for this very Bra . LOVE IT !
4 #### I got this watch for my four year old because I want her to learn to tell time and she is always stealing my digital watch . Unfortunately she wo n't even wear it . She opened it at Christmas and immediately put it to the side . I am still giving it four stars because it looks like a good , well made watch . It looks just like its picture . I just wish the numbers and hands were a little bigger since it is supposed to be a learning watch .
5 #### Ca n't go wrong with KEEN ! I have really wide feet and have a hard time finding shoes . These are perfect .
3 #### The quality is poor , but it fit great and it worked perfectly for Halloween .
5 #### I 've owned a handful of air matresses in my life and this one has held up the best when we go camping . It is very strong material , well crafted , and it 's easy to fit in the included bag .
5 #### Classic . Simple . Perfect . Just what I wanted for an everyday watch .
5 #### I really use my scooter a lot , so what the stock front wheel broke I was sad but these wheels were Higher grade and have dealt with everything I throw at it .
5 #### This has seen some mild use and has worn well . I buy these infrequently
5 #### Bought this for my 8 year old grandson . He loves it . Says it 's just the right size and can now have all his buddies over to play soccer . Great quality . AND the shipping was VERY quick !
4 #### Great scope from Amazon and a good price . I put this on my shotgun and hit bulls eye at 1000 yds which I could n't do before . The eye relief is short so watch out for recoil it can pop your eye on a shotgun . Great scope .
5 #### Bought these for my husband . He is a pipe fitter so he wears out pants fairly fast but these seem to hold up the best out of all the different types of pants he has tried . If you are one of those people , like him , who wears out pants fast I highly recommend these . They are unwashed so the material is not prebroke in but it also makes them last longer . The stich in and manufacturing of these pants are top quality . We swear by Carrhart products always well made and sturdy . Can not recommend them enough .
4 #### I 've owned several pairs of converse before so I already knew about the lack of arch support , the narrowness of the shoe and the fact that they run a little large ( something i 've never actually had a problem with because I like extra room in my shoes anyway ) . Keeping all that in mind , I 'm very happy with these shoes . They fit me great and they 'll be perfect to wear in the warmer months .
5 #### I bought this knife for the Camino de Santiago . And I needed it to open beers , cut bread , cut tape , and uncork wine . And guess what - it did it ! Sharp knife , scissors and saw . Was light for my pack and got used all the time .
1 #### The back strap hangs way lower than the back of the helmet . I do n't know if that 's normal or not , but I doubt it . E - mails with photos have been ignored by Schwinn . When I tried calling them , their support voicemail system was confusing .
5 #### I buy the mens size Chuck Taylors because I ca n't get the half size in womens and I like the extra bit of width that goes with the mens . There is room for an insole designed for casual shoes . Arch support is n't something I desperately need . These are n't my first pair and they sure wo n't be my last . :D
5 #### A must have if you are a raiders fan # RaidersNation
5 #### Chicago weather has been brutal this year and this turtle neck has truly made a difference to my child 's happiness . so very pleased with the purchase
4 #### < div id="video - block - R3GR6JF7P6YAJD " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / C1oMW9OYe6S.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/71EvfSfSPjS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;We bought two sets of these Peltor " Tactical 6S Active Volume Hearing Protection " for use at the range . At first I was a little concerned about these since there a quite a few marginal and negative reviews mixed in with the glowing positive reviews . I am very pleased with these overall and have the following observations : Pros - + Good Protection ; these do provide good attenuation of sharp sounds ( like a shot ) + Comfortable ; these are easily adjustable to fit most heads ( note : I suspect those that complained about this did n't read the instructions ) + Good Amplification ; the audio amplification works great and allows for easy conversations between shots Misc - * Takes four AAA batteries ( not included ) , two in each ear cup - some reviewers claimed that they could n't figure out how to insert the batteries , but I suspect that they did n't read the instructions . See my video showing the easy procedure . Recommended ! As much as I like these , and will continue to use them as spares and for guests , I really like&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Howard - Leight - R-01526 - Impact - Sport - Electronic - Earmuff / dp / B001T7QJ9O / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuff</a>&nbsp;and have switched to them as my primary protectors . CFH
2 #### I always order myself a 7.5 women 's ; however , these were too large . I had to return .
3 #### It was a little to snug for my 40 m&p . It works but not the best fit for me .
4 #### Very nice set ... Lighter than I expected , however this is good so the ladies can " attempt " the 40 ' toss
1 #### even for the low cost I wo n't order this again . The velcro for the pockets do n't even keep the check pockets closed when there is nothing in the pocket . Terrible velcro . So close to being a nice shirt . If I have to pay someone to alter with buttons or better velcro I might as well buy an Eddie Bauer or other higher end shirt .
5 #### It is cute ... I like that I can use layers under the costume , since we live in Wisconsin and it is likely to be cold / cool by that time ... Hat is kind of not fitting really nice , but I 'm planning in use some straps so it can stays in place ...
5 #### We liked the exercise and result so much , we published a video blog . Copy and paste this link into your Web browser 's address field : http://tenniselbowsolution.blogspot.com/
5 #### We 've had a great time as a family throwing this around the soccer fields . Luckily we have a large park area with enough space for 4 soccer fields all together cause this thing really flies . Its soft so that it does n't hurt if one of the small ones misses their catch . The hole in the middle provides a good way for someone to get a grip or to catch it ring toss style . Light and easy to throw for all ages . Get one of these , and get out for some family disc time . You will be glad that you did .
5 #### Size 11 men 's fit a lil big but keeping great looking lots of compliments
5 #### Great buy for the price and it is well balanced . I use this on a daily basis as I build Custom ARs and this i d the right weight for the removal and re installation of pins .
4 #### size smaller than expected . so will return it and uy the next size .
5 #### I have previous good experiences using fuel tablets and these are no exception . They light fast and put out good heat .
4 #### It will work for its intended purpose . Its kinda cheap looking if you 're looking ... however , I purchased it for one photo ... and you wo n't be able to tell in a picture .
1 #### POS . The stop detents wo n't hold the cover in place at the 45 - degree angle . Its like wet spaghetti . Do n't bite .
5 #### I 'm so happy with this kit . I just wish it was anti - snapping like some of the other ones but none have come close to snapping yet . Everything seems like really high quality and I enjoy using these .
1 #### After using this shoes seven times for regular activities like walking or dancing the sole came out . I am very disappointed . I do n't recommend this product at all . The worse part is that I can not return this item because the return window closed 4 days ago .
5 #### My husband loves these boots . He said they are well made , true to size , and super comfortable . I love them because they look so nice on him . He bought another pair in a different color because of how impressed he was with these boots . The color is true to what is pictured here .
3 #### This is my fourth pair of these shoes . They usually last me about two years . It seems like the quality has gone down significantly with the last two pairs I bought especially this last one . Also either my feet are still growing or the sizing is shrinking . My first pair was a 10 and now an an 11 barely squeezes on my foot .
2 #### Product I receives was not the one listed . Amazon was very quick with a replacement which was also incorrect being item # 5612 ( Big Boy Dove - Sport Bucket Hunting Seat ) rather than 5613 . I items I received did no swivel & did not have a back . That said , it seems like a decent product . You may indeed want to add a piece of closed cell foam to the seat as it 's just some thin material stapled to a piece of plywood . The bucket is roomy & opens nicely & the " cooler " inside is merely a foam insert . It will keep your lunch cool or an item from freezing during the day . All in all a decent seat for someone who does n't need the back support . It 's a shame the product shown here is not the one shipped .
4 #### Nice and solid product - training is fun and the product allows you to take your gym on the road . only thing i do n't like about it is that you always have to lookup which colour matches which weight - a bit more intuitive colours would 've been helpful - but that 's really just a minor problem .
4 #### i ordered because i needed a small watch to fit my skinny wrist . it fits and looks great . have not used it much and hoping it will last awhile .
4 #### I 'll get the bad out of the way right off . I ordered the last pair in the color I wanted ( Forest Night / Black Olive)When they arrived I noticed that one of the clips for the speed lace system was broken . I replaced the speed laces to resolve the issue rather than sending them back . It was not a major issue and cost about two bucks . Now for the good . This is hand down the most comfortable pair of sandals I have owned . I have had them for 3 days and am already comfortable saying that . Yes , I am noticing a slight smell developing but I am confident the same trick I use for other athletic equimpment will work . Wash with baking soda . If it persists allow to soak in baking soda and rinse . I simply love these sandals and their design . I am the guy with size 14 feet that bangs his toes on every corner and edge in front of me and these protect my toes . Because I bang my toes they do n't look like I could ever be a foot model . Not a problem because the toe box is totally covered so if you have ugly feet these will take that issue away . Love them ! ! !
4 #### remember when carhartts fit like heavy duty jeans ? and then the thug style infiltrated clothing and Dickies and Carhartt decided to get into the baggy and biggy style of clothes . now i have to buy down a few sizes to get something to fit . if you wear 34x34 , you can buy 34x34 here and you will get a snug waist , long dragging pant cuffs and enough room in the legs to fit another slightly smaller version of your legs . but that being said , i m stuck on carhartts because the quality is there and the longevity and i really wear pants for work and treat them badly . i will be sad to retire my 10 year old sets of carhartt work jeans because they actually fit like human pants , but i guess ill get used to having " hammer time " work pants .
5 #### Not that many " silver / stainless steel / ss " scopes out there , so choices are limited . I never buy high - end scopes because I will break it within a couple of years because of rough usage and carlessness . So , this scope jumped out at me for the money and it proved to be a best buy " in my opinion . It was practically centered ( took 3 rounds to center ) , and after putting 500 rounds through the mini14 , it has n't drifted at all . I run a tactical training program so the 500 rounds were fired by five students at 100 rounds each , and carried through an obstacle course to boot . The rig took some falls and hits , but nothing has taken - out the scope yet . Also , I 've read that the min14 is particularly hard on scope reticles , so I use a Buffer Technologies Recoil Buffer ( also bought through Amazon ) , but I do n't really do n't know if that helps the " reticle problem " or not .
5 #### I ordered one for both of my children and for myself and it helped keep our neck warm . If you have sensitive skin you may want to wash it before wearing . I did n't and my neck was red after taking it off , but my kids were fine . My skin is more sensitive .
1 #### Ripped as soon as I put them on . Poor quality .
5 #### Just like I remembered them . Bought marbles to go with it .
5 #### My 3rd set of merrils . These are my new business casual shoes . Well , semi - formal . I do wingtip Johnson & Murphy shoes when full - fornal .
5 #### Just the right length . Sturdy . Plan on using it to tether this 58 year old to the boat for fishing . Prevents falling out of the boat on unsteady legs .
5 #### Good product . I have a MINI-14 on a bipod and after a few rounds , the extension on the bipod would unlock and the right leg would extend 1/4th of an inch . I bought this to let me know exactly when this happens , and it let 's me know every single time . Perfect for prone shooting while laying on uneven ground .
5 #### This band is very sturdy and well made . I feel secure that it will hold and not snap .
5 #### If you are really serious about hand grips , and you want something that is not your standard sport shop model , this is where to go . I got the Trainer , and for someone like myself that has been using hand grips since childhood , it was too easy . Then I got # 1 and that was tuff ; but I decided to get # 2 and # 3 as well . I have just recently graduated from # 1 and using # 2 , and maybe in a year or more I can go to # 3 and get certified . Let me tell you this , if you can squeeze # 2 at least once all the way , you are good . You ca n't really understand what I am trying to tell unless you get one . So if you are person that has never used hand grips regularly if at all , then go with the Trainer . If you have been using hand grips for awhile , and looking for something harder , then get the # 1 . Remember to always squeeze hard ! ! !
4 #### The rack itself is great but I ca n't find the long security screws to replace the set that came with it as they are too short .
3 #### This looks great but the broom did n't hold up well at all .
5 #### I own several other SOG knives . This is the largest I have . It should be noted that the smaller knives have the fast spring " flip out " operation . This model is not the fast spring loaded type like some of the others . But the blade and the way this is designed still makes it fast with one hand . It is a quality looking knife . As usual with all SOG knives , the steel holds a very sharp edge and is strong . The handle has a good feel to the grip and everything about it is quality . I love the lifetime warranty and am sure I wo n't need it . If I should need it however , it 's nice to know this is a company that stands behind their products . This is a more " handsome " looking knife than the majority of their black coated blades , but they are all handsome and I have yet to have one fail on me or come up short in any manner .
2 #### The clasp starts to fail after wearing everyday . I taped the clasp after using for 6 months . Defeats the purpose .
3 #### Arrived quickly but just too big so they were returned .
5 #### Worked great . Fit perfect did what I needed it to do . High quality replacement . Hope I do n't need to buy another for my boat .
5 #### Thickly padded , not too soft or too firm . Folds in half with carrying handles . Covering material appears durable and cleanable . More than long enough for my 6 foot frame . Highly recommended .
4 #### I needed a wide size , that option was not available . So I went up a half size bigger hoping that would work . It 's not quite comfortable but I am able to wear them . I like the shoes .
4 #### Really used them a lot on our trip to Alaska .
4 #### Very easy to install and do their job well . I have yet to get them in the water so I can only attest to how they work on land but I am very hopeful based on that . More will be revealed .
4 #### My son thinks the trigger is a little too sensitive but I like the hair triggers . Very sturdy , very good .
5 #### It does what it 's made for . Very comfortable . Could n't ride my bike without it . Perfect amount of padding . I 'm new to cycling , so these are the first I 've ever bought so I ca nt compare them to others .
5 #### Very nice band I love the weight and the soft handles that do n't hurt my hands . Really there 's not much more to say about this product it does what it 's supposed to with good durability and comes with a door anchor so you ca n't go wrong there .
5 #### These fit great and are very comfortable . Kept me warm on multiple winter camps in deep snow and sub zero degree weather . Kept me completely dry .
5 #### Very comfortable . I 'm sure I will be purchasing more . I own other Merrell shoes , boots and sandals . I think they make a great product .
5 #### This thing is brutal . I chose the middle of the road resistance rating with the thought that I have some lifting experience , including deadlifts , so I expected my grip strength to be pretty well developed . This thing is a challenge . Very solid construction , and very good textured grips . My forearms are sore .
3 #### Meh , felt very comfortable but provided no support . Seem like a good option for walking around in the summer but not for aerobics or lateral movements
5 #### When the old one goes kaput ... you need another one . Works fine .
5 #### My daughter just loves it . The watch arrived ahead of time in proper packaging . Good buy !
3 #### I was told this worked great for flies as well as mosquitos . That is not the case . Flies were still in the area , but we did n't have a more mosquitos so I guess it does do what it was made for .
5 #### My husbands a truck delivery driver and needed new shorts so I found them here online instead of shopping the local stores and waiting for him to try shorts on . They fit very true to size and are very durable . I probably should have bought more than the one . :)
5 #### While I have no scientific equipment to measure the effectiveness of these respirators , let me share with you some of the environments I have used this in and it 's effect . Carbon fiber lab : no respiratory discomfort , while my peers who used disposable masks or no masks developed temporary coughs . Ceramics lab : When we experimented with some organic substances in our ceramics , there was a terrible smell like burning eggs permeating the lab . When I put on the mask , the smell disappeared like magic . Washing gross dishes : okay , once I had left a soup in a pot for longer and longer times because I was dreading what I would find in there and the smell it would emit . Well , when I finally got around to washing them , I put on this mask and it was a much more bearable experience . ( still gross , but I did n't have to experience any gag inducing odors . ) Honestly , I think at this price , every family should have at least one , whether for woodwork , painting , dust , or any remodeling and repair activities ... Lung health is no joke , but disposable masks are .
5 #### Love these shoes ! So stylish and comfortable . Just got back from a trip to NYC , Black and white Nikes and yoga pants are in high fashion right now !
5 #### Very comfy shoes ! I am a woman with a wide foot . I ordered the men 's so that I could get a wider , but not too wide shoe . This is perfect and it has a really good arch support , as well . Great for walking and non - skid too !
1 #### I HATE to complain but I have ordered 2 BOAT seat 's from you-----and each time - the seat is hard as a BRICK the back too HAS this been sitting in a ware - house for a couple of year's -- like the last time , I will have to replace the foam rubber I hope there is some way you can make an " ADJUSTMENT IN COST " to at least cover new FOAM rubber IT is just what I wanted a nice high back ....... but WOW when i sat down ......... ! ! ! ! ! ! ! MAY I here from you ?
5 #### Nice and work just fine and look good on stainless steel rifle .
5 #### My friends and I did a winter cabin weekend where we knew in advance that we would have to hike in over a mile from our drop - off point . I came across this sport sled during my research for options on hauling the 100lbs of gear that we would need . This in addition to each of us carrying 40 lb packs . This sled is light enough that I can lift and carry it over my head with just one hand . Yet the design adds sturdiness to the sled . In use , the pull cord seems thin - you would want to wear work gloves . The eye holes for the cord took all the stress we put on them with no sign of damage . We dragged the sport sled over snow , ice , dirt , and gravely dirt . Other than very superficial scratches , the sled held up amazingly well . Highly recommend for situations where you simply ca n't use a wheeled device and situations where keeping the center of gravity low is helpful .
5 #### My husband is a farmer and these are the best jeans he has found for the job . They are of nice weight and wear like iron . We bought a bunch to last a while but when they finally start to wear out , we 'll reorder more of the same !
4 #### This golf item storage rack holds two sets of clubs and has.three storage shelves . I love the rack because it is so compact yet functional . I would have rated it 5 stars but the middle shelf falls down any time you knock against it . It would have help if they had a cut out notch for the shelves to sit on the tab that the shelf rests on .
4 #### I liked the shorts , but the medium were at little small for me . I 'm about a 33 - 34 waist and there was n't a lot of room to move . The fabric seemed great quality and the pattern was had robust colors . I will most likely buy the pants and top later , once I loose more weight .
4 #### Plenty of room for a few days worth of jewelery . Surprisingly well made for the price . You could spring for the leather rolls , but for something nobody will ever see , this does just fine .
4 #### It 's been a few years since I purchased my Manduka yoga mat , and besides a few claw marks from a misguided cat , there is little wear to show . This mat is TOUGH . I am quite sure that even if I greatly intensify my yoga practice in the near future , this mat will still last a solid ten years or more . When the day arrives that my old Manduka is too worn to use , I 'll look for another one just like it . It 's easy to clean , too . Just spray it down with the detergent of your choice , rinse ( I put mine out in the rain , ) and dry . Of course , the price we pay for such durability is the mat 's considerable weight . It 's too heavy and bulky for lugging back and forth to classes . Keep this one at home , and bring the lighter weight one for yoga class . But , by all means , buy this if you want a serious exercise mat , for the saying " You get what you pay for " applies as much to this category of exercise equipment as anything else .
5 #### good product and meets expectations . I recommend it . I get asked all normal and no delays . happy and smooth shopping .
5 #### This review is for the Timex Men 's Easy reader . I purchased this for my father and he continues to use this watch today . The band is still tight and the case has held up very well . He wears this everywhere . I would definitely recommend Timex and in particular this model .
5 #### I bought two packages of these . I have n't had them long enough to really speak to their durability , but they seem to be well . I use them for storing my weapons in my gun locker .
2 #### Not a fan of these , the material feels weird against bare skin and it muddied my finger dexterity . There are better options out there for the price .
5 #### Very pleased with this product . I did n't notice any bad smell as some had mentioned .
4 #### I really love how sheer these are but they run slightly small , size up .
5 #### I love them , they fit just right and I will definitely buy more !
5 #### I 'm 8.5 in female and bought this in a size 8 female ( Size 6 male ) and they fit great . Not too narrow and not too long . My toes have enough room to wiggle around some even in thick socks . The sole had enough padding so there 's some support and you do n't feel every crack you step on . Sound shoes . My only problem was that when I got them , they were scuffed . The ' All Star ' writing on the back of the heels were smudged for some reason so for that , I was very displeased . I was n't able to return them , but I was displeased for a very long time about that defect . Wanted to order another pair but did not want to risk having that happen to me again after paying s much for these shoes . Not sure if it was the packaging or those defects were there before the seller even packaged them , but those were my only problems .
4 #### The coat is thicker than I would have thought , so I feel a bit like the Michelin Man in it . The coat is also a bit shorter than reviews here would suggest . I 'm 5'11 " and the coat runs just past my waist . If I reach over my head for something , the coat will definitely ride up and expose whatever you have going on underneath . A taller person would be caught short here , I think . The ribbed cuffs on the interior of the sleeve are a fantastic touch . The zipper is very difficult to start , so I can only imagine this would be exacerbated wearing heavy winter gloves . That said , it 's of high quality , just like many of Carhartt 's products .
2 #### I returned it - did n't like how it looked in person - it was just too small
3 #### i like the watch is a timex ) is tought enought for kids to use , my daughter love it , it also has the back ligth that makes it more usefull , but the only thing that has to be change for another material is the strech band , it gets ugly fast and more if your child gets it wet .
5 #### Medium resistance is weak . Does n't really improve grip or upper extremity . But it is a really good tool to use to stretch your forearm muscles and cracks my wrist joints . My wrists and forearms feel so much relaxed after twisting this thing around . Probably great for somebody recovering from an injury . Not really used to improve grip unless if you 've got an injury .
3 #### Despite that the label says this can be tumble dried on low heat , mine shrank a lot when I did that . If you plan to use a dryer , I suggest buying one size larger . Before it shrank I really liked it . The little bit of extra warmth it provides without being bulky is great , and it 's nice to be able to pull a sweater or t - shirt over it without the sleeves pushing up to my elbows .
5 #### Received the package in good condition , no fear of the targets being damage . Love the fact the anatomy is in lined out . Nice price for the pack . Had more fun shooting at this than the milk cartoons & empty jugs we also brought along to shoot at . Definitely would buy from the Sportsman Guide again !
5 #### Comfortable and slouchy . Wear them like my favorite sweatpants when I want shorts too .
5 #### I Loved The Right From The Start . I Bought Them In White Color And They Are Beautiful . I 'm Planning To Buy More In The Near Future .
5 #### Just what I needed and it was actually cheaper than getting them at any department store .
5 #### This pair fits perfect ..... the first pair was wrong size in the right box ..... definitely order again ! ! ! ! !
5 #### I walked around Europe literally all day for two weeks straight in these shoes and never once were my feet sore . I have terrible arches and usually deal with feet problems after long distances but not with these . I hiked mountains , walked down brick roads , and stomped on concrete sidewalks and these shoes managed to keep my feet comfortable each day . LOVE THEM ! I would definitely buy them again and would also suggest them to friends / family .
4 #### A little expensive but good product , so easy to fit , do n't change a single thing in your car and in less than 5 mins you have every thing set up and ready
5 #### These 8 inch reactive targets are great for pistol practice . Perfect for 10 - 15 yards .
5 #### i 've used this kit a couple of times to bore sight my rifle and it does what it 's supposed to . a very good kit , cause it gets you pretty close to zero . great product .
5 #### Bought to treat golfers elbow and have been using at least 3 times a week for last month and have noticed significant improvement ... would highly recommend for golfer or tennis elbow !
5 #### Great shoes , but they arrived with two different - sized laces : one was 45 " , the other 54 " . The 45 " lace is too small to be laced all the way & tied . Will it be possible to send out another 54 " lace ? I 'll return the 45 " lace if you want me to . Thanks , Karen
5 #### Used this as a replacement for our pool basketball hoop . Looks nice and for the price it 's a great deal . Came with sufficient mounting hardware and was very easy to install . I would n't use it for someone that is really serious about basketball , but it 's great for kids .
5 #### Got this as a gift for someone and it looks great and is dependable based on previous Timex pieces owned . Its a simple piece without any frills or extras that you would most likely not use .
4 #### I use it for 200yard spotting and it works well . Eye relief and FOV are not as good as a Kowa but it is 1/5 of the price .
4 #### For girls , normally you would order 2 sizes down in men 's however , If you wear a women 's size seven order a men 's 4 , instead of a size 5 .
5 #### Much lighter than the ones from the 60s but will be very serviceable .
5 #### I feel like this pair of shoes was made for my feet . Great fit and comfort ! Very pleased with this purchase .
4 #### Not a fancy watch , but perfect for weekends and casual days . I like that it lights up so you can see it in the dark . Unfortunately the battery died just one day after receiving it , so I need to get that replaced .
4 #### this works great easy to use and do n't have to worry about to much rope or the rope getting tangled
1 #### Not enough clearance as advertised . This product is mislabeled and these are not good for low profile scopes .
3 #### Loved the look , but they ripped real easily when I put them on . I 'm 5'0 " 190lbs and ordered a queen .
2 #### I had bought this as a last minute costume , and judged by the other reviews . I knew that it would be big , but it was ridiculous ! I normally wear a size large , so I figured a 12 - 14 would n't be too bad . It sagged in all the wrong places and looked absolutely stupid on me . I do n't know whether I should return it , or keep it for when I 'm pregnant . The fabric was a very nice velvet and the trim is pretty , but the head piece looked like something from the dollar store . please do n't waste your money on this costume . Lesson Learned- try on all costumes before buying them
1 #### The picture in the ad is not what I received and not what I was expecting !
5 #### I found documentation on line that clarifies that the 3 sets of 15 repetitions should be done just once during the day . Each repetition takes about 4 seconds to complete . 30 second rest between each set of 15 repetitions . From some reviews here it sounded like folk were doing a set of 15 at 3 different times during the day . Start with the red , expect some soreness , progress to green once you can easily complete 3 sets with the red . Ice if needed . From the NY Times blog " Beginners should start with three sets of five repetitions , adding more as the repetitions get easier , Tyler says . " That made more sense when I understood the three sets were done consecutively . I 'm only had my red bar for a week but am already noticing an improvement , especially in the ' out of the blue not doing anything ' sharp pains . I can comb my hair back from my face and press the on button of my ipod ( to see the time in the morning ) again without hurting . Going to wait until I 've progressed to the green bar before I start lifting weights again .
5 #### -As other reviewers have said , these run a little big . My son fits comfortably in a 4.5 right now . I ordered a size 4 in these and they fit great with a little growing room . Width seems about average . -If you 're looking for shoes with a more natural / flexible sole so your kiddo can really feel the ground , then you may not like these . I would consider these more for older toddlers who are already walking / running proficient . -They're not the easiest shoes to get on ( these are our first pair of lace - ups ) . You really have to loosen the laces all the way down to slide them on easily over socks . But the cuteness factor outweighs any of this trouble in my opinion . He gets compliments on them all the time ! I 'll be buying more of these as he grows . :)
5 #### I use these on rifles in my somewhat overcrowded gun safe to protect them from dings , dents , etc . For the price , these are excellent for what I use them for and suit my needs perfectly .
5 #### Whelp , they are Chuck Taylors and if you need a review on Chucks you 've either been under a rock for 20 years or you are from Mars . Either one of those would be cool , but I 'm just gon na say these are the best kicks ever . Get some in every color and you will be the coolest kid on the block . Or 49 year old in my case .
5 #### Ca n't beat it . Quiet . Powerful . Accurate . Using steel shot ( ball bearings ) would render this sling shot to be VERY accurate . Odd shaped , not round rocks from the yard leave a little bit to be desired for . The interior compartment is cheesy . Do n't count on that for anything .
4 #### Good quality . The sizing was off . this shirt was much larger then expected .
5 #### My step sons loves his Razor scooter . The bike was very easy to assemble and charges relatively fast . He played outside for hours ! I do n't recommend this for kids younger than 8/9 years of age . The Scooter does have some pick up and speed and it may not be something a younger child can handle .
5 #### excellent , have the pizza oven and use it all the time
2 #### My daughter love the shoes but it was the wrong size . It should of been a 3 size . Please help .
4 #### These are good Swivels for the money . Have handled the weight of a Remington 870 Tactical Loaded with UpGrades as well as The Sling attached with the weight of 50 rounds of BuckShot and Slugs . Would have gave it 5 Stars if not for the " Weak " Quick Detach Springs , otherwise Good Swivels for the Money .
5 #### As a beginner to yoga and pilates , I found myself sliding and not being able to hold the poses well . My experienced friend who has purchases many mats has this one and loves it , so I ordered it despite some negative reviews of slipping and odor . I am extremely sensitive to odor , and while there may be a mild amount ( have n't cleaned it yet ) , it does n't bother me at all . The best part is that I am now starting to improve with the exercises because the mat has the perfect amount of tackiness . I am very pleased with my purchase and like the lifetime guarantee .
5 #### It took me awhile to find these shoes . My husband wears them in a wide width . His other ones wore out . I was so happy to find him a new pair & he loves them , says they are so comfortable . Well worth the money !
5 #### Have nt shot this yet , just bought one for a silent hunting tool for my bug out bag , with extra steel - shot .
5 #### Worked great , for M1 Garands , long enough , and not loose , but not too tight .
2 #### I do n't often give a poor review . Unfortunately , this product 's biggest shortfall , the fill - valve , is the reason why . It ( the fill - valve ) is small , most difficult by which to fill and exhaust air , that the larger air mattress I used previously , proved far and away an easier product to use . This one will test the lung capacity of an Olympic cyclist , and if you 're a smoker , or suffer from COPD or any other lung - related woes , this is not the mattress for you . And exhausting this turkey is just as frustrating , as the tiny valve demands constant massaging as you fold and exhaust , fold and exhaust . Bum Safari , man ... Cost is not always indicative of a superior product , but there are better alternatives out there for your money . This one should definitely be avoided , in my ( seasoned ) opinion ...
5 #### Used this for the first time this weekend and it was a hit ! Even with 20 mph winds on the beach this flew straight and the little kids could throw without a problem . Much easier to throw than a standard frisbee . We did n't have a problem keeping it a safe distance like others describe it taking off . It was like a regular frisbee that it could go farther than you intended but not that far ...
4 #### The large fits like most XL and the XL fits like most XXL T - Shirts , these are great ! The long shirt tail stays tucked in very well . I 'm 6'1 " 275lbs and these are the only shirts that will stay tucked in all day long . Also nice heavy cotton with no tag in the back . Exactly what you expect from Carhartt !
5 #### These are my walking , shopping , hiking , hanging - out and traveling shoes . This pair has logged over 400 miles of trail walking , been to 5 European countries and back , and finally may need be retired from daily use because the soles are pretty worn . The uppers are still in great condition , so they 'll be yard and gardening shoes in their next life . Love these sandals . Did I mention I have three other pairs ?
4 #### they bounce they are green serena did not show up to play with me four stars - five if she turns up
5 #### I bought these for my 7th grade son . We are quite happy with our purchase . They fit well and arrived quickly .
4 #### Have been using since April . No tarnishing noticed yet . The spaces for laying out necklaces and bracelets vary in width which I like . The plastic is sturdy but I wish the product looked even half as classy as the jewelry I store in it . The top flimsy plastic cover is definitely not air tight . I have bought several variations of the Stax products . The cost definitely adds up quickly . I have been able to fit three Stax on top of each other easily into my dresser drawers .
5 #### I purchased this shoe for my grandson who is a magnet for dirt . The dark sole and toe beats out the white counterpart for good looks . The shoe is comfortable just like all converse . Good buy .
5 #### These are my favorite walk around shoes ! I can wear them all day and not be in pain ! Love em !
5 #### I have been buying Jungle Mocs for my wife for years and finally said , what the hey , I should try them myself and so I bought them and now understand why my wife and everyone loves them , . Give your tired feet a present of a snuggly yet supportive shoe you can wear anywhere .
5 #### Played this as a kid and it is just as fun now . If you have the right day and right field it is so fun . Best price here on Amazon .
3 #### Ordered size based on chart but too big . Also do not like the type of sheer legs used . Feels like easy to snag .
4 #### Have used this product several times . Works well , but over a few months wears off . It is not a miracle product , but is quite well .
5 #### I love these . My forearms have gotten massive , and anybody who needs something opened knows to come to me . It 's also helped a good bit my deadlift . I have the .5 and the 2 . I would n't suggest such a jump unless you 're able to close the .5 for 30 + reps . I plan to get the 2.5 soon !
5 #### I have been looking for a cross body small bag for rough use for a long time and decided to try this . I think it was one of my best buys . The bag is small yet can hold my glasses , money , cards , chapstick and a few other things . Yet it is not bulky or heavy . Infact it is so handy that it is borrowed by all my friends who are traveling . Right now it is doing a tour of LA and Vegas . For the price it is a steal .
4 #### I have n't used in the snow yet but I 'm very excited too . it is slightly on the more insulated side than less insulated . I have n't been able to see how it retains heat in the tahoe snow , but I 'll update the review after . the side is elastic so it allows for more movement and turning than I thought would work . It is a bit long for me , but I 'm kind of stocky anyways . I 'm about 185lbs and it works well with my torso , and is n't overly tight or restricting .
4 #### This is a great underwire bra .It provides good support and looks well under clothing .
1 #### Had to send it back . They looked like clown shoes on my husband !
5 #### Old School Watch . My dad had one exactly like it . Love that the band is flexible .
2 #### My daughter says these shoes hurt her but they are cute . : (
5 #### I purchased this scope for my Marlin 795 and it is perfect fit . It is holding the zero very well after more than one hundred rounds .
5 #### Buying shoes online can go either way ; thankfully , these were perfect .
5 #### Best pair of dickies shorts I 've purchased . And I buy a lot of them .
3 #### I bought these for gym class This was my first time buying and I was worried that I 'd get them in the wrong size or they would n't fit . As soon as they got in the mail I opened them and tried them on . They fit comfortably , just a little extra space , but I not enough to make a huge difference . The only thing I did n't like was that the left shoe had a blue mark of some sort on the top , front part of the shoe . Very noticeable . I 'm going to attempt to get it off before I break them in . I just hope that no one else has had this happen to them .
5 #### I had wanted to maintain muscle strength over the winter , but I was quite unsure about this product . Turned out far better than I had anticipated , as it was easy to vary the resistance by how much of the band was held between my feet . Inexpensive , and a fair number of exercises that can be done .
5 #### Merrell is the only shoes I would order on line - I know they will fit ! I have had 3 pairs of these , this is the 4th . My first two pairs I wore out , the third is on it 's last leg - so the reason for the 4th pair to be ordered . When the weather get cooler , I bring these out , wear them morning till bed time - love these shoes !
5 #### My Husband Love these . He is tall and these fit properly and do n't come untucked .
4 #### Very thin , but does provide an extra layer and comfortable under clothing .
5 #### Love the Timex . I had to take four links out . I did n't have the right tool to push the pins out so I used a darning needle which worked just fine . Make sure you follow the arrows inside the band or you wo n't have much luck . It has large numerals so if your sight is n't what use to be it is easy to read , even the date is readable which it is n't on some watches . It looks exactly like the picture but most of all it does n't pinch the skin like spandex bands do .
5 #### My husband and I have repurchased these jeans for him several times over the years on Amazon and elsewhere . He wore them as a student and part timer , at a first post college job , and now on weekends and holidays . They are durable wash well and it 's extra easy and convenient to buy them on Amazon . I do n't feel like the product has lessened in quality as many mass merchandise style clothing has over the last few years .
5 #### I own several pairs of Keen shoes especially love the sandals for summer time , so anytime I can find them on sale I try to get another pair in a different color . What I like best about a Keen shoe is that you do not have to break in these shoes . From the time you take them out of the box and wear them they are comfortable . I have always had a difficult time finding shoes that I think are comfortable , but these are the best ! When I was still working I would buy the Mary Janes in different colors because they were always so comfortable and I could wear them at work and not worry about having my feet hurt if I had a lot of walking to do that day .
5 #### I always order this brand and style . I prefer thie color , too ! I 'll order again next time ! The price was fair , too .
5 #### These wings are a cute addition to the Buzz Lightyear costume ( the wings appear a little larger in the photo ) . There is a strong plastic smell straight from the package , but it dissipates . I also inflated it to check for holes . Unfortunately , our three year old son refused to have anything to do with his costume , which is too bad because it 's really cute and fun !
2 #### I ordered a size 10 and was sent 10 1/2 . Even if they sent the right size it would have been too large . These shoes are sized differently than other shoes and it would have been nice to know when ordering .
5 #### Straight out of the box , these shoes are great ! Very lightweight and fits comfortably on my feet like a glove ! I love most especially that the sole is not bulky like my previous running shoes I hated those things lol ! I would give them a shot and they are great for the price !
5 #### These are without question my favorite brand of pantyhose . They support without strangling me .
5 #### Very comfortable . Wish they were made in the USA . Am now searching for USA brands . However , Carhartts are very good .
5 #### Have returned to Hanes after many years . Had been purchasing " store " brand , the quality of which has been on a steady decline . The quality was so poor that I actually threw away two pair and searched for Hanes . They are just as great as I remembered . I am once again a devoted Hanes customer . Thank you Hanes .
3 #### It 's very pretty , but a little tight which can be problematic with the seams in the cups .
1 #### Way too large , gave my daughter horrible blisters all over her feet . Not the size shipped as stated .
4 #### Besides the lack of arch support in these shoes , they are very good , however there is barely any arch support in any of the Lugz shoes that I 've worn .
2 #### I bought these for my Mother who is short with heavy thighs . The fit was a little small and she found that getting them over her thighs comfortably was difficult .
5 #### Love these ! Keeps you warm when you have to be outside in the winter . Wo n't leave home without them .
5 #### This gloves with very light weight for using form weather . Can not use when cold . Quality of material is very good .
4 #### I received the watch in a timely manner and I liked it . The face was very nice looking ; however , I have fairly large wrists and the expansion band pinched my wrist . It caused enough discomfort so that I decided to return the watch .
5 #### Good deal for tons of tennis balls . Got them for my dogs actually , even though they chew through them unsupervised .
5 #### This jacket is great . Perfect for snowblowing / plowing our driveway . It gets really cold in upstate NY & it keeps my husband very warm .
5 #### Ordered these pants for my husband , great price , style , fit ! they retail in the stores where we live for 90.00 + a pair . We will definitely be ordering more !
5 #### I used it this past weekend on a camping trip . It inflated / deflated 2 queen & 2 full sized air mattresses and did not lose power . It has a nice long lasting rechargeable battery .
4 #### would like to have a little wider , but fits ok
3 #### This was a gift for the wife she 's a Dallas Cowboy fan , and I 'm an ATLanta Falcon fan plus ! ! ! I 'm deep into the sports world as a fan , so I figure with buying all my teams items I would buy her a few items ... I recommend it to sports fans ... It is a nice gift to have , go FALCONS ! ! !
5 #### Fast shipping . Thank You ! ! I bought these for my son . I may buy a 2nd pair . He normally wears a size 14 but in these I bought a 13 and they fit fine . He loves them .
5 #### Very comfortable shoes . This is my second pair of this style of shoe because I loved them that much .
5 #### these are great and would recommend them to anyone . great for shooting and are really large . if you are thinking about get them
5 #### now that she is a bit older , i would have preferred she look at shoes with a little more support and cushioning especially around the ankle area but nooooooo , she insisted on Chucks again after not wearing them for 15 years aaaand , she loves them :)
5 #### Love these shoes . My feet have been weird since I was pregnant and my old shoes were uncomfortable . These are very comfy and help me get active . They are also stylish and go with anything .
2 #### You sit inside and the sides squeeze inward . For $ 16 it 's worth the cost , but prob not going to last very long and it 's a lot of trash for the landfill .
5 #### Exactly what I wanted for my son to match in family photos ! Cute and well made , runs large but that 's okay , he will grow into them !
5 #### I 've been eyeing some Shinola watches recently but did n't want to drop $ 600 so I bought this watch , combined it with a light tan leather band ( 20 mm Width Panerai Style Leather Watch Band from JP Leatherworks ) , and boom , it looks exactly like the $ 600 watch I 've been drooling over . I love the big look of the numbers and the fact that they are luminescent . I 've only had it a few weeks so ca n't comment on its longevity , but in terms of looks , this was perfect for me .
1 #### I am severally disappointed in these stockings , both pairs had runs within an hour of me wearing them . I 've had other stockings from this company with no problem but they were thicker rather than sheer ... wo n't buy again . So disappointed .
1 #### I had high hopes for this being nice fleece but it if looked and felt very cheap . I have a Turtle Fur hat that is great and I had looked at Turtle Fur neck warners at REI . The ones at REI are made from polyester and are much nicer . As soon as I opened this and felt the material , I knew I would n't be keeping it . I was buying it as a secondary / back up neck warmer for my trip to Antarctica . I 'm returning it and trying one from Tough Headwear . I already have a merino wool neck warmer but want a fleece one as well .
5 #### Purchased these for a home use table . The 48 " cues are smooth , straight and fit in smaller spaces . Perfect and inexpensive for home / game room use
4 #### Great prop to have during baseball games . Thin plastic makes up this light replica of a batting helmet featuring a gray plastic crater inside to contour to your head . I would n't take a ball to the head with this but would wear it to a party or a Giants game
5 #### Little big but cold , weather is coming and will need the room
5 #### Been warring them for years . They just done ware out that easy . I have two pair that are over 20 years old and still going strong . They are just faded out from being so old and all the pockets are great these days for your phone or what ever . I know that is not what they where made for but they do work great .I started warring these back in the early 70 's and still like them as much today comfortable and good fit .
5 #### Used the Elevators in building a deer blind . FANTASTIC ! ! Very strong and sturdy . Simple to attach -- just followed the excellent instructions that came with . I expect they will last many years to come . Thanx for a great product !
5 #### I love these shoes they are so comfortable and cute . I took everyone 's recommendations . I normally wear a 7.5 or 8 and ordered a 6.5 and they fit perfectly .
5 #### Be sure you do n't have a serious muscular or skeletal issue before trying to invert . This product is well made it does what it promises to do . Great for mid lower back decompression and improved circulation plus my abs are coming along great .
5 #### Got them for camping to be more comfortable . Kids slept like babies , and were much happier than with sleeping bags . They did n't lose air , but can be a witch to inflate . A cheap battery pump fixed that problem . Seem durable and had no problems . Not really lightweight so would not recommend for backpacking .
3 #### Love them . Then discovered that they ran on the first wearing .
5 #### This cooler does a good job of keeping ice and is big enough to hold just about everything we need for two night weekend trips . While the drain plug is in a functional location , it is not readily visible and could be left open by mistake . The long handle and big wheels make it a breeze to wheel into hotels and up to our room .
5 #### Large in the leg , but gets better after they are washed
4 #### Got this helmet for my wife . Now I 'm jealous because it looks cooler than mine ( Bell Solar ) . Removable visor is a nice feature . Bike snobs will probably sniff at the fact that you 're wearing a Schwinn instead of a Giro or Specialized , but who cares . You can have the last laugh with all the extra dough in your pocket .
1 #### It was not like the publication .... it did n't come whit accessories .. no car reader , no sd card , no mini hdmi cable , no replace battery and no cleanner ... i am very angry
5 #### I usually wear 8.5 - 9 , big kid seven fits with plenty of room for thick socks . I have pretty narrow feet , M works pretty well on my feet . I am excited to wear my new timberlands ! ! !
5 #### I had to return first one for a smaller size , which seems to fit quite good .
4 #### work well . some packets work well , others not so much
5 #### Nicely packaged and clearly marked . Good item for the survival kit . I plan on buying extras for backpacking and the keeping in my truck . A must for hunters .
4 #### Purchased the shoes to provide better support in a slip - on shoe to support an injured foot . I needed one that had higher sides and heel than the slip - on I was wearing so that I could use my orthotics in the shoe . These seem to be working fine . I had to remove the insole that came with the shoes so that I could put in my prescription orthotics .
5 #### Very durable and comfortable . Wear them anywhere . I got them for my trip to the Phillipines . They look as great as they wear .
4 #### nice shirt , well built , comfortable and most of all cool
5 #### Great little packet of water purification . This actually has room for a fire starter , knife sharpener and a few other ' necessities '
5 #### My husband has a really hard time finding shoes that work with his feet . These shoes are very comfortable , and well made . His first pair is well over a year old . He still wears them and loves them . I have bought him 2 pair since , I m afraid they will be discontinued . He figures with the 2 new pair , he is set for at least 6 years .
5 #### It was exactly what I was looking for , at the right price and the item got here much faster than predicted .
3 #### great for light floating but if you are going to maneuver much get a solid paddle as the yellow fin on these will bend under pressure .
2 #### You ca n't do any kind of detailed work on your aquarium with these , these are like construction work gloves . Poorly designed product .
5 #### These jeans fit great ! I like the look and the feel . Could n't ask for more !
3 #### These are fine but I prefer the Chuck Taylor ' 70 's as they offer support and are better made
5 #### This works so we 'll to keep my jet ski in place at the dock . Perfect size , lasts well if soaking in the water . Quite pleased with the quality and ease of use . Would definitely recommend this .
5 #### Excellent scope . Used on an AR15 build , bore sighted using a chambered laser unit and to the range . 4 rounds zeroed at 25 , and 3 rounds to zero at 50 yards . The parallax adjuster was useful even at the shorter distances . Time will tell how durable it is , but the start is outstanding . I considered some other newbies because they had more bells and whistles , but am glad that I resisted temptation .
5 #### My children loved these hats . fit is great and good product
5 #### So excited to get these shoes after looking at them and trying them on in a retail store ! Knowing I saved half off the retail price made them even better . They feel great and ca n't wait to try them out on a walk !
2 #### This scope felt nice and looked cool and everything , and IS VERY CLEAR when looking through it .. the buttons / dials were all nice , seemed like a good buy , however i experienced the same problem as other reviewers with something coming loose during firing .. returned for refund .. you may get a good one you may not . but with amazon 's easy returns you can take a chance on it . Its such a nice scope , but not shock proof ? thanks amazon ..
5 #### Works as advertised . Easy to light , good heat output , economical to use . Flame burns 12 minutes , enough time to boil water or heat a small meal . Ideal for individual backpackers or to start a fire in wet weather situations .
5 #### These are my second pair of Keen sandals , and I love them . I wore them new on vacation and they were comfortable and held up to Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon .
5 #### We ordered these for my nine year old daughter who is playing girls softball . She is doing sliding now and we wanted to avoid bruises if possible . These shorts are made for boys but worked very well for her . They are comfortable and invisible under her uniform . She wears them in every game , and when she grows I 'll order another pair just like these .
5 #### We always lose electricity several times a year . These warm up hands fast and last a good while .
5 #### What can you say about it , it 's a Delorme Atlas !
5 #### I bought thest delivery . stove , and these are extra fuel for it . Great for emergencies . F
5 #### Heavier denum than what I normally buy . They should last .
5 #### Amateur bird watcher ca nt get enough of them . Highly recommended for kids that need more than a toy and less than a $ 200 setup .
5 #### Works great on places that need lube but not oil as on my Remington 1100 gas system .
5 #### Nice easy use leak proof container - NO rolling around ! Clear to see level of fill and type of contents !
4 #### They 've worn and washed well so far - we 'll see how long they last
5 #### I have always liked Uncle Mike 's products and this one is a winner . I put this on my 243 in minutes and it does the job . Great sling swivel .
5 #### Love it ! ! ! ! Great for everyday wear .. casual and elegant .. not heavy on the wrist .. great design .. simple and effective .. buying some more for xmas gifts ! ! ! ! !
2 #### It 's great if your in the habit of buying a new watch every three months . It falls apart and breaks way too easily .
5 #### Works great . Had to dremel a bit off to get it to a perfect fit on a sporterized springfield 1903 stock and drill a hole for the buttstock screw to fit properly . I knew that when purchasing though . Hard to find something that would have fit out of the package . Very happy with this pad , really reduces the felt recoil .
4 #### These are the first pair I have purchased , but I like them so far and have only heard good things . .
5 #### These were awesome . Great control top . I danced all night at a wedding and even walked without my shoes to the car . No snags or anything . LOVE
1 #### Do n't buy these . Not good product , sizing chart wrong . Awful customer service from company .
5 #### This frisbee is the best ever . It flies great and is easy to catch for beginners and children . My granddaughters can use this one and have trouble with other types .
5 #### Really good shoes this white color can get dirty so take care of them
5 #### I ordered the timex easy reader for my 85 year old dad . It is easy to read , a perfect size for his wrist ( not too bulky ) and was an excellent bargain at just about half the cost of retail at the closest large " discount " department store . My dad has trouble putting on a buckle type band- I searched several drugstores for a wristwatch with an expansion band , but no store had any in stock . I checked amazon.com , they had the timex easy reader in stock , and it was shipped out to me the next day . My dad is very happy with this wristwatch .
4 #### What can I say , this is just the latest Coleman stove I 've owned and they all work great .
4 #### I am a bit disappointed in the restyle of the ameribag . I find that the Small is too big and the Extra Small is a bit too small . I ordered the small at first and compared to my classic Ameribag that is a Medium and it was almost the same size . I returned it for this Extra Small . Unfortunately there is a big difference between the Small and Extra Small . I was hoping for something a little larger ...
5 #### this is the third pair of jungle mods that I 've bought my husband . they are comfy , fit true to size and are good lookin ' .
4 #### The jeans were a gift for my husband . It is often difficult to find big men 's clothing , but this pair was the correct size , they were a very nice denim blue color . My husband loves them and wears them everyday .
5 #### Chuck Taylors are some of the most comfortable shoes on the market . A friend of mine called them " outdoor slippers , " and I tend to agree . The shoes will last quite awhile if you 're not 11 years old and using them to brake your gokart careening down the hill or using them to swim in the ocean off Kodiak Island . Both things I have done . I 'm an old guy now , but I still like the shoes . I do wear dress shoes most days at work . And they 're fine , but I shoot a lot of sports for my weekly newspaper . And Chuck Taylor 's picks are better for the field or gym as I stand there with a long lens trying to capture the action of volleyball , football , basketball or baseball . Definitely a good choice .
5 #### I use this sled for bringing fire wood up to the house . It can carry more wood then I care to pull through the snow , for me it 's at least 2.5 days worth of wood for my stove which burns 24 hrs a day . The sled is very sturdy plus the pull rope is longer then I needed . I needed a large drain pan to capture coolant from a car I was working on since it had no drain valve on the radiator and this sled came in very handy , coolant usually ends up going everywhere but , where your drain pan is , well not this time . I am sure I will find plenty of other uses , as for right now I could not be any more happier with it .
5 #### I bought these for my wife who has a need for white nylons that will hold up . She finds these to be perfect for her needs and probably better than expected since they are better than any others she 's been able to find .
5 #### I have had several pairs of these shoes and continue to buy the same kind when I wear out the previous ones . They have a reliable fit and are my " go to " shoes for casual cool weather wear .
5 #### hard to keep kids off it . rides great and is durable
2 #### Very cheap feeling and ill shaped . I thought I 'd try something less expensive while pregnant knowing I wo n't need that size forever but I just could n't get past the scratching cheap fabric and poor construction .
5 #### 100 % PURE COTTON classic BLACK granny panties ..... and in a 3 pack no less ! ! ! Perfect fit . soft/ sturdy / comfy . I did n't have to buy 5 other wacky colors to get one pair in black ! I feel like I found the holy grail .. YAY ! I will order a lifetime supply asap ! ! ! ! !
4 #### cool knife and sharp . just the right size as well .
5 #### Despite some of the reviews ... these pants fit perfectly . I have been a 35 inch waist for about the last 30 years and this size is hard to find in stores . These jeans are well made , heavy duty and a perfect fit ... very comfortable .
5 #### light , sharp , easy to focus perfect magnification for me off roading
5 #### Received in a timely manner . Very happy with product . My son is years old & 140 lbs & these fit just fine !
5 #### I have always had trouble finding shoes because of my small feet . I can never find shoes that one fit my feet right and two do n't look like children 's shoes . So when i found theses shoes that actually have my size it was like it was my birthday ! Size : They have a huge range of shoe sizes and they even sell half sizes . which made it much easier for me to find a pair that not only fit length wise but width wise . Durability : I have had these shoes for about three years and they still look brand new . I have never had to replace the shoe laces , the only thing i have to do is wash but that is only because they are white.the dirt comes off easily from the shoe . Color / style : I love that they have so many different colors and designs . I chose the white because it goes with just about everything . Prize : i think the prize for these shoes is reasonable because they are so well made and last a long time . Comfort : i have walked around all day in these shoes and they have never hurt my feet once . I wore them just recently on a trip to Mexico and my feet never hurt . Over all i think these are a good shoe to invest and one of my favorite pairs on shoes .
5 #### I ca n't get over how far it goes ! No issues thus far and it works properly . Kids are not too interested in it but the oldest is 6 so I am a little ahead of the curve !
4 #### Works as stated . However , you do need to place rubber innertube or something between the clamps and the bar as stated in other reviews
5 #### Perfict fit for me . Great looking shoes at a great price .
5 #### They look great on my husband . Good basic style for guys that have trouble " matching " clothes . Fool proof .... so far .
1 #### If I had thin walls and narrow moldings , I probably could have used this as intended . Unfortunately , it does not work with my 6 " door moldings so is only useful on the ground . I would n't buy it again ; it was a waste of money for me .
3 #### I did not like these as they where a tad big and my heals slipped . I only buy Merrell shoes but this is my first pair without laces and I just did not like it .
5 #### These shoes are so comfortable ! I will definitely buy more of them .
3 #### Really nice looking shoe . I would have given a 5 star but - I normally wear a 10 M but the reviews seemed to consistently say that you should order a 1/2 size larger that you normally wear so I ordered a 10.5 . They were way too big ( taking the elastic in as much as I could was n't much help either ) . They did n't hit my arch in the right place to be able to wear them comfortably . I 'm not giving up though . I 'll try a 10 M next . Hopefully they will fit better . I 'll re - review afterwards . Re - review * * * I was happy to see that the price had gone done considerably . I got the 10 M and was looking forward to having a better fit . They were still a little big . I really liked the toe space . The arch support is another story though . The 10 M still hit my arch in the wrong place too . There 's no way I could wear them comfortably . I wish it were otherwise because everyone I 've talked to who has them absolutely love and live in theirs . Back to shopping for a different fit sandal for me .
3 #### It 's a lot bigger than I wanted and the lid does n't slide freely . The top is n't insulated . Not sure about it yet ...
5 #### I am so happy with this punching bag as it gives me excercise and a sturdy platform . I used Water and it works perfectly . You can adjust this Training Bag to a different height . Benefits : Adjustment to a different height , sturdiness ( does NOT topple over , no matter how hard you hit it ) and it is good for all body Training . Thank you
4 #### Just wish it was a little bigger but other than that its great !
1 #### Way too large , even though I followed the sizing guidelines . I had to give them away . They looked fine but I felt like a clown , with the largeness .
5 #### I purchased this mat , along with the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Manduka - BlackMatPRO-85 - Inch - Yoga - and - Pilates - Mat / dp / B000BK95K0 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Manduka BlackMatPRO 85 - Inch Yoga and Pilates Mat</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Manduka - Large - Mat - Sak / dp / B000VW4VWA / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Manduka Large Mat Sak</a>&nbsp;for our at - home yoga practice , and to use with other fitness workouts , like P90X. The mats are very sturdy , and a little slick as other reviewers have pointed out . My suggestion is to lay them flat and let them breathe for a couple of days , and to spray them with&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Manduka - Mat - Renew - Yoga - Mat - Spray / dp / B003170FMW / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Manduka " Mat Renew " Yoga Mat Spray</a>&nbsp;in Energizing Gingergrass . This will help to remove the slick on the mat , and freshen it up . I should also point out that I have a very active dog who loves to join us while we work out , whether we are doing plyometrics or yoga . It is very much a requirement in our household that the mat be able to withstand her activity [ and her claws ] . These mats do the trick , where other yoga mats have sorely failed . You wo n't be disappointed , especially if you live in a full , active household .
3 #### This rides up on me , no matter how much I adjust the strap . I now just use it when weightlifting , not for running as I wanted .
2 #### Love the color and compartments but the coin clasps do not hold at all . I 'm going to have to find the packing slip to return it . So sad , the style is just what I like .
4 #### It 's great ! I was hoping my son will be able to wear this for a couple years , but it fits him just right right now , do n't think it 'll fit next year . He 's two and I bought the Toddler 2 - 4 size .
4 #### Excellent mat . I put this on hard , naked concrete in my garage for sit ups several times a week and I 'm not sore or stiff from that at all . Mat is durable and thick - can be doubled over well with still plenty of room for a single person to do sit ups if you want twice the padding . Only 1 star off because of packaging - came punctured and had punctured the mat itself also - resolution was easy and fast through amazon .
5 #### Love the weight and quality of this brand . My husband lost a lot of weight and we are in the process of gradually replacing his wardrobe . These are well made and look good .
5 #### Purchased this to use as part of a physical therapy treatment for my tennis elbow . It has taken me about 8 weeks to get so that I can play again , but I think that this has been a big contributor to the therapy . Also , there are so many other ways to use the flexbar , that it really is almost like having a little mini travel gym . Nowadays , I drop it in my suitcase whenever I travel .
5 #### If you use this trigger wheel you wo n't be disappointed . You might find sore areas you did n't know you had . I bought it for my instep but when I was playing with it on my neck I realized I needed it there too . After a few days my foot and neck felt fabulous ! I should say Amazon is great too ! Never had a problem they have n't helped me solve .
3 #### Runs small . If your child wears a kid size 4 , it should fit okay , but if not if size 5 or more . The ear hat is pretty worthless too . The ears do not stand up and also is TOO SMALL ! The hat does n't even fit on our Labrador .
4 #### Got these recently at a great price . Came in a mesh bag for storage . They do n't have a ton of gel material in them , but padded enough for protection . My five year old son loves them . They are large for him , but the velcro straps can be tightened well enough that they are usable for him with lots of room to grow .
4 #### Quality is as expected from carhartt brands . Only issue here is even the size small is ridiculously large !
5 #### Columbia 's shirts always tend to be a bit larger than average . I normally wear a medium ( sometimes large ) t - shirt , but after reading the reviews I got this one in a small and it 's perfect . I wear it as an overshirt to prevent the dreaded " farmer tan . " ( I have serious respect for agricultural workers and I 'm sorry you get associated that sort of sun tan ) . I digress . This shirt is well ventilated , lightweight , well - constructed , and very attractive . I always get compliments on this shirt . I got the navy blue one , and if it was n't so expensive I 'd pick up a few more in other colors .
5 #### i keep my bracelets and watches and a couple earring sets , does a perfect job - a big plus is that it 's also stackable
5 #### very nice compass - just what i was looking for ! ... and you can set the magnetic declination for whatever area you 're in ! ...
2 #### Unfortunately they were too big and I have no way to return them . Downfall of ordering online
4 #### The lines do n't really show up unless there is a bright light on them . But other than that they are perfect . They are very true to size and are comfortable the first time you put them on .
5 #### Bought these for my daughter who loves converse shoes . They are exactly what she wanted and she wears them every day !
4 #### A little flimsy but for the price you ca n't complain .
3 #### I can maybe make a few hoots , but i can not get it to do the complete call
5 #### These were given to a children at a party and they really tore into them , It was SO much fun watching them play with them . I would definitely suggest these .
4 #### I keep these at work where it seems the office is always cold . I use them on airplanes , I use them for tennis . Sometimes just holding something warm really does work .
5 #### This jewelry organizer works very well for me . I have a lot of earrings and now I can see them all at once and also keep them out of sight in a drawer . The dark blue velvet - like material makes it easy to see everything .
5 #### Converse is a very good brand . It just fit as I expected . This shoes are very comfortable and I reccomended to another customers . Thanks
5 #### Fits beautifully - I would like to have same in navy and tan but can not find , even at Danskin . Too bad ! I have had dozens of compliments on these shorts , and I feel so well dressed in them . Only navy I can find have front zipper , which is not flattering .
5 #### Very comfortable and durable . Just bought 2 more pairs . If you 're looking for something very sheer though you should not get these . They are pretty dense for pantyhose .
4 #### I have two girls , a 7 year old and a 9 year old . The pads fit my daughters fairly well , but I can not vouch for their protectiveness . I hate to leave a review like this , but my girls just have not had enough accidents on their scooters to properly evaluate the effectiveness of these pads . They do n't wear them when they are on their bikes , only when they use their motorized scooters . I am only giving them 4 stars because they do n't fit my 7 year old daughter as well as my 9 year old .
5 #### I used it this week with a buffer . The product spread on nicely with a rag , and even buffed in easily by hand in areas where a buffer would n't work .
4 #### I 've had a black pair of converse for 5 years and it was time to get new ones . The blue ones really caught my eye and I had to get them . I think once I break them it I will love them ! But as for right now they are very stiff . Overall they fit as expected and I really love the color
5 #### Super warm , very soft and great for snowboarding in extreme cold . I find myself wearing it on cold days even when I 'm not on the mountain . Beats a scarf for warmth easily . Scarves ca n't even compete ! I 'm 6'2 " and 185lbs and this fits wonderfully !
5 #### My husband loved it ! ! ! ! I got 2 of them ! The fit uglystick to a tee ! ! ! !
5 #### I needed an inexpensive , but accurate , watch to wear to work ( where it will take a lot of abuse ) . This has turned out to be a very good choice . It has kept perfect time , and has tolerated my work environment very well . The hard rubber - type material the case and band are made from , are very resilient , and take mild to moderate bumps well .
1 #### Only gave this item 1 star rating because of bait and switch . I was excited when it came in but when I got it , I noticed something was wrong . Either way , I went ahead and just attached the towel on my golf bag ... Long story short , picture on Amazon was not right . No mascot on the towel . Was going to get it replaced but it did n't have that option . Only refund . Other than that , towel was great quality and embroidered . Golf balls had he mighty D with the mascot on it ... Does n't have a brand type . And normal wooden tees .
5 #### Good deal . Not a problem yet . Do n't wear it at work . Keeps good time . Everyone that sees it loves it .
5 #### The watch is easy to read , And the band is long enough for a big guy . The night light is a plus for the theater .
5 #### Keeps Time accurately . Everything as described . Package a bit beat up , but did not affect the watch . Had a similar Timex with blue dial , however the light quit working so thought I would try the white dial . Think I prefer the blue dial , however I am happy with this one .
5 #### They are quality converse for less than the converse website provides !
5 #### Both elbows were sore ( on outer and inner side to varying degrees ) from golf , racquetball and baseball . Have been using the Thera - Band ( Red ) for about 4 weeks and most of the pain is gone . Go to youtube ( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we4UoiKG3Co ) and watch video by Jamie Dreyer for best explanation on how to use the Thera - Band FlexBar . The red bar is all you need to heal your elbow pain . Works Great for Sore Elbow .
5 #### I currently use these bands for my P90x ! Pros : You can use multiple bands as they clip onto the grip . Included ankle strap Included door strap ( for pull ups / etc ) * * this saved me from having to put a hook into the stud of my wall Comes with a nice carry bag Cons : They do n't tell you that you could also get a FREE ORANGE BAND ! ! ! with FREE SHIPPING ! lol ... I called them up because there was a little paper inside and he said just leave your feedback , anonymous or not " we do n't check it " and call us back , we would be glad to send you an orange band free of shipping . We do this for about 10 % of our kits . Why complain ? Right ? ... Keep up the good work ! -Mike Reed Dallas , TX
1 #### I ordered 8 ladies , sent me 8 men 's . A bit disappointed . Love the shoe , converse are so comfortable . I have never had issues before
2 #### Has a weird shape , it kind of cones in front . Feels alright but even my husband says it looks funny .
4 #### I love these and if I could would wear them everyday . Easy on and up ! My favorite color , utopia is not always available inn my size though and the shipping time is ridiculous ! ! !
1 #### Amount of wool shows 68 % not the advertised 74 % . Contacted customer service and was told the amount of wool varies depending on time of year . One star since false advertising .
4 #### A little tight for my big feet but still a good product
5 #### Love these multi functional bands great asset to our gym . Thanks
4 #### i am a 5 foot , 100 lbs female , and this fit me pretty snugly . The material is soft , and did not irritate my skin . however it is quite thick , so you may easily find yourself sweating .
5 #### My son said he kept looking at his feet all day because he loved wearing his new shoes so much !
4 #### I liked this bra . It covers well and blends with my skin color . Meaning it 's not at all see through and my breasts do n't peek out at the top . So it 's an excellent choice for teeshirts or see through tops . The seam on the side kind of digs in a bit and I 'm thinking / hoping that will improve after wearing a few times because otherwise it 's a great bra .
5 #### Very good , I use them for a variety of cold weather outdoors projects , hold up well and keep me warm and dry
5 #### Very comfortable and easy to nurse in ! I ordered this after buying 3 of these tops for pregnancy / nursing and they are some of my favorites ! The fabric is very soft and the colors are pretty . Only small negative is that it is a lot of fabric and can be warm on very hot days . However , it can be difficult to find dresses that are easy to nurse in , so this is a great item to have in the wardrobe !
4 #### Surprisingly , they do fit -- but I did n't realize that they were elasticized -- I washed them before I wore them & was shocked to see these little bitty panties -- very soft & silky feeling . However , they stretch to fit just fine . I 'm having to get used to them .
4 #### Numbers that represent minutes before / after the hour could be larger .
5 #### The ear compartment is sizable enough that it should fit anyone , the padding is comfortable , and the straps are adjustable enough to accommodate anyone , no complaints !
5 #### Merrill 's have been a great product for my son for 12 years . Very comfortable for me as well .
5 #### I have n't had an accidental misfire with this - once it 's closed it 's in place . The trigger is very light which helps avoid any jerking / flinching . It holds on to my hand very easily . The only issue is that you have to put it on before you start and keep it on until you 're finished because the Velcro does make noise but it keeps it on your wrist . Very durable , and no issues .
5 #### This is the second of these I 've bought . I had one before and gave it to a friend . I like that the ends and the bands are interchangeable and that you can easily combine multiple bands on the same end to get different resistance levels . I was originally going to buy a pull - up assist band , but realized that I can use this for that purpose but also get all the other benefits of multiple bands for general exercising !
5 #### I live in Arizona where sandals are worn all year long . In fact , when it rains in Arizona , we go OUTSIDE to enjoy it ! These shoes are perfect for our weather . My feet stay cool during REALLY hot weather , do not sweat , and if I have to walk through a puddle , these shoes can take it . I ride my bicycle in them , walk , hike , etc . My other pair is a more enclosed style , and they work very well during our winter months , too ! I would rather go barefoot all the time so finding really comfortable shoes are a must for me . Keen 's are the most comfortable shoes I 've ever worn ... almost like I 'm going barefoot . They do run a little wider than most shoes . But you must make sure you have the correct size . I purchased a different style of Keen 's locally and found that I had to order a half size larger for them to fit properly . They are made very well , so they should last quite awhile . I have every intention of purchasing another pair ( or 2 ) in the future !
4 #### I got this for my son for lifting . We bought a size smaller than his usual shoe size , the fit was great and they were exactly what he wanted .
5 #### Coped a pair for my little boy since I already had a pair and they 're good , straight scuff proof ; wish all sneakers and boots were like that or similar .
5 #### Will keep ordering these if the sizing and quality stays the same . It has for many years , so far .
5 #### The shoes arrived promptly and were as described . My daughter loves them and even wore them on a trip to Germany !
5 #### Use these to tie up our pontoon boat . Easy to use and quick .
3 #### I have bought Bali bras before and have not had problems with them . Had under wire bras quite a few times and did n't have problem with them either . Have worn 1 twice and I was at work and I had to cut out the under wire is was so uncomfortable . I will be returning the other 3 that I bought . If I was smaller they probably would be alright , but being on the heavier side when I sit down there is not enough padding on the bottom of the bra to protect the mid - section .
3 #### It definately holds your cigar , but use it to many times and even the best cigars come unrolled .
5 #### Loved it ! Fit perfectly and the red line around the back makes it look even stylist !
5 #### Really nice top . I like that it 's a more contemporary , flattering design than a lot of other pregnancy tops that look more like moo - moos ! Hidden access for nursing is perfect . The rayon material is slightly heavier than expected . I might be too hot in it over the Summer , but it should be perfect for Spring or Fall .
5 #### My go - to men 's Indiglo watch when I 'm wearing silver jewelry . Not too big , not too small , elegant black face and easy to read white numerals . I 've bought watches over the years in Target , but these days they have too few to choose from . I dropped and broke my last one like this ( a first - they 're usually quite durable ) and no one seemed to carry it in the store to look at and try on . I was glad to find it here , and to note that Amazon 's price came in about $ 5 less than the online version at Target .
5 #### I had already tried this shirt on at the store , but they did not offer many colors in the tall size . I 'm glad I had tried them on because I usually wear an xx - large , but these x - large tall fit perfectly .
5 #### My son has been zooming around on this since he was just shy of 2 yrs old . He could n't pedal at first , so he just scooted himself around at first , so it 's nice that it 's not too big . Now that he is strong enough to pedal , he goes everywhere , quickly ! Yes , he has tipped over when he 's tried to get around a corner too quickly , but that would happen on anything .. it 's not a flaw with this bike . It 's constructed very well , and he loves putting his collection of stuff in the yellow basket in the back . It 's still in great shape after 2 yrs of use . The down side is that the handlebars and seat are not adjustable , but for the price , it 's perfect . He 'll get a bigger one and we 'll pass this one on to his younger brother . Great bike ! !
5 #### Good qualify but it 's very rough grip surface , will get use to it eventually !
3 #### This is a cute costume but it is front heavy as all of the designs and extra fabric ( since it 's 3D ) are all in front . If the child is short , then there is a possibility of tripping . The hat is very thin unlike the costume .
5 #### I broke my Rebel Bumble Bee after a year of fishing and ordered the hornet , they both fish all day ! bass love them and sun fish . I have many lures but this seem to be the go to for me . I did add a larger treble hook on the rear of my bumble bee because I was missing some hook sets , but have had good luck on the hornet so not sure I 'll put one on it .
5 #### I love this flexbar . I have been suffering off and on with golfers elbow symptoms for a couple years . I have tried lots of different things . The only thing that previously worked is laying off the pull ups , curls , and other pulling muscle activities , I did not like that option though so I eventually saw videos for this and decided to give it a try . After a couple weeks using it daily I noticed improvements , then a couple weeks later even more improvements . I am 99 % pain free after a month without taking any time off training . I still continue to use it daily to be safe , but I keep it in my car and use it in there at red lights on my daily commute so it is very convenient . Thank you Flexbar !
5 #### This bra was an excellent buy ! I will come to Amazon next time that I need to purchase a Bali bra .
5 #### How exactly does someone lose the key to a treadmill when it never moves ? No idea , but it happened . This matches the original perfectly and everything works like it 's suppose to .
5 #### I work outside by the water and this shoe is great . Waterproof , I just rinse with fresh water and great support . I love the hard toe box , no stubbing your toes . Well work the money .
5 #### Its a great watch for the price I love the large numbers on the face and the expansion band is vey comfortable
5 #### It works as expected . This is my first helmet . Used to not wear any . It is comforable .
5 #### This products is excellent , i recomend . , its very confortable . The expansion of brazalet is the most important accesorie o the wacth and so nice .
5 #### Love these easy slip on and off Converse ! I want a pair in every color now !
1 #### Bought 2 of these . The first had a hole in it and wo n't hold any air . The second , had a small seem separation and would slowly leak . You get what you pay for .
5 #### Shoot - n - c is the way to go for target or practice shooting . Easy to use on any surface and allows fast shot location to see where your aim and impact vary without needing to retrieve your target . I take them to the range every single time .
5 #### Great shirt for casual wear or fishing / camping . Typically well - designed and finely manufactured Columbia product . I normally wear a XXL , but the over - sized design of this fishing shirt makes the XXL too large in the body and the XL works for me .
5 #### I had tennis elbow for months and nothing seemed to help . I bought the yellow and red ones of these after watching a youtube video . I was desperate . I had very low expectations for these but was willing to try anything . The first try even with the easier yellow one hurt , but immediately , I felt a little different . By the end of the first week , the pain was almost gone ! By the end of two weeks - totally pain free . If you have tennis elbow , buy these now ! I have NOT been compensated in any way for this review . This is the real deal .
5 #### Amazon ran a sale on these and I crabbed on as a " what the heck ... " . Picked up two bottles of propane and threw the whole mess in the closet . With the last snow storm , we lost power for 4 days . This stove was a life saver for breakfast . We had a generator to run the 110 stuff , but not the stove , so this was a blessing . Adjustment knobs can be fincky - either on full blast or off . Also , a spark ignitor would have been nice ( has to be lit with matches ) . That said , it boiled water quickly and was able to cook eggs .
5 #### I use this for a G26 . I have a muscular calf , so it really wo n't stay up without the calf strap . The Ankle Glove itself is neoprene with a sheepskin liner behind the leather holster . Retention snap is positive . Needless to say , you ca n't use it with skinny jeans . Once it 's broken in it 's quite comfortable and you almost forget it 's there .
5 #### I like numbers because they are easier for me to see and that is so true for this watch plus the shape and style are quite nice . My watches take a beating but I know this one can handle it .
5 #### Great for bug out bags and camping bags and emergency situations where you would need it . You ca nt go wrong with it , great price and great peace of mind . Remember you ca nt order it when you will need it the most . Order it now and be prepared !
5 #### Perfect for my application , Thompson contender chambered in 30 - 30 . Only fired 20 rounds so time will tell .
5 #### I really like this wallet , plenty of room for all types of cards . Feels pretty stiff now but sure it will soften up with regular use .
5 #### I used to only wear Chucks back when I was in bands in my 20 's and as I got older I thought I should " grow up " and where adult shoes . After a couple of back surgeries that have left me with limited feeling in my left leg , I have been endlessly searching for " optimum arch support " and everything else you think you need to help your posture and back when you 're older ( I 'm 49 now ) . I recently thought " screw it " and went back to Chuck 's because they 're basically thick socks . These shoes are awesome ! Fit just right and because I 'm a graphic / web designer I do n't get ridiculed for wearing them . It 's not like I 'm a CEO and taking a meeting with the GE bigwigs wearing silly " clown " shoes . Then again I 'm not stomping around on stage playing punk rock anymore ( which probably screwed my back in the first place ) but still a great casual shoe . Probably should n't wear them to the upcoming funeral , though . :-)
1 #### Pantyhose are not made like they used to be , these had a run in them on the first wear !
5 #### Love the shoe quality and price but was a tad to big
4 #### Great little knife with useful attachments as are all swiss army knives . I had n't seen it in person and was surprised how thick it is . I think its great , but it has n't made it to my keychain for that very reason .
5 #### I 've had these shoes before and I loved them . The only thing is I remove the insole because for me , the shoe is more comfortable without it .
5 #### Remember please that too much warmth is not good . If you are going to zip it all the way up it only needs to be rated for 20 degrees below the outdoor temp you will be in . The price is right on this one . Quality is very good . Zipper is exceptional .
5 #### Much better put together than what I have gotten from other brands over the last 10 years . I will only buy Carhartt Pocket tees from now on .
3 #### The watch is beautiful . I love the face and thinness of Skagen watches . I purchased this watch after having bought another Skagen watch with a cool face , that I could n't read after dusk . The thin hands became invisible against the black face of the watch in a darkened room . I also have trouble reading the face of this watch after dusk , but that 's minor compared the problems I have had with the metal strap that comes with the watch . It took me most of an evening trying to figure out how to make the clasp work . After nearly an hour of reading the instructions in the tiny brochure ; I searched the Internet and eventually came across a site that helped me understand what I was doing wrong . So , now I am able to wear the watch , and I 've received compliments about the watch , but I do have to pay attention to it , as I 've had the strap come apart while on my wrist and dropped off my wrist onto the ground . I 've been fortunate enough to have had people spot the event and hand me back my watch . This said , I do n't believe I 'd buy another Skagen watch with this metal clasp . Skagen watches are cool , but the metal clasp on their metal bands could stand to be re - engineered .
1 #### First and foremost , this piece of crap is not satin . It 's a cheap poly / nylon mesh that 's entirely see - through , and it is nowhere near the size indicated in the photos . It 's a good thing my costume got changed , because one of the key pieces -- a witch 's hat -- would have been missing . It 's a child - size piece of costuming , and it was absolutely not worth what I paid for it , even with my Prime discounts . I could have gotten a better piece at the local s***ty Halloween seasonal stores , probably for half the price . Do not buy -- it 's not even worth the return shipping on it , and it 'll probably get given out at my Halloween event to a kid as a cheap prize .
4 #### Yes a bit pricey for the small amount of steel used to make this lock . But if your not handy this is the way to go . But I will say the rack I have is the roadway and I am happy with it 's construction . If it cost me another $ 40 bucks so be it . The trick is to make it less easy for the thief to get to your expensive rack and bikes so I say ... A bit hi but what is piece of mind worth .
5 #### Works as advertised . Great thing about it is all the weight is supported by the wheels unlike others where you drag them along even with wheels .
5 #### Works great for my 5 yr old daughter . Very well built .
5 #### Love the price ! My son will love this for Christmas !
5 #### After owning many cheap pairs $ 20 binoculars over the years I was looking for something a little better that was n't going to set me back $ 200 . I found these while researching and was impressed by the excellent reviews so I gave it a shot . I could not be more pleased . The clarity and build quality is superb considering they are only about $ 10 more than the inferior stuff I have owned over the years .
5 #### This shirt is light weight and comfortable . It a very shapely shirt . I love the color . I 'd recommend it to everyone .
3 #### Really a pain to use . Not stable at all , and the water makes the unit shift . Valve does n't work very well , either . I suggest a rigid tank for dispensing and using this only for extra water to be poured into the rigid tank .
5 #### I ordered these last week and with Amazon Prime got it the next day ! I 've only worn them a few times so far but must say they are extremely comfortable . I like the look and impressed with the amount of color choices that Keen offers . Nice sandal for women on the go who want something with support and comfort . Would highly recommend .
5 #### I ordered mine in " Do n't lose me ! " blue . It 's a great sidekick for EDC . Deploying the blade via the AXIS lock is a joy . A flick of the wrist brings out the blade with a satisfying " snick " . More traditional opening with the thumb stud is also smooth with a nice amount of resistance . The 154CM steel should be very good at edge holding . The word on the street is that 154CM is similar to 440C , but increases hardness at a slight reduction to corrosion resistance . Pros : Frighteningly sharp out of the box . Feels very solid . AXIS locking system . Cons : Frighteningly sharp out of the box . Be careful if you chose to flip it closed . I did a slow speed test flip with my finger in the way and got a nice , clean slice that drew blood . Full speed flip with a fingertip in the way could do some damage .
4 #### Great overall classic look and cool shoe . On the fourth of July though I sprained my ankle very badly in these shoes running through a backyard ( might have been just a little intoxicated ) but , ever since that day I blame it on the shoes that F * * * my ankle that night . LOL , For the Veterans !
5 #### I have purchased 4 different pairs of Convy 's from this company . Fast , accurate and dependable !
5 #### Great Tennis shoes , some of you made need additional arch support ... Very happy 8^ }
5 #### Have always loved Wrangler jeans . This one does n't disappoint ! Great fit , nice look , rugged , but soft . Bought two pair . I had spec'ed 2 day delivery , they showed up the next day .
3 #### I have been wearing Sperry Top Siders for years , and this is my 3rd pair of the Billfish style . All have been size 9W , one pair exactly like these that I just wore out over 2 years . I still have a pair in dark brown , and the new ones fit bigger then the others . In fact I tried them from another source first and returned them because they were too big . I have also tried size 9R and they are too tight . I 'm keeping these but have put an additional insole in them to take up space . I called Sperry and was told nothing has changed in the sizing , but something definitely has .
5 #### Nice little traditional cooler . Nothing fancy . Not heavy . Well constructed . Well packed . Happy w / purchase .
3 #### After several uses , I must say that this is good for the money but not great . While the high zoom capability is nice feature , you may be better off with less zoom and more clarity . At full zoom it is very hard to see your target .
5 #### Fit is a little large but my little boy will grow into them ! I bought them in multiple colors .
4 #### Only thing I would change is use a little glue on the tip and whatever they call the thing at back end of arrow where it connects to the bow string . The tips starting falling off after a few shots threw my neighbors windows and the thingamajig in the back falls off . They look like there just pressed on I did not see any kind of glue or adhesive to secure them more but I fixed that .
5 #### These are the only shorts that not only look great but last for years !
5 #### Love these and so does my boyfriend . He thinks they 're sexy Lol ( They are having you order women 's size and they switch out for the appropriate men 's size . )
5 #### Such a great solution to golfer 's elbow and tendonosis . Absolutely a life saver .
1 #### If you have an official Fox40 , and then use this , you will know it is a cheap knockoff . The sound is completely different , and nowhere near as powerful as a Fox40 . All of my kids are lifeguards , and have used Fox40s . My daughter saw this pink one , and asked for it , for this summer at work . She ended up using her " old " Fox40 because she could not blast a loud enough warning from this junk . Buyer beware . By the time I realized she was n't using this pink one , and she told me it was defective , it was too late to return it . She let me hear the difference between the two whistles , and trust me , there IS a difference .
1 #### Please have to be the worst thing I ever bought on Amazon . They tore as I put them on . Total waste of money . From now on I will buy them at the department store like I always do .
4 #### I must like these shoes , this is my fourth pair , and they 're all still in use . I discovered Merrell 's hiking shoes maybe 10 - 12 years ago , and always found them to be well made , durable and comfortable . The jungle mocs continue the tradition , and add the convenience of being a slip - on . This makes them my go - to shoes for a run out to the mailbox , for any activity that involves walking , yard work ( the oldest pair ) , etc . They are also good looking enough for business casual wear at the office , going well with khakis or jeans on casual Friday .
5 #### I upgraded from my old , cheap gaiam mat and have never looked back . I love this mat ! It is the perfect thickness , stickiness , and seems very durable ! It does , however , come with a special protective coating . I gently scrubbed it down with some course sea salt , which seemed to help , and it has done nothing but gotten better over time . It also comes with a lifetime warranty from manduka , which was an important factor to me when making this purchase !
5 #### I was using lawn mower pull rope befoe and just tied the ends around the limbs . This works SO MUCH BETTER and easier . I always have it and an extra string with me !
5 #### Very pleased that these run a pinch large . My son wears a size 16 in football cleats and basketball shoes , but I went ahead and ordered him the 15 's in this shoe and they fit perfect . SO glad -- I was very worried I would have to send them back . Very nice shoes -- will look great for days when he has to dress up and does n't want to wear his cowboy boots all day . Thanks !
3 #### Good stuff . A bit overpackaged ( I hate to add to landfills . ) But that allowed only nominal breakage , which is always a paintball paint issue with shipping .
5 #### Extraordinary clarity and ease of focus for the price . Used often in the field . They are lightweight and rugged and fit the hand well .
5 #### Nice shoes so far . They are comfortable and fit as expected . Ordered size I normally wear . I ca n't comment on longevity , but will update
5 #### I am perfectly happy with this purchase .... arrived sooner than expected and were exactly what I was looking for .
5 #### This watch fits my needs perfectly . It is comfortable and very easy to read , plus lights up in the dark . I am very pleased with it . I would recommend it to friends and family .
5 #### Love the color , they run a little large so consider buying a half size smaller .
5 #### This product is perfect for a little guy who wants to be a super hero . The description was right on . And the price was good .
5 #### I love these bands , they are versatile In the many different ways you can use them , great for upper arm strength as well as for your legs , made of good quality , I use them all the time and it shows .
5 #### You either know em or do n't and either hate em or love em ! They 're nice , basic , flat shoes that make you run faster and jump higher ! You got ta wear a few pairs to get to know they 're sizing ( I normally wear a twelve but I get these in 11 ) and if they 're too big they squeak when you walk . So they 're not the most ninja shoes unless you got a proper size going .
4 #### Very comfortable , but zero arch support . Not for long distance walking .
5 #### This product is an excellent value for the price . I bought two of them and would absolutely buy them again . Make sure you buy some sand to fill the base .
5 #### My children have very large heads that are hard to fit a helmet to . This one works great for my 5 year old . The shape reminds me of the heads of aliens in various movies so it makes me laugh , but he thinks it 's pretty cool . Great quality .
5 #### After years of wearing my bright red chucks ( which always felt a little like clown shoes to me ) I reverted back to classic black and I am excited to lace them up with my new skull and crossbones laces .
5 #### My 6 year old son really likes these shoes and they look cool !
5 #### I 'm 71 years old diabetic and work part time six hours a day . From the moment I placed these shoes on my feet I was comfortable . They feel and look great .
5 #### I had to return it because it did not fit my husband . It looks extremely well made and would have kept it otherwise . Cost vs quality I think you 're getting a lot of bang out of your buck . It 's not a cheesy product .
3 #### This seems a durable mat that will last for some time . It has one piece construction so there 's no outer layer that can wear or rip . The size is also good , and it 's nice to have a little extra length to use though the width is the same as any other mat . The only issue I have is once the mat becomes wet it turns into a slip and slide . The grip is great as long as it 's dry , but if it gets damp , you 'll need some type of skid - free towel to lay down . Overall , a very good mat- just do n't get it wet .
5 #### I have issued a Fox 40 whistle and lanyard to each of my grandkids that they have customized with beads , paint , feathers , etc . , and they ALWAYS wear them when they are camping . The whistle carries much farther than a voice will , and will never become hoarse ! Great peace of mind knowing they have their Fox 40s with them . I use mine to train my Labrador Retriever because he can never say " What ? Sorry , I did n't hear you . "
5 #### I really like these bands for travel workouts . They take virtually no space in your bag and provide enough resistance for a respectable workout . It 's hard to quantify how much weight each one represents . For a thorough workout for each muscle group , it pays to get the extra heavy , heavy and medium bands . Honestly , it 's good for some muscle groups , like the triceps , biceps , shoulders and even the back . I have n't used the door attachment , but for the chest , good old - fashioned pushups will do the trick on the road , wo n't they ? As you adjust your foot position on the rubber , you increase or decrease the resistance . Certainly worth the money , as many hotels have sub - standard guyms and 15 minutes with these bands can work you out just fine .
1 #### Customer service is really bad . The sheath broke after one week ! When I called Sog , I spent 45 minutes on hold then they told me the sheath is not covered under their " life time warranty " and I could buy new one for $ 20+shipping . The sheath was extremely shoddy . The knife was not well balanced and the handle is not suitable for cold weather . The blade is difficult to sharpen . Just calling something SEAL does not make it a good product . I will not be buying from this company again .
1 #### One side of the burner got a bit wet when water boiled over . It has never worked after that , so essentially I paid for half of a stove . Use this as a cautionary tale ! Do n't get the burners wet .
5 #### I 've been wearing Converse Hi - Tops as around the house and casual walking shoes for over a decade . They 're inexpensive , last fairly well , and tend to be well - constructed . There is some arch support , but these are not high - tech shoes . I love them anyway , and greatly enjoy the fact that they are identical to the Converse Hi - Tops I wore when I was in grammar school .
5 #### My husband LOVES this shirt . It 's not a cheap quality fabric or construction . I would definately recommend this item to anyone .
4 #### They fit exactly how I expect Converse to fit . Narrow and no arch support . I bought size 4.5 , which is a 6.5 in womens , and it fits with another i 3 - 4 cm at the toe . It 's supposed to be that way , unless the top of your foot is a point . I bought my shows from Dynamic Sneakers . I 'm pretty wary of buying shoes online , since there are a lot of knock offs , especially on Chucks . I 've checked my shoes and they seem to be genuine . If they are n't , they 're a pretty good knock - off , so I do n't really care .
4 #### Bought several of these Berkshire QP pantyhoses for my mother - in - law and she really liked them , but I bought the size following the size chart ( considering height / weight ) and they were a bit short for her ( and she is NOT -at all- a tall lady , quite the opposite ) . So , I just ordered two more in the 1X-2X hoping these do fit her comfortably ( since the chart indicates 1X-2X are for taller people ) . These help -in regards to compression- for her varicose veins . My only complaint is the sizing . These pantyhoses would probably be great for little people , because my mother - in - law is 5 ' tall and the QP were short on her . Would still recommend buying , if you can figure out the correct size for you .
5 #### It is exactly what I expected . An inexpensive calapsable water bottle ! Works for Me ...
5 #### The watch is very attractive . I do like the fact that it is so thin . However , after receiving it I have found that I prefere a solid blue face as compared to this more modern style of the blue appearing differently depending on how the light happens to be hitting it . This is personal taste , I just found that for me I do n't particularly care for it . It is a very beautiful watch and extremely light on the wrist , so even though I found I do n't personally care for the style after receiving it I still gave it five stars . I will be giving it to a friend for a holiday gift .
4 #### I purchased this to both keep my neck warm and to pull over my mouth and nose while running in below freezing and single digit temperatures . It works great to keep my neck warm but does not comfortably stay up over my mouth and nose while running ( it falls down over my mouth which is a little annoying ) . But it works great if you need to hold it up for a minute to warm up your nose / mouth / throat with your breath .
5 #### For my family who have alot of problems ranging from Rheumatism , Fibromyalgia , and lots of back problems this has come as a blessing for us . Normal weights cause to much stress on our bodies and these give you a workout twice as fast , with less impact . It has worked great for my family and would defintely order another set in the future ! Black Mountain sells some great stuff!6
4 #### This slip is a stiffer material than the last one I purchased . Less giving so it is tighter . I like the stretch straps though . I 'm trying to lose a few more pounds so hopefully it will fit better then . Otherwise I like these type slips .
1 #### This products does not pass the test of time and by that I mean less than a year . My brothers and I use these bands just about every day and I guess you could say that we use them more than your average person . That being said all the bands have tears in them and one has completely ripped and one of the handles is broken . So if your actually going to be using them more daily they will eventually rip . I guess the saying is right you get what you pay for .
5 #### These have a nice range of resistance and seem like they will last quite a while . Handy for exercising while distracted by something on tv .
4 #### Great for canoeing and kayaking . Bulky but lightweight . Works as advertised . Does not fit Ina backpack well . Great to use and leave in the storage space of a kayak .
5 #### I purchased this Airhead bungee to use on the anchor that we have attached to our large 6 person float that we put out at our River house . We previously just had a regular rope attached but my float would just keep coming back to the dock and would beat against the dock from the wakes . My husband suggested that I order a bungee rope and I decided on this one . It has worked like a dream and my float no longer gets beat up against our dock . Very pleased with the purchase of this product and I highly recommend it to others .
5 #### This is our SECOND ! ! We use these to make WINTER HOMES FOR FERAL CATS and this is a purrfect size ! We use a small plastic paint bucket with bottom cut out for the opening and cut a round opening in the side of the cooler with a dremel tool . Place straw(not hay ) inside for warmth and you have a feral cat house . Just be sure to use clear exterior caulk around the opening so water does not get inside the insulating area of cooler . Some will put reflective insulation inside cooler however some cats are scared of it and it is really not necessary . Works great !
5 #### Highly recommend this seller and these amazing Chuck Taylor 's ! Shipping was super fast and the shoes were new and as described !
5 #### I have some hammer toes ( they go well with my mallet fingerrs ! ) , and have had a terrible time finding shoes that are comfortable and supportive . The generous toe box is just what I needed .
5 #### They are larger than some less expensive T shirts but fit me perfectly . Could n't be happier . Will buy more .
5 #### I found these to be comfortable when insoles with arches placed inside . Able to walk 13 hours or more while working without discomfort .
4 #### Bought it for a Halloween costume Fits large but worked for my use . Decent jacket food leather but thin .
5 #### Do n't like to type , but I am very pleased with this purchase . Thanks .
4 #### MOst tips you can get from various and sundry internet sources , but it is a nice volume over all for the beginner prepper !
5 #### This appears to be identical to the flex bar is my physical therapist 's arsenal - same brand and everything . Seems very sturdy .
4 #### bought these for my husband , brought him back to when he was in high school , He really likes them , he said they are same from 30 years ago ! But a cooler color selection . We must stay current !
5 #### I ordered six of these shirts in XXX and they fit perfectly as I expected . Shirts are very comfortable and also did not shrink , nor did the color fade after washing . I am pleased with Russell Athletic Basic Cotton Shirts ... and will be ordering more in the future . FIVE STARS for me .
1 #### The product is fine but the product was old and has gotten very thick . It does n't squeeze out very easy . Be careful you are buying from a dealer that sells enough to keep the product fresh . Had I purchased this from a store I would have taken it back .
5 #### My wife loves these and is now on her umteenth pair . This is a rare manufacturer that knows it has a good thing and keeps it the same so that you know just what you are getting . Thank you Merrell . [ I now wear them too ! Mine , not hers ... ]
5 #### Easy to install and it looks like it came factory on the gun . Love it and the aim is spot on .
5 #### i love to see my son in converse .. wore them in a wedding .
1 #### I was so excited when this came in the mail today ... until I opened it and saw how cheaply this bra is made ! I still tried it on and i felt like madonna(not in a good way ) It makes your boobs stick out like cones ! And its so uncomfortable I ca nt imagine wearing it for a full day . I also ca nt imagine trying to wash it , there s no way it would survive in a washing machine !
4 #### we buy these every year for outdoor winter use at many functions , they always help us keep warm and comfortable
5 #### Still a winner , ca nt go wrong , quality is still very high !
5 #### These are very comfortable and the leather makes them a bit more dressy than my standard seat belt material Keen sandals .
5 #### Fit snug , but not too tight on my son . Velcro has n't separated from the straps like some other cheaper pads we 've had . Works great , looks " cool " as well - from a kids perspective .
5 #### love these shoes . Workout in them 3 - 4 times a week at the gym . I do treadmill , stairmaster , cardio classes and weight lifting . lightweight and versatile shoe .
5 #### perfect for exercising it foldsup nice for storage and the handles make it easy to carry .
2 #### I do n't know if it was the type of glasses or my older eyes , but this just did n't work for me . I went with the mirrycle shifter mount road mirror instead .
3 #### I was so hopeful about this ball , since the reviews overall are so positive . I 've bought 2 of these in the last 6 months , and unfortunately , both have popped . Maybe my kids are extra rough on balls or something , but I think it 's more likely the ball just is n't that great . I am going to try the trick of putting contact cement in the ball to see if I can plug whatever leak has sprung ; perhaps I 'll update if I 'm able to bring the balls back to life .
5 #### This stove is lightweight compared to the rest of the line , easy to clean , gets the job done and it 's dependable . It 's only problem is that the diameter of the burners is too small , you ca n't use 12 " pots , and it does n't have enough BTU 's to boil water fast . Listen , if space is not an issue , get the Coleman 2 Burner Powerpack Stove . It 's a couple of dollars more than this stove . It 's quite a bit larger than this stove , and it 's as nice as cooking on a gas stovetop at home . You can boil tons of water quick , saute calamari or scallops while you 're camping if you 're so inclined , or make pancakes for a mob of people on your Lodge Reversable Grill / Griddle . There 's some trips I use a single burner backpack stove , and then the rest of the time I 'm eatin ' homefries and cheese omelette 's . You could cook chicken marsala with portobello mushrooms and sage on the Powerpack stove . The stove I 'm reviewing is a great stove , just not for a family .
3 #### The Captains GRIPPER is well made and seems like its very durable . I 'd give that part of the GRIPPER five stars . My biggest complaint -- and the reason I 'm only giving it 3 - stars -- is the machining of the hand grips . It 's like grabbing and squeezing sandpaper over and over . I feel like I need to put on gloves before using the GRIPPER . Disappointed with the ergonomics and the need to put on workout gloves every time I use the GRIPPER . Perhaps some sort of foam or rubberized wrap around the grips would have been a better design .
5 #### Pretty much already assembled and ready to go . Give your child some basic training sessions before letting them run wild : How to turn , how to use the brake properly , avoiding people , etc . Your child WILL outpace you if you are not riding a bicycle , roller skates / blades , jogging or any other quick way of transportation .
5 #### This basketball has a great feel . I think it is one of the best basketball products in this price range . My daughters love to use them and prefer to use them over the basketballs they use in their team games .
5 #### I love these shoes ! The size was perfect and they shipped out quickly .
5 #### very good product , I recommend ... In addition to being very responsible people when making shipments . I recommend it 100 %
5 #### I got this bar in two sizes and found using them on a regular basis has helped minimize the tendonitis I got them to help me with .
5 #### I like whistles when I travel . Here is a very good one ! Small and lightweight . I attach it with a 550 cord lanyard to my backpack so that it 's handy . I have a compass attached to said backpack as well . Why a whistle ? Because if you blow one of these when you are surrounded by pickpockets in Europe they scatter like leaves ! Just too much attention . They know they are " made " and move on to an easier target . Sometimes just putting it to your lips is enough ! I like to carry a cane for the same reason . A cane will establish a " no go " zone around you . They ca n't get close enough to get your stuff ! . Ten stars ! Good product . Very useful .
5 #### Took all of 2 minutes to install on my Remington Woodsmaster 742 . Fit and finish is perfect . I would buy again .
5 #### This is the second pair of these my husband loves them Shipped quickly . Exactly what he expected
5 #### Received them today , but actually they , according to Amazon are not supposed to be here until Wednesday of this week . They fit and feel perfect . Waist and length are just right . I was concerned about the length because I am really tall and that can pose a problem . Everything is fine . And they are Made in America ! Thanks Amazon , you did it again .
5 #### If the basis of our review is how much our little one still likes this teether , then it 's a 5 star rating . This the one she reaches for if they 're all out in front of her . The Crab " legs " are perfect for her little teething gums . AND she 's learning that she 's going to love crab legs early !
5 #### Wrong pictures . Read description . Different color = diff size diameter and strength . Yellow small - lightest Then red and green I think . I know mine , BLUE is the biggest and hardest . Get blue if your a guy
5 #### I love these belts for police work . They are tough and heavy duty , yet light in weight . There is a sticky velcro strip on the inside to work along side the safariland reversible inner belts . Although safariland markets these as buckleless there are clasps that go into the belt on the inside to help keep the belt tight , and a loop to hold it in place . I still use 4 belt keepers as well . No one makes a better duty belt than this !
5 #### This is my first Benchmade and I would say that I love it for EDC . It fits comfortably in the hand , it 's razor sharp and holds a edge for a long time . I use a home made strop and a Work Sharp and within a few minutes . I will be buying another Benchmade , probably a fixed blade . Overall , this fits nicely in the pocket , and flips open nicely . There are plenty of good reviews online where people go into all the details and pros / cons so I wo n't bore you with those . For my medium sized hands , it works great . I 've had it for about 6 months and have used it hard with no worries to breaking the blade . I love the idea of lifetime warranty where if I do mess up the blade , I can get it fixed .
4 #### The shoes looks good . However , they are too big , may be 1 " longer than the same size of other brands . Do not know why .
4 #### These rings fly the best of any " frisbee " style toy but have a hard plastic core that breaks ( the dark ring in the middle of the soft plastic ring ) . This brand does n't last anywhere near as long as traditional " frisbee " discs and rings . BUT then they fly so well , it might be worth having to buy one every few months ? ?
5 #### Great color . Durable shirts that fit ! My fianc has a long torso and these shirts fit very nicely .
1 #### This was extremely misleading ! I am 5 ft 7 in . tall . This may be tall enough for a munchkin , or a child never for an adult ? ! ! Also it is very cheaply made . I will keep this for a wall decoration for Halloween , if it does n't fall apart before then ! But I will be careful of buying something like this again .
5 #### This thing is MUCH larger than it looks , but it works GREAT too . Started to give it 4 - stars , but it saved me on more than one occassion , so I could n't do it . Just be ready for a LARGE stand and LARGE glass . The battery - lit built - in light actually works quite well , and you can reassemble , disassemble the hand - wand from the base stand as you need to , if you want to go ' look at something ' , then put it together again . Built pretty good quality too .
5 #### I do n't think I can possibly do this bag justice in writing . I love everything about it . This is my second one ( the first was leather ) and I thought I 'd try the distressed nylon for summer . Although this color is called " Taupe " , it is actually a khaki color . I wanted something neutral and the desert color looked a little too light . I have degenerative disk disease , so I tried this Healthy Back Bag and I never have problems with my neck or back because of my purse anymore . This bag distributes the weight perfectly and contours to your body . The zippers operate so effortlessly that you wo n't believe it . The X - Small is plenty large for everything , make - up bag , wallet , cell phone , some medication bottles , checkbook , a banana . As much room as you really need , especially if you 're trying to help your back . The bag has a nice wide strap for comfort and that is easily adjustable . There are great little compartments everywhere to keep things organized , including the one on the outside side where you can stuff a small umbrella . I never have to hunt for my keys anymore . Also , you do n't need to take this bag off to open it which makes it easy for check - out when shopping . The price is excellent for the quality construction . Do n't hesitate or worry , just get this bag . I will never carry anything else .
5 #### Rain , Shin , Slate or Snow all is done on time .
5 #### Love my Merrell shoes . Just hate that they are made in China . Very comfortable and long lasting . They are exactly as described .
5 #### My husband carries a knife and had made himself a carry of sorts - found this and he loves it . Comfortable and breathes - loves it !
5 #### Was skeptical about these , but am a big fan now . So much more versatile than traditional dock line
4 #### Great work pants can put up with a lot of use and abuse I have had them for a few months working in mental shops and they show no wear and look brand new when I wash them . My only complaint is that they are a little on the baggy side and I find myself getting the cuffs snagged on things here and there when I work .
4 #### Has hooks . I was hoping for something with clips . Decent quality otherwise .
5 #### Keen shoes / sandals have been my all time favorite for comfort and wearability . The sizing has not been an issue with me - I think they 're true to size . I understand some folks have issues with them getting stinky after a few wears , but thankfully I do n't seem to have that problem . Definitely recommend !
5 #### I have these Jungle Mocs in every color , this is my sixth pair . I walk a lot on concrete floors and , until I found these shoes , my feet and legs were burning and hurting every night . When I wear the Jungle Mocs , I get perfect support and cushioning and no pain ! They fit well and wear beautifully . My only complaint ? No summer version ! I would love a few pair in a summer weight , maybe mesh , in lighter colors , so that I can wear them year - round . Due to the nature of my job , I can not wear slides or mules , they have to be closed - in shoes . Please , Merrell , make a summer version for your loyal customers who want more of these Mocs !
5 #### I 'm an 18 year old female on a budget who was not able to afford $ 160 for the womens Timbs , so I looked into kids . I normally wear a size 7 in women and a 5 in men . I ordered the 5 M in big kids for $ 50 less then what I would 've paid for the womens . I was not charged for shipping or taxes so the shoes were a flat rate of $ 109.95 and were estimated to be delivered the following week , Wed - Fri . I recieved them the following Thursday . Price was good and shipping was good . As expected . At first glance the shoes seemed huge and that they would fit a little big but when I put them on with thick socks the fit was perfect . Thin socks gave me enough room but did n't feel like they were about to fall off my feet . Something I did notice was the right shoes seemed to be a darker shade then the left shoe , which is n't a major factor , just a noticeable difference . Also the tongue from the right shoe seems a little crooked which is n't a deal breaker but again a noticeable difference . This review is a first impression review and I have yet to wear them out as I am looking for different outfits to match the shoes with . Overall , satisfied with price , shipping and appearance .
5 #### This is my third pair . They are tight so will have to break them in . Which they came in wide but I did size up . I just love these because of the support you get . I had to get new ones as the other pair I have I have worn the treat flat . The uppers are still good . Which you made shoes .
3 #### Comfortable and easy to to get in and out of . However the sole has zero grip in the rain or ice . Decent spring and summer shoe but be aware when the conditions are not dry .
1 #### I bought these for a project that does n't require precision but I 'm still shocked at how bad these wheels are . The bearings came too crooked to even fit onto an axle so I had to remove them and reset them . The rubber molding is wobbly and has a high spot when spinning ( runout ) I imagine if I actually used these wheels riding on a scooter I would be bouncing down the road as if they had a flat spot . I did n't return these because for my project it does n't matter but I wanted anyone who would use these on a scooter to know not to get these .
4 #### Somewhat wider legs than expected . My only complaint is that I expected a much lighter blue ( like the one shown in the picture ) , but instead , I received a regular blue which I already have .
5 #### I bought 2 of these for my bikes and my kids ' bikes . They were easy to set up , easy to use and really help save space in my apartment . Not much else to say , except if you 're looking to keep your bikes inside and want to save space without drilling holes in your wall or ceiling , this is the way to go .
3 #### They are light and relatively small . Not as shiny as I would like it to be ... but the photo does n't lie . Very discreet , good for a everyday use . I give Amazon 5 stars for the delivery time : 2 days only ( Switzerland ) !
5 #### True to size . Great shoe . Look cute on my son ! I 'll be buying another pair for my other son . For narrow feet I think .
3 #### I got a small but it was more of an xxS and I could nearly fit into it .
1 #### The heart rate feature is not user friendly and after using it approximately 6 times , it stopped working . Next Time Polar !
5 #### I love this bra ! ! ! Its the type of bra that u want to get all three colors . Makes my silohette very nice . A must buy !
4 #### I was a little skeptical of an adjustable kickstand but was pleasantly surprise when it showed up I would buy from this seller again I do n't give out 5 stars
5 #### These are my new favorite shoes . They are so comfortable and they fit perfectly . I love the color and design . Everything is just as pictured .
4 #### I love my Merrells . I bought this pair to replace an older pair that worn out over the years . These shoes are comfortable , sturdy , and goes with so many outfits . I 've worn them with jeans , khakis , and shorts , along with almost any top you can think of . I 've walked with them everywhere . These are great for vacations when space is an issue since they are so versatile . My only complaint about the Jungle Moc is that the flaps at the top instep of the shoe curls up a bit after a few wears . The curling is not too noticeable but slightly annoying . However , that does not stop me from wearing ( and loving ) these shoes . Overall , The comfort and fit alone makes these shoes worth every penny .
5 #### My son loves this . Really nice and a great value .
5 #### This flexbar is great ! I bought this roughly a year ago and used it maybe 2 - 3 times a week for 6 - 8 months and noticed negligible improvements with medial epicondylitis ( golfer 's elbow ) . I was using the tyler twist technique . There are numerous youtubes videos explaining the exercise . A few months ago I started doing the tyler twists at least once a day after having had enough of golfer 's elbow issues . I wish I would 've done this from the beginning . I have noticed dramatic improvements in elbow pain . I was off and on being able to do upper body lifts due to my elbow problems and I am now able to do upper body lifts consistently like I was before I had elbow pains . I also used a McDavid elbow strap that can be credited for the relief as well . I would highly recommend purchasing this if you are having elbow tendonitis issues .
5 #### Love Keens ! My old pair I have had for over ten years ! I always order a half size up . They can be used for so much but are by far my favorite camping / hiking shoes .
5 #### Have been wearing Merrel 's for years . LOVE them . They 're VERY Comfortable with NO break - in time needed .
2 #### Be careful these shoes are not exactly brown , look kind of burgundy , very hard to find a belt to match them . Another problem is how difficult is to remove simple scratches , I have other Stacy Adams shoes and they are excellent , however , I m disappointed with these
5 #### I use these on several guns . If there is a possibility of someone getting their hands on your weapons this is a must for safety . Theirs and possibly yours
5 #### My initial impressions of this fabric camping mat are very good unlike other Intex air mattresses I have had in the past . I bought three of their air beds and all failed within 90 days with leaks , tears and ruptured seams . I wish that they used the same fabric with this mattress on their air beds , maybe they would hold up better . It was n't hard for me to blow up as I had an air compressor with the proper attachment to do the job . Unfortunately the compressor did not like this mattress as much as me , it blew up right after I inflated the mattress . Oh well .... Anyway , I put this on top of my camping cot and it is quite comfortable but just a tad narrow for the cot . It 's long enough but if I lay on my back my arms do n't really have enough room to rest on the mattress . Not a big deal . I slept well on it . I do hope this will hold up over time better than the other Intex stuff and I will definitely update my rating if it expires prematurely . It was so cheap I had to give it a try .
5 #### Fantastic fit . I have a decent size wrist and have no problems securing the straps . It has no problem attaching to my d loop with my 70 # draw . Holds just fine have not had a premature release like others have stated . Trigger is curved and feels very comfortable .
5 #### Bought these to wear with my Easter outfit and they fit just as expected . Perfect addition to my outfit .
5 #### This is far and away the best waterproofer I had had the pleasure of using . I typically use it on my suede work boots , and reapply it about once a year . I am able to submerge my boots in water and when I pull them out , they are not only completely dry inside , they LOOK dry outside . I use it on EVERYTHING I can , footwear , outerwear , motorcycle leathers , tent , packs , hats , sheaths , holsters , pets , children , etc ... well , maybe not pets and kids , but you get the idea . At $ 8 a large can , I do n't feel badly about saturating whatever I am spraying . It works SO well . Not sure why its not working for others ... I guess the All - Father did n't gift everyone with brains in their skulls . This is now the only waterproofer I will use . Heard of it from my father and brother who have been using it for years . Make your own opinion . I will continue to use this , because I enjoy outsmarting the weather . If you are too stupid to get this right , you probably deserve to get wet and have no business being outdoors anyway . Semper Fi
5 #### This is by far the best frisbee I 've ever played with ! ! ! I am in love with this frisbee lol . I am a terrible thrower with traditional frisbees but this Aerobie Pro Ring makes me look highly skilled . It is way easier to throw than a normal frisbee and takes a lot less force to throw it as well . I got the random color option and ended up with bright pink . Although it was the color I did n't want out of the 3 options , it looks pretty nice in person and I do n't mind having it . All three color options are bright and makes them easy to spot and find . I hope I do n't lose this frisbee or have it break any time soon , but if that does happen then I 'll get another for sure . I also got the Aerobie boomerang in red and the red is very nice looking ( and just what I wanted ) .
5 #### Amazing , love it . Works great . I got tendonitis at some point . Not sure if it was from this ( these , i have the green as well ) . But I ca n't do anything for a while ( swim , lift weights , arm / hand strength stuff )
5 #### I have to say that these Flyshooter Bug Guns are fun . They are so fast and powerful , that you can shoot down insects while they are flying ! They are surprisingly accurate .
4 #### Good comfort and support , long lasting , long wearing great product .
4 #### My son loves . Another generation of Chuck T 's worn in our family ... (a little overpriced )
5 #### Perfect watch for everyday ; a little large for my wrist but fixable .
5 #### Takes a little while to assemble , but the parts are precision fit and it will last as a hand me down . Very impressed with product and our 1 year old loves it . Bell is a nice touch as well . If you ca nt tell from pics , the handlebars do steer .
4 #### My only experience with playing Horseshoes is when I was a kid with my Dad , so I was n't quite sure what to look for when I got the whim to build a pit in our backyard . I went to the local sporting store and looked at sets and they seemed kind of cheesy so I came on here to look up sets and found this one . It was a little pricier than the ones in the store so I was hesitant to order , but after reading the reviews I did and after getting I them I found they are definitely worth the few extra bucks . They are quality , well - constructed and Made in the USA . They feel good in my hand and came with instructions to refresh me on how to play the game . The paint has chipped some but that has n't bothered me since it does n't interfere in playing the game . I would recommend this set to anyone interested in backyard games .
3 #### Does the job but the plastic seems a bit cheap
5 #### This " home version " is very very much like the ones at the gym . It is a good addition to a home workout gym . The directions are ultra - easy to follow and do . Great great purchase !
3 #### It said relaxed fit but fit like regular fit . Too small !
5 #### Just received ! Well designed , well manufactured and excellent quality . Have another one on the waY and will recommend these t - shirts . Hard to find with pockets ! Beware they are made of thick material !
5 #### I bought several of these to wear while a new half sleeve tattoo was healing . I have an athletic build so the light cotton and extra room in the arms was what I wanted . The are perfect on both counts .
5 #### I wear this every single day and I love it . It 's so practical and easy to read .
5 #### Absolutely love this wallet ! I have had one like it previously & carried it until it wore out ! I would recommend this to anyone who like organization in a wallet .
1 #### It 's not clear . It 's green . I did n't order green . I do n't have time for B.S. either so I 'm stuck
5 #### I LOVE THIS PANTY ! I would give this a rating of A MILLION stars if it were possible . The material feels absolutely Heavenly . The very wide gusset is great for obvious reasons - wink ! I completely agree with a previous review of this product , if Bali would also market this panty to men , Bali would make a fortune !
5 #### great deal these fit perfect and look great delivery was on time great deal !
4 #### Great all - around watch - nice enough to wear to work , but also good to wear on a normal day . The face is easy to read but is n't oversized , so it does n't draw attention . The backlight is helpful at night . You will need to take it to a jeweler to remove some of the links . I had the same model previously , and it lasted me three years until the hands stopped working , however I was not gentle with the watch , sometimes dropping it on a hard floor or accidentally banging it into things . I wish it had lasted longer , but again , I was n't careful with it , and i liked the look so much that I bought it again .
5 #### It 's got great action , I put it on a 3/0 worm hook with a bullet weight or weightless . Works perfect with a slight jerk every few seconds . I 've used it in saltwater for fluke and seabass and freshwater for large mouth bass .
5 #### These are great shorts . This is the third pair I have purchased for my son over the past few years . His last pair is still going strong after a very full season of wear . I bought these just to have a spare . Highly recommend for any player who is aggressive on the bases and likes to slide !
4 #### This is a good product for warmth . And it 's comfortable . I , however , bought it for skiing and it is n't quite the right product for that purpose . I wanted to be able to pull it up over my mouth / nose , but this creates 2 problems . 1 - the turtle fur just holds the moisture in your breath and gets and soggier and less warm with every breath . 2 - that condensation then travels up to the ski goggles , making it hard to see . The same thing happened when it snowed - the turtle fur got wet and did little good protecting my face . I ended up having to buy a ski mask thing at the ski shop - it was a breathable fabric and worked much better .
4 #### The navy small I ordered now fits like a medium after running through the washer and drier a few times . The sleeves are awkward , pretty long for a t - shirt .
3 #### I love Hanes Silk Reglections pantyhose . Normally , they are 5 stars ; long lasting , nice fit , good texture . However the " Barely There " color needs to be renamed to something like " very dark tan . " To me , the name implies a very light , sheer color . I do not know why I did n't listen to the other reviewers ! ! ! I think I thought I had purchased that color in stores before and liked it . This was way too dark for me to wear , though .
4 #### For a size 10 wide width .. I expected it to have more room . Apart from that , I love it . Looks neat and great on my son 's feet . Bought it for school and so far it is as strong as it looks ... I wish they have 11 cause I would surely buy it .
5 #### Converse sneakers are my absolute favorite outfit staple when dressing casual . You can wear them with pretty much anything and get away with it ! I love that I can wear them comfortably without socks or with socks . I have several pairs , my children have these , and I will keep buying Converse as long as they 're around !
3 #### The converse all star runs a bit large for me . The toe bed is too long . Not sure if I will keep them
1 #### This is for a wallet that I purchased , I only used for one month and the change purse ripped would never buy this style again really disappointed with the quality of this buxton wallet , would not purchase this style again
4 #### I really like SAKs and this one does not disappoint . The tool features of this knife are perfect for my camping trips . I like the Scissors and Saw on one easily carried tool as those two are the most used in my outdoor adventures . The included sheath make this a great deal .
5 #### Sure , you can get better hearing protection than this . You just wo n't find a better product in the price range . I know several people with this exact model , and none of them have any issues with the functionality . These have a great low profile design . My old protection caused issues with getting a cheek weld , whereas these do not . The electronics have functioned great for the 6 months and 20 + times I have used them . They offer great protection while allowing conversation . They do not completely cut out like cheaper versions , you can still have a conversation with shots happening nearby . They do become uncomfortable after a few hours of wear , but I 've used much worse . To address some others ' complaints : If you know how to turn a dial , you can turn these off and keep them off . They will not switch on while in storage . I have changed the batteries twice , and while it is somewhat difficult to do , you can do it without damaging anything , and without too much trouble . I do n't know anybody that actually damaged their protectors while changing the battery . If you are intelligent enough to use a firearm safely , you can safely change these batteries . I think the db rating is accurate . I regularly shoot a 12 ga shotgun and a Mosin Nagant M91/30 . These offer more than enough protection . You can still hear the shots ( obviously ) but I do n't think it 's damaging my hearing .
5 #### Used this first in 1984 in Ranger school . Big fan since . Continue to use .
5 #### I split the gross with a friend for when we 're riding and even on warmer days I 'd still drop one in each of the warmer pouches of my mitts . They 'd easily last the full day on the slopes .
5 #### Best little tool kit to have in your bike . This little kit will get that screw or clamp tightened besides having a couple of the most used sockets on hand . Has a few needed items that big shiney chrome wrench / tool set the Mfr . put in your bike does n't have . inexpensive too . Do n't leave home without it . Cheapest insurance you 'll ever buy , and if you use it just once , it paid for itself . Sort of like a Swiss Army tool kit for HD and any standard non - metric motorcycle .
4 #### Shipped fast came in it 's own little zippered net style bag . Was a bit smaller than I had anticipated . But seems well made .
5 #### Our Grandsons , seven and nine seemed very pleased with these boards . I liked that they can use them indoors and out , and they will be able to improve balance and coordination.with these .
5 #### I have been crazy for Sperrys ever since my boss gave me a pair , years ago . They are expensive , but they are great quality ( so they last),but they are also very comfortable and versatile . I 'm not taking a star -- yet , but the latest ones only have one layer in the sole . This would not be a problem ( they are just as comfortable ) , but Sperry is trying to keep the same look , so they are painting the top part so that it 's still that cream color . Only problem with that is that the paint of course starts to peel pretty soon , which of course looks pretty shoddy .
5 #### Jacket fit perfect and looks great ! ! My son is a small 10 year old and I ordered him a 9 - 10 . The seller sent a nice email letting me know the jacket was on the way .
4 #### The only problems is that is occasionally has issues staying flat . the plastic just needs to be shaped and bent occasionally when this happens . I 'm super happy about this purchase , this is a great thing to have .
5 #### I put a " Slip on " Hougue grip on every handgun I own . The rubber makes for a non slip comfortable grip and it adds " fingerlets " even if your firearm does n't have them . I just bought my first 1911 pistol , a Kimber Ultra Carry 2 . I put this Hougue grip on in place of the factory wood grips . Not only does it feel so much more comfortable to handle , but now it also matches the color of my slide , in my opinion improving the look of the gun .
4 #### They 're ping pong balls . As long as they are round , and durable enough to warrant the 3 - star rating ( and price ) , then what 's not to like ?
5 #### awesome does nt put to much bind on cleats in boat , prfect shock absorber
5 #### Purchased this for my Boy Scout . It is easy for him to put up and take down and has held up nicely .
5 #### My kids loved it ! I bought this for my son 's full size bed ( one is five and the other two ) . It was and still is a huge hit ! My sister went and bought twofor her kids after seeing mine .
5 #### I bought this to ear as an undershirt under a football jersey ( as a spectator of my favorite NFL team , not an athlete playing football ) . Fits well and is solid construction . It fits as expected . I got an XL and feel it is true to it 's size .
3 #### This kick stand has a strong spring , but the screw the locks the extension arm in place comes loose very easily and has to constantly be re - tightened . I suggest using a little blue thread locker if you have some . It is also not as compatible with multiple brands of bikes as they make it sound . In addition , the extender arm and tube that holds it , does not have a tight fit . It is very loose even when the screw is tightened and should definitely have a tighter fit .
3 #### The glue on the padding wore off in a few months . It 's really annoying to have to re - glue the padding back on . Other than that , this product works fine .
3 #### Love the quality and the feel of it but it fits like it 's two sizes bigger
2 #### When it says Unisex I think I misinterpreted that . I thought that just meant the sizing but these look like they fit alien feet . Each shoe barely looks different right to left . I ordered a wider size and they are still narrower than most narrow sizes . I sent these back and ordered a pair of normal Converse Chuck Taylors . I have a hard time believing these are made by Converse . They looked very generic .
5 #### I bought a wide size of these at a local store and they are amazing ! Soft , comfy , with moderate support . Not a cloud to walk on , but not minimalist . The wide size is perfect for my wide feet with high arches . The shoe tends to run about a half size long though , especially for Nike . I am working on getting in shape , and these shoes feel good all day ... No rubbing on my big toe joint or pinkie toe or heel . Very pleased .
5 #### Love converse . So comfortable and go with anything casual or more . Have several pairs in several colors .
5 #### Works great on a P-11 . It makes the grip feel much better in your hand .. This should be a standard feature of the magazines for the P-11 ..
5 #### I normally use a chalk bag ; this is good for travel .
5 #### the length and the elastic leg bands make these amazing , padding is good too . they fit like underwear so order the same size as a form fitting pair of underwear
5 #### Purchased this to wear as my work at home watch of which I 'm sometimes very active . First I was quite impressed with the appearance . However after wearing it for a week I 'm more impressed with its accuracy . I 've checked it by my atomic time piece and it has n't lost or gained a second ! This would be a nice watch at a greater cost but for under $ 40 its a steal .
5 #### I Love it . It is very light and the color is great .
5 #### My second one ( the other is long sleeve ) These shirts are unbelievably comfortable and wear like iron . I will be getting more ! ! !
4 #### I really enjoy my shoes . But they 're a little bit too big . I have a pair of shoes that are 12.5 and fit just right . But do n't let the slightly to big thing stop you from buying these awesome shoes .
5 #### I ordered this for my 4 year old grandson who loves magic . It was perfect . The hat material was excellent . It is just as adorable as in the picture .
5 #### Have used this for 2 years . We 're not very good , but the rebounder has held up for 2 years in all weather conditions and still works great .
4 #### The collar and head piece were a bit awkward and small , but the rest of the costume was great !
5 #### Father 's Day present for my dad . X - Large . He said it 's cool , comfortable and he really likes all the pockets and velcro straps for holding up the sleeves . He wears it for fishing . I 'm going to pick one up for myself .
5 #### Way more difficult than any gripper I 've ever used before . High quality instruction . You 'll feel like Sly Stallone .
5 #### Carried the Executive for many years . Best tool all around for space in pocket . lifetime warranty . If it ever breaks they will fix it .
5 #### Great shirt . Seems bigger than most t - shirts this size but that must be for the working man moving around in the shirt so much ,
4 #### It 's great for up to 40 power past that the mirage makes it very hard to see . it 's a great spotter for the money and it will do what a smaller expensive one do but it will be twice the size .
4 #### Bought three packages of these along with the Lixada Lightweight Compact Stainless Folding Stove , and Esbit CS585A 3 piece Lightweight Camping cookset . Arrived promptly . I 've used these in the past for camping and hiking so I bought more . They do a great job of clean fire burning , for starting fires or heating something up .
4 #### This whistle is REALLY loud . It is also kind of high pitched . It does a great job of getting the attention of my students . Unfortunately it has the same pitch and loudness as the fire alarm !
3 #### I got this disc because the Aerobie Pro is made for big open spaces and I only had limited space to throw . This disc was perfect for the smaller area I had to throw in and is just as fun if not more fun than the Aerobie Pro . The only problem I had was that this disc broke within the first day of throwing from normal recreational use . Maybe there was a defect already in the disc but I was very disappointed with its lifespan . It is still loads of fun and will give it another try eventually .
5 #### Love my new Nike 's . It 's been years since I 've been able to wear them ( sizing changed years ago and I just could n't wear them any more ) but now the new styles and sizing are perfect . Lightweight shoe with tons of style . The Fog color is just what I was looking for ... not black and not neon ! I wore them to participate in Relay for Life ( 24 hour walk ) and they held up great !
5 #### I have work TIms and Outside work Tims . But always Tims . They 're comfortable , last long , and I 've been rebuying Timberlands for the past 6 years . Only boot I trust .
5 #### Exactly as described . Have worn in shower several times with no problem . Very large for someone who has small wrists , had to have 4 links removed . Nice looking watch for a fairly inexpensive price . Would order again !
5 #### Our little one loves these and they fit as expected .
1 #### I just have to practice the throw technique a little more but it was very hard to get it to return . Not a bad item though .
3 #### Feathers are not glued on very well . Overall a good arrow but not impressed with the cheaply glued feathers . Would buy again but add extra super glue .
5 #### Not as comfortable as my years old Merrell 's because they have n't broken in and stretched out , but still my favorite comfort shoe . Provide cushion like support and nice stability .
5 #### These are awesome ! We use these any time we are going camping ! I would buy them again and again ! Also it shipped quick ! Great product !
4 #### Not as comfortable as expected , internal seam rubbed on my pinky toes
5 #### Our son has used his E100 for almost a year now , got it for his 7th birthday . He rides it a while almost every day on the street in front of our home , no long treks . It 's been reliable and performs as advertised . I would guess that our son goes about as fast as someone running fast ( running , not jogging ) , sometimes faster going downhill . The brake is a bit weak but not bad . At age 7 , our son has behaved safely with it , stops and waits off the road if a car comes and no crazy stunts , so I would say it is suitable for his age , but obviously every kid has different maturity levels so parents have to judge on their own . Lots of fun , impresses his friends , and reliable .
5 #### Man ! I bought these as part of a Jane Lane Halloween costume , but honestly , even though I do n't wear tights or skirts or even shorts or any of that nonsense , I really liked these . Would actually probably be comfortable to wear under pants as an additional thermal layer now that it 's negative ten billion degrees outside . And , hey , if I ever wore a dress because I lost a bet , I 'd have the perfect pair of tights for underneath .
5 #### What a great compass- it 's been very tough and endured a beating in the field , with no breaks of the plastic or fading of the numbers . My bearings also generally sync up with those of others around me , so I feel confident my compass works well .
5 #### I like this watch a lot . However , I do n't usually wear it when I am going to get all sweaty since the band is leather , though it says that it is water resistant leather . It is now my EDW ( every day watch ) .
2 #### This shoe is narrow across the toes , and definitely needs a better arch support . I 'm truly disappointed with this shoe , but wanted an all white leather tennis shoe .
4 #### I had one many years ago and it has n't changed much . I see what people are saying about being able to ' turn ' down the heat . I suggest a piece of rubber ( like a piece of tire etc ) or a piece of cardboard etc and put it between the dial and the stove so the dial does n't move . That should take care of the problem . You should n't have to do that , agreed but in the meantime that is what I am doing . Also sent email to Coleman asking about this , let 's see what they say . I will update when I get a reply . For that reason I am giving it 4 stars .
1 #### Returning these . the pictures on here make the shoe appear all black with a touch of pink in the check . however , the whole shoe has pink coming through . I was looking for an all black shoe . I ordered the Nike Women 's Flex Supreme TR3 instead and love them ! ! !
5 #### Had a pair of same style but 10yrs old . Bought new pair , very happy with them . Glad I have them .
4 #### Very high quality fabric and construction , but larger than expected , and longer , which was a nice surprise , actually .
5 #### These are my wife 's favorite casual shoes . The pair we purchased on Amazon arrived quickly and fit as expected . Good job by all involved and price was reasonable too .
5 #### The best underwear you can buy . They do n't ride up , and even if you gain weight they stretch with you . I have worn these underwear for years , gained 20 lbs . , and can still wear the same size .
3 #### Light weight , comfortable but wrinkles too easily for me . If it did n't , I 'd give it a higher rating
4 #### My husband likes these a lot , but the " nubs " on the sole take some getting used to .
5 #### I ordered this pair for my son and I definitely plan on ordering more in several colors . Nice , comfortable , and cool sneakers for the summertime . My son also has very wide feet which can make it kinda hard to find sneakers that will fit him comfortably . I would definitely recommend converses for any one with this problem .
5 #### Great safety arrows , and now that we have these , we do n't have to risk losing the pink ones that came with my daughter 's Brave bow .
4 #### these fit great and look good in almost anything . they look great with shorts ! Now i want some more for the rest of the summer !
4 #### I love these , but the 34 I ordered was WAY TOO SMALL even though I always wear a 34 . I bought Dickies brand jeans in a size 34 and they fit perfectly . Not sure what happened to these shorts , but I had to return them .
5 #### Bought this for a 5 year old and she instantly loved it , especially the pink color . :P This folds so very easily - the 5 yo could do it . It is sturdy and rides pretty well . The brake works quite well too . The adjustable handle means that it will be useful even after the kid grows taller . After 3 months of use , there are still no problems . I highly recommend it if you 're looking for a kick scooter .
5 #### I have bought Carhart and Dickie work clothes for years . from local uniform / big and tall store . great quality work clothes . Very good price and convenient having them delivered to my door .
4 #### Good gloves . Durable and worth it . Small means like 5 year old small not 9 year old ....
5 #### The price is wonderful ! Can never go wrong with a pair if classic Chucks .
5 #### Perfect for wearing around the house or mowing the yard in !
4 #### Reasonable cheap rolling cooler . Construction is not bad ( would n't put it through serious abuse ) . Good stuff for light duty . . .that is , great for shorter trips , etc . , would not expect to keep cold over more than a day or two .
5 #### Just got these today and yes as any other grown " KID " I took these out and tested them sitting on my front deck . Bushnell is a well trusted name and I am glad that I went with this pair of Binoculars . If you are looking for a great pair of binoculars at a GREAT price these are for you . Excellent clarity and I absolutely love the " insta focus " these have . I hike the Adirondacks in NY and ca n't wait to take these out when I am on the summit of a mountain .
2 #### Love timberland boots but I need to stick to the women
5 #### A gift . I 'm not a Wrangler wearer - but the person they were for likes them swell . And - oddly ... I just answered a lengthy video survey about this brand - and viewed the " cartoon " version of a commercial that you will soon see on television about this brand . It starts out with " commuter . " A guy jumping on a bus at a bus stop . There 's a plethora of other " wearers " of Wrangler in the upcoming ad . " Father " was another . All the wearers shown in the commercial end in " er . " Ca n't recall the rest - " worker , painter , camper ... " But anyway - the Wranglers were appreciated as a gift . They fit as anticipated . You ca n't balk at the price .
3 #### I originally got this for my 5 year old and while it 's very cute and she liked the design the time face did n't work . It had this weird time till for the minutes . Like 20 minutes till instead of showing 40minutes . That 's the half pink and half purple you see on the face . for a little kid it 's confusing ,
5 #### I have had this bra before and like it . It came promptly and was as I expected . Thanks .
5 #### Standard Chuck Taylor . Classic and comfortable but would n't want to run a marathon in them . Who has n't owned a pair at some point in their life ?
5 #### My local gunsmith recommended these rings to me as being about the best scope rings you can get , especially with higher recoil applications . I installed them on my Weatherby 30 - 06 . They are fantastic . The inserts really help you torque them down tight and also protect your scope from ring scratches . They are fantastic rings . I prefer one piece units , but if you need just rings , like I did for my 20MOA base , these are the way to go ! ! !
5 #### I have had this cooler for several years , purchasing it at a big box retailer on a trip after my fabric California Innovations cooler failed ( zipper broke ) . The size of this cooler is perfect for a few bottles of water , sandwiches and snacks that need to be kept cool . It fit nicely on the floor of our Acura MDX behind the front seat and was easily accessible . While this is not a huge cooler , it is just right for packing a lunch for a family of 4 . The top also has storage for napkins and some plastic forks , knives , spoons , etc ... I have used freezer packs to keep the items cool or filled ziplock bags with ice as either work fine . This cooler is just right , not too big and not too small , for those times you need a more compact cooler or just do n't want to haul a big one .
2 #### These are way too small and uncomfortable for a grown adult like myself . I wish they would have said in the title that these were kid 's sized , but I suppose I blame myself for not thoroughly reading the customer reviews before purchasing . The Velcro straps are uncomfortably tight , and they tend to rip off whenever I bend my knees dramatically . The same discomfort was experienced with the elbow pads ... except that they are even tighter than the knee pads ; so much that I could only tolerate wearing them for 5 minutes before taking them off ... I'll probably never use the elbow pads again . The knee pads at least do an " okay " job at protecting my knees ( so long as they stay on ) but I can tell these were meant for children and maybe young adolescents . I 'll never be buying these again , nor do I recommend anyone buy them unless they have children .... (in which case they might fit perfectly and comfortably on them . )
5 #### the only way i have figured to mount the net is to use zip ties and zip tie it to the hooks on the rim . its not a quick on and off net but other than that , this product is a 5 star win !
5 #### I like these boots for my infant . They are stylish and you can pair them with anything . It took my walking 11 month old some getting use to because the boot is heavier than any of his other shoes .
5 #### I have worn Merrell 's for years , first time I bought them thru Amazon , and they were perfect . Put them on the day they arrived and wore them all day .
4 #### So far , so good . I wanted a variable powered scope that started at 1x and was n't grossly over priced like most optics these days . This unit fit the bill . Seems to keep point of aim . Once I got it dialed in , have n't had to touch it . I would like a larger lever or something on the zoom ring to quickly go back and forth , but that 's something I can work around for now .
5 #### The only watch that I will always trust to hold up .
5 #### These are great shoes and they last forever . Like walking on air , as they say .
5 #### This shirt is a beautiful , and the color is strong and true -- just as shown on my computer . The fabric is substantial , not thin and wimpy , and the construction is excellent . The shirt is a little longer than we 're used to , but that serves to cover any " crack problem " that might arise . And my son loves the pocket for his sun glasses . I 'm VERY pleased , so I 'll be buying several more for my son and husband .
5 #### I bought three pairs of these socks for a week of hiking the mountains in Acadia National Park in Maine last summer . The weather was warmer than expected , but these socks wicked the moisture beautifully . My feet were cool and comfortable and never felt any rubbing or risk of blisters despite taking a pounding on the downhill runs . By itself , that would n't be sufficient to warrant a review . But now I 'm home , and the weather has turned cold ( thanks to an early attack of the dreaded polar vortex ) . Normally I suffer from cold feet indoors during the winter , despite wearing slippers all the time . This month , I decided to try wearing these summer hiking socks indoors . For the first time in years , my feet are warm and comfortable indoors . The socks are nice and thick and they wick away foot moisture . They fit inside my LL Bean mocs and make life a lot more comfortable . Back in 1982 , I discovered Wigwam socks , loved them , and bought six pairs . I still own them , and still wear them ! I was delighted to find that these new Wigwam socks are just as well made as back in the day . Wigwam does n't sell fashion or fad -- they do manufacture a high - quality , highly - functional product that lasts forever . These socks represent a great fusion of the latest materials and old - fashioned Wigwam quality . My feet say " thanks " .
5 #### What can I say . These are my favorite brand of jeans and these were at a good price and delivered quickly .
5 #### BEST THING EVER ! ! Great quality and I love how you can switch from one band to another is seconds
5 #### Love these little shoes . These are my sons second pair and when he out grows these I will be getting him another pair .
5 #### This watch is perfect for people with smaller wrists . I often have a hard time getting a good fit on a watch bandwith my small wrists , but not the case with this watch . Not only do I have a good fit , but there are actually 2 smaller sizes beyond where I am wearing it . Thanks Timex !
5 #### Just the right size for a small wrist . Easy to read . Very nice .
5 #### My husband absolutely lives in his Merrell 's . They were a great fit and easy to wear right from the get - go . No breaking - in necessary .
5 #### I have used GPS previously , however , it is much better along the way to see my speed which encourages me to go faster and allows me to see when I am slowing down .
5 #### SO easy to put together & take a part . Perfect size for my son to practice . Very sturdy . Highly recommend .
5 #### Bought as a gift and they love it . Very high quality and gets the message out .
4 #### Love these shoes , an old throwback that is having another great fashion moment . These Kswiss are super comfortable and can easily be worn walking all around town , far more comfy than Chucks . 4 stars because they do run a bit big , as I believe it is just a larger cut shoe . I normally wear and 8 and occasionally an 8.5 . I got an 8 in these and wish I would have gotten a 7,5
5 #### I have been looking for this watch for months , and I finally have it . It has everything I was looking for : classic style , nite lite , and water resistance . I have purchased about 3 watches in the last 12 months that had 1 or 2 of the features previously listed but not all 3 . I have had no problem with this watch , and truthfully I have yet to take it off . It holds up to my vigorous work and play routine , and it looks just as good as the day I purchased it . I will purchase this item again .
5 #### Came pumped up ! Sure I topped them off , but nice that they came pumped up . You do n't want to have them not inflated for long its bad for them . Good product . Picked this up for my basketball team , and they are loving them .
5 #### chalk ball works well . it gives off just enough chalk at the time and not too much . I will purchase this in the future .
5 #### Bought it as a gift for my mom . SHe loved it . The watch is small so it looks really nice on thin hands .
5 #### The COC Sport is a good starting point for beginners with " white collar job " type hand strength . It does n't provide extreme resistance , but in the very early phases of grip strength training , it allows people with weaker hands to move up the ladder properly . Do n't let your ego get in the way and buy a stiffer gripper if you really are n't ready for it . The Sport allows beginners to generally familiarize their body mechanics with the muscular requirements called on by grippers , without excessive strain and the potential for injury . Two warnings about the Sport : 1 ) for those who do n't have calloused hands from other activities ( golf , baseball , etc ) the grip surface on the COC grippers * will * open raspberries and blisters on the hands of beginners , but do n't worry . After a month or so of training , your hands will toughen up and you will actually want a more aggressive knurling . 2 ) Grip strength training is addicting as heck . You will progress past the " Sport " fairly quickly and find yourself buying the Trainer and even the # 1 before you know it . When I first started , I could barely rep the COC Sport for 10 . Now , I can just about close it using only my thumb and forefinger !
4 #### The Galco Ankle Glove Calf Strap complements the Galco Ankle holsters . I got it for the Galco Ankle Lite ankle holster which I use to carry an extremely small and light 380 pistol . That being the case , the extra support is not required in my particular case . The firearm is so light that the ankle holster alone is sufficient to secure the weapon to the ankle . This is not to say that the calf strap is of bad quality , or unnecessary in all conditions . For me , most of the time , I do n't feel it is required , though I still use it . For a larger or heavier firearm , I would imagine the calf strap to be an indispensable addition to the ankle holster . If you are unsure , and intend to carry something very small and light , try the ankle holster alone for a while , and see if you find extra support to be necessary . It is made in the USA , so quality and craftsmanship are not of concern . I use it , but I could live without it if I had to . If I were carrying something more substantial , it would be a must - buy .
5 #### My son loves this and it really well made . He wore it several times for Halloween events and I am sure he will continue to wear it for play .
2 #### a bit too long and flare out at the bottom . The picture does not do them justice .
4 #### I like to buy watches for gifts , they are a great gift . This watch , is great , easy to read , keeps great time . No complaints from anyone that I bought them for presents . They love this watch !
5 #### It 's a fanny pack . It 's great . Does n't bounce , good material . The front pocket is actually large enough for an i d or cc or so . The main pouch is large enough for a fat set of keys w/ USB and my galaxy s2 . Definitely a good purchase if you want to run and have your phone with you . I use a bluetooth headset .
5 #### Perfect fit on my Rossi 22/410 matched pair youth rifle . Installed in about 17 seconds . Combined with AccuShot Premium 1 " Weaver - style rings and a Barska 3 - 9x32 Plinker-22 Riflescope to make the Rossi into a lean , mean , plinking machine .
5 #### Was really happy to find this shoe in a 10.5 . Half sizes in Chucks are not easy to come by these days .
5 #### Item was purchased for my sister that loves this particular ladies wallet .
4 #### I was really hesitant to buy these for the simple fact that I had no idea what size I would get . I tried reading reviews to help but they honestly were n't much help because one would say order a size smaller because they run big . While another would say order a size bigger because they run small . But i took a chance and bought a half size bigger than I normally do . They arrived ahead of schedule and they fit perfectly . I am happy with my purchase
5 #### i buy these for every ski season and they just work , very reliable . they are designed to work in low oxygen environments , like in a glove or boot , so do n't complain if they get really hot when you leave them lying around somewhere
5 #### The unit is very well built . I do metal work and have experience with this type of fabrication , and the machining was perfectly alined . The assembly instructions list EVERY part and give a good assembly plan . Remember , there is an assembly order that you need to follow . I advise that you put it together according to the instructions . Materials are packaged well and shipping was handled professionally . It is difficult to build a " stock " unit that can fit " all " body types . So , the adjustment options to fit each body are limited . But , if you 're like me , Joe Average , it 's a good fit . As for the gym function , it works great . I have limited space and need to fit gym , spinner , and free weights into one very tiny room . This is the perfect unit for my setting . Small footprint with versatile functions . Pully bearings are sealed -a big plus for those of us who sweat during a workout . Multiple attachments make upper and lower body exercise variation possible . Range of motion when lifting weight is important . The unit allows for a full range of motion for every type of exercise I can perform . All in all , a good unit for the price .
5 #### this has 16 card slots , one is a window thumb slot . It has an inner bill holder ( this one is smaller than an actual bill ) , and a regular bill slot , and then it has a coin purse , and seven slots behind the cards . It is very well made , I love it , it suits my needs and it is very well made .
5 #### Quality made shoe that is unbelievably comfortable . I can see more in my future .
5 #### I really love these shoes . They are attractive and very comfortable . They work well for my daily workout and fit well .
3 #### Only one downside so far ... one of the grommets on the top , inside flap , has already torn away from the fabric after cinching the pack , and lifting it when filled with 42 lbs . of gear . I suggest people reinforce the grommets to the fabric using strong thread before packing it . Other than that , it 's a well thought - out design , makes the important items accessible via the outside pockets , and there are lots of webbing if you like to hang things on the outside . You can even slip things in between the outside pockets and pack . The long straps over the top allows over - stuffing of your pack if you feel the need . There are two snaps on each of the front pocket straps , which allows adjustment if you have something taller than the pocket itself . The material of the pack seems pretty strong , I believe it 's the grommets that need more reinforcement . Aesthetically pleasing exterior . Nice and roomy , and perfect for me . Not too heavy with all my gear and a weight I can handle when packed and out hiking , so it works for women my size ... I'm 5'5 " . Did n't realize how roomy the outside pockets were , very nice . This pack will fit the alice frame also .
5 #### These shoes are like custom made for me . Its a bit difficult to put them on but once they are on they fit perfectly on my feet . It is very comfortable to walk around with them . They are like sneaker sandals ! Since I do n't like to wear socks for the summer , I will wear these Keens for my travel .
5 #### Great cushioning , no slip , easy to break in . I looooove this mat . Used for : Bikram / hatha , vinyasa , boot camp , core classes , Tabata , etc .
4 #### My Buxton Heiress Double Cardex wallet arrived by the date given . It came in a very nice gift box in case you would want to buy and give this as a gift . I love the color I chose - Red . The color makes it easier to find my wallet in my purse . There are plenty of slots for credit cards or store point cards . I especially like the fact that the coin part is large and has a divider inside . I keep my quarters and dimes in one half and nickels and pennies in the other half . This makes finding exact change very simple and quick . As for the dollar bills , they just fit in the wallet part where the bills go . The reason I did n't give this 5 stars is because then inside of the wallet is not all leather . It is a matching vinyl . I believe the leather will far outlast the vinyl some day - few years . Otherwise , I highly recommend the Buxton Heiress Double Cardex wallet for yourself or as a gift .
4 #### This is my first benchmade and the first one i saw and held at my local sporting goods place . I love the color , quality , steel , etc ... my only problem is after a while carrying it every day it seemed the handle just did not fit me as nicely as some blades . I will always keep my first benchmade though
4 #### My son wore these for a wedding has been wearing them ever since .
5 #### As I get older I bigger feet . These fit much better than the EE . They are a good now but it did n't stop me from putting on some Leather Honey
3 #### Too small for me I need a refund or replacement for 8.5 men size
5 #### Nice clean look , can go dressy or casual . Very shiny which I like . The date is more readable than some watches , but still a little small . Face is a nice fit for my small wrist . The indiglo is great which is one of the primary reasons I bought this particular watch , that and the fact that I can swim and shower with it on . The band was very long and difficult to shorten so I took it to my jeweler . I did n't want to fiddle around and scratch it and of course the jeweler had the right tools and was done in no time . However ladies if you have a larger wrist you might find this band just the ticket . I would definitely recommend this watch .
3 #### The only reason I rated this product with three stars is because the belt was to big . I ordered according to my waist size but the sellers should have stated that in order to get the full benefit of this belt it needs to be cinched tight therefor it should be ordered a size smaller . The belt fits but is not tight enough and I can not tightened it any further so my back still moves and hurts . It should be stiff and not mobile . Recommend that you order a size smaller to receive the full benefit , I am not certain what to do with this belt because it is not worth the shipping cost to send it back ! ! !
5 #### We had one of these for over a decade , but the bottom finally started to come out . They 're durable and keep your bevarages ( but not your hands ! ) cold .
5 #### Bought this to replace my pea - based whistle for refereeing swim meets . It is loud ( really loud ) , consistent , and light - weight . A great value for the price
4 #### I love these support stockings . My one complaint . This is the second order of two pairs I have placed and each pair appears to have a " dark " mark that goes up the front of the stockings . I bought different colors . No problem when I wear slacks , but it looks awful when I wear a dress . I had hoped it was just on a previous order but I just reordered and the two pairs I bought have the dark mark up the front . Almost afraid to reorder . Wonder if these are not first quality and outlet quality . Have other people noticed this dark mark ? I
5 #### Fit perfectly on my Remington 870 Express super magnum . Shot two deer with a scope mounted on it last season . It WILL mark up your gun slightly , so keep that in mind when you mount it .
4 #### very durable rod holders just what I was looking for
3 #### It 's not for me . Quality is not what I expected ! Good stockings though but I would like it to be a bit more silkier .
5 #### I rated this ball 5 stars because we have bought multiple soccer balls for our son and this one has provided the best value for the money . by no means is it a professional ball but it is still fine for kids in the 6 - 10 range . Bonus - it comes inflated !
5 #### second pair . Comfortable and great for people with bunion issues or previous surgeries . Sole wears great
3 #### Be advised , its a nice shoe , fits well , and its is made of some type of seude .
5 #### My BGR hours are in TK for this week . I will be working on OWBJ over the weekend . It was very easy to set up , close & use burner on camping ( good backup for emergency ) . Most of the people on camp ground were using a similar burner for cooking . We wo n't find many variety and brands for burner . You can attach a big propane tank with adapter ( never try but the small one last one trip with evening dinner and tea ) I will recommend for anyone who is trying out first time or looking for good backup or camping burner .
5 #### ...... LOVE IT GREAT NO PROBLEMS FAST SHIP WOULD RECOMMEND TO FRIEND ............
5 #### MH Beef Stroganoff is our favorite flavor , but most of the Mountain House foods are awesome . I bought this one , the Spaghetti and the Chili Mac for our emergency food supply for when we get snowed in during the winters in our location . These have a very long shelf life but we normally do eat them within 3 or 4 years because they are pretty tasty and we do actually get snowed in and need them . These meals give us something diffrent and tasty to look forward to ;) To make the Beef Stroganoff ; We boil the water and add it to a bowl with whatever amount of the dried food that we want . We then cover the bowl with plastic wrap , wrap it in a towel to help keep it hot , and then let it set a good 15 to 20 minutes to be sure all the beef pieces have reconstituted . Then we ad a tad more boiling hot water to bring it back up to temperature . Or , we warm it up more on our wood burning stove . We like it served over a bowl of steaming fresh cooked , brown rice , just so the meal goes further and is healthier . It is also very good over cooked egg noodles or other pasta too . To make it special , if we have it , a dollop of sour cream and a sprinkle of dill weed makes it awesome !
5 #### So cute ... my daughter loves it . It 's bright and goes well with every outfit .
5 #### What a nice nightgown / slip for under other dresses . Lightweight soft fabric . No scratching at all . Ordered 1 but have already ordered two more . Just like the vintage french slips I got from the 60 's . Am 5 ft 11 and the dress is knee long
5 #### We were doing a kitchen remodel so I bought this stove so I could fry eggs for breakfast each morning . The past six weeks I 'm on the patio frying eggs in the morning . Love propane over the old gas stoves . Easy to light . Still on my first bottle of propane so seems to be fuel efficient .
4 #### TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST ABOUT THEM , THEY ARE GRAND . THEY SEEM A LITTLE TOO WIDE BUT THEN I'VE BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO EVEN SCUFF UP THE SOLES BUT I REALIZE THAT SUMMER SOX WILL BE REPLACED WITH MODEST WEIGHT WOOLS . HEEL SEEMED TO LOSE BUT AS IT FLEXES IT IMPROVES THE FIT . FRNKLY , I'M SURE WE MADED A DEAL . HUCK HUCKESTEIN QUERY ? SHOULD I SHOULD I EVER USE NEEDSFOOT OIL ON THEM ? THE BAG I BOUGHT FROM YOU JUST WHAT I NEEDED !
5 #### I usually wear 8.5 but ordered a 9 which fit perfectly . I 've always worn Chacos for my outdoor activities but these are so much better . Comfy and treated to prevent stink . Breathable , dry fast , and protect your toes . I wear them for casual hikes , walks , and other outdoor stuff . My only concern is they make my feet sweat a little . Overall , I love them .
5 #### I bought this shirt and the pants for a July trip to New Zealand . They are very lightweight but add lots of warmth . Good purchase .
5 #### For the money one of the best scopes going . Clear , rugged , good resolution and surprising amount of light at the edge of shooting hours .
2 #### Shoes came with marks on the front white part . Had to return .
5 #### I highly recommend these . When I bought mine ( 2009 ) I was working around houses , climbing onto roofs , and wanted exactly what these looked like : durable , sturdy , secure hold / fit on the foot , toe - cap for ladders , roofing , bushes , etc . They 're solid , yet , they 're surprisingly light - weight material . I 've had other shoes come apart on me , but not these . These are work horses and have protected my feet extremely well . They look comfy , and feel even better . Very good foot support , immediately comfortable with no break - in required , and have not given out or lost the shape or supporting quality ; I weigh 260 - ish lbs and am on my feet all day with no problems , and the sole has not compressed that I can tell . They are still like - new although the sole has worn some and they 've faded . I wear this pair 90 % of the time unless I want a dressier sandal . They wash easily and you can let them dry or they will dry on your feet in summer . I love them so much for fit and comfort that I bought the closed - shoe style they make for office & winter use , and just ordered my second pair of sandals in another color . I ordered another pair to be dressier , but I have no reason to replace the first pair . They are ingeniously designed and made , and I love them .
5 #### after i ordered these , i started drinking trappist craft beer ....... well now they do n't fit ..... im fat
5 #### My wife loves it . Very soft and comfortable . She likes the fact she can use it different way 's .
5 #### We have n't had this product very long , so we ca n't attest to the quality and longevity of the product . It seems to be made well and holds the 4 life jackets perfectly . The bag mounts easily and the straps are extra long which is better than too short . For now , we are enjoying the extra storage space this bag helped provide and hope the bag lasts for a few years .
5 #### Not my first Rothco apparel . I recommend this cover for the use it is intended for .
5 #### Fit like a dream ! Great for cross - training / HITT videos I do everyday . Great for walking too . Look amazing !
1 #### The service from American Athletics is poor . The shoes were the wrong size but they refused to refund the postage and wanted to charge postage again to resend the correct size . Wo n't be shopping there again .
5 #### I 'm a long time frisbee fan 30 ) + years I 've been on leagues , frisbee golf etc . I 'm a big fan of the disc craft brand . The size , weight and tacky Ness is very very close to disc craft . It 's a nice soft pliable plastic . And extremely durable . Obviously you are limited on " pop ups " and finger spins due to the fiber optic ridges underneath and the 1 inch on off button . But for all other activities it 's great . The blue lights up very well ... easy to catch and throw and batteries have around 20 hours so far and still bright . If mine broke tomorrow I 'd " prime " me another one tomorrow .
4 #### I absolutely love these shoes . They are the most comfortable and stylish around . I must have every color ! It 's like walking on a cloud , I have never found anything like them .
5 #### I bought this to help me exercise while recovering from an injury which kept me from my usual routine . I did n't expect much from some elastic bands . However , I found that I actually really like this product . I use it every day at work and at home . I hook up the band under my desk at work and workout my legs while sitting at my desk . At home I get a very good , full body workout . I like the handles and the ankle band ... I only wish it came with two ankle bands . I do n't suppose there is much difference between brands but , after using it every day for about a month now , I have to say this product is exactly what I was looking for .
5 #### Not intended for outdoor use particularly ( can be used outside , but not really for running etc . ) . Good dojo shoe for any of the whushu ( Chinese martial arts ) , Akido and Qi Ging . The men 's sizes tend to run just a little short though . They will stretch just a little in use however . The tight fit is good for competition but slightly larger is more comfortable for practice . They should have a low top and slightly rounded edges after all you keep your balance not the shoe ! This is my 3rd set , I am a Tai Chi instructor and use them pretty hard .
5 #### In love . They fit just right and are seriously awesome .
3 #### This is a very nice watch for the money , however it is much smaller than I anicipated . I am used to much larger watches , I have a Casio and a Seiko and I was a little disappointed in the size of this one . It 's very light weight and a typically " bullet - proff " Timex . No issues at all , just smaller than I anicipated .
5 #### I bought this silicone grease to seal threads and other parts on fountain pens . It has performed well . Some pens come with liquid silicone . This is much more convenient , in my opinion . When I first used this grease , I wanted to get a tiny amount on my fingertip because I know a little goes a long way . Touching the surface of the grease is akin to touching a cloud . This is a very light and fluffy grease . A little dab will do you . Do n't be surprised by the small size of the jar . This is probably a lifetime supply for most people .
5 #### these little cubes are great to have on hand , in the car , in the camping gear , etc
5 #### Bought this to put on a thompson contender 44magnum . Holds its zero well . I searched for a couple days for pricing on this scope and this was the absolute best I could find .
5 #### I was ordering a wrist watch for my nephew and somehow , this product popped up . As it looked similar to the watch that I was about to place in my shopping cart , I placed this one in the shopping cart , and did not pay attention to what I was buying . When I received it , I contacted Amazon and received an immediate return authorization label . I sent it back on Monday December 16 , 2013 and have received my refund credit already on Tuesday December 17 , 2013 . Great product ..... just clicked on the wrong one .
5 #### Nice quality . I wore it for Cub Scout pack meeting . Kids loved the rabbit !
5 #### Works great for my kids bike after I took of the training wheels
5 #### This is a great little kit that provides everything you need to take care of your handgun except the oil . You wo n't be disappointed with this product .
5 #### Bought this for my son for Christmas . He loves it . Pretty realistic looking , and a good value .
5 #### Was n't to sure about this helmet , but after wearing it for awhile it is very comfortable and offers protection incase you crash ..
5 #### I do n't normally tie down the bow and stern of my kayak for the short trip through town to the local river , but on long interstate drives , it is a common sense thing to do . These little ratchets work easily and quickly and give you the peace of mind you need at 70 mph . Highly recommended .
3 #### The straps are difficult to adjust and feel like they are tight when they really are n't . Otherwise , the product is what I expected .
5 #### I buy these for my kids , most durable and supportive shoes ever !
4 #### They look nice and are comfortable enough , wish the leather was a little softer .
5 #### Its thick and comes with a decent handle . I put a sodering iron to my handle , and slid it up and down the handle ( broad side of the sodering iron ) to made a more rough surface . Similar to stippling a glock but more smooth . I really like this knife . Even though its made in China , I like it alot . I m going to rig some paracord through the sheath and attatch it to my molle vest . Quick service too !
4 #### There is a reason that the Coleman stove has been THE stove of choice for campers since the 1920 's with very minimal design changes . In fact , the Coleman stove has remained almost completely unchanged since 1960 . The only thing better than this Duel Fuel two burner stove would be the larger unit Coleman stoves that give you more space for cooking . The Duel Fuel capability is accomplished primarily by increased diameter fuel tubing in the generator . In other words , there is no magic or rocket science that makes the use of automobile gasoline possible . It is well known in camping circles that Duel Fuel stoves will technically work with automotive gasoline , but they will become testy with use as the automotive fuel additives start gumming up the internals of the stove . Even with a Duel Fuel stove , you are well advised to use Coleman fuel unless you are in a pinch and can not find Coleman fuel . Given a choice between this liquid fuel Coleman Stove and the propane models , I prefer the liquid fuel stoves .
4 #### Great quality but size ten is a little smaller then I expected on my two year old
5 #### If you need a review of Cons , buy different shoes .
5 #### No , I 'm not a contractor . I work in a major trauma center working 24 hour shifts . My briefcase / messenger bag is my life - line when I 'm at work . I found the Bucket Boss to meet all my needs . I carry tons of stuff with me to work . Books / Guides / Stethoscope / Folders / Files / Pens / Pencils / Multi - tools / Cell Phone / PDA It 's very functional and well - built . -----------ONE YEAR UPDATE------------- The case is still going strong ! No rips , no tears . It has put up with bad weather , vomiting babies , and a nasty ex - wife ! Currently , my case weighs 8lbs 10 oz ! Yes , it 's full of stuff . ---------THREE YEAR UPDATE------------- Wow , it 's hard to believe that I 've had this case for over 3 years now . The case has held up superbly . Yeah , it 's a little dirty and scuffed up a bit but it 's like an old friend . Always there . One of the inside key clips finally broke . I had a little LED light attached to it . In the key clips ' defense I did yank a little too hard . I now carry a Netbook with me . The case swallows the Netbook with ease and keeps it protected .
5 #### These bands are great . The only room for improvement would be better carabiners / clips . The carabiner like things have sticky springs and have sharp edges which could potentially cut through the bands . It is nice to be able to attach the bands to other things and I have used a bit of rope to tie them off to poles and trees . Use a bowline around the tree and a linemans loop to secure an additional carabiner to . This set comes with an exercise guide . These bands are good when paired with the BMP exercise ball because you can focus on muscle groups . Isolate the hips for those ab exercises ! Have fun , mix it up !
5 #### I use them at the range and they do their job ! Good for use at both indoor and outdoor ranges .
5 #### fantastic helmet , amazing price , fits great and light weight . what more could you want ?
1 #### These ripped as soon as I put them on . Poor quality , do not buy .
4 #### I bought these shirts for my husband for work . Material is good heavy weight cotton . I had to return them and exchange for one size smaller . They run quite large and did not shrink with washing . He likes them but wished the pocket had a separate place for his pen .
4 #### Great shirts , but cut a bit big ... I like a bit baggy though , so I wo n't swap out . The next size down may not fit . Sefinetly liveable .
5 #### Great product . Great price . Have recommended the boots to friends . My child loves them . The parents of his friends have been asking where I got them .
5 #### I think these fuel cubes were a GREAT invention ! I 've used these for many years ! Not only for camping but I 've used them in my home when the electric was out during storms . My kitchen is all electric so having these on hands has helped many times when I needed to heat up soups etc . A very good emergency item ! Karen D.
5 #### I have a couple of these myself , and just bought 2 more for my mom as a present . They keep my jewelry visible and neat in my drawer , and I do n't know what I 'd do without them .
4 #### These pants are awesome . Build quality is incredible they will last forever . The only complaint is they are long ! Much much longer then a standard 32 .
1 #### Arrived with top section detached from lower section . There was no way I could force the two molded pieces together . I ended up getting a different brand
5 #### My husband loves these tee shirts . The sizing does run bigger he normally wears a 2xl and an XL fits him perfect ! But they look great on and are good quality for a good price
3 #### We gave the tricycle as a 3rd birthday gift for our granddaughter . She loves the bell and rides on the back porch . Sadly , the seat paint was flawed . It was n't worth sending back for a replacement , but it just was n't as good of quality as expected .
1 #### If you plan on wearing additional layers make sure you order the next size larger . While the sizing fits if you do n't wear much more than a shirt usually I have a few more layers in the cold and this makes it tight and harder to move in .
5 #### Been purchasing this bra as a gift to myself since I completed nursing school in 1989 ! I continue to enjoy the lift , comfort , support and styling even now . Also bought 2 as a gift for my sister . The smile on her face is my reward - Bali has a new fan !
1 #### Not very exited about this product , smaller than I spected and expensive for its size .
3 #### I love the length of the strap and they way that the bag is organized . You just have to be prepared to have everything falling out all of the time . I taught a class , and one of my students came into my class carrying my debit card saying that I dropped it in the parking lot . I 'm glad someone nice found it .
4 #### This is a good heavy spring . I have it on a 75 pound bag and it does flex a bit with several hits . You definitely need a spinner at some point in the chain and maybe something to wrap the metal on metal towards the mounting bracket to cut down on spring and metal noise in your floor if it is mounted in a basement . Boing .
4 #### First time buying a pair of converse . I wear a 7 in boys/ men . I thought these would fit the same . Next time I will order a half size smaller . Overall , I love them ! They arrived earlier then expected .
1 #### This costume was really junk . Total polyester with an evil smell . The cape is just cut from a piece of cloth with no stitching and the Velcro to hold it on the costume is stingy and cheap . The colors are not as shown . And , even if they were , I would not put this on my grandson to wear all day long , which he would want to do , because that is way too much polyester to put on a child for more than an hour .
5 #### Takes a while to install , but the instructions are good . Hoisting is easy , due to the high mechanical advantage of the multiple ganged pulleys . The hardware is first class ( you get what you pay for ) -- it is stainless as well , in case you are hoisting a boat in a boat - house . I recommend using a pair of gloves , as the cord can wear on the hands after a while .
2 #### Gone are the days of stepping into a pair of Keens and feeling like you 're walking on a fluffy pillow . This is my third pair in the last year . Not for good reasons . The ones I bought last year started falling apart within a month . I ordered a pair a month ago and had to return them because of size issues - I normally wear 9 1/2 and they fit more like a 10 . I got these in a 9 and if I do n't snug them up they 're ok . I 've been a Keen fan for many years , but the quality is going downhill . The footbed is much firmer than the Keens I first started wearing several years ago , there 's not any cushion to make it comfy for hiking in . The leather seems cheaper than those of years gone by , and thinner . The strap above the heel rubs uncomfortably . Unfortunately I have n't found any other sport sandals I like the features of enough to switch from Keen , but they should n't be resting on their laurels .
4 #### Love Smartwool socks . Comfy , warm , good fit and seem to last .
3 #### Heavy with a rocker panel focus and a short focal length . If you are birding in your backyard , go for it . If you are looking at more than a two acre space or seeking something for astronomy use , forget it .
5 #### Initially , I worried that these pads would be too small , but that 's not the case at all . They 're adjustable ... and fit my daughter two years ago when she was six , and still fit her fine today . In that time they 've withstood multiple spills from the skateboard . They 're scuffed , but have suffered no cracks , chips , dents or other damage . I 'm very pleased that such a minor investment in safety has lasted this long ( and should continue to last for several more years ) .
5 #### Purchased these for my wife as she has a similar pair that is wearing out . She has feet are difficult to fit and these fit perfectly without pressure on sensitive portions of her feet .
5 #### BEST . SHOES . EVER . I bought two pairs in different colors- black n ' white and the pink and white ... They have AWESOME support for whatever you use them for .. I have one for work and the other for training / running / etc in ...
4 #### Glad to find non control top pantyhose . These are not restricting , fit fine and well price . They do run easily , though so I knocked off one star .
5 #### I am a rock star . Period . And when we are on stage blasting out rock anthems , you need equipment that is durable , easy to use , and will not let you down . That is the case with this whistle . There are a few songs that absolutely NEED a whistle . Guns - n - Roses ' Paradise City is one of them . Playing that song without the signature whistle part in the beginning is , well , inconceivable ! Now , add to that using both hands to breathe fire with a guitar or bass , and you have a real dilemma on your hands . Well , never fear . The fine folks at FOX 40 have answered my prayers . How can you hold a whistle in your mouth when your hands are occupied without the fear of losing or swallowing it ? Enter the " Mouth Grip . " FOX 40 has put a piece of silicone or some other magic space - age material around the whistle , which allows you to keep it in your mouth without fear of it flying away for good . No more worrying about being like Axl Rose , this whistle has you covered . So , if you are a rock god like myself and ca n't handle the thought of losing your precious whistle at the most inopportune time , this is the whistle for you . Look no further . Sound , tone , timbre , and the mouth grip . What more can you ask . Go ahead and kick out the jams , prospective rocker , and do it with confidence !
5 #### I have great buns for a 64 year old cowboy and my do the women stare me down in these . Fit like a glove without the uncomfortable fit that I have with Levis and I used to like levis
4 #### I have been buying merrells since I started w foot problems . These are great but I wish the top of the shoe was alittle wider . At the end of a 10 hr day , it starts to rub . Not a big deal and no band aid needed .maybe as I break them in it wo n't be an issue . Highly recommend merrell - I wo n't wear anything else !
5 #### Love these shoes ! Super comfortable and I love all the fun colors :)
5 #### Good fit , ample size including the suspenders for a 6 ft 4ins tall man . I recommend it .
4 #### Cute little set for the office or your kiddos , though if you 're going to give to a child , I would recommend getting a second one ! The stick is lightly padded , which should limit the damage done , but it still smarts if someone whacks your with it with enough force ! It is really a bummer it only comes with one stick , as pretty much all the fun is in playing with someone else !
5 #### Great exercise band . Seems sturdy and well made . Door anchor and user guide are great suppliments for this product !
5 #### Makes docking a breeze ...... no more long ropes , got ta have it !
5 #### This is a must if you enjoy frizbee . Buy it and leave it in your car for those random nights of shenanigans
4 #### Fits well enough . A little too snug / not quite long enough but worth buying .
5 #### Great case . Fits my ID badge and has a little room to spare for a key or some gum . Great size for work .
5 #### I have owned several timex watches the last 40 years and find them to be an excellent watch for the money . The Expedition I just purchased follows in the same manner . Would I purchase this watch again ? Absolutely !
5 #### Very lightweight , good material . Most useful and practical for storing / transporting balls used in a summer camp . Very satisfied .
5 #### This was advertised for an adult , but was way too small for me ! Should be sized as a child 's ...... gave as a gift .
5 #### these are really nice socks and i recommend splurging on a few pairs specifically for hiking . my feet stay dry and comfortable throughout the hike .
5 #### Better than some of the ones I 've found in stores . I use these binders frequently moving current players in and out of various books based on my organization , thus , my binders receive a lot of use / abuse . and this has done well where as other options have torn spines or the rings have stopped lining up exactly .
3 #### I returned this item because it was to big . It was changed to a medium which is perfect . Let me know when you receive the returned package that I returned on 11/4/2013 .
5 #### Wow ! ! talk about comfort . I really , really love this sandal . I have never had a sandal feel and look wonderful . My toes are protected which is a great thing for me . I wore all day to a gathering and never once did they hurt my feet . No rubbing in any area . My feet did n't get hot either . I would recommend to everyone .
5 #### I bought this knife at the mall for $ 22 and it 's the best knife I 've ever owned , and also my favorite . I will be ordering another soon since I lost mine . This thing is extremely sharp , sharpest knife I 've ever gotten right out of the box ! The thing I loved most about it , when the blade locked into the case , you felt a very firm grab and a hear a " click " . This blade will NOT accidentally come out ..
5 #### Love using this to help my kids practice their baseball skills . It makes hitting grounders , fly balls , and even pop ups an easy task . No more miss hits with the bat when taking fielding practice with the boys .
5 #### Great cooler ! Fits bottles upright , a bonus for coolers of this size . Still made in the USA ! =) Just a note : I just happened to purchased mine at Sportmans Warehouse and it was a few bucks cheaper , not even on sale . Amazon used to be my go to place , I am finding more and more I am getting better prices other places . :-/
2 #### Sperry sizes are inconsistent throughout their range of boat shoes . The Billfish are too narrow in size Medium , where the topsiders are just fine . The Billfish are also about 1/2 size longer than the topsiders . Another gripe is that the leather seems of much lower quality than a few years ago . It 's hard and artificial feeling , so even a small error in size makes them uncomfortable .
4 #### The back is a little scratchy , but I think that will go away after a couple of washings . This bra is an old friend . So glad to find it available on Amazon . Fits well and looks good .
4 #### I initially purchased the red Thera - band a couple of years ago , but by the time I 'd figured out that tennis elbow was actually the problem and ordered the bar , my injury was already so involved that using the bar was too painful , as mentioned by one of the 2 - star reviews . I ended up going for two cortisone injections about 8 months apart . These hurt like all get - out for 24 - 48 hours following the shots . With this current flare - up / re - injury about 18 months after the 2nd cortisone shot , I tried to nip it in the bud w/ NSAIDS , which in turn caused stomach pain after a few days . Remembering that I still had the red Thera - Band around somewhere , I decided to dig it out and give it a try for a few days before calling to get another shot . I 've used it a few of times today and have experienced significant pain relief . Hoping to be able to sidestep a 3rd shot .
5 #### I buy my son black chucks every year . They are classic and cool and the price ca n't be beat . They run large so make sure you size down 1/2 size to a full size . They do not come in half sizes so my son who is a size 13 wears a 12 and they fit great .
4 #### Look great . Feel great . This got a 34 and he are a TRUE 34 . A little tight on me . Size up
4 #### This works well . My daughter loves to shoot goals to this net . I like the size because it gives her a small target and the balls return . Keep in mind the ball does not return directly to the player . The ball wildly return to different locations based on the speed and angle of the strike but it is much better than walking up to the net to collect balls . It also serves to provide practice stopping and controlling a passed ball in open field . I would have rated it 5 stars if the stakes provided worked well . The stakes are necassary to hold the net frame firm in the ground and only work for about 10 shots before having to reset the stakes . I used my tent stakes and rope to secure the net frame to the ground permanently .
5 #### Sturdy , thick fabric and it fits very nicely . These are the only shirts that the pockets have n't blown out yet ! Love them .
4 #### My husband works outside : cutting wood , doing lawn work , winter snow clearing -you get the idea . He loves his watch and I 'm replacing one we bought over a year ago , but only because he asks more of it than any low - cost watch should be expected to survive . For me , the price for this model is well worth its value . I will always have one on hand " just in case " .
5 #### These showed up in pristine condition . Perfect size as well . I m a 7.5 in womens , therefore iIordered a 5.5 in Mens .
5 #### sure its plastic but that 's what keeps the cost down and its not like its going to be used as a actual sign for traffic . the size is decent too , it is going to be just indoors so it wo n't take a lot of space on walls and also the site tells you the exact dimensions of it , so reading is fundamental folks as well it stating its made out of styrene plastic . this is a fun and cost effective way to represent your team at home . i would like to add that someone whined about the bar code being on the actual sign but mine was on the back . i have no idea if whom ever was handling it was lazy and put it it on the front or they 've made changes , beats me .
4 #### Oh these definitly work , but make the water taste absolutely terrible . But if you choice is drink something that tastes bad or , say , be dead ... Well then , looks like you 're gon na have some foul tasting water . At least you know it will be safe to drink !
3 #### The shoes look really good but they are men 's sizes and that was n't indicated in the description . I 'll have to send them back because they 're just way too big .
5 #### These were perfect for a weekend in Tahoe . Even though I officially hated skiing , I was warm and comfortable the whole time .
5 #### Love everything about it . Great addition to my BOB . Used it 2 time and it was great . One in low elevation and ones in high elevation . Compass did its job
5 #### I have these on all my rifles . They are great to use once you get the hang of them .
5 #### Works great and at the right price . I 'm not a major yoga person , but it suits my needs .
3 #### I have been wearing Carhartt for several years . I usually buy them at my local store but the Amazon price is $ 10 less and my local store would not match . The last 5 pairs of these pants I have purchased , including this pair have all been very bad on size consistency . I have worn the same size for years and up until recently there was little to no variation . But this last year or so has been pretty bad . I have seen variation 's of at least an inch in inseam & waist . For me that is the difference of pants dragging on the ground or practically falling off my waist ! I 'm not sure what is going on in the quality control department , but I 'm going to be trying the Duluth Fire hose pants now to see if they are more consistent . My co - worker swears by them .
1 #### These must have been mismarked . Very small waist and extra long length . Bad pants over all .
3 #### Not finding the buckles very reliable . Ankle weight came loose & fell off twice so far . Though they fit firmly , tend to irritate my lower ankle . Have not yet used full weights , so wonder if at that step this problem will go away . Functional , but must use with caution . Looking for options .
5 #### They are great shipped on time and just love them . My husband is using them for his powerlifting . They work great and he just loves them .
5 #### I love these . I 'm a 16 year old girl and I 'm 5'1 . I ordered a 3 and its fits perfect , I 'm usually a 5.5 - 6 in woman regular shoes
3 #### Front fender dented , no big deal should still work fine . Then got to rear wheels , pole that goes through wheels was bent causing a squeak , nothing I thought wd40 could not fix , but after allowing grandson to ride for a while I noticed the rear wheels coming out of round and appears to wobble . Grandson does not care but I wonder how long it will still be rideable .
5 #### PERFECT ! ! ! ! I bought a size smaller , gorgeous as usual , fits wverything ! ! ! I got them pretty fast too , in perfect condition ! ! ! ! ! 5 star ! ! ! I 'll buy more ! !
5 #### This is a fantastic compass , worth every penny . I hike often and this is a life - saving tool . The mirror doubles as a signal mirror and triples as a body inspection for ticks . You can feel the quality of this compass in your hand ( I have 4 compasses ) .
5 #### Great boresighter tool but not as simple and accurate as the SiteLite Ultra Mag Green Laser Professional Boresighter . The Bushnell is a great tool for the money and I would highly recommend to anyone . I know it 's used by many gunsmiths , but the SiteLlite unit is used by the military . It really depends on your what you want to spend or your personal preferences .
5 #### The oars are absolutely cheesy ; however , it still merits five stars because of the value ! I went out on a lake nearby , paddled across with those lousy oars and back ... it works !
2 #### Good looking shoes , but ... after just 1 month , the glue is failing at the edge of the shoe where the foot bends . The shoe still looks perfect , but I had to use shoe goo to fix it . Seems like for the price , and for as long as this style has been around it should n't so this ? !
5 #### I purchased this set for my new Breville convection / toaster oven and absoluely love them all ! ! ! ! Excellent quality , perfect size . I have yet to use the broiler pan , but have found the muffin pan and the cookie sheet to be exactly what is needed in my toaster oven when I use it , instead of my ovens , to bake .
2 #### Once again from Amazon ... a watch with a short watch band . That 's one thing i like about going in a store is they have special long watches you can try on ... not having any luck here . Otherwise nice ! Band barely meets together on my wrist .
5 #### This is a must have for finding the tucked away backroads of Arizona ....
3 #### These are as good as you can expect a fuel tab to be . It burns really hot but does n't seem to stay lit very long . I could barely get a GSI cup of water boiling ( with a lid on it ) using an Esbit pocket stove .. It was a pretty cold night but I was surprised it did n't get to a full boil . These definitely have their place in a pack , they 're easy to light , weigh nothing and do n't take up much space . I use them mostly to get a fire started . Break one in half and stuff it under your tinder pile and you 're good to go . If you 're just camping I guess one and a half tabs will get your water boiling nicely but if it 's long term or you do n't have the space to waste , they 're just better emergency back ups . Also , the foil liner is very thin and if it 's ripped and they 're exposed to air the clock starts ticking on how long they 're usable . I run a piece of clear packing tape over the foil and it makes them much more durable .
4 #### Arrived on time . I probably should have gone with a 7.5 instead of an 8 because they do seem a little big , but if I wear thick socks they are fine . Also , they can sometimes make a very annoying squeaky noise when I run on certain surfaces so I 'm trying to get them worn in . Over - all , I am satisfied with my purchase !
5 #### Great , thicker fall/ winter type of shirt . I order XLL because I 've been over weight and it 's big . Perhaps the XL I 've order will fit me better .
5 #### I really wanted a white gas stove , but they 're bigger dollars than I could justify . This is certainly less hassle . It appears to be built as well as the Coleman products I grew up with . If so , it 'll last longer than I will .
4 #### This is lightweight , durable , about the right size ( probably on the smaller size of right ) , and the battery is going strong about 16 months in . The strap is just alright ; looks fine , but there 's just enough leather to make it less than ideal for sweaty sport activities , and enough nylon to make it not especially dressy . Helpful tip : This may be obvious , but if the band gets a little funky and you need to clean it , do n't soak it in near - boiling water , as it re - cures the leather , making it firm and full of scratchy spikes . I replaced the original band with&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/BARTON - Quick - Release - Choose - Color - Width-16mm-18mm-20mm-22mm - Chocolate - Brown-20mm - Watch - Band - Strap / dp / B01EKWRPBA / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">BARTON Quick Release - Choose Color & Width ( 16 mm , 18 mm , 20 mm , 22 mm ) - Chocolate Brown 20 mm Watch Band Strap</a>&nbsp;and it 's a big improvement anyway . Regarding the noise , it 's not noticeable in your average daily waking environment , but in a quiet room when you 're trying to sleep , it 's just loud enough to be maddening . I tend to put mine in a drawer or under some clothes at night to muffle the sound .
5 #### This bag is perfect for anyone that can not carry a bag on your shoulder or neck . I have medical issues that find it difficult to carry any heavy objects . The bag is very roomy , just right not to over stuff .
1 #### Not at all stable ! The circle frame comes in four parts , and when put together they did not create a flat circle . When together only 2 of the 6 feet hit the floor at any given moment . Not stable and not at all safe for my 2.5 year old son to bounce on . This is going back .
5 #### I 've been using it for some time and the quality is superb . Also , I 'm a tall guy and the extra length has been very useful . I no longer need to have my head or feet on the floor .
5 #### My 8 yr old son loves his scooter again . The rear wheel on his original scooter was so worn out from using the brake that it was making a noise every time he used it . I decided it was time to replace his wheels . These wheels worked great and come with their own bearings ( so you do not have to reuse the old bearings ) . I believe the bearings are rated ABEC 5 ( though I can not be 100 % certain ) . ABEC 5 are what are found on most skateboards and scooters in the US . Some models from China are rated ABEC 3 which are to be avoided . These wheels roll about the same as the original razor wheels , which is why I 'm inclined to believe they are ABEC 5 . Overall , I am very satisfied with these new wheels .
4 #### I like the Converse shoes I bought . A little extra room but , they fit fine .
5 #### I 'm a size 8 women 's shoe , 5.5 size was perfect ! ( I already knew that I needed a half - size down for converse )
2 #### The two main reasons I do n't like this wallet are : ( 1 ) It 's very hard to get cash bills out of the too - deep pocket , and ( 2 ) it 's almost impossible to get cards out of the card slots once you 've shoved them in . I bought a new clutch - style wallet and discarded this one after I 'd used it for quite a while .
3 #### They 're oversized in every dimension to the point of being comical . Washed and dried in hot cycles multiple times trying to get them to shrink , which they did slightly but are still huge . Otherwise , they 're well made pants .
5 #### My five year old loves this and uses it for pretend camping . It is sturdy and well made . Lots of fun .
5 #### As usual - Converse delivers ! My daughter absolutely loves her new pair of Chuck Taylor Hi Sneaker Navy Converse . It fits perfectly and the navy is perfect for neutral outfits and jeans . The price was also great ! Disappointed that it was delivered one day after the scheduled delivery date , but she was happy when she finally received them .
5 #### A Pink shotgun sock ... really ! We women love it and the guys do n't mess with our shotguns .
5 #### love love love these fits good got them for a good price great for this time of weather thanks amazon
2 #### Very difficult to inflate and deflate . I bought this and a self inflating mat to test out the difference . I ended up not even using this as I did n't have a pump to inflate it . If you buy one , make sure you have something otherwise you will end up light headed from trying to blow the thing up . The valve also made it very difficult to deflate . I think it will work for some but I found it more nuisance than it was worth . Somewhat heavy and awkward when compared to the self inflating mats . If you have a few extra $ I would spend a little more on a better one . I will probably give this one away or use it as a pool float .
5 #### I got this for my mother . She needed a sturdy wallet to keep all of her cards , pictures , and cash in . She seems very happy with it . It 's big , but not too big to fit into her smaller - sized purse . She rejected several previous wallets , so I 'm glad I finally found one she likes .
2 #### These were my first pair of Converse . I 'm going to have to assume these are not reflective of the brand overall because uh , these were among the more uncomfortable shoes I have ever worn in my life . They seemed to fit as expected . Roomy in the toe , not at all difficult to get on , expectedly snug around the ankle . But I found it was more comfortable to stand on my hard wood floor in SOCKS than it was to stand around in these shoes . I 'm not entirely sure whose idea it was to put a hard layer of stitching right on the back of the ankle , but THIS IS THE WORST THING . My first time wearing them I walked to dinner and back in them - no more than an hour round trip - and on the way back I could barely walk right because the shoes had already torn the skin off the backs of my ankles . Through my socks . I have of course had to wear in shoes before , but you ca n't wear in something you 're afraid to put on again . They do look good . It 's a classic sneaker look . But there are plenty of other shoes that look good and feel better .
5 #### I am extremely happy with these converse Chuck Taylor shoes . These shoes are fashionable and comfy . Love them and I definitely will recommend
5 #### Fit Great been wearing hem about 10 hours a day for almost a week and no complaints !
3 #### Not a bad shirt but I 'm never buying Carhartt shirts from the internet again . Too inconsistent in sizing and material . They are a " must buy in person " item for me from now on .
2 #### These are easily the sheerest pantyhose I 've ever tried , so if that is what you are looking for , then you may like them . But I found them too sheer -- they were too literally like wearing nothing at all , you could still see every small imperfection on my legs . They also were not very soft , and very delicate -- mine already had a hole in one leg when they arrived , I tried them on simply to see if it would be worth ordering another pair , and I think not . By comparison , Hanes Silk Reflections Silky Sheer are much softer and while still sheer , provide a bit more coverage .
5 #### Easy to install and use ! A economical way to improve your shooting ! I field tested these for Ladies in Camo and would sincerely recommend them ! [ ... ]
5 #### 6'4 " and a 34 inch inseam here . This shirt fits great . I will buy again .
5 #### As a new assistant coach , I wanted aluminum batons for the team to practice the relay ; these are exactly like the batons the head coaches have .
5 #### I highly recommend theses bands ! I love the door anchor that comes with this set also ! I previously used a cheap set of resistance bands ( Gold 's Gym , I think ) and these are so much better . Such a good workout with these ! !
5 #### I was n't to sure about them when they arrived . But they are my favorite pair of summer pants . I get compliments all the time and everyone asks where I got them . They fit well , make me look like I have a back side , I have a flat rear ... so it gives it the illusion of a hump .
5 #### I was so surprised at how good it was and the ease of preparation . After a long day exploring , I did not feel like firing up the barbi and cooking chicken . Since I was on a solo trip , I pulled out the Sweet and Sour pork . Never having tried a meal in a pouch , I was more than a little dubious . I followed the directions . I poured the boiling water into the pouch , waited the correct amount of time and dinner was served ! It was not like eating at your favorite Chinese place but it was very good . Now I want to try the other Mountain House meals . I also loved the clean up :)
5 #### great set of boots , great quality and look great , they were a little to tall for me but that is a me problem , there was no false advertising . a great product , a great deal .
4 #### Shoe quality is very high , but not the same as the desired color
5 #### We have a 2009 ( 2nd generation ) Toyota Highlander . With all of the seats in use , there is precious little space behind the 3rd row . This cooler is a perfect fit , and can be opened ( just barely ) by 3rd row occupants . Two of these coolers would fit side - by - side behind the 3rd row , to allow for more storage . This cooler is n't very large inside , but it provided space for sandwich ingredients , and kept everything ice - cold on a 12 - hour drive in the middle of Summer.c
5 #### I bought this to keep with me when riding my bicycle , hiking , riding my motorcycle ... etc . You never know when you might need a device to call for help in an emergency . Easy light cheap . Everyone should have a few of these around .
5 #### fun . kids stopped playing with them but they made it through their rough housing
5 #### Fun for all the teens at summer camp ! This got the adults in the game too .
2 #### I bought these for my six year olds school shoes because kswiss were always my go to shoes . I think my son is just as rough on his shoes as any other kid and the rubber soles are separating and the laces have frayed pretty badly . I do n't think I 'll buy these again .
5 #### It fits a little big at first , but it does shrink some .
3 #### I like Timberland the first time I saw it and my wife like it too . Since we both have too little feet to choose a audit boots , I ordered two kid 's boots . For this boots , it looks very nice from outside while when I wear it on , I found some place was not made up well for the right foot . It looks ugly and rub my feet making my foot hurt . Since I live in China and I wander it will become better after weeks wearing , I did n't send it back . It 's stranger that the other boots I bought for my wife is perfect everywhere . I do n't know what happened , just because my boots made in Cambodia but my wife 's boots made in China ?
5 #### I gave these to my husband for a gift and he loves them . They are the perfect color and look of the " old school " shoe .
4 #### Purchased for my husband . He wanted a watch with a bright light and good size numbers . This filled both of those needs . Easy to set was also something he was looking for . Only shows the date on face not month . Would of given it 5 stars if it had this feature . Otherwise he loves this watch .
5 #### Tasted pretty good for what it is , dried food . On our hiking trip it was nice to have a hot meal . We made it with boiled creek water and the pineapple had an interesting but pleasant texture . Definitely enough for 2 - 3 people !
5 #### It 's hard to find shorts like these that have pockets for my cell phone when I 'm doing yard work
4 #### These work great and get the job done . They are not ideal if you have a larger head or plan on wearing these for multiple hours ..
5 #### Very good quality , exact size , very confotable , yet reasonably priced , in short the purchased product meets my expectations of price / quality
4 #### this is a classic we had the older version and as we could get a repair kit for it we just bought the new model . Well made and good value we use it car camping and have found it to work well the hardest thing is getting it to simmer as when you turn the burner down it creeps back up to a higher flame .
2 #### I was disappointed to open this on Christmas and see that the playing surface is not wood at all , but a cheap piece of flimsy pressboard with a vinyl printed surface on both sides . I had a Carrom board a a child and they used to be made out of wood . If I was to buy it over again I would look on ebay for a used one from the 70s . The assortment of playing pieces also leave something to be desired , although the Carrom rings themselves are fine . It is all the other pieces which are very cheap .
5 #### This has always been my favorite type of wallet . In the stores , they have all kinds of strange styles of wallets , but Buxton is a timeless classic . You just ca n't find this quality in stores .
5 #### I 'm a fan of Converse shoes I have several of them so I do n't know that there 's a lot that I can offer to put in here . Either you like converse tennis shoes or you do n't . They fit normal very true to size and snug so if they ever do n't have your size I would go with the next half size up .
5 #### attaches easily but instructions could be better on how to apply it
5 #### These shorts are awesome . Danskin always uses the best fabrics for their clothing . They launder very well . I would recommend ordering a size smaller than what you normally wear because there is some stretching of the shorts due to the fabric content .
5 #### Only one ball had any signs of any imperfections . Great for BP !
5 #### My son loves these and the fit is great . He has numerous pairs !
5 #### Great costume for my four year old ! He loved it !
5 #### Great tricycle . This is just like the one I had in the 1960 's . Same solid materials ( unbelievable ) . This is a must - have for the grandkids .
1 #### Item received was not an Official Rawlings major league baseball . Cover was made of plastic , decription said leather . Sending them back for a refund .
3 #### a little on the small size for a busted small women
5 #### Great mocs and love the gunsmoke color . Very nice heel cushioning and arch support . Like the one piece toe to upper design ... no seams in the front at all . Only thing to adjust to was a little pressure from the upper , right where it connects to the elastic - dug into the soft skin on top of arch . Seems to be gone when not standing around and expect this to wear in . Great looking moc that feels good on your feet .
5 #### Been collecting Raiders stuff these for my nephew for years , he loves them .
4 #### I purchased this Timex Easy Reader , Indiglo , expansion band watch because I wanted a basic timepiece that I could wear at night to easily check the time if I was awakened . This watch lives up to my needs perfectly . It is a comfortable , lightweight , basic and functional time , date and day watch , that still looks good in everyday use . I am docking one star for the following reasons : Crystal seems to be acrylic . No instructions included for setting date and day . ( had to go to internet ) . Date position on the stem is difficult to find , and day of the week setting requires rotating the hands through a 24 hour cycle until the correct day of the week shows . Otherwise , I recommend this product for being exactly what it proports to be , and I am sure it will give years of service . If not , I 'll check back .
2 #### A fake Wrangler Jean , or cheapest made . Had visable seams and not authenic Wrangler waist tag at belt -loop area . Had a W on each back pocket . This was NOT what was described on screen ; I ordered these jeans before from this site and had received the Authenic Wrangler Jeans .
5 #### I have many post style earrings . This jewlery organizer has enough compartments to hold my collection . Varied sizes of compartments , work well for larger earrings , or grouping several together or use for large pendants .
4 #### I bought these to take camping and hiking with me . They are big but that was my mistake . The lenses focus very well and it helps me see animals that are farther away . I felt like I was able to get within feet of elk , moose , big horn sheep , and bears . I 'd buy another smaller pair to take with me hiking from the same company .
1 #### If I could get it to work I would give it 5 stars .
5 #### Size 4 fits my 11 month perfect with a little room . I love it
5 #### Very comfortable and I received quite a few compliments . Great shoes !
4 #### I received a used product . It is off white and has sweat stains around it . I read in another review that the Mizuno VS-1 is a favorite for women 's volleyball and that is why I ordered this one . The medium size does fit , and seems to be excellent coverage that does n't restrict your movement . I am 5'2 with athletic build . I would have liked to keep this item , if it was a new item . The package itself is a resealable ziplock style bag , so I can see how if someone returned the item , shipping handler would not know that it has been used . I am only deducting 1 star for the sweat stain , but overall it is a good product . I am returning these .
5 #### Love my high tops but always have to put in arch supports
3 #### Guess I did n't mind the description , I thought it was the actual size of a stop sign , not even close .
5 #### You ca n't beat the price of this kickstand , which is super easy to install . I was worried about it fitting my 5 - year - old daughter 's tiny Disney Princess bike , but it fine . It 's adjustable , so it would probably also fit my adult - size mountain bike . I sprayed a little WD-40 on it , which made it much easier to open .
5 #### Great price and a great fit for any commuting cyclist .
5 #### Fits me perfect , and so I bought another one ! I need it for these very cold harsh winters in the NE . It does smell a bit , so wash it first . :)
5 #### I am pleasantly surprised at the comfort of these shoes . They are relatively easy to put on and can be worn walking or just around the house . They come up high on the ankle but the material is soft and not bothersome . I also love the color . This is my second pair of Keen shoes and they are becoming my favorite brand for comfort .
5 #### Came before the due date , and seem to work like they said
5 #### There are the original black style converse . No arch support and pretty narrow , but that 's what converse are supposed to be like . Could n't be happier with my purchase !
5 #### Captains of Crush should be the go to company for anyone wishing to improve hand strength . From archers to weight lifting this is already improving my grip !
5 #### Great for gifts to husband and son . Both enjoy these .
3 #### I liked the amount of earring holders but would have liked an attached lid rather then a plastic sit on top cover .
5 #### Molded to the contour of your foot . Great material , antimicrobial , looks awesome . No need to ever buy another type of sandal . I also paid about $ 40 less than you can find them almost anyplace else . I waited about two years to buy these . When the price came down due to the time of year or a holiday special , I jumped at it . I could not be happier . I found as did others that they run a bit small so rather than get a 9 , I bought 9 1/2 and they are perfect . When you first get them they are a bit stiff but with each time you wear them , they start to soften up and mold to your foot . All pros , no cons .
5 #### It 's a gift for my niece . They shipped it fast , and it was packaged well . It looks well made like most Converses are , and I remember having one of these in high school , now she 's in high school and they still love it .
5 #### This is the second Bungee Dockline I have purchased and they are very handy . A handy tip is if they are a bit long just run them through the dock rail and back to your boat 's cleat .
5 #### It 's so simple , just point and shoot . It 's kinda fun . I killed about 10 flies in my house today ! !
5 #### Received it a head of time - did use it during hunting season - great product - it did the job .
5 #### My 8 year old loves this , took her a little to get used to having a motor and there is a slight jerk when the motor kicks in but once she got used to it there was no stopping her . I like that there is n't too much power , she ca n't go too fast .
4 #### So i do n't know how comfortable these are seeing as they are for my 1 year old , but she does n't complain , and she does if her shoes hurt her .
5 #### Great buy is very comfortable and for the price is impossible to beat . Is a hassle to blow up without pump but still can be achieved in around 5 through 10 minutes . For under 10 dollars to get me of the ground it 's good in my book .
5 #### Really great exercise bar . Bought for my elbow injuries ... unfortunately , the rehab exercises did n't work , but no fault of the flexbar !
4 #### I ordered the medium pants for my son , who is 8 , and had to send them back for the small . Other than running large , these are great . He was warm and dry playing in the snow .
5 #### Perfect fit , the original lasted 11 years lets see how long this one does .
5 #### I was looking for a replacement for the brand of jeans that I usually wear and thought I would try Wrangler . I 've found my new favorite brand of jeans ! They are well made from quality material , the fit exactly the way I like and are available in the colors I prefer . A perfect fit in every category !
5 #### Love my new Nike 's . It 's been years since I 've been able to wear them ( sizing changed years ago and I just could n't wear them any more ) but now the new styles and sizing are perfect . Lightweight shoe with tons of style . The Fog color is just what I was looking for ... not black and not neon ! I wore them to participate in Relay for Life ( 24 hour walk ) and they held up great !
4 #### first of all , i am a female and using my husband 's account . i 'm a size 7 and i bought these in size 5 men 's size but could 've gotten away with size 4.5 in men 's . the color is excellent , brighter than pictured here . i 'm contemplating if i should keep them or not .
5 #### Very light , self adjusting , and makes me feel safe . A great purchase ! !
5 #### Love these tights ! They fit perfectly , and stay in place . I do n't find myself messing with them , as I would with many other tights and nylons . The grey color looks good with many of my skirts and dresses . I like the slight sheerness of them . My legs are pretty in these tights .
5 #### Love it ! I have a smaller wrist and it fits perfectly .
5 #### fantastic quality as expected , soap or wax the zipper as it 's slightly sticky when new . The bag will drain through 2 large holes on the bottom
5 #### A tiny bit large but that 's good . Held up well in laundry without being misshapen as so many lighter weight shirts do .
3 #### When I first purchased this I would of given it 5 stars . Excellent watch , but after 3 months the battery died , which I can understand that . But when I went up to have the battery changed , The person realized that the knob for the adjustment of the time had fallen off . This was not a watch for myself it was for my mom . I expected a sturdier watch from Timex .
4 #### My daughter wanted a watch that was easy to read & that was waterproof . I wanted one she could learn from . I think this is a great combination . She loves the color too . My only complaint is that the words " minute " and " hour " on the watch hands are so small you ca n't really read them .
5 #### Comfortable , slimming and durable . I 'm very pleased , and I absolutely LOVE that I can order them and have them in two days . No more making time to go to a department store ! I wish I could add them to my Subscribe and Save list .
5 #### Purchased the product for my daughter , a jogger , to jog with during the cold winter of upstate New York . She finds the Under Armour Women 's ColdGear Frosty Tight to be very comfortable , light and warm .
4 #### They work great , but changing batteries SUCKS ... designer needs a stick up his butt
5 #### I wear this around my hips under my shirt during hikes and runs and it 's very comfortable and flat . I can fit my ipod shuffle , ID , phone and car key in it easily . Everyone that I exercise with asks me where I got it and ends up buying one . I think there are some bad versions out there that are not as comfortable or discreet . Who wants everyone knowing you 're wearing a fanny pack ! This is not the 1980 's version .
5 #### Chucks are always a half size off but take that into account and you 're kicking it old school
5 #### We have a dirt driveway . Therefore , we can pick up a lot of dirt on our shoes . This brush has saved my frustration of dirt all the time in the entry . A worker at our house found it very good for cleaning off his shoes . He said he was going to purchase one for himself .
5 #### These are so comfortable ! ! I wore them to work and had been wearing these Alpine similar sandals before - needless to say the Keens are so much more comfortable . My feet felt great at the end of the day .
5 #### Color : DAY 20 Naturale TG2 Size : Small These pantyhose by Veneziana comes in 3 different colors to choose from : Black , Natural and Cappucinno . I have the Natural one and it is really more of a Nude Color . The material feels silky and luxurious . The waistband is soft and comfortable and offer adequate control . They are sheer and opaque pantyhose that does not feel thin and easy to rip . I appreciate that it is a product import from Italy and the size is true to one I typically purchase in the USA . In conclusion , I rate this Women Pantyhose by Veneziana 5 out of 5 Stars . It is a comfortable and a quality product I recommend . * * * I received this complimentary product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review . I am not affiliated with the company and did not receive any compensation from them . * * *
4 #### I had to buy an arch support pad to accommodate the shoe . The additional arch support pad and the Birki shoes are now a winning combination .
5 #### I bought this for my vacation and the temperatures were all over the place , including during same day . The pointelle knit is very pretty and feminine . The shirt is very thin and see - through but it does add noteceable warmth to your clothes . This shirt is 100 % silk and silk is known for being comfortable in wide range of temps . I really felt that - it kept me warm in cold and cooled me off when it was warming up . It is also extremely comfortable against your skin . I wish the neck was cut lower ( and wider ) though . If you compare this shirt to L.L.Bean 's it is definitely thinner and snags more easily . It 's also 3 ( three ) times cheaper . I think the sizing chart is very accurate . My chest is 36 " and I ordered Small . It fits close to the body with a little stretch ( exactly how I wanted it ) . I could have bought a medium for a more roomy fit . Size XS ( 4 - 6 ) S ( 6 - 8) M ( 10 - 12 ) L ( 14 ) XL ( 16 ) Chest 32 to 34 34 to 36 36 to 38 38 to 41 43 to 45 Sleeve 28 to 29 29 to 30 30 to 31 31 to 32 32 to 33 Waist 24 to 26 26 to 28 28 to 30 31 to 33 35 to 37 Hips 32 to 34 34 to 36 36 to 38 38 to 41 43 to 45
4 #### Does the job . Great price . Fits 1 1/4 " slings perfectly . Make sure to keep them oiled as they are blued not parkerized .
5 #### This costume fits big on my small 5'4 " frame , but it did n't stop me from winning the costume contest ! Mooray ! ! !
5 #### I like to use this stuff on the door seals of my cars . It keeps them soft and fresh . They do n't dry out in weather and sun . They look nice after application , too .
4 #### We kept reading all the reviews on how you should buy at least a size bigger and we did , WAY to big for my son . We are going to have to send them back ,
5 #### The shoe you 're buying is the real deal . Not sure why the other views say otherwise . It 's completely legit .
4 #### Last hunting season I nearly froze every time out . I redid most of my hints clothes and pick up a pair of these . They are very warm and get the job done in that department , they are very very bulky . I could n't figure out how to pack them in and out . And one they were on my feet in the stand , there was n't much room left on the platform . Not sure if I 'll keep them , just much to deal with . They are warm if you can figure out how to get there and back with them .
5 #### Superior to a nylon net for an outdoor basket . This was a bit of a pain to install as it was all tangled together when it came in , but a bit of patience and a pair of pliers got this installed in about 15 min . Best part is , I know this will outlast my last 5 nylon nets combined ! Great product , highly recommended !
5 #### Love this jacket ... hate the hood ... tried the large because everyone says runs big . Fit perfect , but no room for layering , so I tried the xl .. a little too big .. I 'm 5'7 " 220lbs . Only thing I really did n't like was the bulk of the hood . I have the coat version of this and it 's great , no hood . I wanted something shorter with the knit waistband . quality of these jackets is amazing .
3 #### Got ok but these run narrow so I ordered B 's they are no wider than all my regular width shoes .
5 #### Perfect nice mat that I bought to replace an old broken one .
4 #### The waterproof box is good for holding anything that you want to protect from moister or water . Documents , and other materials that are sensitive to humidity . They have an O ring seal to ensure that water does not penetrate . The clear box allows you to see what you placed in them if you have multiple boxes . If you add a Silica gel packet ( to absorb any humidity that is in the container when you seal it ) , it will be a completely dry space !
5 #### Bought these to play with my dog . He loves them and for the price they are hard to beat
5 #### Bought these for my niece for xmas . she loves them . look super cute with her skinny jeans
5 #### These were purchased for my daughter , she loves them . Very comfortable .
5 #### Always order half size smaller than you normally wear . Love Converses !
4 #### good and useful product , meets most of the needs for a pocket knife . It is good for gift as well .
4 #### bra is super cheap when it comes to material to have the bali name ... supports as well as can be , but would not waste my money on buying this style again . should be on clearance rack or featured at much lower price
5 #### It 's perfect for my daughter 1 year old , color , quality and size ... I like
5 #### Boonie hats are a good investment ! Whether you use them for camping , working in the yard or for training out in the field . This is the hat , it fits well and is comfortable .
5 #### This Turle Fur neckwarmer makes a huge difference when riding to work on cold mornings . It definitely keeps you warm if you have a full - face helmet to complement it . The microfleece is very soft , but be sure to wash it first or else little loose bits will stick to your beard or 5 o'clock shadow .
5 #### Decent pellet gun cleaning kit . I use it on my .22 break barrel rifle . Have nt tried it on my .177 .
5 #### I love the huntsman . It is probably the best and most practical of the victorinox knives . I use it everyday for general use ( like opening letters & packages , removing splinters , cutting rope ...... ) . It is also usefull on the campsite . You will find the can opener , corkscrew , scissors , and the 2 knife blades to be your best friends in the campsite . Also with a little imagination you can use it for just about anything ( they are so simple yet so amazing ! ) . When I go camping I bring this knife along , plus I bring my KA - BAR stacked - leather handled bowie knife as a bigger tool ( I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE BOWIE ! ! ! ) . When I have my huntsman in my pocket and my bowie on my belt they make camping , fihing , hunting , ect .... so much easier ... and alot more fun ! I own many knives , but my huntsman , executive , and little classic victorinox knives hold a very special place in my collection .
1 #### I need to return them and do n't know where to send them back . The 8 1/2 were too small and the 9 were tood sloppy . I guess it is just not the shoe for me . I need to find out where to send them back . Please contact me at ccbednark@gmail.com . Thank you .
5 #### Amazon has " fixed " the photo issue mentioned in another review , so it 's now " what you see is what you get " ... and that 's a superb 1 " nylon web sling made in the U.S.A. with Talon 's very nice " QD " type swivels ... and I would be remiss not to mention the incredible ease with adjusting this sling , as with all the Super Sling products . Needless to say , this was not the first Super Sling as I 've bought ... the previous examples sold me on this product !
4 #### I 've had this in my boot every day since it arrived . Clips on good and was easy to sharpen ( moderately sharp on arrival ) . The only problem is the sheath is way too tight ... takes too much effort to draw it . I simply oil the sheath every time I oil the blade .
5 #### great quality , innovative , makes 5gal bucket a very versatile item . comfortable seat to use for working on tasks around house
5 #### This is an excellent update to the classic converse design , Great matte black color looks great with anything you wear !
5 #### These arrows are great they areas good sas the more expensive ones .cut them to size fletch them put the inserts in and go shooting.be impressed
5 #### I bought this green one and ended up buying the blue one too for less resistance . You do n't realize how tight 10 pounds can be until you try to do arms . Make sure you check the color guide before purchasing !
5 #### Amongst our families and friends , we have avid long time experienced soccer league players who were looking for additional training equipment to use at their homes for days in between soccer league practice and league competitive games , and this is one of the products they chose , and as far as we know , they are continuing to use these items , but always tethered to poles and trees , to avoid tangling themselves up in the tether unnecessarily , but they feel it has added to their performance and at home fun times , and to be able to play with others of their family members and friends who are not yet ready to participate in a league or have no time or interest to do so that seriously but still wish to play the game casually . We believe they also purchased soccer balls through Amazon for backup various practice times and have been satisfied with those purchases as well . Thank you , Amazon . Blessings .
5 #### Grandson 3 years old . Rides it almost every day . Great gift
5 #### Bought to use for rehab on my shoulder based off the recommendation of my trainer . Packaging : Unboxing this was a pleasure . Everything comes nicely enclosed in a carry pouch which makes traveling with it really easy . First Impression : The material that the bands as well as the attachments is made to last . So far I have not found a single area where poor decisions were made on design or implementation . I have been using this product 3 - 4x a week for the past few months in parallel to a normal weight lifting routine . I have found that in doing so , my overall strength has increased as well as the rehab on my elbow and shoulder complete . Since starting to use this product , I have purchased a second one to keep in my office at work for days where I am unable to get out or when my elbow / shoulder are feeling blah .
5 #### Great thick mats ; I use them for stretching on my hardwoods and they double as sleeping mats for kids when needed .
4 #### I have several pairs of Chucks . They are my favorite tennis shoe . This pair fits like the others , but where the others are rather light weight , this pair is heavier than the others . It feels like maybe the rubber sole weighs it down more fore some reason . I do n't really notice it when I 'm wearing them , but I still find it a little strange . Other than that , I like them .
4 #### I really like these . o post a 5 star they would be adjustable . That would be ideal . They work great on the boat not and would buy again
5 #### For the money best Jean ever . Fits correct with relaxed fit regular maybe a little small in the crotch ...
5 #### Great item ! Bought for my wife and she absolutely loves them
5 #### My 2 year old daughter loves Cinderella and all these playsets . This set includes 2 Cinderellas ( one in a white wedding dress and one in her blue ball gown ) , the stepmother , her 2 stepsisters , the fairy godmother , Prince Charming , and the mice in the basket . I love how detailed these plastic / PVC figures are . For example , you can see the key the stepmother has near her pocket , the clothing ripples , and even individual yarn strands in the mice basket . All the figures are brightly colored and durably made . I love that my daughter can act out the story with the figures as well as create her own story with them . The only minor criticism I have is that some of the detailing was messy . Cinderella had lipstick that was smeared across half her face like a clown and also her sister Anastasia was cross eyed , but other than that , we love this set !
1 #### I have one Gaiam mat I got12 years ago and it still works like new . I wanted to have some other colors to choose from so I got Granite storm(black snd gray ) . And this new mat is definitely different than the one I got 12 years ago . This new mat is slippery . Unfortunately I ca nt practice on this and have to return .
5 #### We love the quality , price and good stuff my wife makes with them . The value is tops .
4 #### It was JUST A BIT tight ( probably for the best ) otherwise great material . I would more if i have to .
5 #### Great pair of stockings . Fit was just right and feel was really nice and a great buy .
5 #### I thought these should be much larger . I read , " ... 8 " Round Target ... " and thought I had ordered the right size . Upon arrival I should have guessed something was wrong but took them to the range and set one up at 24,000 meters . Fired my first 8 " ( 203 mm ) round and , after the dust settled , could not locate the Shoot - N - C. I tired three more times and each time the Shoot - N - C was vaporized . Did I get a bad batch of targets ? I think this may be misleading advertising cause I do n't think these things will hold up under any field artillery , even smaller than 8 " rounds . Wish they were less expensive but help a lot with older eyes at 100+yards . The dots are okay but sometimes a close shot ( .308 ) throws them off where you stuck them so figuring which shot was in your last string can be confusing .
5 #### I needed a casual watch for jeans and weekends , but wanted something sturdy that would n't clash with any of my other jewelry . This watch fits the bill . Looks great on my small wrist . Love that indiglo feature , too !
5 #### My husband and I just survived " Sandy " in New Jersey and because we were without power for 5 days , and then another 4 days , really wanted something easy to use and small enough to store so we could heat up things and MAKE COFFEE ! ! ! This product is small enough to fit on my stove top and counter and with two burners , large enough to fit our needs . Great product .... great Coleman name .
5 #### Great quality , but the size is not even close . I 'm 6"2 and 180 and got the XL thinking it would shrink some during washing . Not the case . Definitely buy 1 size smaller than you need if your of normal build .
5 #### Good value , has everything you need from a helmet , stylish too .
5 #### My husband wears these to work all summer long and he loves them ... they are very well made and comfortable ... They run about a size smaller than listed so we ordered a size up for him and they fit perfectly ! Thanks so much !
5 #### I had ordered 2 shirts at the same time , both Carhartt . This one fit better and seemed to breathe and move better with me . I like both shirts but i 'm ordering more of these very soon ,
5 #### I use this on my shoes , tent , jackets , and sometimes my hiking pants . I 've found this product does work . When you first apply it , it has a petroleum type smell . But , after it dries the smell goes away . I put four coats on my hiking shoes over the past two days ( see pictures ) in preparation for a wet hike . My shoes held up well in the wet , much and mire . That 's one of the benefits of using a product like this . No matter what you apply to a shoe , if it is submerged it will be wet . The benefit for me is keeping light rain , dew , and mud from permeating inside . Also , with this product applied , it 's much easier to clean the muck and more off your shoes .
5 #### Given as gift . My stepson wanted Hi tops . Was able to take to Kohl 's and for 5 dollars more , trade in for high tops .
5 #### I purchased this item for my brother , as all his electronic watches seem to last only a short while before they break down . I thought after all these years , why not try a Timex again ! Well , my brother is happy with this watch . It has a outdoor rugged look to it and it looks great . More importantly , it 's well constructed , and it does n't need batteries ! A great , great survival watch ! I 'll be purchasing one for myself very soon . Timex offers a variety of great looking watches , with great functionality , for prices much less expensive than other brands . Sometimes lower prices mean cheaper manufactured and less long - lasting watches . Not in this case . I am now once again a fan of Timex watches !
5 #### Soft on hands , can feel everything . perfect shooting my crossbow in less than perfect weather .
5 #### This bra has the most support of any bra I ever wear . This is the only bra that I wear .
3 #### A good every day watch . UPDATE : It quit working after two months .
5 #### These fit a wide array of pistols I have and not one gave any problems . The face of the looks are easily etch - able for key matching as well which I found a nice quality that is n't conveyed .
4 #### I JUST GOT THE WATCH .. LOVE IT ! REALLY BIG FOR MY WRIST , JEWELER SIZED THE BAND .. PERFECT ..
4 #### Since all the good stuff has been mentioned , and I agree with most of of it , let me give you a couple caveats . It 's small . It 's really small . It 's a watch for ants . Also , the display becomes hard to see at around a 40 degree viewing angle . Also , band has very little flex so I ca n't wear it loose without it resting out of viewing angle so it 's useless as a beater when I 'm wrenching and getting filthy . Pic next to F-108WH for reference . Wish I 'd bought that one first !
5 #### I like the Levi 559 better BUT these are half the price so you ca nt complain ! Still comfortable so no stars knocked off but yes the Levis are better quality . Of course that 's just an opinion but I prefer them .
5 #### Puts a nice light coat of chalk on your hands . I 've only used this for weight training for when my hands get sweaty or when I go heavy .
4 #### Kick ass shoes but research sizing first ! I 'm an 8 1/2 so I needed a 6 1/2 , they 're still a little tight . They look awesome tho
1 #### Ordered a 7 - 8 but a larger size was sent with a note and pencil eraser . I ordered the size my child needed . He 'll have to grow into it ... maybe in a year because it 's very long in the sleeves and torso .
5 #### My daughter loves her razor and uses it almost everyday in the spring / summer . It is a great item to get your kid to go out and get some fresh air and exercise . I too have been on it and thought it was pretty fun .
1 #### I have worn birkenstocks since 1992 and was looking forward to these . Unfortunately they are so cheap and nothing that I would expect from Birkenstock . I returned them right away . The inside foot bed can be removed but does n't stay in place and they are super uncomfortable . My husband was thrilled I was sending them back because he called them ugly . Unfortunate because I LOVE birks !
5 #### I wear these socks when upland bird hunting which means I walk a lot . They wick away the moisture , but keep the feet warm when not active . Worth the money .
5 #### Followed the instructions and used this for six weeks and my pain is GONE !
5 #### Awesome product no problems with water leaking through would definitely buy again
5 #### Fit like a dream ! Great for cross - training / HITT videos I do everyday . Great for walking too . Look amazing !
4 #### These run a little small , probably since they are so straight and slim cut .
5 #### Eggplant color is more like dark purple , but my daughter still loves them !
5 #### What can you say , works fine . Put one in climbing chalk bag and does the job .
5 #### My daughter loves them for volley ball . She is 5'3 " and they fit her well .
5 #### These are perfect ! Just what I needed for my toaster oven . I have a miniature regular oven in my apartment and was either under cooking or burning food . I plan to use these with my toaster oven so I can cook more with my toaster oven .
5 #### Grate for work 20 dollar 's how could you go wrong well worth the money for a brand name wrangler
5 #### Classic awesome shoes have n't changed at all . Way too large tho . Order at least a full size smaller . Also confusing about men 's women 's sizing . Will be returning
5 #### I choose this mostly because of other reviews and have to agree . The bright orange seems to catch the eye of every guest on board which I love as they seem to understand my committment to safety afloat . I practiced with it once and I am pleased with it 's easecof use as well as re - packing . Highly suggest this product .
5 #### Great durability and performance . The shoes are kind of expensive , but this is my second pair and I 'll hardly change brand or model . Plain rock , tiny smears or crack climbing . This shoes will get you to achieve that impossible redpoint . With time , they will get your feet 's shape .
5 #### Love this bra - definitely gives a lot of lift and defines my shape nicely . It actually lifts the girls up so well that it makes the rest of me look thinner ( which is a definite bonus ) ! This is not a padded bra so not the best for under t - shirts or clingy fabrics . Fits just as expected , comfortable , the straps do n't cause any discomfort . Best of all I do n't have to spend a fortune to get a decent bra ! One of my faves :)
5 #### This throat protector worked great during our tournament weekend ! We 're a new team and the catcher 's mask and all the gear was brand new and we did not have a throat guard until the day we started our first tournament game . It is required by the tournament organizers . We attached it quite easily and NO problems at all ! It will be a permanent piece of safety equipment moving forward . We have a team of 9 - 10 year olds and this size is perfect for these big kids . No issues at all . I highly recommend this Wilson brand protector . I ordered this brand after reading reviews about other throat protectors being hard to attach . Some have strings like shoe laces and those are a pain and they had to use zip ties ! You wo n't have a problem at all with this brand . To be helpful , I 've attached three photos of this throat guard being used by our 9 1/2 year old catcher . Please let me know if you have any questions and I will try my best to answer them .
5 #### Love these sneakers . Light weight and comfortable even without socks .
3 #### My wife wears these everyday and is on about her fourth pair . She finds them very comfortable for walking . I do feel that the soles wear out prematurely for the price point . They either need to harden the rubber or drop the price . We now have three pairs where the upper is in great condition but the sole is worn flat , we 're going to investigate whether the local shoe guy can resole them . Seems like a waste to just throw them out .
5 #### I needed to replace a Skagen watch that I destroyed by smashing the crystal . I love the way that the band is attached to the watch face itself . Very different . The watch is more beautiful than expected . Thanks Amazon !
4 #### It looks like its protecting string I am please with this item wax is easy too apply it seems Like string is flowing easy
1 #### Does not work . Obviously cheaply made . I have set the timer and when it gets to zero nothing happens .
5 #### Ok let me start off by warning everyone that this release is VERY sensitive ! Being new to archery and this being the first time using a release , my 1st shot I touched the trigger to my cheek and released early and lets just say my arrow is in orbit someplace over the great state of California lol . That aside once I was used to it it is great . Very comfortable and reliable and the cost is about half of other releases of the same type . I highly recommend .
5 #### These shoes are great I have grown up with these ( cheaper back then ) . Chucks look good , size is great , plus they work great for squatting in the gym ( like wrestling shoes ) . Shipping was good too .
4 #### The rings and adjusters are plastic in the DD 's and below which I do n't like , other then that they are a great fitting bra that looks great !
5 #### I do n't usually wear a sneakers but needed something to wear around for my child 's baseball games . They fit perfect , I usually wear a 9 and that 's what I ordered . They were n't tight and look really nice !
5 #### Solid and heavy . Used with an old canvas 100 lb everlast bag . Gives just enough to prevent excessive spinning and bounce . Used with Amber Sports Fight Gear Heavybag Joist hanger . I still had to threadlock the hanger screw eye to prevent it from spinning out , but the spring definitely dampens unwanted movement in the bag .
2 #### I 'm trying to buy these Kswiss in a 9 and they keep coming up 9XW ... I bought these once already & i m sending them back because they 're a 9XW .. Feeling frustrated
2 #### Okay , it 's great to get a shirt that is n't skimpy . But I 'm a guy and a medium wears like a dress . Avoid it
5 #### I like using this after I m done cleaning the bores , bolts , etc on my gun as a final wipe down to get the fingerprints off and other things . Just be careful not to rub too hard especially on rough area , it causes the cloth to start to fray .
5 #### The Cadillac of bait transports . No water mess on back seat of car on the way to fishing hole . Well made pump and hardware . The inside net makes getting the slippery little critters out one at a time easy .
5 #### In really like these . I wear between a 9 - 9.5 womens , I got the 9.5 and they fit perfectly . They are light weight but have good support . I will buy another pair .
5 #### My feet are so skinny and narrow that these chuck Taylor 's are too big and I purchased a 4.5 and they are still too big , so be careful when purchasing the unisex pair .
5 #### This thing is heavy and will last forever . Used in hot yoga . Its a couple of inches wider and longer than regular mats . Gaiam towels , Mandukas and Yogarats grip well the surface of this mat , Yogitoes do nt . Its made of a dense kind of plastic and will not absorb any sweat so you ll have to use a towel on it .
5 #### I always catch fish on this lure . I caught about 14 trout in a two hour period with this lure , when my 7 buddies caught 0 - 1 each .
5 #### Love my Chuck Taylors ! ! Got these to take on vacation and to wear on my Boat ! Great nostalgia , great Look !
5 #### This is my second Fox Classic Whistle . My other one is still going strong after 10 years but wanted a new one and new color ; green . Higly Recommend .
5 #### Loved these shoes , wore them a month straight while on vacation in Asia . Comfortable and good traction .
5 #### This watch is the only one I wear . This is the second one of this kind I have purchased since the first one I had finally bit the dust after 5 years of continous use and abuse . I absolutely love this watch !
5 #### My husband is very happy with it . Easy to read .
5 #### Great shoes , I love them . Exactly what I wanted
5 #### Seems like this is the right size for me . Really like the support through the back and ribs so that shoulders are not digging so much . It is very hard to find a bra this size , so I hope Bali continues to make this style . Especially like the 4 hook closure and wider straps .
3 #### They are OK , but if you really want to protect your knees , calfs and elbows I would recommend the complete pads .
5 #### They 're perfect . Very hard to find half sizes . Bought them for my daughter .
5 #### Straight out of the box , these shoes are great ! Very lightweight and fits comfortably on my feet like a glove ! I love most especially that the sole is not bulky like my previous running shoes I hated those things lol ! I would give them a shot and they are great for the price !
1 #### Did not fit my boyfriend 's F-250 . The steering wheel it 's apparently too big , waste of money ! And since it was a Christmas present it 's too late to return it .
5 #### Heavier thread count long sleeve tee . Neck opening was right size . Not too loose nor tight . Good sleeve and torso length . Fit was spot on . Great for fall and late winter wear . Russell quality and good price
5 #### Excellent product - buy it ! The quality is what you 'd expect from a real american product . You can get it in many different strengths .
5 #### Bought these for autographs specifically . This is exactly what you need to take your collection to the next level or ensure . The great perk is that this also came with the cases !
4 #### The product is pretty good once I got it put together . You really need 2 people to put it together just to get the pieces to line up properly and for your sanity . The directions are terrible . It took me about an hour to put it together because at the beginning none of the pieces lined up . They do n't tell you in the directions that you have to slightly bend the back frame to get the holes to line up properly . After I finally figured this out it was n't that bad . Is it worth $ 70 ? I do n't think so , maybe $ 50 .
5 #### WOW ! ! ! this jacket is RED and made of the best quality naturally MADE IN USA where everything should be made . LET 'S MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
1 #### lasted about 10 seconds and got a run in it as soon as I got them all the way on
5 #### They were a gift to my daughter she loved them
3 #### The waist string broke first time trying them on . Luckily I do n't really need the wast string but it would be nice if it did not break . That being said the pants fit as expected and are comfortable . Probably shop around next time I make a sweatpant purchase .
5 #### Very cute high tops ! ! ! ! My daughter loved them . They fit really well . They 're little challenging to put on , but the fit is really good once they 're on .
5 #### These fit both the forward and rear mount screws on my Remington 514 youth .22 rifle . I mounted 1 " scope rings to it .
4 #### I prefer this stove to the propane tank version any day . If your camping trip turns into a real life or death situation you can always siphon gas from your vehicle to power this and other dual fuel devices . On a mellower note , carrying a can of camping fuel is much easier than a bunch of little propane tanks , especially if there is not a Walmart nearby to resupply . Coleman claims this unit has a 2 hour life at its maximum heat settings but I find that is more than you need . With a moderate setting the fuel can easily last several weekend camping trips . The wind flaps are cheesy and this is a light weight product ( some feel it feels cheap ) but if you 're having to carry gear long distances , light / portable is what you want . You can use two medium sized pots / pans on this unit but you can also use a Wok on it . I have done this before to create a meal for a group of 10 . I 've never had any problems with this unit and highly recommend it .
4 #### I wore this yesterday when i went waterfowl hunting . Typical 19 degrees , with 2 inches of snow and still falling . This bib is legit . Very warm , comfortable , and the camouflage is well printed . I only have 2 concerns , and both are irrelevant once your sitting in your blind . The material makes a lot of ' swoosh swoosh ' noises when walking and the material is rubbing together . And I found the crotch to be ... lacking room ; restricting movement . This was a problem when I was going over a fence . Overall I am happy with the product .
5 #### This is my third pair of these . I only replaced the leather ones because the elastic wore out on my first pair after four or five years ! I have swum in them and hiked in them . I tried getting a pair of fabric ones and for some reason I kept being itchy under the fabric so I 'll stick to leather .
5 #### This was a gift and fitted perfectly ! Comfortable and nice
2 #### Shorter and wider then the same size in another style . I loved the rose sandal same size fit perfect . Reordered the whisper sandal .. it fit perfect .
5 #### A real must have for camping , trips in the outdoors , unexpected emergencies . Makes it very easy to get that much needed fire going .
5 #### Worth every penny . You can actually get them up and down without ripping .
2 #### Pros : Cute , lightweight Cons : Cheaply made The elastic and velcro straps that attach the wings to your child are small and caused the jetpack to be very tight to my 3 yr olds body . Because the jetpack is inflatable , it you blow it up all the way , the center between the wings gets very rounded and made the jetpack keep slipping up my sons body and hitting him in the head . He did n't enjoy wearing it very long to say the least .
5 #### My son loves them although I did find out today that they are at least a size too big . He knew that and told me 8 on purpose so I guess he wanted them that way . I really do n't understand 14 year old boys but I love him and he loves the shoes so what more could I ask for ?
4 #### This is a very versatile lanyard , very strong , good for even heavy lights . I popped a gear keeper in a second , this will take a lot to break . Much . much better than a gear keeper . It just needs a another clip or easier way to attach to BCD . You can manage with any kind of other clip or salt water carabiner clip but it should be part of the equipment .
5 #### Fuel tablets work as described , fantastic , Esbit makes NO WORRIES product .
4 #### For the price this outfit was perfect for my purposes . The head piece is a bit low quality but again , for the price i am happy with the purchase
4 #### As a workout tower goes this one Is exactly what I needed . Pull - up , chin - up , dip and leg / knee raise ready . My only complaint If I had to have one is that the top arms move a bit inside there unions . a mild design flaw . As a Side note . If you do n't have Metric tools get them ready to assemble this .
4 #### Arrived on time . I probably should have gone with a 7.5 instead of an 8 because they do seem a little big , but if I wear thick socks they are fine . Also , they can sometimes make a very annoying squeaky noise when I run on certain surfaces so I 'm trying to get them worn in . Over - all , I am satisfied with my purchase !
3 #### I bought this watch for my daughter two years ago . We have had it replaced twice under Timex ' warranty ( we have to pay our own return shipping ) . Bottom line , just do n't take it in the water , even for limited exposure - it is not water resistant . Other than that I like it for the price I paid . This band works well for my 4 - 5 year - old , because she can put it on herself . But it does leave some tail trailing out to one side . It keeps time well , it is comfortable . The printed numbers for the minutes are tiny , but I do n't see how they could be made much larger on such a small dial face . If I had to do it over , I would not buy this watch again because it is n't actually water resistant as described . I 'd rather not worry about it when my kid washes her hands or if she scrambles into the tub too quickly before we remember to take it off . However , it was less than $ 15 so I was n't really expecting a high quality time piece .
5 #### My favorite shows . Hardly off since they arrived . Ordered my regular 12D size with trepidation since many reviewers said they ran short . Mine were a tiny bit shorter , but still with thumb width extra at toe . No problem . The Newport and Keen Arroyo II are about all I wear and never wore sandals before 6 months ago .
4 #### These gloves seem to work fine for my kids to punch the bag every once in a while
4 #### The box arrived intact and the backboard went up pretty quickly . Our original one broke after we had a cold snap here in Wisconsin , so I 'm hoping this one will last longer . My only issue is the board flexes a bit and makes a thud sound when banking shots off the backboard . But we only use it occasionally , so it should n't be an issue .
5 #### Believe it or not , my son wore these to the prom ! ! ! He loves converse and just had to have the red ones ! ! !
5 #### * Attractive , modest , but does n't look cheap . * Works great . * Ideal when you do n't want your watch to make a fashion statement , or upstage your jewelry . * Uncluttered by date , which is often difficult to read , and sometimes has to be reset anyway . * Slim gold second hand lets you know it 's keeping time .
5 #### I love , love love these shoes . I have troublesome feet and these shoes have helped so much !
4 #### Not the fanciest , but sturdy . Wig actually looked great unlike so many cheap costume wigs . Added little dalmation stuffed animal to the stole and pinned it to the dress so I did n't have to fuss with it all night . Used the picture on the packaging to do my make - up . ( My toddler daughter went as a dalmation . ) We got tons of compliments .
5 #### I purchased this to strengthen myself after a car accident and my physical therapy has finished . I have been using these for about 6 weeks and I have found this is better quality than others I have used . The bands have very good resistance .
3 #### Do n't fit me right because I have a very high arch and my feet overpronate ( roll inward ) , so I have to return .
5 #### Bolt it to your deck and scrape them boots clean !
3 #### I wish the quality was a little better , the weave seems a bit less silky soft than the name would imply , and the threads are a bit more visible when worn than I would like . I was aiming for nude oantyhose that would nt look like I was wearing any to the casual glance . This color was weird for me , it d just a soft white with no flesh tone to it , but the travel buff color matched my neutral undertone , very pale skin very well , but due to the weave they 're still slightly noticeable as pantyhose when worn . I also did not care for the sandalfoot , I found it uncomfortable . For the price , though , they 're nice .
5 #### Very cute watch . Very easy for my daughter to get off and on by herself . Easy to read face and has an adjustable band .
5 #### Keeps colder than any lunchbox I 've ever owned ( this is my second one * ) The lid is hollow , I fill the lids with low expansion building foam ( rinse it out with water first , the foam WON'T cure without a little bit of water in there ) Summer temps here are most times over 100 . * ( replaced because they can only fall off a speeding work truck so many times before they 're destroyed )
5 #### Everyone asked where we get this from ! We build a snow fort , the the kid have a blast . Still trying to figure out how to bake a igloo ... maybe next time . We bought 3 , so everyone can have 1 .
5 #### These work very well . My previous toaster set got covered in gunk in no time . These wash clean off .
4 #### This Classic Official Whistle with Break Away Lanyard by Fox 40 will go with me when I am on the boat or kayak . In an emergency , it may come in handy . Other wise , I can just whistle interference if anyone is catching fish and I am not ! Tight lines all .
1 #### I could hardly believe the poor quality of the fabric used in this T - shirt . For a knit , it had practically no give and was uncomfortable to wear . I was looking forward to taking the four shirts I had bought on a vacation that commenced the morning after receiving them , but was sorely disappointed . The only reason I have yet to request a return label is that I am not at home . As soon as I do return home , I will do so . These are unwearable as for as I am concerned . That being said , Amazon 's service has been up to their usual high standards .
5 #### Very durable and easy to attach . I have n't had any problems and would buy it again . They come in a two pack , so do n't be stupid and order two ( like I did ) .
5 #### These are the most comfortable shoes I 've used for working out . Extremely light weight and flexible . Loved them so much I purchased two more pair in different colors .
5 #### I 've been wearing Bali 's Flower style for 45 years and it has n't let me down yet . ;-)
4 #### Ordered 10/22 and rec'd on 10/26 - not bad considering I 'm in California and it shipped from New York . My son loved his costume . Says it fits to size 6 - my son is a size 3 and it was hard getting his arms in - but it worked just fine . Hat is extremely oversized - I ended up wearing it going to door to door so that my son could see , but we rigged it so he could wear it later in the night by adding cloth , foam & velcro .
5 #### Buy this ! ! ! ! Its made very well , its looks so official . My son is 2 yr old and he is small for his age but the size i bought which was 2 - 3yr fit well with just the right amount if wiggle room if your child is big for their age . The suit is made with a durable heavy material which comes in handy if you live in an area that is cold during halloween , and has real metal clasps . It has reflective fabric sewn in which is great for night time trick or treating . Could nt be more thrilled with this buy !
5 #### I love K - Swiss shoes . They always fit well and look great .
4 #### It fit around the waist perfectly . The B cup was about 1/2 inch too big , and I had to sew them 1/2 inch smaller for a better fit .
3 #### I read all reviews for this product , and I ordered 1 size smaller than my daughters ' size . However , when I got it , I was still surprised by its length . Well , kid is growing , also return etc will be too much work , so we keep it . I guess that the producer also can see the reviews from amazon or other webs , why the producer has no action ?
4 #### Great scooter for my 4 year old ( who is as big as a 6 year old ) . She wanted something that was faster than her three - wheeled radio flyer . It did n't take her long at all to get her balance on this one . It helps that the handle bar is adjustable . But it does go pretty fast , so do n't forget the helmet and knee pads .
5 #### My 3 year old loves it . He even wants to eat with it . It is big and sturdy and easy for him to get the tools in and out . He feels very special to have his own knife .
5 #### They fit perfectly , and the control top worked wonders for me . They are comfortable and the color is nice . And I know others complained about runs in them but I did n't have that problem and I have worn them three times so far . Definitely recommend . I want to get them in different colors now .
5 #### my grandson loved his outfit but he 's a big boy and even though he was running around getting wedgies , he would not take the outfit off and all that really matters is that he loves loves loves it .
5 #### I have two of these Pelican 1450 cases -- one for firearms and one for my DSLR camera gear . This is an outstanding case for either purpose . For camera gear , the foam inserts are removable in little cubic square increments , making it very easy to configure the case to hold camera , lenses , flash , and other accessories . For pistols and revolvers most users will leave the foam inserts intact , as the case holds pretty much any handgun snugly , with just the right amount of pressure , without modification . I can pack a couple of pistols and some clips no problem . If all of that is not enough , I also use one of these for transporting portable amateur radio gear . It is perfect for this . For any purpose , firearms , radio gear , or camera gear , this case provides a secure and lockable way to transport one 's equipment without worry of physical shock to the equipment , or problems with water or humidity . These cases are watertight and very safe against the elements . This is important to me , as I often transport my camera gear in an open dinghy in coves and harbors , where the wind is apt to spray water on everything . This case has been 100 % proof against this . Firearms do n't like water or moisture either , making this case an ideal solution for transporting one 's firearms . Replacement foam inserts are readily available for this case , by the way , so one case can serve multiple functions . A quality Made - in - USA product . Highly recommended . RJB .
5 #### Love these . Very soft cotton . Wish they came in colors instead of only white . Easy to put on and take off . Nice fit and finish . Nice everything . Sizes run way too small as with all the Gerber clothing items . For my 4 month old twins weighing 14 lbs , I had to buy the 12 month size .
4 #### The Color is a bit faded after while I had it almost a year now and I wear it everyday
5 #### Absolutely love ! The mouth grip helps to keep it in your mouth
5 #### This might not be the best thing since sliced bread , but it 's close . I am a competitive rifle / pistol shooter , but had never used a compound bow . I got a PSE Stinger package which included a wrist release . Could NOT get the wrist release to feel right , and with everything else I was trying to learn ( posture , no torque , etc ) I was frustrated . The T - handle release seemed more natural , so I figured I would try it . Wow ! What a difference . Right out of the box , I was shooting decent groups at 20 yards . Tweaked the trigger pressure a little and the groups got even tighter . Ca n't speak for the more experienced bow shooters here , but for me this device is perfect .
4 #### Jade green / gray ... super cute , easy to slip on . Order a half size larger . I normally wear size 9 . Ordered size 9.5 and debated whether to keep them . Left shoe fit well , right big toe rubbed on top . Wore them for a day with socks . They stretched enough to make them comfortable without socks . Sole is plenty thick and supportive . No heel - that 's a good thing . Other reviewers mentioned shoes splitting or falling apart after minimal use . So far , so good for mine .
4 #### I really like these suspenders . I tried other suspenders which did not meet my needs . These suspenders have a rugged construction , and they hold my pants up ! !
5 #### Bought these to squeeze for exercise , and also for a dog toy . Never played tennis , so ca n't rate them for that . For my purposes they are excellent . My yellow lab always bothers me for hers !
5 #### What should I say ? Just buy it . 100 % . You will fall in love with it .
5 #### These are my 3rd pairs of Keens . I love them ! I can wear them all day and walk in them all day whether I am walking in the city or in the woods .
3 #### Bought this as a Christmas gift for a boy . I received a pink one ... I'm thrilled about this
5 #### This thing is loud . Does what it 's suppose to do
4 #### I wish a pair lasted longer than a year . Pretty comfortable work show with decent support , slightly narrow build . So far , among the best all - day shoes I have found that are n't a work boot or sneaker .
3 #### Cuts into ankles but the size is good . Shoes look nice but ca nt wear very long from the ankle soreness .
5 #### been wearing converse chuck taylors since high school days ( 60s ) and these just continue that as expected . It is unbelievable how many comments a 70 year old can get of " I sure like your shoes " - These seem to do the trick !
4 #### Work well for long term storage of firearms in a safe or elsewhere . Oil them up and put them in this case and they will be protected for some time . Avoids safe rash as well .
5 #### I have n't been in freezing temps yet , however its been fairly cold , rainy and windy , and it did the trick . I use it to throw on and go feed horses . perfect .
5 #### Knife is butter smooth , sharp , and perfect . The only thing I did to make it better was to add AWT aluminum aftermarket scales . This brings the knife to a whole new level of quality feel . Get this knife , you 'll keep it forever .
5 #### nice watch , but , band is not real large for a man 's wrist
5 #### This KNIFE SUCKS , it does nt hold an EDGE and the Sheath fall off my belt CONSTANTLY ! ! ! They need to re - design the SHEATH and do some work with the BLADE ! ! !
4 #### Nice but too expensive . If I had of had more time , I would have search for another red similar pair .
5 #### I remember when I bought my first Casio watch back in college which was around 1973 . Cost was around $ 50 , no kidding for a plastic watch with a funny digital screen . Fast forward 30 years and I am finding myself buying almost an identical watch with some minor mechanical and cosmetic improvements for $ 13 . It just does n't get any better . Hope they continue making these watches . They are affordable , keep incredibly accurate time and weight almost nothing . I now find myself returning to a simpler time in my life with this incredible watch . For now , my Invicta , Timex , G Shock and other oversize timpieces can be placed in storage and worn on a special occassions . Big is not necessarily beautiful and practical .
4 #### Received my pair a few days ago . So far , they 're nice , but glue is visible on the side of one shoe .
1 #### I ordered a Toddler US 5 - Thinking it would be a size 5 for a toddler . I received a Men 's 5/ Woman 's 7 . This shoe fits me , not my toddler . Be careful with the sizing .
4 #### I buy Carhartt for the fit , you want a large or X - large that 's what you get not something that shrinks to your kids size after the first washing . Down side is they have gone to lighter material it seems this current batch I just bought are not as heavy as a few years ago so I 'm wondering about the longevity compared . Good shirts when you look at the usual imported crap everyone has anymore .
1 #### Did not fit , my grandaughter just told me . Wanted to return to get size that fits
1 #### Very poor whistle . Purchased it as a replacement for my current reffing whistle . You could barely here it . Ended up throwing it away ...
3 #### I followed the recommendations for height and weight and purchased the A size , which barely fit me . I am pear - shaped and carry most of my weight on my butt and hips , so that is definitely a factor to consider ... if you are like me , order a size up ! In addition , they do tend to flatten my butt and create a wide expanse of behind rather than lift and shape :( however , I do like the medium sheerness ( not too opaque like tights but not sheer ) and the comfortable top . They go up to my waist , and thankfully I have a small waist otherwise these would definitely create muffin top . If you have any excess in that area consider buying hose that go up nearer to rib - cage . Still , these are not bad for the price !
4 #### Not the easiest to use , but the rod work great .
5 #### Hi seas grand slam is by far one of , if not the best fishing line on the market today . No joke .
5 #### Works as a cooler should . Easy to drain and dry .
4 #### Very well made . I have several colors and all are made equally well . They are very close to size when they are kept dry , but will shrink one size after getting wet or sweaty . Originally bought a 7 - 3/4 ... and it fit perfectly ... but after a day of water skiing it shrunk to a 7 - 1/2 . Next I ordered an 8 . Perfect . After 2 yrs it has never shrunk below 7 - 3/4 .
5 #### Love these for powerlifting as they keep your arch muscles strong by not having arch support and they have CRAZY grip on the bottom so you feel really stable
5 #### As I received this , I started using it . Love the quality of the bands and the different accessories for it . I really bought this to help in my P90x workout and so far so good . Definitely recommended !
5 #### I typically do n't like to get name brand shoes for my kids as they grow out of them too fast . I have four kids , so shoe purchased in our house are expensive . I had been buying shoes from bix bog discount stores , but have grown tired of thier poor quality . The straw that broke the camel 's back was the fact that I bought my very active six year old daughter a pair of big - box - store shoes , and they fell apart after only TWO MONTHS . So , I came here and found good old Converse All - Stars for her on here at a wonderful price . They did n't cost too much more than the cheap sneakers I bought her . The fit as expected , are very comfortable for her , and have held up well so far . I am very pleased with this purchase !
5 #### Just what I wanted and could n't find in stores any more .
1 #### I understand that there 's not much to this particular item , but if Amazon is going to offer several different colors ( and charge a different price for each ) , the least they can do is provide the color that you order . The package I received has two red wheels in packaging that says ' clear ' . And while I do n't really care what color they are , I 'm sure my 9 - year - old will . So do n't pay extra for a specific color because you might not get what you pay for .
5 #### Black Mountain is an A+ brand . Quality shows on every level with these bands . I also have the exercise ball and resistance loop bands . You wo n't be disappointed in this . Great for traveling so you can still get a muscle work out .
5 #### Fit great and you can feel the warmth almost immediately . Ca n't wait to see how well they work in extremely cold weather .
3 #### I ordered these shoes in a size 8.5(mens ) and was completely unaware that they run about a full size bigger . now they feel like a 9.5 which is n't that bad but I have a large amount of room between my toes and the edge of the shoe and it makes my feet look a little bigger than normal . just a heads up to all you buyers out there . get a FULL size smaller than what you normally wear and you should be just fine
1 #### after i received I followed all directions , first time I went our in a moderate rain it worked fine a few days later I went out in a little heaver rain and the jacket leaked a lot , guess you have t spray after each use ....
5 #### Got these for going to Astros games . The color is perfect . Love my Chucks !
5 #### Love em . Perfect fit , they slip on with no hands '
5 #### Really useful for my kids , both under the age of 10 . They can use this in the backyard either together or alone and try a variety of maneuvers . It does bounce the ball back quite quickly and has punched them in the gut a few times , which has taught them rather quickly about angles of deflection and also to stay ready after passing or taking a shot . They invented their own game of passing to each other off the rebounder , which I thought was neat . The rebounder has also saved a lot of wear and tear on the soccer balls and on the stucco on my retaining wall , which was their previous target . It does n't feel like a super high quality product , but it is light enough for them to move around easily . It 's a good trade - off between heavy - duty ( and heavy ) construction and portability . Assembly was relatively easy , I had the kids help me ( actually could n't keep them out of it so put them to work ) and they could do most steps of the construction . I do n't think the paint is very good , so I do n't recommend letting it get wet via sprinklers or dew .
5 #### and then they came out with this beautiful blue color . they arrive quickly and I wrapped them as a gift from SANTA ... worked perfectly .
4 #### Bands are good for portability , and I like doing some exercises with them at home because they prevent " cheating " in the same way rings do and allow for some unique exercises . I 've tried a few brands , and the Black Mountain ones are pretty typical . I have the red one , which is still fairly thin . This type of band has the handles attached rather than clipped on , so bands ca n't be combined . If you are okay with that , I think you 'll be happy with these . The handle is comfortable and they work well .
5 #### So far so good . I have to make sure the stem is in all the way - but this is a great watch . I do n't like that when I press the light mechanism- it beeps ! !
5 #### I really like these gun socks . I store my hand guns in a safe and the socks keep them in pristine condition .
5 #### Exactly what my sister asked for looked just like the image on Amazon .
5 #### Great , fashionable shoe ! Reminds me of my younger years and fits nicely ! On time seller !
5 #### Basically just got what I ordered . Thanks for the deal ! The size and shoe were both correct and they were brand new .
5 #### I like this product because I am a die - hard Redskins fan , and it means alot to me to be able to wear this pin proudly .
4 #### For me , It was a long learning curve , but now have mastered the throwing of it and works well , always catch bait . Use chum , it makes it even more effective . This is a good quality net . Far exceeds a cheap net from a big box store . 7 ' or 8 ' net is best in MY opinion . Thank You
5 #### These pants fit right and look good and wear well . Happy all around with purchase !
5 #### Great shoe and price is the lowest around . $ 10 or more less than mall comparisons . Now I 'm glad mall did n't have my size .
5 #### Great quality and thankfully both my girls fit into the kids sizes still so we can order them a little cheaper .
5 #### Love it . A little on the long side since I 'm only 5 - 2 but I like things long .
5 #### What can I say , these grips certainly do the job . very comfortable , they fit my gun perfectly and have a superior grip .
5 #### I often have a whistle in my mouth for 8 hours a day . This whistle keeps me from mashing down on it all day by making you feel like you have a firm hold of it even when loosely holding it .
4 #### Out of the box fit well but I ordered one size larger than normally wear . Seem comfortable and well made . May update after wearing a few days but good so far ..
3 #### I purchased this watch August 1 , 2013 . The battery died December 26 , 2015 .
3 #### This garden flag is a bit smaller than a regular one & it 's not thick . My other garden flags ( including my LSU one ) are double material if that makes sense so they are very sturdy and thick & stand up to our humid weather . This is a thin garden flag & fades quickly . I gave it 3 stars because it is so cute & I still hang it despite these issues .
5 #### My 5yr old wanted a green scooter for his birthday and he loves his razor ! We looked at the micro maxi and a few others , but the razor was the best quality for the price with the highest weight limit . It 's sturdy , easy to steer and has adjustable handle bars . 10/10 Would buy again
5 #### Great alternative to a hot sneaker in the summer . Can use as water shoe . Even can wash in the washing machine . Ding out in dryer though . I 've out many miles in them and see no wear in the soles . Great support .
4 #### Good targets . Easy to see when hit . Will buy more .
4 #### I purchased 2 sets of black , size Small , silk thermals -- paying $ 20 for each top and $ 17 for each bottom ( after taxes and shipping ) . I got a great deal , but now that I 've worn the thermals I would n't pay more than that . Why ? Because these are very basic , very thin ( think pantyhose ) and Made in China . I 'm 5'1 " , 112 lbs . and straight - bodied except for my 32F chest . I 'm usually an XS , but due to the sale price I ordered Small . It fits like lounge wear ( not like a snug thermal ) , but I do n't mind . Sometimes I come home , remove my work clothes and lounge around in these . The pant length is long on me , but miraculously everything adjusts ! For thermal underwear , this is quite light and insufficient for extreme cold weather . I use it for winter sports ( mountain trekking , skiing ) with multiple layers over it . A typical trekking outfit for me would be silk thermals , cotton turtleneck , merino neck gaitor , down sweater , then heavy winter coat with insulated ski gloves . For all that bulk these thermals are quite breathable . Be careful with sharp edges on the thin , delicate cloth , for e.g. fingernails and jewelry . Like pantyhose it can snag , but I have n't has any holes ( yet ) . I wash and dry these in a separate lingerie bag without issue . Treat these garments delicately and they should last long . Finally , I strongly recommend the black color for 3 reasons : it 's stain - proof , it retains heat and it 's sexy !
5 #### I like this particular Timex watch because it has no calendar ... just an easy to read dial , backed up with an " Indiglo " night light . Calendars , found on 99 % of low - priced watches , it seems , are just something to fiddle with when the month has fewer than 31 days . With this model Timex , I only have to change the time for daylight savings . I can handle that . The watch has a silver expansion band and white dial . Looks good , fits well and , by the way , keeps time well .
5 #### Feels durable , has that durable " heaviness " to it . Has all the tools I expected and then some . Plastic toothpick and tweezers surprised me . Great price for this model .
5 #### I have been wearing Wrangler jeans my entire life . I like the relaxed fit becuase it gives your legs some breathing room without being " baggy . " I can always trust Wrangler Jeans to fit me the same every time and do n't need to " try them on " first . A top quality product that I will continue to buy the rest of my life .
3 #### Shorts are very loose in the legs , I prefer a strait leg short . Can not wear out cause legs are too loose .
4 #### As much as I want to love this mat , it is VERY SLIPPERY ! I also do n't know if I will use it enough to break it in , so that is a concern ... It might be worth the money if you practice yoga very often . When I got it , it mat around the label was also kind of dirty . Luckily I had a mat cleaner and it took the gunk out . Other than that , I like the size and padding . I m 56 and I got the size 71 , which was perfect .
3 #### This is a repeat order . I was happy the very first time because this style of watch is the ONLY style I wear ..... but this time I 'm not so sure . After two and a half months of wear I developed a rash on my wrist and the band started cracking on the inside . So I took it off and bought a new band and so far so good .
5 #### Got 3 pairs of shoes for my B - Day , these are the best !
3 #### They fit somewhat small but I wear them barefoot it helps out a little but overall the shoes are okay
1 #### I was shocked when Esbit cubes refused to light ! I took these with me at a camping trip recently to the mountains in March . It was fairly dry and calm most of the days , but somewhat cold in the 30 's . I was excited to to try the Esbit cubes based on high ratings and reviews . Imagine my surprise when the cubes refused to light ! I am fairly skilled at primitive and modern fire starting . There was no wind and humidity was not an issue ( very low humidity , in fact ) . I tried firesteel , matches and a lighter . Nothing would light the cube . I tried 2 more cubes . None of them manage to light . After about 10 minutes , the Esbit cubes caught on fire when the kindling surrounding the cubes were burning hot . The good news is that once lit , the Esbit cubes stayed lit and burned . So they worked fine as an secondary kindling , but not as a " tinder " to catch a spark or the initial flame . Very disappointing performance . Fortunately I always bring multiple ways of starting fire . I whipped out Ultimate Survival Technologies Wetfire Tinder . It worked like a charm and caught a spark . I will keep the rest of the Esbit cubes and use them as kindling in a wet environment only . But will not buy them again .
5 #### Great product , color matches stainless on 10/22 . Great flexibility , no tool marks .
5 #### Great watch for my 6 year old . Good quality and looks cute .
2 #### Not a good fit for busty with long torso . Did not like the feel of the fabric at all .
5 #### Well , it is hard to write a review when I have not put it together yet . I saw the instructions and then knew I could n't put it together myself and needed help and am waiting for the right moment .
4 #### I love these shoes , but felt they are a bit large for the size . They fit fine with thick socks , but otherwise are too roomy .
2 #### too clunky , too big . Light sticks out to much when used bezel down . Bezel up is OK
4 #### Great pair of Dickies ! Fits great , love the price and comes in various colors .
3 #### This is my second pair of mocs and this pair is smaller , even though they are identical sizes and both leather . I hope they will stretch .
5 #### If you know someone who likes Buzz , then this is a no - brainer ! This is something my son has continued to play with rather than ditched after the first week ( unlike expensive train set ) . My only advice is not to leave / take in car . We wore it to a superheroes party and I think the heat of the car-- hot air expanding-- created a small hole . I found the tiny slit and patched it with clear packing tape-- no problem with the fix and it 's been 6 weeks .
1 #### I searched for Champ Nike spikes , and I got these . the correct ones were listed as FootJoy spikes . Just double check and and see if you need Q - Lok or Tri - lok , then get the right one . Amazon was awesome as usual about returning the wrong one .
4 #### So far so good . Comfortable and cushioned . Will by more when old pairs wear out .
5 #### First class at keeping my boat centered in the dock . Just wish they were available in more sizes
5 #### Soffe shorts are all awesome- You can wear them around the house , running errands or to the gym . These shorts are cute and have a beautiful coral color . Love em !
4 #### Once he put them on he realize that a 35 " waist was what he really needed , and they 're Wranglers so they are made well and will last . And they look good on him .
5 #### This product works . It does what it says , arrived in good condition and able to use it for my purpose . nice size pan to fit in my toaster oven and nice clean up and also a handy size for camping though I have not tried that yet .
5 #### This was a great kit for a UK fan that plays golf . Decent quality and looks nice . It was a gift for my brother - in - law and he loved it . I will probably be ordering more for other UK fans in my life !
5 #### I 've worn this bra for years and it provides great support and does allow bounce . If you want a bra that provides excellent support this is the one for you . I
5 #### It keeps excellent time . It 's very attractive . The band is sufficiently substantial . It feels good on my arm . Only caveat , it 's not nearly as large as I imagined it from the photograph .
1 #### My pantyhose arrived with a run in them . Not happy abou that .
5 #### Made my girlfriend poop and scream and break up with me .
5 #### They 've fixed the earlier problem . Udder is pink . The udder is too low on the body , so I 'm going to hand sew it up a few inches . I do n't like the eyes being on the hat , but hey , for the price it 's fine ! We 're going out as cows , and my husband is going to be a cowboy ( how sexist , right ? )
1 #### Returning these . the pictures on here make the shoe appear all black with a touch of pink in the check . however , the whole shoe has pink coming through . I was looking for an all black shoe . I ordered the Nike Women 's Flex Supreme TR3 instead and love them ! ! !
5 #### absolutely worth the money . sharp as hell right out of the box and i love it ... very smooth and it looks incredible
5 #### My son wears it all the time he really likes them
2 #### These ran small , I gave them to a friend and she loves them .
5 #### Looks nice and seems to hold up well . I have had for a year and still looks great .
5 #### I ordered this shoe in my regular size and ended up returning them because they were to big . Had to order a size down but hey , I should have known better . Chucks have always ran big . They 're sized for men . Overall a great shoe
5 #### I bought this as a gift for my dad who has always bought cheaper pocket knives , and later regretted them . After getting this , and using it for a while , he told me it 's the nicest and by far the sharpest knife he 's ever had . :)
5 #### Super light weight comfortable ! Kick box in these and run too . Good support !
5 #### These bands are made to higher standards than some others I have purchased and appear to really hold their resistance .
5 #### Just as good as ever pair of sickies I 've ever owned .
5 #### I love shooting and this product is a must for everyone , I also use the when working with construction power tools . This allows you to protect your ears and hear people talk to you with removing them .
5 #### Thera - band has brought great relief from arthritis and muscle weakness due to stiffness . The Thera - band exercises in an every other day routine , two hand twists , both hands held out in front of shoulders , while twisting the band with one hand forward 30 reps , then back 30 reps , and on to the other hand for the same . Much of the arthritis has disappeared . Very satisfying .
5 #### Good buy . Good balls and arrived quickly no complaints at all .
1 #### My son loves his boot However they are not real which I did n't know . Has a black line along the bottom
4 #### Fit right , but hold on tight to things . The material is very slick .
5 #### I love these shoes ! Great arch support and perfect for cardio .
5 #### I wear a 9 1/2 in women 's size , and these fit perfect in a 7 mens/9women 's . They are great shoes !
5 #### The shorts are great quality and a very comfy choice for a summer day when you need a little stretch . I usually order XLs for Danskin items , so I did that for these , and I wish I would have gone with a large , but still love them even if they 're a bit bagger than I prefer .
5 #### I have used these for years . I work outside all day 50 + hours a week . After a year or so these hats fade a deteriorate . But I figure at this price a year is good enough for me . Usually about Christmas I buy a new one .
5 #### I suffered from Tennis elbow . Yes , note the past tense . I ' suffered ' . I 've used this consistently for around 4 months doing the so called ' Tyler Twist ' ( look it up , it 's all over the net ) and yes , if you use this consistently and properly , it will improve tennis elbow . I 'd call mine 95 % gone and that 's amazing . Try and work out a little , and do some mild stretching also , and the results will be quicker . If you buy this , then use it as a doorstop or something ( which I was guilty of for the first two weeks ) , then it 's probably not going to cure your tennis elbow . I would call this an essential purchase .
5 #### This is my second pair of K - Swiss . They are so comfortable . They could be worn all day without having to take them off to replace with a sandals or something . When I wear certain shoes to work , I have to do that , but with this one , I do n't . I can wear them all day . They are also a great price and I got them before the estimated time . Go ahead and buy them . You wo n't be sorry .
5 #### They fit perfectly . These shoes are great for walking - so very comfortable . Love them .
5 #### This thing is wonderful ! Bought this a couple years ago and am now compelled to add a review . It has fit so many applications from the boat 's T - top to my patio chairs . So far it has clipped to nearly everything I 've needed it to , and very securely . The secondary clip that holds the cigar is also very secure . Never a doubt I 'd lose my cigar . When and if it breaks I wo n't hesitate to purchase another .
4 #### Fond memories of this shoe but always thought they were about $ 20 too much . Still they are the most comfortable shoe I have ever worn . I ca n't believe that you can wear these around the house like slippers and yet the tread is beefy enough to do anything you want outdoors.(Make sure you get the oval nub tread ) The styling is great , they have been around for 20 years and do n't look dated at all . Other manufactures have tried their own version of a similar styled shoe and not been successful . These are the originals . Found some discounted and stocked up is case Merrell ever phases out the oval nub tread .
3 #### I bought this when it was on sale , and I only used it for one season . It 's pretty comfortable , but a pain in the buns to readjust . Some threads get loose and come off , but it 's still functional . Good for the price .
4 #### It 's a push pole head , so there is only so much I can say about it . Here are two things they could do to improve it . Make the spring out of something so it does nt rot and break in salt water like mine did , and make the hinge or pivot pin the same way so it does nt rot out so quickly in salt water like they do doen here in southeast louisiana .
4 #### WORKS PERFECTLY ! Was tired of using the propane adapter found around here online , as dissimilar metals caused flames to come out around the end of the generator manifold ... Good price here for this stove !
5 #### Love these swim goggles ! I especially like that the lenses are tinted . They really do a good job in keeping the water out of your eyes .
5 #### This is a great product ! I have a 3 year old that is starting to play soccer and it 's great for him to practice kicking the ball with , he can even do it in the house and we do n't have to worry about the ball flying and breaking stuff . The waist strap is adjustable and the Velcro is very sticky . It comes with instructions that are very helpful . I thought I could just take it out of the package , put the ball in and go but you have to open the hole to fit the ball in . I tried to do it without the instructions and immediately found I needed them . Within minutes he was kicking the ball around . My 15yr old and husband also have used it . It 's a great well made product .
5 #### my husband only where s Dickies products because they are good quality and always fit awesome without shrinking .
5 #### An easily portable strength trainer . A step up from the red
4 #### I purchased this at dick 's sporting goods about 4 years ago . It has since become my favorite lure , although it certainly is n't the best . It looks exactly as in the picture , and fools anyone from 10 feet . On to the specifications . First off , it floats , like a real bee . When jerked just a tiny bit , it shakes as if it were a bee buzzing on the water , trying now to drown . When reeled slowly(not enough to dive ) it wiggles back and fourth across the water , as if it is shaking its butt . When reeled quickly , it realistically dives to the maximum of 4 feet . I 've personally only even caught a few bass on it , as its hooks are fairly small , but for smaller fish , and freshwater trout / salmon , this thing is perfect
4 #### Got it a little late in the year have n't need to use but it 's a darn fine hat
5 #### Beats a wobbly multi - piece rod and brush every time . Where was this when I was a kid and had to clean all the guns after a hunting trip ! ?
5 #### OK . Here goes this interesting post . In short , I loved this thing . I just returned from a 10 day , high alpine hunt . I 'm not one to dig holes in the ground and squat . For a base camp toilet , this thing is great . It offers privacy and is sufficiently roomy . If needed , it can also double as a shower room . I have a small 2 ' x 2 ' portable outdoor wood shower floor . Very handy if you need a shower in the back woods .
4 #### This was soft and nice , but way too big . So it was returned for the camisole shelf bra which I had also ordered .
5 #### i realy like this lantern . it gets very hot so be careful . i would definitely buy it again . it gives off adequate light for a tent or inside a car .
4 #### I love this ! It is perfect for our Halloween celebrations at Disneyland this year :D
4 #### Nice fit and attractive , but a little more fragile than expected .
5 #### Good item shoe was a Lil to bigg should go a size down overall it was a good shoe love it ..
5 #### It 's a scooter and it 's a classic ... These things are great and the kids get around .
3 #### Tee was o.k . Material is thin and not up to past Nike quality .
5 #### Bought these for my husband after the Lees ( same size ) proved a bit tight . He 's much happier with these and say they 're very comfortable .
5 #### Works in two days . Completely eliminated my severe pain I 'd had for three months , I 'd been to the doc , tried every brace there is ( what a waste of money - braces may help prevent reinjury a bit but are n't worth the $ $ $ IMHO ) . I was flabbergasted my MD had not heard of this thing because he is truly well - informed and brilliant . I 'd say he was a genius if it was n't for the fact they close the office - and the phones - from noon to 1:30 for lunch . He has a large staff and could stagger ONE PERSON 's lunch .
5 #### These fit like the original Keens . For awhile they were making a new version that did n't feel comfortable at all .
5 #### I purchased 4 pairs of shoes for my Grandaughters . Needless to say beats shopping with them . Everything was the right size and color . Arrived as promised . Will definitely do again . Joe Mc
4 #### Good cheap little boat for the pool and beach . Inflates quick , and has made the 5 mile trip to the beach a couple of times inflated on the roof of my car or in the back of my truck .
3 #### My son opened this package and was so excited he could barely wait for me to inflate the jet pack . The jet pack inflates quickly and there are two elastic arm pieces for the pack to attach to the child . The wing span of the pack is very generous . My son is a very tall and slender 4 year old and it fit him perfectly . It was just terrible that within minutes of putting on the pack it developed a hole . My son had it on long enough to check himself out in the mirror and to pose for a couple of pictures .
5 #### Wilson is now my bestfriend we go everywhere together . We go sailing , we lived on a random island for awhile , we talk about our days and sometimes we play volleyball together . Truly Wilson is a big part of who I am today . Wilson is a decent ball , not a soft or grippy ball but adequate for beach game with friends .
3 #### I suppose that " heavy " is all a matter of perspective . I have two blue bands , two of the purple " very heavy " , and then one each of the red , green , and yellow bands . I consistently use two purple + one blue to do any sort of back exercise . The resistance is sufficient .. and that 's about all I can say about it . If you are at all serious about your exercise , then you will have to double or triple up on these bands to get a workout . But overall , I have n't had any issues with the quality of SPRI bands , yet !
5 #### my grand daughter loves this - well built - easy to adjust - collapses to fit under bed or in the trunk - she 'll have this for years
5 #### This mat is awesome , last for years . Recently bought a second one . Strong quality , and folds up small enough to fit in a beach bag . I use this at the beach , as well as place it outside the door of our tent when camping . Washes clean with a hose .
5 #### Just noticed I did not review this item . WOW , I thought resistance training and Bands might have been a gimick . It was the price that got me to get them and test them . I m a believer now . I slam these bad boys into a door , and I get going and do n't want to stop . I use them without a door , and entangled in all areas , and have fun with them . They seem very strong , and I do not fear they will snap on me . The threading on the Door jam thingy is coming unraveled a little , but , that would be expected , as I am using them a great deal . Will likely just double stitch them later . All in all , for the price , and how many exercised can be done with these things , I am more than happy . Excellent product .
5 #### Really love this bag . Its a lot bigger then i was expecting which is great
5 #### Received this product after 2 days and was only expecting the regular shipping UPS ground style . Works great plows right through the ice . BY the time you have your power auger started on a cold day ill be fishing . Great product .
5 #### These fuel cubes are really hot . Does a great job if you use an Esbit for emergency or camping use . It seems faster heating water than the regular fuel cubes . Will be getting more as easy to pack and quick heat .
1 #### The waist was more like a 28 than a 33
5 #### I thought it was gon na be cheaply made for the price it asked . I was impressed the quality is good and it serves it 's purpose . I work in a warehouse lifting gallon products so it helps
1 #### The package came in a very large box but ended up being way too short and very spare . Looks nothing like the product photo .
5 #### I love these shoes for my son . He is 3 and very active so he does n't wear them often . But when I want him to look clean and well put together I let him wear these . The shoe fits great and is holding up well !
5 #### I love this set and would definitely recommend it . It 's a very comprehensive set that is easy to set - up . The varying bands definitely provide increased intensity which I like from other sets . They can easily transition between arm sets and leg sets using your body weight or a door jam . You simply slide the band into the included door wedge and close the door on the wedge . The comfort handles are easily attached with a carabiner styled system . The handles are very comfortable to use . The system seems secure and of a solid quality for long use . As a woman without a lot of existing upper body strength , these are a great solution instead of using free weights . I love the travel bag , which means I can take my set wherever I go so I do n't miss work out days . The included training steps are well pictured and easy to follow for an initial routine .
5 #### I bought a wide size of these at a local store and they are amazing ! Soft , comfy , with moderate support . Not a cloud to walk on , but not minimalist . The wide size is perfect for my wide feet with high arches . The shoe tends to run about a half size long though , especially for Nike . I am working on getting in shape , and these shoes feel good all day ... No rubbing on my big toe joint or pinkie toe or heel . Very pleased .
5 #### Love my new Nike 's . It 's been years since I 've been able to wear them ( sizing changed years ago and I just could n't wear them any more ) but now the new styles and sizing are perfect . Lightweight shoe with tons of style . The Fog color is just what I was looking for ... not black and not neon ! I wore them to participate in Relay for Life ( 24 hour walk ) and they held up great !
5 #### If you 're bothered by tennis elbow , and you 've tried many other treatments , do n't give up until you 've tried exercising with TheraBand . It has definitely improved my condition , and I even canceled my surgery for my elbow . You need to do the exercises regularly and consistently . But if you do , I promise you 'll see results . I 'm not cured but I feel so much better . There are many demonstrations online ( youtube ) that show the exercises .
5 #### Very comfortable shoes . I have wide feet with falling arches . These help both and are comfortable enough that I can be in them all day long .
4 #### They fit well , not too short like many knee highs are .
1 #### The battery is dead ! And I see no way to get a new battery replacement . Will return it sadly . Not going to make it as a Christmas present .
5 #### Daughter grew out of kiddie skates these were the first pair of girl skates . Teacher noticed immediate improvement . My daughter was much more . Omfortable and confident . Good ankle support .
3 #### Great product but only received one . Title said " 2 " see pic .
5 #### I love these targets ! They 're great at the range ; you can easily see from a distance where you 're hitting , and the stickers extend the life of each target , making them very cost - effective .
5 #### I primarily bought this package for the kiwi cloth which is somewhat hard to find . The polish is a small can of the standard . The sponge - on - a - stick does n't do much for me , but it is a nice way to apply the polish . The little cover works well to hold water for a great high shine .
5 #### The shoe is very comfortable . It fits like a glove . However , I just happened to have a shoehorn in the house from my father and I do need to use it to get into the shoe . My foot does not slide into the shoe easily . I really do not want to return it for a 1/2 size bigger because once the shoe is on , it feels great . I wish there was a strap to adjust the fit . I have to order a larger size because the shoe was a M and I normally wear a W. My feet are hard to fit . Chanhassen Women
3 #### Rod casts pretty well and functions normally for the first few times on the beach . After the 5th use the guides began to corrode and 2 fell off . I never dipped the pole in salt water or anything and I rinsed the guides with fresh water after every trip . This rod is great if you are just getting into surf fishing and do n't want to break the bank on your first setup . Its a low cost entry level setup that will not last well if you hit the sand every weekend . You get what you pay for .
5 #### The discus holder was perfect for my daughter . Now she is able to carry all her discus and not worry about dropping and damaging them .
2 #### I am super disappointed ... the right shoe is completely falling apart . I owned the same part for more than 5 years and never had the sole disconnect from the shoe . I 'm not even sure at this point if I can get a new one since its been almost a year . Probably been worn maybe 20 times ... so frustrating .
3 #### It worked great on my Mossberg 500 , however , it did not fit my AR-15 ( Stag Model 1 ) . It somewhat fit my Savage Model 11 ( Bolt action .308 ) . I did n't try it on my Ruger SP101 . I got rid of them and switched back to cable locks , which actually prevent the weapon from being loaded , and I will be buying the Gun Vault dummy mag for my Stag . With the trigger locks , you are still able to load the weapon , and if you want you can jam the trigger lock down hard won to fire the weapon . None of my guns were able to fit the lock bar behind the trigger , as the space behind the trigger on all my guns is less than 1/4 inch , and the bar is thicker than that . Hope you enjoy .
5 #### I have a Spalding home system and I actually hung the nylon net over the chain so I have the look of nylon net and the sound of the chain net ! Although the chain net is a bit longer , I do n't really care . My hoop and my rules . Haha . Great product at a dirt cheap price and makes playing basketball even more fun all over again . The chain net actually slows the ball down after going through the hoop helping the kids catch the ball . I crimped the hooks like other reviewers here have stated and it should stay on well into the next century .
5 #### Been using these for about four years . They are perfect . In the sun I use the blue tinted ones . The material is flexible and seals to my face well . They seem to last for about 1.5 year of swimming 3X a week for about an hour . They can get a little foggy and start to turn black in the lens seams . I could probably do a deep cleaning , but I usually buy a new pair . This is common with many goggles .
4 #### Well it does work well . Put your mask on then attach the snorkel via velcro and you do not get any odd pulling trying to position it for your face . One improvement that could have been made would have been to put a swivel under the velcro so it could also move after it was placed on but anyway for this price it is fantastic !
2 #### I 'm a C and based on the questions , cautiously ordered a B / C as I wanted a TINY bit of oomph ( i ALMOST ordered an A , based on the reviews / responses to questions ) to a bathing suit top that was slightly too big ... these did almost NOTHING for me ! ! ! ! I was moreso looking to fill out a slightly too - big top more than add cleavage , and still basically nothing . HUGE disappointment , the only reason they did n't get 1 star instead of 2 is after a LOT of readjusting I did see a TINY bit of difference ! ! !
5 #### It is a quality whisle with exclent finish . And best of all it is loud
5 #### So comfortable and the perect color . I definately like the face that they got to me so quickly as well !
5 #### I will buy more shorts in the future love all your products
5 #### Great quality whistle , the sound is truly thunderus ! A must have item for camping expeditions !
1 #### My shoes came in the right box 8 in men 's and 10 in women 's the shoe tag says 10 in men 's and 8 in womens they did n't even bother to check the size of actual shoe before just pulling a box off the shelf and shipping it to me
4 #### I was really excited when I opened the box to see the color is exactly like the image shows ! I have the Nike flex tr 5 and used the same size to order these . They are a little bigger than expected but still comfortable .
5 #### Forget your cheap walmart or target t - shirts . These shirts are thick and hold up to a beating . The industry standard for us blue collar folk .
5 #### Got as a gift for my mom and she loved them . Wore them all day long for the first wear and did not hurt her feet .
5 #### I bought this earlier this year for my Surefire 6PLED light , and it surprised me with its level of quality , durability , and comfort while wearing it . First , it is durable as an anvil , constructed of thick fiberglass reinforced plastic , with a really good spring steel retention clip on the inside to hold the light firmly . I also REALLY like the full loop belt clip with the sliding adjuster that prevents it from sliding off the belt when the belt is undone , and which also completely prevents the holster from coming up with the flashlight when it is deployed . I now have my flashlight riding in this holster continually while I am on duty as a security guard , and I can scarcely feel it there , until I really need it , then out it comes as smoothly as when I read my wristwatch . This is not a cheaply made second rate product , and the price somewhat reflects that , but it will probably outlast both you and the equally excellent Surefire flashlight itself !
5 #### High quality , super comfy and easy to wash . My sons have these in all colors including white , and when they get dirty , I just throw them in the washer and then dry them in the sun with tongue out . They consistently return to whitest white !
5 #### Absolutely perfect , nothing more to add , I give you 5 stars ...
4 #### This is a very simple , low - tech watch , which is exactly what I wanted . Plusses : large face is easy to read . IndiGlo ! ! Time and Date ... that 's it . Battery . Nice band ( faux ? ) . Minus : Big face means that if you wear your watch down low on your wrist , distal to the ulnar styloid , the crown hits your wrist with any degree of wrist dorsiflexion ( bending the hand back toward the watch ) . This gets to be irritating and will limit the time on my wrist . I 'm not a big watch wearer anyway , and so any irritating factors will reduce the time on my wrist . If you wear your watches loosely , allowing the watch to slide up your arm , over the styloid , then you 'll find it more comfortable , but then you 'll also be dealing with " roll " , where the watch face rotates around your forearm because the strap is too loose . Be prepared to deal with that issue . Otherwise , it keeps very accurate time and works and looks very sharp .
5 #### My daughter loved the watch . It 's brightly colored and cheery . Only problem is that it was a little smaller then what I imagined from the pictures on amazon . The dial was rather small . The other problem is that the strap tends to loosen while my daughter wears it and it needs to be tightened every now and then . Anyhow 5 stars because my daughter adores it . It 's her first proper watch .
5 #### Fit as expected , color true to photo , shipped on time , packed in Converse shoe box . Never had arch supports so I buy Dr Scholls inserts for $ 11 & it 's all good . A+
5 #### The sizing was kinda weird . Idk about the whole half size big . Mine are pretty snug . But I still love them
5 #### We bought these tights for my daughter 's dance class , they are easy to put on and have yet to snag , a good buy . My daughter does wear a 7 and these could be a bit longer ...
3 #### these are replacement wheels that fit a normal razor scooter . they are pretty much exactly what comes with the scooter . do n't get these if you are looking to upgrade . they come with new bearings .
5 #### Just bought these compression shorts wore them for exercising and some sparring for my Karate they are good they give me support and flexibility .
1 #### I loved these shoes ... that is until after about an hour of wear , the green inserts on the sole of the right show began falling off . The wear was in my home , on smooth floors . I can only assume they were defective .
4 #### Was a replacement for a neighbor when he assisted me with replacing my roof hips . I 'm told the price was outrageous . Another lesson .
5 #### Will only wear this type of boot and this fit well .
3 #### I bought these for my husband as work shirts . Thus far all he 's done is complain about how tight they feel . Next time I would order a size up .
5 #### Love chucks on my little guy ! He is 2.5 years old , & wears a size 8 . I re - ordered the hightop navy , and the hightop black mono as well . Look adorable with shorts , leggings , or skinny jeans ... and those two colors work well with all of his clothes . Bonus -- they are n't easily kicked off in his car seat ! We 've been in chucks since size 4 , and I will continue to buy them as he grows -- highly recommend !
4 #### The sole needed some mending sooner than expected bc the rubber pieces were n't sealed together . I still wear them after superglueing .
5 #### My wife is cold natured , so I bought her these for Christmas . She said they are very comfortable , lightweight and keep her comfortably warm .
5 #### A great soloution for BOB however just realize it is wise to red the instructions for use . otherwise they suck
5 #### Great solution for my 8 year old suffering from a rash from shin guards
5 #### I have used many Tru - Fire releases in the past and decided to switch it up . I shoot in my basement for fun occasionally so mis - fires are definately not wanted . I put 50 arrows on the target right after delivery and for the price , I have no complaints . Strap is a bit cheap , but effective and the release works great !
5 #### Purchased these to complement the arrows included in the Bear set I got for my son . Pretty simple stuff here . Carbon shaft with a steel field point tip . Heavy plastic fletching . Beyond the fact that they are 2 inches longer than the arrows provided in the archery set they are otherwise identical . I have been very impressed with the durability . As these are made for new archers you can imagine the type of abuse they are subjected to daily . We have n't had one problem or failure in the time we have used them . Despite being stepped on , shot against hard wood fence ( when target missed ) , dropped and generally put through the torture test of an 8 year old they have remained unharmed and ready to be shot again . If you need arrows for your kids that are just plinking around the back yard , you ca n't go wrong for the price here .
1 #### These have a strong horrible smell ! Definitely not keeping these .
5 #### The Lodge lid stand is one of those little gizmos that at first glance seems like something you do n't really need to buy , for you will be able to find something around the house that will serve nicely as a make shift version . The true reality however is that very rarely will you find anything that quite does the job so easily and effortlessly as this little item . Anyone that has ever been camping knows that if your going to use a dutch oven or pot of any kind over an open fire , you will need some kind of apparatus to hang it or suspend it slightly over the flames or hot coals . Sitting it right on the fire is a no no and never works . This folding metal tool does the job easily and is invaluable for camp cooking in my opinion . I would recommend buying two to either have two pots going at once , or to use one as a lid holder when you 're checking or serving your delicious concoction . Having a clean place to set down the lid of a pot is something hardly anyone thinks about until they are actually in the act and standing there lid in hand and spinning around with it . Setting it down on a rock or in some grass and possibly picking up a crawly little varmint that will become additional " seasoning " for your stew will definitely have you appreciating this very resourceful little item ... Highly recommdned ...
3 #### These look like they would be durable , but they are unfortunately too small .
4 #### As with my past experiences with Pelican products , this box is very good as well . Would recommend the Pelican products to anyone .
5 #### This hammer is rock solid and is great for gunsmithing . And its made in the good ol USA so it will last !
4 #### Cute little watch for a 6 year old , hopefully it will last at least the year it 's guaranteed to last in the warranty .
5 #### Perfect for pistol @ 25yds . Nice contrast on hits and patches and self stick are preat . Even used it at 50yds !
3 #### Was not the color I expected . The site shows a tan color but I received a white color :( I must have tan by the time my flight leaves Thursday morning ... Otherwise perfect , besides the incorrect color .
5 #### Wow ! I am amazed how far this goes with so little effort ! Worth the endless hours of fun !
5 #### This watch is very nice . The perfect size for my six - year - old 's wrist . Unlike other children 's watches , the face is made of plastic . That 's a good thing considering the safety issues involved in having a glass - faced watch ... My daughter has worn this watch every day since we gave it to her for a Valentine 's present . It has made her very enthusiastic about learning to tell time .
5 #### These are quality hose . I have always used this brand .
5 #### I coach my son 's 8u kid pitch baseball team and we needed helmets as base coaches . These plastic helmets are perfect . We really look like major league coaches . LOL !
5 #### They 're Chucks , I got what I expected . You ca nt beat the price for a pair of good shoes .
5 #### Nice , big cooler . Quiet hinges . Drain plug on one side . Sliding , pivoting handles . Same size as the classic red and blue ones that have been around forever , just not as glaring when you 're in the woods . Speaking of which , the colors in the photo are a little misleading , because the lid looks pretty white and it 's actually much more of a beige / tan . I almost did n't buy it because it looked white , but I trusted the color description and I 'm glad I did . For under twenty - five bucks shipped , you 're not going to find a nicer cooler anywhere .
5 #### Terrific fit , and great value . The quality of these shirts is unmatched !
4 #### Nice , strong , cushy and thick ! It is too heavy to use with the Gaiam yoga mat carrier though .
5 #### this one of the best purchases i have ever made . it 's got good weight , unlike many other light - up disks i have seen . color is bright and easy to see in the dark . love it !
5 #### Such a simple idea that works great . I attach the clip to my golf bag and it holds my cigar nice and sturdy . No more having to place the cigar on the ground while taking my next swing . I love it !
5 #### gifted this mat and the recipient loved it - it is heavier than a typical yoga mat so it offers more padding and better grip !
5 #### Great price and fast delivery . I 've been looking for a watch with a blue face for some time now , and this was a great find . It is light and I like the black mesh band . Very smart appearance . I wear it all the time , you do n't even know you have a watch on . Very pleased with purchase .
2 #### Fell apart only after a few months of wearing . I have owned converse for 9 + years and have had them last .
3 #### They 're ugly : the toe is rounded and the material is weird . the Nike Womens Flex Trainer 6 is way better looking and costs about the same .
5 #### I got it for my husband who is 6 - 1 " and I 'm glad they offer it in a long length . The charcoal color is nice since it 's dark enough to hide the dirt , and it 's not black .
3 #### That these ran so large . They 're super cute but I could n't find in my size . I estimate they are about 2 sizes larger than stated . Understand that mens sizes run bigger , but these were sold as a woman 's product .
4 #### First of all , these shoes are incredibly comfortable right out of the box , however , the color is not even close to the online color . I bought the Persimmon which , in reality , is more of a safety orange than the more wearable yellow orange I was hoping for . I 'm docking one star due to this color misrepresentation , I have yet to decide if I can hack wear hunting vest orange Keen 's on my feet , or not . Go to the Keen website to check the true colors before you buy here .
5 #### Works great ! My little girl is only 6 so she is scared to ride this by herself . As such , I road it with her . It can support the two of us ( about 200lbs total ) with no issue .
5 #### This is a great heavy duty raft ! Great to go out on ponds or lakes and even fish off of ! Lots of fun ! A++ seller
3 #### Shirt size is pretty good . Material is pretty thin . Could be better
1 #### It is way too small ! I use it to collect shark 's teeth at the beach and it is a lot smaller than I thought .
3 #### These are a bit longer than they should be . I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5 . The width is accurate . The pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it is n't as gray as shown in the picture . It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming . Also two grommets on each shoe is dark . I 'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo , I 'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces ( opposite side of side shown in photo ) . I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe . Kind of odd and not pictured . Overall , they are very comfortable shoes which is why I am keeping them ... even if you can see me coming from a mile away .
5 #### My wife was looking for a new wallet to replace an older well used one . She liked this one because of the functionality of the built in change purse , the many card slots and the space for bills . The design and the leather color were also very pleasing . She is completely happy with her new wallet and has already put it to everyday use .
4 #### Nice balls played them far a month and still have nice bounce .
3 #### Fits on the small side . Had to return them for that reason .
3 #### I have been on a quest to find a brand of panty hose that last longer than 3 time use . I purchased a pair from Macy 's and they lasted two minutes by the end of the day my legs looked like I 'd been in a street fight . So begins my quest . I was happy with with the Hanses brand although they did snag on my knee a few hours of having them on but it was n't that bad . Since I have read another review on these panty hose that they are good for 3 - 5x use , I am going to give it another go and update my review . The color I purchased was sheer black but they looked more like black brown sheer but they still worked with my outfit .
5 #### All Chuck 's need inserts , but this is a fine shoe for the money
5 #### I wore these hose many many moons ago . I have gained some weight but in need of nice hosiery . I was happy to see that Leggs Sheer Energy has not changed at all . They feel like silk on your legs and look very nice and pretty on . My husband loves them as well . That is a big bonus !
5 #### i wear women 's size 7.5 , and i bought these in the children 's size 6 ... fits PERFECT ! and LOVE the cinnamon color !
4 #### The materials used to make thisseem pretty cheap , but it has held up well with minimal use over the past year . If you have a cart style bag , which I do , do not expect a second bag to fit on the rack .
4 #### Amazing emergency fire tool , but takes practice . If you 've never used a mag firestarter , try a few times at home ( in a fire pit , or somewhere safe as magnesium burns extremely hot ) to get the hang of lighting solid fuels like wood when there 's no pressure to get it right on the first try .
5 #### The Manduka mat is an excellent yoga mat for serious practitioners and yoga teachers . It is pricey , but with this mat you get what you pay for . It does have a strong odor from the material used , but almost all mats do to some extent . Weekly washing and airing in open air will eventually eliminate the odor . The mat is solid , supportive and will last many years if not a lifetime . It is heavy , about 8 lbs , but it is made to last . You will not be disappointed .
2 #### I was excited about getting my new trampoline in the mail and then it was some what of a Debbie - downer once we put it together ; it took two of us to try spreading it apart and clicking it together ; there 's a strong chemical smell ; and I was disappointed that it did n't bounce as I 'd hoped . Like my husband always says , " you get what you pay for " .
2 #### These held up for about 6 months . I ride about 100 miles a week . They were comfortable at first and looked nice . After a while the logo started to turn pink and then started peel . The chamois pad is pretty inaffective in my opinion . Its Worth spending the extra couple bucks for quality bib shorts . I d say these are ok for newbies or short rides
5 #### Flies great ; just like a Frisbee brand disc . Turns on easy and stays on when it should . Just remember to pay attention to the throw as it is harder to judge incoming speed at night Do n't ask me how I know ! I recommend it !
3 #### THESE ARE DEFINITELY NOT THE SHOES YOU WANT TO WEAR ALL DAY . I LEARNED THIS THE HARD WAY AFTER WEARING THEM TO WORK . AT THE END OF 8 HOURS MY DOGS WERE YELPING IN AGONY ( WITH GEL INSERTS MIND YOU ) . THESE ARE REALLY FOR 20 SOMETHINGS AND NOT MIDDLE AGED MEN LIKE ME WHO WORE THESE AS A TEENAGER IN THE MID 70S. THERE IS A REASON SO MANY MEN MY AGE ARE ROCKING HIGH END RUNNING SHOES ( SHOUT OUT TO NEW BALANCE ) . BUY THESE FOR ONE OF YOUR KIDS AND KEEP YOUR OLD ASS OUT OF THEM .. LOL
2 #### Narrow , is a clique product , no foot support .
5 #### This is a good product , but it takes a long time to dry your shoes . I ride my bike to work and I get wet all the time , so I got this for my shoes to dry for the ride home . It takes 8 - 10 hrs for the biking shoes to dry . I understand that there are better products out there . It 's a good deal for the price .
5 #### i LIKE THE REAL SHEEN ONES VERY MUCH . I USE THEM ALL THE TIME . THEY ARE WASHABLE AND LONG LASTING
5 #### I ordered the 50 # line , and have found it to be indestructible . The color camouflage sounds gimmicky but it actually works , and does not seem to compromise line - strength . You can choose between a black , red , or clear knot to fit your needs . The downside is that this line is quite thick , and you 'll need a large reel and the right knots . The line " memory " is about average . I plan on buying another spool in a lighter weight for my smaller reels .
5 #### Really beats setting a lid on the ground or hunting a place to put it .
5 #### Bought them for my husband , he absolutely loves the comfort and quality .
5 #### 12 year old son loves them ! Fabric is thicker and the fit is slightly larger and longer than other Adult Small tees . He is 5 ' and 120 lbs . Adult small is perfect .
4 #### Purchase these for a second time and it appears that it worth it . Size , material , and description as expected . Would recommend to look at .
5 #### Very high quality tool set . The Hardwood is an unique rustic presentation of the classic shiny red swiss knife form factor . The presision of the tools alignment is second to none . From the razar sharp blades to the correct saw blade width ( narrower at the top of the blade and wider at the teeth ) , the tool set will not disappoint any outdoorsman . A great value for a heirloom quality pocket knife .
5 #### If you 've never used anything but white cotton socks , you 're missing out . Socks like this will wick the sweat away from your feet , instead of feeling like you stuck your feet in a puddle . They can keep you warm when it 's cold , and wo n't make you melt when it 's hot out . The gray ones work for casual and dressier times . They 're thick enough to provide good solid padding . They are a significant step up from standard military socks , which have similar materials . These things are thicker and better constructed by far . Just remember to follow washing instructions - do not toss these in the dryer on extra high heat , wool does not respond well to such things .
5 #### Comfortable and warm . I feel most hiking socks calves are too tight , these fit well .
5 #### These were purchased for my son 's ball team . They used them weekly with a pitching machine . They work great for what we wanted them for .
5 #### At first I thought they were going to be lose or something but now that I 'm wearing them , they 're PERFECT . After my high top all star converse gave up , I thought if just get regulars . And so I did and they fit perfect :) I absolutely love them .
4 #### This converse is very comfortable , especially for slightly wide feet . No break in period - comfortable from day one ! Well made . Only regret is that I was unaware that they were not made in USA .
5 #### This is exactly like a watch I current have and just love . Economical , the face lights up for night viewing , and the ( old ) watch and watch band have lasted for years . The band is wearing out , but this is with daily wear for a long time .
5 #### Ca n't beat it for the price . Have it on my 1022 . It 's light , clear , bright and cheap . Perfect for a 22lr rifle .
4 #### My son has been wearing this on dress up occasions for a year now , as the outfit is pretty stretchy . When we got it he was 41 inches tall and 38 lbs . It fit well ( with T shirt and leggings underneath ) , a bit loose . Now he is 43 inches tall and 43 lbs , still fits well ( with clothes underneath ) , though I think one more inch and it will be too short . The material washes easily and the cape attaches separately so he wears it with regular clothes too . Only complaint is that the back is wide open , so if it 's a hot day you still have to put a t shirt on under it .
5 #### Works great and sturdy enough that your cigar wo n't drop out . Perfect for golfing or even just attached to your chair on the deck . Buy it if you do n't have one
5 #### Great value . Good fun being Encarnacion with a friend as Nacho libre for Halloween .
5 #### My shoes came quick and did n't have any major wear and tear . The inner foot part of the inner padding is a bit raised , but I have flat feet so this helps create an arch for my foot
3 #### I liked how it looked online , but once the shirt arrived it turned out to be a garish , off - red color , and my husband would n't even try it on .
5 #### outstanding for the price . i like the non slip on the top . this is great for the price . yeah you have to blow 40 or so times , its great exercise for your lungs , it is also bulkier and weigh more than the advance stuff , but it is very tough and grow some legs if you think it 's heavy . i use it at home to lay around on , in the field camping on a tent and also use it with AMOK hammock . just the price alone and toughness . 5 stars easy
5 #### product received in good time and we liked it because it was requested by me to give away and use
5 #### Arrived ahead of schedule and fit just like my last seven pairs . Nothing if not dependable .
5 #### This helmet adjusts to fit your head . Large or small head this will work for you . Very comfortable .
5 #### Good inexpensive watch I can take a dip in water without worries .
4 #### This clutch is everything that I had hoped for with all of its features . However , beware , the checkbook insert is not removable ! !
5 #### Carhartt makes some of the best work pants i have ever had . The only problems i have had were the color will fad with repeated washes and one of the belt loops ripped .
4 #### I love this watch face , the cream color face is easy to read and sets off well with the black numbers . It is good for those days when I feel more like a sporty watch than a business type watch face like the Timex Easy Reader . The band does n't look like the one in the picture , it is more of a dark brown , suede type look and has no contrast stitching . I swapped it out for a tan band , which like the picture looks great with the watch face .
5 #### very nice . It was just as described and delivered promptly
4 #### Fit my 8 and 12 yo daughters and random adult range guests . Good basic ear protection . Cons : not pink ( daughter ) Pros : not pink ( everyone else )
5 #### Great fit , well made , and came on time as advertised . Other pocket t - shirts are not as well made or have the heavy material like these . I will purchase more of them in the future .
5 #### This is a very lightweight top which is great to wear under clothing . It is very silkly feeling against the skin . Although when I washed it the first time using Ivory gentle detergent , cool water , and washed by hand , it lost some of the silkyness and shrank a tad . Next time I will use less detergent and very " cold " water . Just a heads - up to others .
4 #### Sturdy and fun . My two year old likes to sit on it and get pulled or bounced on it .
5 #### These shoes were for my son . He will wear nothing but Merrell shoes and has done that for years .
4 #### We love converse sneakers and were just replacing an old worn out pair .
5 #### I got this watch for my father . His eyesight and coordination are slipping as he ages and this watch serves him well .
4 #### First , the shirts fit well . They are very durable . What I do n't get is the neck - hole can vary a lot . I own about 10 of these shirts and 3 of them have really large neck - holes . When I receive them , I try them on then wash them . All 3 of those shirts had really big neck holes .
5 #### Through regular use of this , my " Golfer 's Elbow " is slowly clearing up . after just 1 week I have a 75 % improvement . the secret is that you have to actually use it , and several times a day at that , to strengthen that area . I 've been showing all my friends at Cross Fit ( Tendonitis seems to be a common occurrence when doing a large quantity of pull ups , muscle ups and Toe to Bar )
5 #### Absolute best part of the costume ! The price is cheap and these suckers are still intact after several wears and my son just tossing them around . It made the whole costume complete and my son loved it the most . Super cute to watch my son run around with his ' wings ' . It would smack into the sides of doors but they are filled with air so very flexible . He did n't even notice .
5 #### My old Chucks were getting kind of raggedy so I ordered some new ones . These are just what I was expecting . These are known for running large so make sure you order an appropriate size for yourself .
4 #### Make no mistake - this cheap Timex is no high - end watch , by any stretch of the imagination . It bears all the hallmarks of a cheap watch : Chrome - plated brass case instead of solid steel , low water resistance , that characteristically loud Timex tick . But overall it 's still a solid watch for the price . It tells the time with quartz accuracy , lights up like a torch at night , and looks decent doing it . The dial design is a standard field watch in a classic smaller size and a less standard olive green color . For the record , the watch size is more like 36 mm than the 40 mm listed in the item description . The brass case has a nice brushed - looking finish and a good heft for its size . I swapped out the flimsy leather band for an olive - and - red striped NATO , which improves the simple , rugged look of the watch . Though only rated to 5 ATM , I have worn the watch swimming without problems . This watch is a good option if you 're looking for something simple , modest , and understated that will tell you the time without breaking the bank .
4 #### Works as described . I recommend if you are looking for practice balls .
4 #### Good looking shoes but even picked wide size still very narrow ... so if a kid has narrow feets would be perfect
5 #### My granddaughter was so happy to have this at home .
1 #### These do not fit the b - square Marlin 336 rifle mount sold here on Amazon . Do n't buy them .
2 #### This is of very bad material . I tried it and fibers of material were everywhere on my face , head and neck . Return initiated .
5 #### These sandals are awesome . I tried some of the Newport H2 's but the sizing on those is all over the place and I had to send three different pairs back . I had a pair that almost fit but still did n't feel right . I traded them in on a pair of the original Newports a half size larger than my normal size and they fit great and feel great on my feet . I feel these are a much better product than the H2 's .
5 #### These put out a good amount of heat for your hands , and if you put a couple inside a jacket they can make all the difference between being cold and being comfortable . They stay warm for quite a while , but you must remember that they need oxygen to function , so do n't put them where they can not get enough . They do well in pockets made of material that breathes , but not so well in a waterproof pocket . Do nt worry ... you ll know because it just wo n't get and stay warm if it does nt get enough air .
5 #### I had this exact shoe for the last 15 years and they finally wore out . This is a replacement . Not as comfortable but will break in .
3 #### These gloves fit as expected . It is very slippery to hold items . There is no grip to the underside of the gloves . Also , the gloves will stick to anything grassy or abrasive if you are trying to make your way through brush . Otherwise , the gloves are very comfortable fabric .
5 #### I bought these to cut down on my frequency of cleaning the weapons that are n't used as often but are still in the display rack for showing off , ample opening for easy on and off and the material has good stretch quality ... if your rifle is equipped with everthing including a kitchen sink it will snag the material
5 #### Using these for months now . No leaks , no fogging . Very Comfortable . Highly recommend .
5 #### Like the bands , bought the Kinzi bands and they started coming apart durin 1st workout , will recommend to others ! ! !
4 #### I like Hue comfort - top knee - highs better , because they are much more comfortable .
4 #### I work over the road as a locomotive engineer . Staying across the road does n't always allow me to workout like I would like . This has been a wonderful kit to bring with me for those stays . I use them at home when I 'm feeling like I do n't want to workout around other people . The band 's seem to be quality along with the metal d rings and carabiners . Also included is a pamphlet of the resistance of each band and a handful of workouts .
5 #### I ordered this in conjunction with the ATI barrel clamp and the two of them work well together . I would recommend this item .
5 #### I bought this to keep my FLIR thermal imaging device safe for transport and storage . It 's exactly what I wanted . Obviously I 'd prefer custom cut foam , but " pluck and chuck " foam allowed me to customize this case for the FLIR , its charger and USB cable . I feel much better knowing this expensive piece of equipment is safe inside this rugged , quality case .
4 #### I have had this style before in a different color and have received many compliments on the shoes . They are great walking shoes ! I wear orthotics and these shoes are one of the best I have found to accommodate them for fit .
4 #### I 've used this sock inside of winter boots while snow hiking , inside of general - purpose boots hiking through southern Australia , and just around the house . It holds up well so long as you do n't wash it with items containing Velcro . It 's comfortable and seems to stink less than most of my other socks after a long hike . It 's my widest comfort temperature range sock . It 's a hair bigger than I expected - the heel rides up a bit on my foot - but it 's merely a cosmetic issue . Functionally the slight oversize is irrelevant .
5 #### Good construction . Perfect for what is designed to do ! Recommended !
5 #### I have enjoyed wearing this brand of shoes for many years . I have never been disappointed .
5 #### This is a great product for the price ! It completes the Buzz Lightyear outfit perfectly . My son wants to wear it all the time . Simply blow it up and slip their arms through the bands . Hangs comfortably on their shoulders . Very pleased with my purchase .
1 #### Never got it to properly align in G27 , using laser bore sight at @15 ' was off 2"h x 2"R
4 #### Soles wear out way too fast . Very comfortable . Recommend item and seller .
4 #### Chucks DO run longer and you 'll probably need to buy a half shoe size smaller than normal . I do n't know how well they work as walking or running shoes because ... well ... I ca n't use my legs > _ <
3 #### I have bought several pairs of this type of Merrill 's but these seem a little tight . I hope they stretch out a little .
5 #### If you are not playing sports why wear sneakers . These Merrell 's are great comfort and look good too . No breaking in even . Wear well , and clean up well too .
5 #### Nalgene quality is always impressive . I 'm using it for oil for gasoline pre - mix and they hold up great .
5 #### When I finally ordered one that was tall enough for me , it was very baggy . Apart from that , it works well for insulation and is somewhat waterproof . I used it both with 3 layers underneath and with just one thermal layer .
5 #### if you do not order the wide the shoe is kind of narrow . The wide fits perfectly .
4 #### I recently went on a long road trip to celebrate my retirement . I would be driving thru at least 6 states and wanted to have a hard map on hand for planning purposes . While I will have a Garmin GPS unit running , I do like having a manual backup - just in case . I also like having a map so I can spend an hour the night before reviewing the route and perhaps looking for side roads to adventure . The beauty of this retirement road trip is that if I see a road leading off into some unknown distant hills , I am free to go . Trying to get a feel for the terrain ahead or where interesting waypoints along the way on a tiny GPS is impossible . Having an actual map makes it so easy to look for alternate roads , forest service roads in the mountains , and possible stops . Now that I 'm home , my Atlas & Gazeteers are full of circles , scribbles , notes , and arrows . They got a lot of use . Even sitting at a rest stop , quite often other travelers would come up and ask me for directions to some place they 're looking for . The only downside to these maps ? Small print and I have old eyes . I brought along a magnifying glass to read it better . My bad luck to forget it at a rest stop and not realize it until I was 700 + miles away . I stopped at a Walmart and bought another .
4 #### You could spend a whole lot more , but this little kit delivers quality , compactness , and covers many calibers and gauges of firearm at a great price . The plastic jags are pretty flimsy , sombe careful one does nt snap off on you inside a barrel or worse barrel / chamber of a SA pistol .
4 #### The knife itself is amazing , easily earns 5 stars . I just believe Benchmade products to be a bit overpriced for what you get . If that is not an issue , then by all means get this blade . It is perfect small EDC . The axis lock is fantastic , 154CM steel is good . I wish the steel liners were skeletonized though , and also beware that the textured FRN handle scales can be slightly abrasive to your pants under the pocket clip .
5 #### Thick watches might be ' in ' now , but they wo n't fit under a long sleeve shirt sleeve plus they are SO heavy and clunky . This Skagen is super thin and light .
5 #### Excellent ! made in USA . nice surprise . Like the ammo storage in handle . It is a bit toy - like with bands that are not very powerful . Consider changing to heavier bands
4 #### The hat is very nice . It runs a little small so buy a size bigger
4 #### Good economical pair of jeans . Fit like the other Wrangler Rugged Wear jeans I purchased .
5 #### I have n't used this yet , but i expect it will work just fine .
5 #### Awesome soccer ball - just the classic soccer ball . Comes inflated ( but you can top it off ) . Seams appear strong but time will tell the durability .
5 #### I am in love with my " Chucks " ! ! :) I 've worn them all day long at work , ( and I 'm on my feet a LOT at work ! ) and have n't had any blisters or problems ! :) They 're so cute and funky !
5 #### I bought these for the purpose of putting them in a crew sock and using for applying pressure to tight muscles in my shoulder blades when I go to bed at nite . Breaks up that tight feeling .
5 #### Super clear picture . I bought it for the gun range but it is great for looking at the moon as well .
5 #### excellent denim quality , great price , great fit . exactlly what I wanted . Thank you , and Amazon prime has the BEST FASTEST reliable shipping , well worth the price .
2 #### First day using one of the socks . I was on my first climb of the day , reached in my chalk bag and squeezed the sock . The little crimp that seals the bag popped open and the whole sock poured into my bag . Weak . Poor quality .
5 #### bought it to fit onto Nautilus fold up snorkel- works well
5 #### Time tested , this model was my first back brace . Over the years I have bought a few different brands but the 1650 for it 's price is bar none the best . I work in a warehouse that moves 50lbs bags of sugar and it has saved me plenty of times from hurt and injury . No pinching . As for the other models like the 2000 , I will receive one shortly . I 'm going to test the difference at work . I will always look to Ergodyne now . P.s . Brace up is okay as well , a bit stiffer that ergodynes but it limits mobility when crouching .
5 #### A bit tight , perhaps a sign to lose 5 pounds ! Still , wearable .
2 #### The whistle is great , only problem was that i got the finger clip instead of the loop . I kept it because i needed it . Product was good , just wrong one .
5 #### i used the sizing guide and measured my sons foot with a ruler . These fit well and are adorable
5 #### I ordered a larger size than I am , didn't want a tight waist fit . They stay up , fit & look good . Would buy again ! ! !
5 #### I was delighted when my order came much earlier then expected ! Packaged well . New . Now I 'm ready for football season here in Jersey . Hang the colorful ' Garden Flag ' in a window . I 'm very pleased with the flag and how well made it is . Amazon.com is my favorite online site to shop ! ! RPITA , Brick , N.J.
5 #### Lighweight , easy to pack . This unit is well worth the money .
1 #### If these were the actual size I ordered they should have been almost falling off me . As it was , I could n't get them over my rump . They felt like they were a petite size small .
5 #### I am a teacher and I love the performanvce of this whistle . I use it only when we are out in the field and there is people everywhere . The sound is powerfull and it can be heard at a considerable distance , probably 150 yards . It is durable and compact . I have also taken it to camping , you know , for emergencies . I definitely recommend it . If you are into refereeing this is definitely the best choice .
4 #### If you order this and have a bigger wrist be ready to replace the band . While it is stretch(which is why i ordered it)it does not stretch much . My wrist is n't all the big but the band fits tight enough that I am going to have to replace the band as it does not stretch enough even if I try to do it myself . Like the watch itself though .
5 #### 16 years ago ( before i knew anything about knives or quality of craftsmanship ) i worked at a thrift store in seattle and came across a smaller version of this knife . i loved it because it had the tree stamped into it and it was and amazing knife . lasted me years all the while being a used knife for who knows how long before i stumbled upon it . it was worn and faded and was obviously well broken in . just recently i have discovered my knife fetish and have purchased a few of the boker knives and really love them . but it was n't until a few months ago after seeing one of their hats with the tree logo that i felt that deeper curiosity and connection that i had with my first " real knife " experience . and after submersing myself into the search i found this knife . almost exact to the mysterious tree knife that graced my daily tasks 16 years ago . so i eagerly purchased it knowing it could never replace that beauty of old but it wore the same tree emblem and that was enough for me . and to my suprise ...... this knife is amazing ! ! ! beautiful and " sharp enough to draw blood from a stone " .
5 #### This whistle has a clear sound that resonates well across larger soccer fields . The only real complaint I have is that this whistle seems to be used by almost everyone . This can lead to some confusion in a tournament setting with multiple fields . Not really Fox 40 's fault though that this things is so well - liked . I use this and a Fox 40 CMG Blast almost exclusively .
4 #### I bought this as a base layer and am well pleased with the fit and comfort of this top . It washed easily and comes out of the dryer ready to wear . Gets more comfortable with each laundering . Good top for the money . I will buy again .
5 #### easy to read , easy to set . Just what we wanted .
4 #### The anatomy is impossible to see unless you are basically holding the target but overall a good target . It is a good representation of the size of an actual human
5 #### Love Uncle Mike 's stuff - these are no exception , well made . However the ad is missing leading , the picture of product , the bundle items , and the Q&A all say 1 1/4 " . I returned for a 1 1/4 " set , and they sent me another 1 " set - I returned and gave up on this source .
5 #### Caught a bass on one first time using them . used it on a drop shot and the fish seemed to like it pretty soon after the weight hit the bottom . No more luck on a few more attempts but hopefully many more fish will take the bait next time out .
5 #### I am very impressed . It is cool that you can have a full body workout in such a small package . These would be fantastic for those who like to workout when they are traveling , and for folks like us that have a very small house and ca n't fit in a lot of bulky equipment . I have no complaints . I love the door anchor that allows you to do chest and back exercises . This was money well spent . I recommended a set to my parents , and they love it too !
4 #### i bought a pair from DSW for 50 $ and they are very comfortable but i bought a size 6.5 when I normally where a size 7 . and even the 6.5 feels a little roomy . I have wide flat feet btw . i m not sure if I will keep them even though i love their look and comfort . I 've been having feet problems while taking a gym class and I think they wo n't give me enough support when running . they 're great for wearing at home or gym and doing exercises in one place- extremely light weight and flexible , but i do n't know if they 'll last long if you use them everywhere else . :( i really like them but i ca nt just buy 2 different shoes . also , i really like the strings inside the lining on the side of the shoes to adjust and make the shoe fit snug . it makes me feel secure :D
5 #### Nice quality holster . It 's a little tight to begin with and I originally thought it did n't cover enough of the trigger , but with a little work , the holster loosened up enough to slide the pistol all the way inside , but not so much that the pistol felt like it would come out easily . Would recommend .
1 #### I practice QiGong and am a FEMALE . I find this " child and men " thing absurd . What am I supposed to do ? Guess or order ANY size and get stuck with a pair of shoes that wo n't fit ?
5 #### Great cotton . They came in black which is what I was looking for . I ordered the size I wear and it fine fine . Just wish they would come in a spandex blend and they would be perfect .
5 #### looks good and feels even better . Wear it with socks for the uncool look or bare footed .
5 #### It feels pretty awesome for now .. Will update in few months . The size was slightly large so I ordered one size smaller .
4 #### I would give this 5 stars except for the pesky tag which is very irritating .
5 #### love these - they do n't like sharp rocks but otherwise they are great and also comfy on land to lounge and read
5 #### I ca n't believe how many people miss the point of having a long watchband . If you have a large wrist it 's a devil of a time finding a leather - band watch long enough . The point of the long metal band is that women with large wrists can wear it , and women with smaller wrists can take out , or have a watch repair person take out , as many links as necessary , and even put some back in if you gain weight or your wrists swell ( along with your feet , hands and everything else ) in hot summer weather . Come on , people ; be thankful for this advantage , and remember to save the links removed in case you need to put them back later .
4 #### Purchased to wear for weightlifting and Zumba . Zumba trial was last night , and they were great ! Super comfortable , good ventilation ! Not too much padding , very minimalist , which is just what I wanted
5 #### Well made , solid zipper and button , heavy duty denim I expect will wear well
5 #### Love these . Unable to find my size in the stores
5 #### This is the best bait station I 've ever owned . It is a bit expensive , but will pay for itself in no time - why you ask ? Well I 'll tell you . I 've used bait buckets with aerators for years and on more than one occasion the bucket has tipped over on route to the old fishing hole . Yes I normally tie the bucket in such fashion that should eliminate tipping , but that does n't always work . Even if the bucket does n't tip , it at times sloshes enough water out to make life in the minnow school pretty hazardous . This case is insulated , sealed and aerated so our minnows keep cool , oxygenated and never run low on water . Years ago a case like this was n't necessary because fishermen would drop the minnow buckets into the lake for fresh water and oxygen , but that practice is no longer legal in most states . I 'm in central Wisconsin and a couple of dozen Red Roseys cost nearly $ 10 . Being able to keep them alive rather than to throw them out after each trip makes this Bait Station well worth the price .
5 #### Love these shoes ! I used to wear Sperry 's about 30 years ago back in school , and they were great all - around shoes . I went through many pair of Sperry 's throughout school . Well , I decided to go back and try Sperry 's again . I can say that they are the same great craftsmanship of the shoes I used to wear , but are much more comfortable than I remember them being . I am assuming shoe " technology " has advanced since the mid-80 's , and while these shoes have the same classic look and feel , they are very comfortable . The interior footbed feels like it has much better support and cushioning than what I remember . I normally wear a 14D ( medium or normal width ) , and that is what I ordered . They fit perfectly ! I like these so much that I am going to buy another pair of these in a different color so I have options . If you want a great pair of all - around casual loafers , you wo n't go wrong with these !
5 #### These bags are great for carrying around enough tools to maintain just about anything . It 's a little longer than I wanted but does the job
5 #### I am a big girl . This fit perfectly . I still had room to breath and it flowed . It 's a polyester type material . Breathable and light weight . Color is good . Washed well . Arrived on time . No damage .
5 #### Have used RCBS for more than 40 years .. they even machined me a set of dies for my own caliber and I design back in the late 60 's .. yes a .22 - 243 and it will still shoot a dime size group at 200 yards with a Heavy Hart barrel glass bedded in a Rem . XBR stock and Rem . action also a 20X Redfield scope . Swift and 22.250 can not hold a light to speed , accuracy , and flat trajectory of a .70 gr bullet coefficient ! RCBS A GREAT TOOL COMPANY and I have used almost every one on the market even Lee when they first started out and made a great field loader kit with dippers ! Second thoughts if I was not so much a Shakie Jake I could still give a dime sized group at 300 yards . My best shot was 9 telephone poles down a straight dirt road about .9 of a mile I killed a coyote and that is not any smoke or bull , just once in a lifetime in the right place at the right time and read the mirage correctly ! I still remember after all those years , how it looked like a swimming pool that warm day !
5 #### Been wearing Under Armour gear for about 3 years and I have to say its the best product out in the market . I workout a lot doing the cool months of Spring and Fall . And most of the Winter up in Northeast in New Jersey . These Men 's Coldgear by Under Armour are the best in keeping warm and staying dry while Running , walking , or doing other outdoor activities in cold weather . I like travel around while wearing just Under Armour while shopping , visiting Famous landmarks , and seeing people in different cities . The fit is always great , and help me warm doing colder winter months while I travel around the nation as Long Underwear Man .
5 #### I used this lanyard for a total of 22 dives in Roatan and there is no rust what - so - ever on it . This holds onto my console very well and I will probably buy this again if I ever need to replace it .
5 #### I recently had back surgery . My rehab for the first three months is walking . They seemed to be the most practical choice because while being a great walking shoe , they also look nice enough to wear to work and or dates with my wife . The slip on part is an added bonus to me because of my back .
4 #### I got this for my fianc for Christmas . Loves it , however it does run a little large ! !
3 #### After my purchased I found out they are overpriced . They feel good but I will not recommended if you need Wide fit .
5 #### I install LimbSaver recoil pads on all my deer rifles and 12 ga . shotguns . It makes shooting them so much more enjoyable ,
5 #### I bought these shoes to wear to the water parks this summer . They are so comfortable and cute that I wear them instead of other summer shoes . Many compliment received -- I bought the blue which is easy to wear with several different colors .
5 #### Great shoes . Fits like everyone says . I would buy them again
5 #### Best watch ever ... Takes a licking and keeps on ticking !
5 #### I was pleasantly surprised at how well this pantyhose fit , not only was it able to accommodate my plus sized figure but also my tall height . A rare combination and very much appreciated . Recommended !
2 #### I took a chance on this shoe and I 'm really disappointed . The quality looks cheap and feels cheap . Had horrible blisters after the first 2 days of wearing despite a good fit- the material is just unnaturally hard . I guess you get what you pay for . Really not great .
4 #### These things are almost bullet proof .... do n't know that I would take them into space or the depths of the ocean . Would buy them again and most likely will next year for our next trip ...
5 #### This is a really good idea to fir the magazine holder in a horizontal position . It does poke you when carrying .
5 #### I 'm a 42R coat size 5 ' 10 " 180 # always wear a Large shirt but with these I order a Meduim and as long as I do n't shrink the shirt it 's perfect .. These are the best ! !
4 #### I wear them for Zumba and my heel slips on turns . A little annoying because I have to pay attention but they are so cute and comfy , it balances out .
4 #### these are a good deal and saved me going to a store to buy them ca n't wait for summer so that I can fit into them
1 #### No .. i am order size for 12 month but i r3ceived sizw foe 3month !
5 #### We 've had tons of snow & sub - zero temperatures this season , and this suit has made my life much easier . I do not have to layer with this on . It keeps me dry & warm and is easy to get in and out of . I am 5 ' 10 " 220 with a 50 " chest & 42 " waist , and the 2XL fits me perfectly . It 's been used a lot with no signs of wear . It 's performed so well at extreme temperatures that I 'm looking forward to trying it out with my motorcycle when the snow thaws .
5 #### Just what I wanted to help my granddaughter learn to tell time . She loves it !
5 #### Just got a picture with his complete costume on ! He is so cute and these wings are the best ! He can wear them throughout the house w/o scratching up the walls , furniture , etc .
5 #### Great for cycling in cold weather . I slide one of these between my cycling shoe and the thermal cover to keep the toes warm when ridin in sub - freezing weather .
4 #### I did not measure before the purchase and it was a little longer than expected ( well over the knees .... I'm about 5 ft 3 in ) . But the quality was as expected .
5 #### These locks work awesome I love these Master Locks Fits on all my Firearms
5 #### product shipped fast . item as expected good buy . will do business with you again in the future and to top it ooff your customer service was great .
3 #### I have been using this for a month and it does everything it is suppose to do and seems well made . However , I was replacing one I had left at a relatives house and this one is not as nice as the one I used to own . I prefer a padded handle for more comfort and less slipping ( I have large hands and it is much more comfortable for me to have the larger , padded handle ) . I should have looked closer at this one , my fault , but just letting others know that if it matters to you , the handle on this one is hard , cold plastic and without the pad is not as easy for me to grip . For the price , I was expecting the nicer grip .
4 #### she had a smaller one and was ready for this one . it seems a bit lighter and flimsy than the older one . the bell is fairly hard for her to use ( she 's 3 ) . its the perfect size and she loves it .
5 #### Fit as expected . Bought for my wife a few months ago . I based the size off the other pairs of " chucks " she owns . They were exactly the same . Color almost exactly as pictured . Shipping and all that jazz was fine . - If I buy these Converse through Amazon again , I 'll use this seller
5 #### these fit very well on my boyfriend who is 5'8 and about 200lbs they kept him pretty warm along with 2 front pockets and a place to clip snow gloves he also stated they were very comfortable
5 #### Great cushioning for knees ! Length is awesome for tall people .
4 #### Seems like a strong , well made stuff bag . Only time will tell . Just the right size too . Blah , blah , blah
5 #### This is my daughter 's second pair of chucks . She is in high school and they are a must have . She finds them very comfortable and I like them because they last for the whole school year . Well being used about once or twice a week . She says they are very comfortable . And Amazon Gave us a great price .
4 #### A little lighter than I expected .... Wanted it for winter wear , but it is OK for spring and fall .
5 #### these targets are anatomically accurate for size and placement of vital organs . bargain vs. price they charge at the range .
5 #### soo easy to set up and fold back to put away ! Highly recommend .
5 #### love it but do n't know where imam going to use it on a 10000 lb vessel .
4 #### I was hoping for more arch support for my high arches , but the footbed seemed fairly flat to me . However , if you have flat feet , this amount of arch support is probably fine ( I would call it minimal , but I suppose it is all a matter of perspective ) . Otherwise , the shoes seemed well made and comfortable and they easily accommodated my wide feet and narrow heels .
5 #### The watch is very small . The face is about the size of a quarter , and the band is thinner than a half an inch . Some people say they ca n't see the date displayed on the watch , but I think those people might need to get their eyes checked . The date display is small , but plenty big enough to see if you have the right glasses prescription . Some people say the glowing was n't bright enough , but I think it 's great . I hate when it glows too bright to the point where it looks like you 're trying to take down an aircraft with your watch . You ca n't see it glowing if you 're in broad daylight .
5 #### Typical Times quality . I got this on sale for $ 11 to use as a spare when needed - its just good to have a couple of these beaters around .
2 #### The watch is pretty small . I thought I could deal with that . I was unable to change the date . The watch then stopped functioning a day later . I will be returning it .
4 #### It 's cedar . It 's a shoe valet . I bought it because it was pretty cheap , and it meets my expectations . Would recommend .
5 #### Keeps the rays off and the drops at bay , what more could you want from a hat ? Do get a size up from what you normally wear , as it is cut rather tight . Mine lives in the jeep so it 's always handy here in the Mojave where I live .
5 #### I have worn many helmets in my life , but this is the first bicycle helmet I 've ever owned . It is comfortable , easy to adjust and stays adjusted . I fervently hope I never have to find out how well it performs in a crash . I do wonder what would happen to the area around the base of the skull if one were struck from behind , but all bicycle helmets appear similar in design and it looks like in a headfirst pitch the top of the head would be protected . That 's why I say a little prayer every time I ride .
5 #### This thing works surprisingly well . It really does come back . You need a huge space for it though . I have taken it to 2 parks with big fields and it always finds the closest tree . The last time we used it got stuck in 2 trees . The first we climbed , the second I got a basketball stuck in when I tried to get this down . Luckily a man with a football helped me knock them both down . It is a fun " toy " and it really flies well . Highly recommend it if you have the space .
5 #### I carry my off - duty in this when I am running around town . I have found it to be comfortable and covenant to carry . As with any ankle holder I would encourage the carrier to practice drawing it as it does add a new challenge . The quality of Galco prevents the weapon from shifting and keeps it secure . I have never had the feeling that I was going to drop or loose the weapon .
5 #### I 'm a 38H and work out daily This is the ONLY bra that works for me - I have used it for years .
4 #### My 5 year old son loves this thing . It 's pretty zippy and has held up for the last 6 months . The drive chain fell off once but other than that , no problems .
5 #### These were a gift to my son . They fit well and he loves them !
5 #### I have been eating this particular recipe for over 40 years and I enjoy the taste . And as for storage , I have had cans that were stored for over 15 years and they held their taste and quality . You get what you paid for with Mountain House .
4 #### Bought this for my 6yr old , but it was way bigger than expected . Not normal pocket knife size . Thankfully the 6yr old did n't compare his to both of his siblings real knives .
5 #### These are the best shoes I have ever use for my workouts ! ! ! I love them and buy them in bulk ! ! ! LOL
5 #### Purchased for my baby nephew . They are adorable on his little feet .
5 #### Great fit and support . I 've been buying this bra for many years and can not find in the department stores any longer . Amazon had it at a great price . I 'm a happy woman .
5 #### I am an 8.5 in Vans and got 8.5 in these and the only issue was that the toe was long and everything else for as expected so I guess you got ta order a 1/2 size down
5 #### I usually like to walk to work in the morning and being that it is now the winter season I wanted to bundle up for the short trip there . I scoured the interwebs for a cheap yet quality product that I could buy and found this beauty . It feels great even when used as a face guard . It 's really soft and keeps you very warm for a nice price .
5 #### If u do n't have 1 of these U NEED 1 ! Loads of FUN ! !
5 #### My husband saw a gent with these on , and asked him the name , then he had to have a pair as the gent said they were as comfortable as they look . They fit great , and he wears them all the time , says they are much better feeling than athletic shoes . They look great too . I was worried about getting them dirty , but everything brushes away . We have recently ordered another pair in darker color to wear with work clothes .
4 #### h tongues slide to the side constantly , but they are cute
5 #### Nice looking shoes . I wear them all day and my feet do very well , no hot spots . need to get a brown pair .
5 #### My son loved this pocket knife . I purchased many the past few years . Decided to get this one for his Boy Scout camping trip . It was easy for my 11 year old child to use each part of the pocket knife . This will last him throughout his Boy Scout journey .
5 #### Not much to add in addition to what has already been posted but I wish I had one of these years ago . Great for quickly cleaning the bore between relays at the range and the bore shines after a couple of passes . Knocks the fouling out from the chamber throat to the muzzle as you pull it through . Folding kit is great too as it keeps everything together in my range bag . Silicone wipes that come with it made my AR look new again .
4 #### Only 4 starts because I have n't tried the shoe on . I 'm a 8 1/2 - 9 in women 's and I bought an 7 in kids . Runs big .
5 #### After a long day of kayaking my back muscles are tired . Having some back back support in camp is so important and comfortable and this chair fits the bill .
2 #### Denim is denim is denim . These jeans meet all the usual standards in terms of appearance and toughness . The problem is that although I ordered my normal size they are cut slightly , but noticeably , too small . The next size would be too large . One particular oddity is that the back pockets are so small that they are difficult to use .
4 #### My daughter loves these shoes and is wearing them constantly ! !
5 #### Worth every penny . Been disappointed with the comfort and durability of other brands of socks I ve bought but not these . Wigwam makes quality socks .
5 #### Just what I was looking for , I have big head and it fit loosely , not too tight
4 #### I 'm completely satisfied , none were damaged .. Now I do n't have to pay $ 6 or $ 7 for 5 at the range . I will definitely reorder when I run out .
4 #### Not much to these tinder tabs . They 're small and stay lit for about a minute or two , which is all you need if you have the other parts of making a fire ready for use . Just pull 'em apart to fluff them up a bit and lit it with whatever you can and BAM ! Fire .
3 #### So -- there 's two different items advertised here . There 's a small image and a large image . The small image accurately depicts what I received . It was a block M with " MICHIGAN " written across it . The large image , however , shows something other than what I received . It was a block M WITHOUT " MICHIGAN " written across it . I would have preferred receiving the one without the writing . The vendor ought to make the picture match what they are shipping . In my case , that did n't happen .
3 #### I liked the bottle , but it dents really easily so after about a month , it looked pretty old . A bit heavy too , compared to other brands that I 've seen .
5 #### The bands are color - coded for resistance level , making it easy to swap bands to obtain the exact resistance you want . The handles are sturdy and comfortable . I especially appreciate the metal carabiner - style clips that seem much stronger than the cheap plastic used in some other brands .
5 #### I love these Carhartt shirts . They fit great and they last a long time . I highly recommend these shirts .
5 #### Love it ! Earlier then expected ! I bought two of these pins , one for me and a coworker . Clipped into our name badges at work .
3 #### It 's as cheap as it is priced . one of the three rubber teats on the back broke off & the bracket was bent when it arrived . The darts are as cheap as the board with as much as 0.2 grams difference between them in weight . I wanted a cheap board for practicing at home & that 's exactly what I got .
5 #### On the Porch . Now all I have to do is get in the Habit of using it . Shipping was sooner vs. later and handled efficiently and professionally .
5 #### Use this bag for keep tools and supplies for furnace tune ups .
4 #### I 've lost weight since the one I had many years ago , and this one is just a little too loose . Other than that , this is exactly what I wanted . Simple , clean design , includes the minute ticks between the numbers , and has a lovely mother of pearl face . It glows when you press the stem , so you can see the time even in a dark room .
5 #### Just like buying them from the store but comes to your door , great . Do n't tell me how many words to use .
4 #### It is very nice system , it was easy to assemble . My only issue with the kit is the main rope line which is used to hoist the Kayak up and down . It would be nicer if that line a was thicker and softer braid , so you could grip it easier without gloved hands . I bought the 90lbs kit and with my rigged Kayak it 's pushing 70lbs , the line is a little hard on the hands . I would have given five stars if that were not the case .
5 #### Best mat on the market . Comfortable , slip resistant , easily washed / sanitized and always lays flat regardless of the time its been rolled .
4 #### the arch support is good , not perfect . But the shoe is comfortable . I love this design . It matches all my outfits . I normally wear a six , but size 5.5 fits with Saucony sneakers .
5 #### Did the job , brought walking belt back to life . I do wish they would sell the same product in a larger capacity so I do n't need to come back and buy another tiny little squirt package !
5 #### The one I own is my second one . I love all the extra slots to put things in . Most likely when I wear this one out I plan to order this one again .
1 #### Utter crap . The first time I dove with it , it fell off within minutes ( on the dive boat ) and I could n't find it again . Do not waste your money .
3 #### In case of emergency I could get it to work . I found it tough to get enough magnesium together and the flint seemed to glaze over with use . At least it 's water proof .
5 #### So comfortable . I want to get them in more colors .
4 #### This is a good tetherball system ; the pole can be removed ( ours is at the bottom of our sledding hill , so we will take it out of the hole in the winter ) . BUT ... the ball is not of very good quality . We have had it in the yard for only four weeks and the ball is bleached by the sun on the top and the rope already broke . But you can buy another ball . The best part is the pole is solid , and as I said , removable . I would recommend this set .
5 #### I have been wearing Merrells for well over ten years , now . They are durable , rugged , with firm grip soles , easy to put on and take off , and just the best show anyone could ask for . Back in 1988 I had developed bone spurs and plantar fascitis . I got orthotic inserts made for me and my feet were fine .... until , in 2004 they broke ! Unable to afford replacements , I went without . The Merrell shoes give my feet SUCH good support , that from 2004 until today in 2016 , I simply do n't need the orthotics . These shoes are the BEST shoes I 've EVER worn .
5 #### I have a big head , it is adjustable so it fits fine .
4 #### Bought this because I was concerned that just securing a rack with 5 bikes via one secrew was a recipe for disaster on a long road trip , but the pin did n't loosen at all during our recent trip and I assume the original pin which came with the rack would have stayed securely fastened too . If someone wants to steal a rack , they 'll find a way and this wo n't stop them , but it provides peace of mind by adding a second thing that has to break before your rack falls off the car if the screw fails .
4 #### Fit very nice , feel very good on and look good also
5 #### Bought these for my 14 year old daughter and she loves them ! They are cute , versatile and easy to clean .
4 #### My hand therapist recommended I buy this for my home therapy program . I broke my wrist and needed to do exercises with this product for my recovery . This works very well . I can tell it 's helping me gain my strength back .
5 #### LOOOOVE IT ! ! ! ! ! Was absolutely awesome ! ! ! ! Great quality ! EXCELLENT PRICES ! ! ! Very fast shipping ! Excellent seller !
5 #### Cheaper than a case . The three pack helped me keep rifles clean that normally are just sitting in the wall case getting dust on them . They slide over my shotgun , 22 and old British 303 with ease and keep the guns clean to the next time I take them out for practice without having bulky carrying cases .
5 #### Good but they smell like fish . I have to keep the box in a plastic bag because of the odor
5 #### This is a great value for the price point . I enjoyed the power for this price point . It focuses fast and has a clear field of view . Would purchase celestron again .
4 #### Very nice simple and classy looking watch . Water resistant and fit well after removing a couple of links . Clasp seems to hold well too . Nite light comes in handy in the dark .
3 #### These are not as large as they used to be , so do n't generate as much heat . I wish they went back to the old size
5 #### For having a large chest , these are perfect . Great support and comfortable . They have wide straps and the back is wide with 5 clips , so great support all around - exactly what I look for in a bra !
4 #### Although I own these socks , the purchase on Amazon was for Marine Raiders serving overseas .
5 #### My Mom asked for a pair of casual sneakers . I got these for her & she recalled liked them . She particularly likes the color . They 're a dark grayish blue . They look great with blue jeans .
5 #### I bought a pair and have not taken them off since . Easy to slip on and off these are the perfect pair for someone on the go . The unique toe guard protects your feet like no other sandal of this type . They also dry very quickly so if you spend a lot of time around water these could be the sandals for you . ( Although the Newport H2 's dry faster ) To top it all off they feel great on my feet . Do yourself a favor and try these out you will not regret it .
5 #### My dad loves this watch . He has Alzheimer 's and likes this better than digital .
5 #### This is fun we used it at the beach and had a great time . The light works and the disc has a nice weight to it .
5 #### I 've been wearing converse for years and I still love them !
3 #### They would have been good shoes but came in the wrong size so I had no choice but to return them
5 #### This has worked out very well . It sits right on top of my Jewelry Stax 36 Compartment Tray and keeps all my small charms in one area .
5 #### Good ppl had a problem with my tracking number so i emailed them and with great responce my questions were answered ..
5 #### The wig was such awful quality and took some working with to make it look not bald , I do not understand why it was even included . The costume was great tho , we customized the plain pink backside with designs to match the front
5 #### Its one thing that this frisbee lights up for some awesome night play , but another , more important quality is the material . Its a soft plastic that is so forgiving on you hands you could play forever . I 've used many of the " Official 175 g Ultimate Frisbees " and they downright destroy your hands after a few hours of tossing . Also you could throw this thing straight at a tree and it wo n't baulk . I played night frisbee on the beach with these and we were getting tons of people coming up and asking us about it and saying how cool it was . Felt like a couple of trendsetters we did , because the next night some people who were watching us the night before had got their own from LL Bean .
5 #### Great old school shoe . Very comfortable . I wear a 10 and it fit true to size .
5 #### Best fitting shirt for a 3XL Tall I have ever found . And unlike other big and tall shirts they positioned the pocket in the right place
5 #### Keep my guards in perfectly and were great for the price .
5 #### As described . They run a bit large as do most chuck taylors .
5 #### I actually really like these bands . I have n't used them a ton yet but they seem well made and work well . I did try the door anchor and used it without any issue . So far I 'm very pleased with this purchase .
5 #### I had n't worn a pair of Chuck Taylor 's for over 40 years and bought them for old times sake . Wow ! They handle an orthotic very well and are surprisingly comfortable . They 've become my shoe of choice and I wear them most of the time now . It 's also great to be able to throw them in the wash with the clothes .
5 #### Like this one so much , I bought another six - pak by mistake , but decided to keep it for my ever growing family . Especially handy on those shoots where weather / condensation may cause problems .
5 #### Have had several pairs of this Keen style ; glad to find them at Amazon ! I have problem feet and these shoes solve that problem without having to use orthotics !
5 #### I got these shoes to wear for squats and deadlifts work great
4 #### I go through two pair a year and usually buy at west marine . While they have the width ( W ) I need , do not have this darker brown . Nice for a change
5 #### Fit like a dream ! Great for cross - training / HITT videos I do everyday . Great for walking too . Look amazing !
5 #### This was super . Great price , could not have rented for less and it looked like the real thing . On a panel in a game show and it was so convincing . Get it . It is worth it .
5 #### its exactly what you expect . Great for gun smithing or armoring jobs . Does not scuff up your rifles . build quality seems solid .
4 #### Awesome ankle weights . The Velcro is a little cheap as it is starting to show wear already with minimal use . But overall , these are great .
5 #### Bought these for some mosin nagants that i bought , seem durable enough and serve their purpose . Great price for what they are as well , do n't pay more .
3 #### I ordered these for a trip in the north pole in December . I wanted a " base layer " for my hands . Most importantly , I am a photographer and I went to the north pole to " hunt " nothern lights so I wanted to be able to manipulate the camera without loosing my hands . I was very please with the gloves for that . They were able to keep my hands in " working condition " for ~ 30 min . at temperature as low as -13 F. Without these , my hands were freezing in few minutes . The downside is that the quality is poor . The seems are weak and even with great care , they did not survive this 5 days trip ... too bad .
3 #### getting these socks to fit a 9 - 9.5 foot / 43 cm is tough . they are just a wee bit big .
5 #### Love these shoes ... Getting harder to find them .. Hope you keep selling them ... Very comfortable and i love the look ! Great fit and price !
4 #### I love these , I 've had several pairs of Venice sandals , this pair just does n't fit like the others did . Maybe they changed something besides the length of the toe string holder . It 's not bad , it 's just different . The right heel cover does n't seem to stay up as well as the left ... I guess the thing is , I 've never had a pair of shoes out of the box where the left was perfect and the right was " off " until now . But they 're close enough and the price was right . I 'll update this review if something goes way wrong , it may just be me having new shoes and not accustomed to them . But seriously , the left one is perfect and the right one is n't . How odd .
5 #### I bought these for my daughter . She wears them nearly everyday .
5 #### i have a wide foot so usually brands like these fit tightly . this shoe fits perfectly . and looks great , now lets see how long i can keep them white .
5 #### Bought this a year ago and they are still going strong one year later . It is a shame that the matching pants are no longer being produced .
5 #### Pretty iffy construction but it has n't popped yet with these knucklehead kids bouncing around it . We tie it up to the boat and let em float . Stupid oars keep floating away
5 #### Great basic long sleeve tee shirt . I did buy one size larger of the 100 % cotton one planning on it to shrink during laundry , and it did . The 50/50 blend had very minimal shrinkage , not enough to buy a size up .
5 #### Converse are always true to size . These are great because they last longer than tennis shoes and can be handed down when outgrown without being too old and ratty .
5 #### Adjustable and light weight . Great for mowing , trimming and chain saw work .
5 #### Best dog frisbee ever . Soft edge so it does n't hit their teeth hard , flies well , very durable for the price !
5 #### Great bra for lift and separation . Best for larger sizes ! !
4 #### Overall this is very good . I really do enjoy this . I do n't play lacrosse but I do have a stick and I love to play with it .
5 #### So thin , great for keeping you warm without all the bulk . Would definitely buy these again . ,also easy to wash . The black color is nice .
5 #### Nice quality attachment . Spring loaded to the open / spread position all of the time . Fits the Avery Telescopic Push Pole nicely , although the spring loaded buttons on the pole do n't stick out very far past the attachment collar . Read in other reviews that this my be a problem , so I immediately drilled and inserted a small # 8 stainless steel sheet metal screw thru the collar and into the pole . This , coupled with the two push buttons ( on the pole),should eliminate any possibilities of losing the foot when stuck in the mud . I do n't plan on using any other attachments on the pole , so fixing it on permanetly should n't be a problem . If I change my mind and want to add an extra attachment , its as simple as removing the stainless screw with a screwdriver and going back to using the push buttons on the pole .
5 #### Well made . Strong enough to carry more weight than you will need .
5 #### Perfect , exactly what we wanted and at a great price . I will buy from this seller again if we need another one .
5 #### Have used this sterling silver polishing cloth for years . Connoisseurs is the best for removing dark tarnish with white cloth and polishing to high shine with pink cloth . Much better on your sterling jewelry than the liquid , too powerful cleaners which damage the finish . Everyone who has sterling MUST have one of these cloths . Also , cloths are large with a lot of cleaning service .
5 #### I got these boots for my lil cousin and she loved them !
5 #### These are perfect for wearing in the garden , as they keep dirt out of your shoes and do n't collect stickers . This is about my third pair .
3 #### very tight , & i 'm only 95 lbs & 5'2 . i 'm currently stretching them out . they have a weird smell to them too , & they 're very translucent
5 #### I first have to say that I bought dickies from Walmart for my husband last year and he does n't care for them at all ... The belt loops were chincy and came with a button instead of a clasp . These were the solution to our issue . The price was great , the quality was superb ... thick belt loops and clasp instead of button the works .. Will be buying more soon
4 #### This works great for dead lift grip in swampy Fayettenam , however , leaves the hands a bit chapped .
5 #### On the third pair over many years . Love the style and comfort . Only down side is breaking them in new ... they rubbed the heel .
4 #### son wore these and they hurt his feet at first like any boot that needs to be broken in , but he loves them now when he helps in the yard .
5 #### Love these hose silky and control top , they arrived quickly
5 #### nice swim goggles .... this is usually what I buy when I need goggles .
5 #### I have three other pairs of these sandals in different colors . These sandals are terrific . They fit beautifully , and as well or better than any shoes I own . I pronate and they are no problem even though they are not made for people who pronate . I also have very wide feet and they also accommodate that issue . Thumbs up on these shoes .
3 #### I was shocked at how small these shoes were , not true at all to size , and I own multiple shoes in this brand . The quality could have been better , in my opinion -- very little support from the upper .
5 #### My 3 yr old son loved wearing it for Halloween . Looks accurate , comes with elastic straps to be worn like a backpack .
5 #### This is very nice camping stove I 've had mine for years worth the money ........ when it 's time to replace ill buy another one just like it .
3 #### Nice shoes but run very large . I wear 11 W in Brooks and New Balance so I ordered 11 W in these . The length was right but the width was considerably wider than the Brooks or New Balance of the same size .
5 #### These are my favorite panties by far . I am a male as a FYI . They feel great against the skin and very cute . You not need to be a female to wear woman 's soft and cute panties . Men 's underwear is rough and yuck .
5 #### In really like these . I wear between a 9 - 9.5 womens , I got the 9.5 and they fit perfectly . They are light weight but have good support . I will buy another pair .
4 #### This set was the perfect replacment for my grandson 's Razor . He wore a flat spot on the rear wheel ..... what 's better than skidding on a Razor ? So I got this set and replaced the rear wheel . The front wheel was in good shape so I will keep the second wheel as a future replacement . Installation was a breeze with a small hex wrench .
5 #### My physical therapist recommended this FlexBar for some of my exercises . It is really great and has helped me immensely . I continue to use it and like it .
1 #### Hope I can return this watch ... stopped working after using it for 1 month ... changed batteries .... after 1 week stopped working again ... oh my ! !
5 #### These are Very nice shirts ! ! ! Only problem we 've had is pockets need stronger stitching , other than that , very Nice !
5 #### I had a bad case of tennis elbow . Saw the Thera Band and gave it a try . Glad I did . About 7 to 8 days of daily exercise with them , my elbow is almost pain free . I would highly recommend them .
5 #### First off , I 'm 6'-5 " 225 lbs and finding any article of clothing that actually fits me properly is really tough . The Xlt 's size are perfect for me . These are good quality heavy weight work shirts that come in hard to find tall sizes . Nothing worse than a crummy paper thin T shirt riding up your back because it 's too short .
5 #### Timberland products never disappoint . Good looking , solid boots . My 5y / o son loves them .... looks good with his uniform . Very pleased .
5 #### Nice leather and functional purse ( lots of compartments and card slots ) . My mother loves it ! The red colour looks better than the picture shows .
1 #### Bought 2 . First one leaked right out of box .. Have not opened second one - may return . Was very disappointed , have always thought INTEX products were the best , but this item fell very short . Because of the great experiences I have had with all other INTEX products I have , I will buy from them again - just not this item .
5 #### perfect sandal , my second pair would purchase again , another color would be nice , I love the compfort of this sandal . Keen is the best
5 #### I love these , I had the previous iteration ( or maybe two earlier ? ) and finally wore them out after several years . They are definitely a light - weight training shoe so I would n't get them if you are going to be doing a lot of running . But this also makes them extremely comfortable , I had n't realized how hot running shoes made my feet until I switched to these . Good support and my feet stay cool all day , also noticeably light but well - made and long lasting . I have worn them hiking in a pinch but do n't really recommend it because the material is mesh - like and will let a lot of dirt in . But if you mainly take cardio classes and/or do weight training or just need something to wear around town look no further .
5 #### An excellent replacement for my previous pair of 4 years . Thanks for the fast shipping
3 #### Like the look of the watch , but the battery died within a few days . My husband never had the battery replaced , so he 's never worn it .
5 #### Came pumped up ! Sure I topped them off , but nice that they came pumped up . You do n't want to have them not inflated for long its bad for them . Good product . Picked this up for my basketball team , and they are loving them .
5 #### So much easier to see where you are shooting then a bullseye target . Gets one shooting in the right areas easier .
5 #### My 3 year old daughter looooves this hat . It 's really well made . Is adjustable to fit , and the rabbit it adorable . The best part is you can put any other small item inside the secret compartment and make it " disappear " . Highly recommend . I think this hat is good for any age 3 and up .... My hubby and I included ;)
1 #### If there were an occult dedicated to Sperry , I 'd be in it . However , this shoe is utter garbage . The sole is a very cheap spongey material that is painted for the colour differences , of which is painted inconsistently along an imaginary " seam " line . In addition , the shoe came with scuffs and inconsistent leather treatment applied on the exterior ( especially around the seams ) . They look like I 've already gone bumbling about in a Thai opium den while blitzed on sake bombs . I know they 're cheaper than the other Sperrys , but I would pony up the extra $ 20 and get a better pair .
5 #### It took a couple rides for him to get used to the speed ( he almost crashed the first time ) , I considered the faster ones , but now I am happy with this speed . Although I want him to be above the curve , this one is just fine for now .
5 #### super easy to use and they hold stuff down nice and tight . i was skeptical to order due to the price but i wound up getting 2 sets to strap our kayaks down on my ladder rack . cinch it down , tie off the excess and you can shake the whole truck with these things .
5 #### Carhartts are always awesome I just love it even more when the price is perfect !
5 #### My teenage daughter started wearing these when she started high school . Now they are the only sneakers she will wear . All of her friends wear them too .
5 #### Great grip nice product very good quality and very good fit .
1 #### I always wear chucks , but the ones I bought from here were bad . They felt a bit uncomfortable , and up to this day they hurt so bad . I tried the whole breaking them in , but nothing has changed . So disappointed .
5 #### Love these shoes . I wear a 7.5 but ordered a 7 based on reading the reviews . Perfect fit . May order these again in red .
5 #### I bought this little kit for my 6.8 AR it works very well and fits into my rifle bag . I can also use it on my ruger 77 7 mm mag . one of the great things about the bore snake is you only have to pull it through the bore twice and that s it , clean as a whistle ! ! ! I like that the kit holds cleaner and oil and I added a silicon cloth to it as well as a soft clean cotton cloth . I highly recommend this kit ...
5 #### Ordered for mount on a 22 like described . Scope is very nice with covers that have one end yellow and one end clear . Mounted on gun with no problem .
5 #### Great product , nice feel on the leg , stays up well . Nice color
4 #### I got them because they were large , plentiful , and cheap . The bonus is that it comes printed with the image of a human being , which will definitely excite all of us who dream of having an excuse to take down our fellow man .
5 #### this is an old favorite . I found my original slingshot predecessor to this from about 20 years ago . the old one was almost all metal construction so it was heavier . this one is lighter . it also has the grooves to hold the wrist support rigid , whereas my old one does not . this is probably the best and simplest slingshot you can get for $ 10 . i bought 4 of these so far . i also bought the spare rubber bands and some of the 303 space age protectant . it 's supposed to be the best to keep the rubber from aging
4 #### I bought these shoes to give to my niece for Christmas . They were very nice , but I miscalculated her size from the unisex chart and they were too large . I returned them , and to avoid the confusion on sizing , I purchased the correct size from a local sporting goods store . I do recommend them , but I would suggest you refer to the charts for men or women sizes rather than unisex .
5 #### Great product and design . Following exercises on YouTube this helped heal my tennis elbow more than anything else . Very glad I found this . One note is the rubber material breaks in after some use giving it a little less resistance with continued use . Not a problem but you may need to take into account when selecting the resistance level .
5 #### I normally wear a size 9 but ordered a 9 1/2 based other recomendations that they tend to run small ... " they " were right ... go up a half size .
5 #### Beautiful watch and fits perfectly . Just what I wanted -- simplicity and versatility .
5 #### Extremely comfortable shoe stretches after several wearing so buy your normal sizw
5 #### This is a great little hammer , When it arrived I was a bit disappointed in it 's size but after using it , it 's perfect . Just the right size with a good weigth to it .
5 #### Great chalk for climbing and lifting . In the 300 g bag , it 's got both large chunks , and the broken down fine powder . The mouth is large enough for one hand , though maybe not two unless you have small hands so I 'd say pour it in your chalk bucket instead if you like getting it on with two hands . A little pricier than I 'm used to at $ 12 , but I usually just buy the flashed 2 oz blocks for $ 2 - 3 and break it up on my bag . I will say though , from the black diamond store itself , the 300 g sells for $ 10.95 , but an extra dollar for 2 day shipping is worth it to me . Comparing the two , Flashed for the value works great , and does the trick . Black Diamond though , does seem to leave a better layer on my hands , and actually feels a little stickier . Worth the price IMO , but since I 'm cheap , I 'll probably wind up mixing the two a bit for gym use .
5 #### I researched my compass selection for days before buying this . It lives up to all of the hype . It 's accurate , accommodates a wide range of tilt , and any geographic location . The mirror works beautifully for siding , and the rotatable bezel holds its position . It 's a great choice for a primary compass .
5 #### My wife wanted a small bottle for her hair gel for trips . This bottle had a nice wide mouth and a tight fitting lid and was of good quality . She had no problems with leakage on a recent 10 day trip . We use Amazon for most of our purchases and I update my reviews if anything changes with the products . I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product . I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own .
5 #### Ladies if your earrings are jumbled mess this Acrylic Earring File Organizer is the one to buy ! Each file slides smoothly out to hold 36 pair of earrings 108 pair in all amazing ! The clean Acrylic lines are beautiful and look pretty on the vanity . Well worth the cost !
5 #### Always have loved the Chuck Taylor 's shoes . However I thought I was ordering the black on white and the black on black . But I love them anyways no issues and no worries .
5 #### Great quality with a lifetime warrantee . The bands have metal d - rings that are sturdy . Not like the plastic ones they had at your target and walmart . You get 5 bands of different resistance and other goodies . I enjoy using them and it gives me a great workout .
5 #### Probably the coolest purchase I made this summer . My whole family loves playing with this guy outside at night . Its BRIGHT and looks awesome flying through the sky . Excellent purchase . Now I want to purchase more colors .
5 #### I love these shoes , they fit at the right size and are very comfortable . The price was pretty good , could be a little cheaper .
5 #### Got them for my girlfriend . She loves them . Says it 's like wearing slippers because they are incredibly light .
4 #### Fun toy that takes some getting used to . Plan to spend some time chasing this thing before you get the hang of it . Make sure to use this in WIDE open areas and on grass , turf or other soft grounded areas . Asphalt and sidewalks will tear it up pretty quickly and the gashes / chips can effect the boomerangs desired flight trajectory . Other than that it 's a lot of fun to toss around . :-)
5 #### This is actually the exact replica of the pair husband actually wore out . He was very pleased to get the new pair .
4 #### Deflates rather quickly for no reason , after 24 hours 3 of these are flat again . Pumped them full again , and flat a day later . Not cool Champion . This makes my job a lot more annoying now .
5 #### Great targets for handguns or even distance shooting . The targets are truly man sized and will make you a better shooter .
5 #### These are great . I appreciate no longer losing chalk out of my bag while off the wall . easy to chalk up finger tips or the entire hand . They are sealed with a hog ring which can be pried open to be refilled and then crimped back together .
4 #### I bought this to use in my backyard chiminea to lay firewood on and place kindling underneath . There 's really not much to it ; two pieces of wrought iron riveted together in the middle . It serves my purpose and seems to stand up to the intense heat generated by the fire . I thought is was a little pricey for what you get , but as mentioned , it works for my intended purpose .
4 #### This flag does the trick without being too large for the yard . Good color .
4 #### I like this watch , and the light up dial . It is large , and I do n't know how to take out link(s ) , so I just either push it up , or wear it like a bracelet . Maybe I 'll take it to a jeweler , but doubt it .
5 #### Great color , sturdy canvas , strong strings with the usual great Converse quality .
5 #### Love the quality of these shirts , but they are n't as long as I had hoped . I purchased SEVERAL of these shirts for my husband who is a General Contractor who can never keep his shirts tucked in . He 's not super tall either , he 's right at 6 ' but has a longer torso and I was hoping these shirts would be significantly longer than normal but they are n't . But on the other hand , the quality is SUPERIOR ! ! !
5 #### It 's a very nice product for the price point . If you 're reading this you know they can be very expensive . I trust that if I take a minor tumble wearing this helmet I should be okay . I like the humbleness of the helmet vs some of the other ones out there that scream for attention . I think it says more about the person wearing the helmet than the helmet itself ...
5 #### I wore these when a new apartment complex was being built beside mine ... I had to act . These let me sleep . For some reason they HAD to start work at 8AM . On a college campus . These headphones saved my life .
5 #### these are the only shirts I wear . they hold up like iron and feel nice . great price here too . they do not shrink too much at all which helps choosing the correct size .
5 #### They look great and are super comfortable . Only problem I have is that they are a little larger than expected since I am usually a 7 w in converse shoes but they look great with boyfriend jeans so it really does n't matter since they do n't slip from my feet . Next time I will prefer 1/2 size smaller .
4 #### As it turns out , I did n't have a chance to use the costume but it seems to be well made . Look forward to using it another time .
5 #### I would recommend this item to anyone . I 've taken this shirt camping , fishing , hiking , and hunting . Looks great and keeps you fresh .
5 #### I see this product all the time in YouTube'.so I decided to get some.at first that looked like wasted money , sooner than later I learned u have to flower then from one of the ends and the I hit it with a spark from a bic lighter and it fires right up ! There also water proof .i dipped each one In melted wax they fire up the sane way and they burn much longer . There light small and they will start a fire .
5 #### very clear optics seemed to hold a zero with heavy caliber ammo .
5 #### Like others have stated , this thing can fly ! Easier to throw than traditional frisbee 's . Easier on the hands when catching them as compared to hard plastic frisbee 's . We have lots of fun in the backyard with this !
5 #### Item as described . Looking forward to breaking them in . I have had a pair in a different color for several years that look a little rough now . Too rough for the office anyway . Easily the most comfortable shoe I 've ever owned . Firm snug fit that gives everywhere it needs to . Laced shoes tend to hurt by the end of the day . These stretch as needed .
5 #### Keen shoes always fit me well and I find them comfortable . These are no exception . Could n't be happier with my purchase !
1 #### I do n't like how it already has several horizontal lines the first time i put it on : 5 on the left leg , 1 on the right , of which 2 of the smaller lines on the left leg are already starting to become runs ( see pic )
4 #### The run really large , I m 10.5 and should have asked for 9.5
5 #### Over the years I have tried many different bras and the one I love most is the Bali Women 's Flower Underwire Bra . It fits perfect , and has great coverage since I wear a 36DD . I will forever buy this particular bra ... comfortable , perfect fit , and quite attractive ... I have black and beige and will buy a couple of white ones very soon .
5 #### I needed to move some weight to my back and these fit the bill perfectly ! They are easy on and easy off .. secure and no worries about falling off on a dive .
5 #### No issues here with the sizing , I have 2pair B11 bought a year apart and one pair B01 and all three are sized well all bought off of Amazon . I love Carhartt , I wo n't waste my money on anything else , t - shirts pants jackets and beanie you ca n't go wrong , if you like quality for your dollar choose Carhartt . Support the trades , God bless America . # alltradesmatter
1 #### I measured everything correctly . Set it up exactly how the instructions directed(EVEN DID IT TWICE , just to be sure ) . The thing came crashing down on my head after two pullups ! ! Called for assistance , but got none . Got rid of it already , i have a tower gym on the way . Really wanted this product to work , but to no avail .
5 #### This is my favorite accessory for when I knock over banks , hands down ! The look just screams " do n't be a hero , Mr. Security Guard with an itchy trigger finger . " It subtly implies , " no dye packs , please . " It 's also good for jihadist beheadings and North Ireland car bombings . And the price can be recuperated in only a single convenience store robbery ! What a steal ! I suppose it works for keeping your head and face warm in cool weather , too . ( Please note the obvious sarcasm . I do not partake in , nor condone , the aforementioned activities . Please enjoy this item responsibly . ) Pros : Fit , warmth , stretchability , price Cons : Instant association with criminal activity Bottom line : If you wear this at night , and say to a cop , " Do n't tase me , bro , " chances are , you 're getting tased .
5 #### Bought this to drill holes in what I thought was about 6 " of ice . Turns out the the ice was 13 " thick , it took me maybe 45 seconds to get through that ice with the 8 " diameter hole . The Swiss blades are great , razor sharp .
3 #### The fins work great but if you have big feet and boots like I do , getting your feet in them is a challenge in itself . Also make sure you tie a tether just in case the snap comes loose . It did on me first day out and if not for me taking time to make a paracord tether I would have lost it . If I had to choose all over again I would have gone with the one 's that snap over the boot . But still works fine .
5 #### I got these the day before New Years Eve and these still have held up perfect . Fit just like I expected , very comfortable , nice fit around the ankles . Everyone should by a pair of these ! They 're amazing !
1 #### Put about 300 arrows through it and it was done . The metal pin broke off . Would have been nice if I could have put 3000 arrows through it as I was hoping for . 10 percent does not cut it ... You know what I mean ? Save your money ... give this one a pass .
5 #### Love the shoes , only problem was that when they arrived at the ups facility they went to the wrong address and had my shoes delayed for a day , then someone at the ups facility changed my address ! Glad my Dad work there , so i told him and he brought them home for me ! But overall GREAT ! Thanks Amazon
4 #### I bought this for myself but discovered it was a little too short for me ( 5'8 " ) . Luckily , it 's the perfect size for my kids and they drag it to the bus stop every day to play with . It 's been durable ( ran it over , and it gets dragged along the concrete ) and is nicer than a traditional rope jumprope . Now to get a longer one for me !
4 #### I work 12 hour shifts in a warehouse , therefore ; I work in a physically demanding job . My back is not as strong as it was or heal as quickly as it did 20 years ago . All this week I wore the back brace . My back feels much better than last week . Now that I realize wearing a back brace will help my back issue I may invest more in a higher quality back brace .
5 #### These are the perfect skin tone for this very pale Irish lass . Even " nude " makes my ankles look too tan . Travel buff is perfect .
5 #### I got two headbands at the same time for using in the blazing Texas heat while I mow the lawn and do yard work . ( Can not stand having sweat drip in my eyes . ) I got this Under Armour and another Nike Swoosh Headband . The Under Armour is awesome . I was very disappointed with the Nike . This headband fits great , absorbs plenty of moisture , and washes up nicely . It also looks nicer than the Nike , I think , because the band is wider . Very pleased .
4 #### I have long legs and had to really stretch them out to make them fit
4 #### I bought this watch for the watch itself not the band . And I really like this watch . It is easy to read , looks great on my own watch band and I am really pleased with it .
5 #### I actually went and tried these on in my correct foot size , which is a 7.5 - when I was up in Portland . The 7.5 fits perfect ! I really love these shoes . I can wear them all day , and walk over all kinds of terrain . Keen really does make a great shoe ! !
5 #### Coleman stoves have always been easy to dent , scratch , get burned on and are not for the weak of spirit . On the other hand , properly assembled and pumped up they heat far better than propane for much less in total fuel cost . The white gas can be stored for years before using . Over pumping the stove creates massive amounts of heat for extra big pots . I have used big ones like this and the little portable ones . It is easy to forget that metal parts do an excellent job of transferring heat so look out ! I have also used MSR stoves which could be dangerous , tempermental fireballs if not treated with respect . By their nature camp stoves get stored a lot and used some . These are the good ones .
5 #### A classic shoe that is durable , comfortable and has great styling . You can not beat the price for the quality and design .
1 #### After reading the reviews , I took someone 's suggestion and purchased a M12 1.75 80 mm bolt , two M12 washers , one M12 lock washer ( from Home Depot ) and one Wheel nut lock ( from Auto Zone ) and gave it a try . I found that my 1 1/4 " box hitch was on the smaller side , and ran back to OSH , since Home Depot did n't have this size , and bought a short bolt ( M12 1.75 70 mm ) . In my case I added three M12 washers and the one M12 lock washer to make sure it was a snug fit . I probably would have an even better fit if I bought a M12 1.75 60 mm bolt , but going out twice in one day is enough . Thanks for all of the suggestions !
5 #### It is difficult to find strong panty hose with good color for African American women for work . This fits the bill for me when I must dress which is 2 - 3 days of the week .
4 #### I cycle a few thousand miles a year and have had this helmet for about a year . Vented fair well for hot summer rides . I found using a rain cover ( < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/RockBros - Windproof - Dust - proof - Rain - Cover - MTB - Road - Bike - Helmet - Cover - Red / dp / B00MJXY78C / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">RockBros Windproof Dust - proof Rain Cover MTB Road Bike Helmet Cover ( Red)</a > ) makes this helmet function in cold temperatures . With the rain cover I do n't use a hat and I 've done this down to below 18F ( -8C ) . The sun visor works to holds a mirror ( < a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Bike - Peddler - Take - A - Look - Cycling - Eyeglass - Mirror - Compact / dp / B000AO7ETQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Bike Peddler Take A Look Cycling Eyeglass Mirror ( Compact)</a > ) . I used a zip tie to securely hold the mirror as I had sometimes knocked it off while adjusting it . My only complaint is that the padding in the front is getting crusty from all the sweat .
5 #### I bought this for when the power goes out . I have used it and it works fine . Just keep a propane tank handy and it 's ready to go .
5 #### My husband loves these shirts . They are long and they also have a good fabric feel . Good quality .
5 #### I have had this same slip for years and thought I would never find it again . Thanks , Amazon , for carrying it ! It is the same quality as my first one , purchased many , many years ago . Usually quality suffers as the years go by , but Shadowline has done a good job retaining quality workmanship and materials . Wish I could get it in black -- I'll have to keep checking Amazon on this one .
5 #### Great grill for throwing in the back of your truck .
2 #### Plastic started to lift from the foam a few times of use . Should have spent the money on a better helmet .
5 #### Fit as expected . Arrived quickly . Good quality material . Love the pockets .
4 #### Nice spring for say 70 - 120 lb bags . I picked up a shorter stronger spring for my 180 lb Aqua Bag .
5 #### These have instructions on the individual packets , and have a bonus zippered pouch for carrying or sharing . I have bought these before , and will again .
5 #### Love my Chuck Taylors ! ! Got these to take on vacation and to wear on my Boat ! Great nostalgia , great Look !
5 #### My watch arrived by the date promised and wrapped securely . The watch came in it 's own box with directions which is always a plus . The watch keeps perfect time and fits well with the adjustable band . It is sturdy which is what I need and yet you know it is a female size watch . It 's not huge . The face is very readable and I love that you can push the light in to see the time at night . I would definitely order this watch again . I 've always loved Timex watches and am very pleased with my purchase .
5 #### Cathartt run a little big and they do n't shrink much . I always order a medium for my 18 year old son and they fit perfectly
5 #### I have always used HeatMax Hot Hands 2 hand warmers and they keep your hands really warm when I am hunting and ice fishing . I tried the others and they were not as warm or last as long as Hot Hands 2 . We had a major power outage a few months back and we have a reptile that requires warmth and I told my wife that I have these hand warmers i use for hunting that work really well and could work to keep our Chinese water dragon warm until the power come on . It worked like a charm as my wife surrounded him with the hand warmers and he loved it . strange way to use them but it was all i could think of at the time .. LOL . I would highly recommend them for anything that requires warmth . :)
1 #### Good looking shoes for the first three hours of wear . Then the heel fell off . Very poor quality . Returned .
5 #### If you want to impress potential employers by breaking their hands ... this is for you !
5 #### These shoes fit as expected . My 7 year old and my 10 year old got a pair . My 10 year old boy was n't excited about having to tie them but really thought they were cool when we got them . My 7 year old has Down syndrome and likes to take her shoes off all the time . These she could not ... yay me ! Also , in my opinion , they are really cute on any kid , but especially mine .
5 #### LoVe these shoes , out family has matching pairs , just remember white for kid is not always best idea
5 #### Outstanding . Great balanced knife . attached it to my bug out bag .
4 #### Do you really need a review of All Stars ? If you have n't tried them in the last 60 years , this review will not change your mind . I love these shoes , and buy a new pair in black every couple of years . My specialty colors last forever but I wear the black all the time . I wish there was more arch support , but if I really cared I could just add some . I love that they pack small in my suitcase , but are still comfy to wear all day .
4 #### These fit as expected , because I expected them to fit small . I always size up by 2 sizes in tights since that makes them last longer . This is the brand I always get since they 're nice and sheer .
4 #### A tiny bit pricey for the thin material , arrived with a few minor scratches , but nothing substantial . No complaints here really .
1 #### I loved these shoes ... that is until after about an hour of wear , the green inserts on the sole of the right show began falling off . The wear was in my home , on smooth floors . I can only assume they were defective .
5 #### I did a lot of research for the best affordable pads and found these . They are very high quality and have already prevented a number of scrapes ! They are a bit large for my 6 year old daughter , but still work OK since the straps are fairly versatile .
5 #### Exactly what I was looking for . They fit my dad perfectly no complaints what so ever
5 #### Absolutely love this chair . I use mine as a sleeping pad while backpacking as well . Great way to minimize gear and still be comfortable !
5 #### Got a tablet or phone with a USB C adaptor that you want to use for video output ? Well keep in mind that if you want to project video for an extended time , you 'll also need power ... and power comes through that same single USB C port . This adaptor will allow you to input power while outputting a video signal . Great for presentations or trade shows where you 'll have a booth .
5 #### I 'll start by saying , I have been wearing these on and off since about 1975 as a little kid . They 're always fairly comfortable , but never have been that great for long days like Disneyland or whatever . I found putting in an insole helps . Hard to fault these overall , they are a simple comfy shoe , and timeless as well . When they get dirty , toss them in the wash . Easy - peasy
5 #### i wanted a big watch when it arrived it was too small for me , by the watch itself was perfect , nice looking , better than in the picture . I had to return mine , but i would recomend anyone .
4 #### Seems to have helped a bunch on my tennis elbow . While it has provided some relief , there is still a little flare up every so often . Not sure if it was designed to totally eliminate the pain , but it sure has helped a lot .
5 #### This thing provides great resistance and has somewhat helped my tennis elbow . If you buy one , be sure to go to the TheraBand website and check out all of the exercises that can be done using this one bar .
3 #### for some of the guys the clip did n't hold as well . The belt would come off while running .
5 #### Fit great and felt great during a long outdoor wedding celebration . I would purchase again .
5 #### Just what I was looking for . Fit was great and I am hoping they are as durable as all the other pieces of the companies clothing I have purchased in the past 40 years .
5 #### Works as advertised . Easy to get a newly mounted scope on paper .
4 #### This product is fairly descent for the price . The fit to the stock is a little off . I filled the existing but stock holes ( with glue and tooth picks . A great trick if I do n't say so myself ) and re - drilled the holes to align this better . Super soft for the recoil dampening .
5 #### This compass is not the cheap plastic compass that you see in many of the auto and department stores . It 's a quality compass with some weight , and it mounts very nicely to the top center of the dash . The compass itself rotates very freely inside the housing . It also tilts with the angle of the car . It has compensators for north / south , east / west . They even give you a small non - magnetic tool to turn the little screws . Once you have it set up , there 's no need for further adjustment . I wanted a nice car compass without having to pay a lot of money . This one satsified me . I like it a lot .
5 #### I 'm wearing this bra as I type this rating . It fits very well , and is extremely comfortable to wear . I disagree with some of the other reviews that say this bra is " scratchy " - not at all ! Very smooth feeling and well made . I will purchase more .
3 #### Too big for my 4 year boy , did not return , decided to use it in a year or two when my boy grows , the gel cushion is very well made and looks very comfortable and protective , I got a nice deal . I recommend this .
5 #### This is a good jacket . I returned because the smallest size was still too big for me . I am 5 foot 9 . No more than 150 pounds max . usually 140 something . Thin . It was just too big . Wo n't buy the brand again because of it .
4 #### Ordered these for a gift in wide , got a good price and they fit great
5 #### This is perfect for my mom 's tiny tiny wrist . It is very feminine and yet the watch face itself is very easy to read . We looked all over for something for her and were ecstatic when we found this watch .
5 #### This watch is perfect , it is subtle enough for casual and yet has a look to it that can work for dressy occassions . The picture does n't do it justice , very impressed with the watch !
5 #### Great ball -- I typically have purchased a ball based on price which means we get the $ 10 ball in the bin from the store at the beginning of soccer season because I figure we 'll lose it at some point . Lately , they 've been coming apart just 4 - 6 weeks in . I decided to " splurge " on this $ 14 ball with the great reviews and I am so glad I did . My 9 - year old son AND his teammates AND the refs all seem to love this ball . The team always brings this to the center of the field as one of two for the refs to choose from as game ball and it has been chosen EVERY time , most of the time as the ball to start with even ( not thrown down the side to sit by the goal net . We 're 6 weeks in ( it has been through rain , mud and extreme heat ) and it still looks new . Even my husband , the soccer guru , asked me how expensive this ball was as it has been holding up so well .
5 #### I used this to hold my tires of my mountain bike after my ride . What do you expect from Thule ? Well the workmanship is certainly of good built . I 'm happy with this product , in fact - I have two that I bought at the same time . Great to keep the inside or trunk of the car dirt / mud free after a ride .
3 #### This boat was used for two days ( one weekend ) . I did n't find any holes but it deflates much faster than can be enjoyed in the water . Two or three toddlers got to sit in it while an adult walked on the shallow end of the lake hauling it . I expected the material to be a little on the stiff side , but it 's really soft . Probably wo n't buy another one again .
5 #### The shoes are amazing , very comfortable and fit as expected highly recommended . :)
5 #### My boss was whining about having to spend $ 1000 to get his Rolex fixed , I just pointed at my good old Timex and said 30 bucks , live within your means !
5 #### Yea right size , my hubby wears a 10.5 but that was too big , a 10 fit fine .
5 #### Most comfortable training shoes I 've worn in a long time .
4 #### Happy with the purchase but would not recommend this as an everyday punching bag for the hard hitter . Also , not the best bag for apartments or condos as it does move around a bit while using it . Great for the person who is using it to stay in shape or to lose weight , though !
5 #### I have always been wary of resistance bands because I 've heard so many horror stories of bands being made poorly and people getting hurt badly when they break . However , after reading the great reviews on these , I decided to try them out . By the end of my first workout I was no longer afraid . It is quite obvious how well they are made . Others that I 've used ca n't even compare . The door anchor and ability to attach more than one band to a single , sturdy handle only adds to their awesomeness . And in case this was n't all awesome enough , I ordered them 6:30am on a Tuesday and had them Wednesday afternoon ! ! The very next day !
5 #### Spooled this Co - Polymer line on both my bait caster and spinning reel . Cool looking camo line , If the Bass do n't see it , That is the question?Will post another review after a day on the lake . Great price ! recommended !
5 #### I really like this watch for the price . It looks nice , lights up in the dark and shows the date . I am going to have to get a link or two taken out to help it fit better but it is a nice watch .
5 #### I recently saw a professional umpire take a foul bunt to his throat , under his mask , so I 'm thankful I have one of these . The odds of you needing one are slim , but increase as you start to umpire higher levels , especially if you use an undershirt chest protector .
2 #### I bought this product to replace an old Sigg water bottle I have been using for the past 5 years . Seeing as how much I liked my other one , I figured " Why switch ? " Loved this bottle the first day , and then the second , but on the third the inside lining started peeling off . And let me tell you there is nothing worse than taking a drink from your water bottle only to end up with some little rubber pieces floating around your mouth . I m back to using my old bottle ... I would have only given it one star , but it is still a damn good lookin bottle and I ca nt bring myself to throw it away .
5 #### I like these and particularly like the way the top sections are separated so you do n't have to meticulously do X - pattern screw tightening . Definitely much easier to tighten down . The thumb screw made it easy to mount on a rail and it removed and then reattached without affecting zero . No complaints other than that they do n't make this design for 30 mm tubes .
5 #### They are cute and they fit but wow they are really stiff ! I do n't know if I 'll be able to get these to loosen up any ?
5 #### The most comfortable shoes I 've ever bought . Amazing !
5 #### I bought these jeans and WOW , they have a lot of room and move well at work ( I work in the shipyards ) and at the bar . Carhartt got it right with these pants .
5 #### Keen sandles hold up pretty well through the seasons . This is now my 3rd pair in 15 years . The first pair ( blue nylon straps ) is still going but delaminating at the heel where the sole wraps up to meet the foot bed . It collects small pebbles and sand all the time and I ca n't seem to glue it back together . My second pair ( brown leather straps ) is starting to fray at the heel strap where the leather is stick = hed together . I sometimes use them as slip - on sandles to go outside , not hooking the heel strap over my heel , so that probably does n't help longevity of that strap . Both pairs are still serviceable but are on their way out so they have been moved to " travel shoes " . The new pair is also leather since I prefer the look and they 're a little more dressy than the nylon strap ones . However you use them , the Keens are durable shoes that can get soaked again and again ( I use them for white water rafting , kayaking and canoeing ) and are good around the pool , at the mall or anywhere else you can be casual on hot days . They do n't seem to get very smelly either ( compared to Topsiders from the old days ! ) .
5 #### My 7 year old son loves this . Uses it at least once every day , weather permitting . While I was nervous at first , its a well made , safe , easy to maneuver product .
4 #### Fits my Glock 36 Magazines okay but a little loose / flimsy on the belt . Not comfortable either .
5 #### I find the Berkshire Plus - Size pantyhose to be the best on the market . I have been wearing them for years and have not found any other brand to be as comfortable or durable . For everyday wear , I particularly like style # 4489 , which has a reinforced toe and a control top . The control top is functional , but not uncomfortable . The extra panel in the panty is what makes the fit so comfortable . I do find that I need to purchase a size larger than what the chart says I need , so I think that they run a little small . Interestingly , when I buy the ultra - sheer style # 4411 , those I find fit true to size , and I buy the size the package recommends based on my height and weight .
5 #### What can I say , they work , they are comfortable and I would buy them again when I am in the market
5 #### These are so fun ! ! Much better than a frisbee ! Can be a bit tricky to throw but once you get used to it -- I feel like it is more fun than a frisbee because you can grab them to catch them . Kids and adult approved ! !
4 #### funny halloween costume . my daughter just added a ruler and she was off
5 #### From the moment I saw this watch I knew it was the perfect gift for my 6 yr old . As a matter of fact she is just starting to learn time in school and it came in handy . I love the band and the colour is exceptional .
5 #### I was nervous about these seats but the quality and ease of attachment was much higher than I was expecting . Well worth the money
5 #### < div id="video - block - R2PABLG6X3U1HO " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / A1BKmXrJQdS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/91iZO%2B6tpXS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;I am 5'10 " and the large fit perfectly . Weight does n't matter because they 're adjustable . If you 're too big for the hugely adjustable band , you ca n't fit through the door to go outside , anyway ( see video , I show how big it goes ( actually I do n't , it goes even bigger than I showed ) ) . It is so nice being able to work outside without wondering if you 're being bit every 2 seconds . These are going to make you a little warmer than shorts alone , but not nearly as hot as wearing pants . And you may look dumb - I have no doubt I looked like a doofus wearing this in my backyard , but I was a mosquito bite - free doofus , and I was able to work comfortably and without bug anxiety ( or bites ) . They 're fine inside out , as well .
5 #### Great shoes . Best fit . They last about a year before fading
5 #### All people on wheels are dangerous . But they are also fun ! This toy is for every kid from 6 and up . 5 is a bit young until the later half of the age . Just something to dink around on . Kids enjoy .
5 #### I love this billfold ! It is large & has many compartments and slots . I love the zip around closure as well .
5 #### Bought this after having used these while teaching . Easy to put together , fun to shoot into . Ca n't wait to put it out on the driveway and dent up the garage door a little ! ! !
4 #### Not complaints other than it was smaller than expected . Looks the same as the photo
5 #### i bought these sneakers for hip hop dance class , i 'm moving alot in class , so i needed kicks that fit perfect . luckily these do ! ! no problem dancing for hours in them . the color is super cute , i get loads of compliments . delivery was fast as well ! !
4 #### Product description is good , arrived on time . satisfied with product .
2 #### For the price I would say these are a ripoff . They did n't seem to work at all , after I properly applied them to my dive mask . In two separate dives , they were not at all helpful in my reading of my dive computer , which was the sole reason I wanted them . Once I took them off I could actually see better than with them on ! I got the 2.0 diopter strength . I expected them to be optical glass but they were just very clear elastomeric plastic that effectively stuck to the inside of the dive mask . By the way , I am quite confident I had them installed correctly . If , down the road , I decide I need an Rx sort of dive mask correction I 'll just pay the $ 50 for a custom one , since these are no great bargin at over 2/5ths of that cost .
5 #### We have owned similar off brands and for the same price , the Razor is the best . It is well made , very smooth ride and light for my 5 year old to pick up and throw around . I will buy the larger model when my 5 year old grows of of this one and pass this one to the next child .
5 #### I love these shoes . They fit as expected and they look really nice on . These shoes have a narrow base which I really like . I do n't like the ones that make your foot look wide .
5 #### Great shoes , great fit , casual shoes that are popular and easy to match . They are very comfy even for all day wear . Not for running but casual walk to parks all day will last
5 #### I use this back brace for a sore lower back . I do n't have an injury but it helps sooth back pain from poor posture . I am 4'11 and 130 lbs and the medium fits me well . I did cut off the straps because I do n't need them .
5 #### They are good balls . Works well in pitching machine . around 60 mph
1 #### Talk about granny panties . The picture makes em look a little more sexy than they are , like a pin up girl or something . In reality these are the tents your Grandma wore . NOT worth the price , and NOT worth hassle of returning , The panties tore after I washed them once .
4 #### They were a bit larger than I wanted . Overall , I love them and they got to my home before the scheduled date . When buying these shoes , purchase 2 sizes down .
4 #### Nice . Really liked the size because it was easier to carry than the huge ones yet still brought enough water back to the campsite for things like coffee and dishes .
5 #### We love all the items about Princess , because the girls love them too . We have bought Princess and gems stickers , Castle mini - mural and Princess Holiday for three gifts . We are going to buy more for Christmas gifts .
5 #### This was my 3rd pair of this same model over the last dozen or so years . My first pair are still usable but the sole has been worn smooth . My last pair are still doing ok , but one of the leather straps is separating from the sole . For 8 years of good service , that 's just fine . The uppers on the new pair seem just a little snug , but the sole is just right for my size . I actually like having the elastic uppers being snug since I know they will [ and already have ] loosen up . These are my favorite footwear from May to October for outside use , and well beyond for inside use . They last a long time , are comfortable , look great and are a great value for the cost . I 'm a loyal and happy customer . Recommended buy for sure .
5 #### very nice sign.its plastic not metal and holds up in the weather . this thing is making me type more words .
2 #### Shoes looked egg she 'll color . Looked like they had been in warehouse for a long time
5 #### I got these for my 4 year old son . They look very nice and durable . They are comfortable for him as well . The dirt and sand just brushes off the suede so they stay looking nice . I 'm very happy with these and would buy again .
5 #### WOW ! I love these capris ! I ordered the deep teal and they are a very dark blue / teal ( a much deeper prettier color than shown ) . I received many compliments the first time I wore them to the gym . They are super soft and comfortable from the leg all the way to the waist ... COMFORTABLE . They never slip down at the waist and give me full coverage ( not see through at all ) . I am 5 ' 4 " and 159 pounds and I ordered a medium . The size fit perfectly although that being said they are longer on me than the photo ( probably my short legs ) but came 2 inches above my ankle so just below my calf . Given that I have weight to loose these are very flattering on as well . They are also a nice stretchy fabric ( thus the comfort ) and cool . We are in the high 90 's and 100 degree summer weather and I am cool ! Purchase these as you wo n't be disappointed especially at this price . I like these better than my Lululemon and Athleta capris ! ! ! I am back to purchase more !
5 #### These are so cute and comfortable and very light . I just received them today and the fit is perfect . I normally wear an 8 1/2 and they are true to size !
3 #### Shoe box was torn to crap upon arrival and shipping took forever , they are also size 13 ( the same size I 've worn for 15 years ) and they are more like 14 's ... Other than that I like them .
5 #### Durable and provides a good workout for weakened elbows from overuse at sports or labor . Excellent instructions accompany each bar and there is oodles of additional information and tips available on the manufacturer 's website as well as from websites of various contributing physical trainers and therapists . Take it very slow and do not overdo it if you are attempting to overcome elbow tendonitis . A little bit goes a long way .
2 #### I * * loved * * these shoes when I got them . I 've noticed that the foam inside tends to compress during a workout , though . I 'll lace them tightly enough that they 're nearly cutting off my circulation . 20 minutes later , I 'm sliding out of them while doing sled pushes .
5 #### Great lures , excellent distance and very appealing . Be sure not to get to big of a kastmaster . For most trout , use 1/4 ounce .
5 #### Love the looks of this watch , and the fact that I can shower and swim in it . Very nice .
5 #### Great quality shoe . Runs really large . I 'm thinking maybe 2 sizes . They may be sized for men / boys . I bought them for my grandson but my teenaged daughter ended up with them because they were huge for him .
4 #### I normally wear an 8 in sneakers but ordered these in a 7 due to many people here saying to go down a full size . They fit perfectly on my feet , so now 's the time to wear them in and suffer the sore feet syndrome for a little while . But hell , they 're Converse , it 's worth it .
5 #### The original 608 's are the best all around sneaker that New Balance ever made , too bad they ruined a perfect thing with their v2 and v3 's which were obvious attempts to cheapen production and pawn them off as improvements on the originals . I doubt i will ever be able to find these again at an affordable price . My feet are sad already . I only hope New Balance wakes up and returns to their original production standards .
5 #### Excellent game for the beach . Only if it was buoyant ...
5 #### Grand daughter ordered for a special event . Fit weel . She was the hit of the party !
5 #### I love this , but I had to return 2 to get the right size ( fit a bit differently than non - longline bras) ... will reorder the correct size today - really minimizes " muffin top ! "
4 #### This was my 5 year olds Christmas gift , she was a little young for it when she first received it , but now a year later she loves it ! It 's very well made , after many " crashes " in to objects , it does n't even have a scratch . I recommend for older than 6 , unless you have a very sporty kiddo .
5 #### This helmet looks good and feels great on the head
5 #### Love these shorts , they are great for work . They go just past the knees , i m 6 ' 3 " so that s hard to find . As everyone else says order 2 sizes bigger they fit perfect then .
5 #### My oldest loves these shoes , he likes to wear with , jeans khakis and shorts very versatile .
5 #### Item exactly as described . Shipped quickly and safely ; thank you !
4 #### Daughter loves them . Classics . Hard to put on ! Great color ( Pink Sapphire )
2 #### this shoe is about one size too large ! the shoe size is misleading and runs large .
5 #### Excellent for long dog walks when the weather requires something other than running shoes .
5 #### Love it cause it 's square and saves space . Use it for camping for rice , grains , lentils etc .
5 #### I purchased two shirts as a gift . The size perfect , and I was very pleased with the quality , of this heavy duty tee shirt .
4 #### Good light weight shoe ... had to add insole for more support .
5 #### Fit well but I bought half size smaller because everybody says they stretch out ! Plan to get gray pair just like these . Kids have them and love them too .
5 #### This is an excellent shoes for my problematic right foot ( plantar fasciitis ) . It gives much padding on the heel part and fits perfectly . The only downside to this is if you are going to wear it all day , can become too heavy and I really can feel that it is becoming a burden . I wish they make a somewhat lighter version to this especially for petite people like me . Other than that , it is a rather a great pair and was my " go to " shoes during the winter .
5 #### These are a great addition to keeping guns rust free that do n't get used much . I also like to use these while traveling .
5 #### Love them . Easy to use and they work well . I HATE rachet straps and screw them up all the time . These straps are a no brainer , that 's what I need . I bought the extra set for my Thule Stacker 830 for the other side and I 'm very glad I did .
4 #### The background at the range I usually shoot at is black . That makes it tough to see where your shot went when the target is dark like this one . For me , predominantly white targets are the most useful . They do n't look as menacing , but I can see where my last shot went . The instant feedback is important if you want to improve as a shooter , so keep the backdrop color in mind when buying any target .
5 #### Just installed an energy efficient variable speed pool pump . I spread a little of this on all of the pipe fitting threads and silicone gaskets and it worked perfectly . Added a little lube between the PVC pipe threads and gaskets so they screwed together smoothly ( no binding ) and also adds some waterproofing . Should improve the life of the seals as well . I used it on the main seal on my DE filter as well . Advertised as safe on rubber gaskets ( as opposed to using petroleum jelly that disintegrates rubber and causes leaks ) . After a week of running on high speed , it has not leaked a drop .
2 #### The waist is too big to keep them from sliding down . Rest was a perfect fit ! Wo n't purchase again .
5 #### Boots came in PERFECT condition and fit just as expected
3 #### We are big Merrell fans in our houshold , so we were supprised with the poor quality of these shoes . The leather and sole were nice . but there was hardly any arch support and the elastic was cheap and looked like it would come appart easily . We returned these shoes after my husband only put ONE on his foot !
1 #### I bought one of these after reading the good reviews . Mine would only work from 15 - 25 yards when pointed at the ground and sporatically at that . I was thankful for Adorama 's great customer service in refunding my money for this defective product .
5 #### Love the color and price was ok ... but a little bigger than I expected
5 #### perfect socks for running and keeping your feet warm here in Connecticut . Thick enough to keep them warm , thin enough to fit in * most * shoes .
5 #### I have had one of this type of holder for years and I love it . I purchased this second one to permanently leave in my golf bag .
5 #### Love the shoes , perfect ! ! ! Came brand new and for a good price . Could nt be happier , would definitely recommend . Go buy !
5 #### I buy this pair every year but increase the size as my son grows . My son is about 5'10 in and 170 lbs . The men 's large fit him comfortably - not right and not too loose . He wears them for skiing .
5 #### When it comes to dive masks , Cressi made in Italy , are one of the best makers of dive masks . The Cressi Matrix features twin tear - drop shaped lenses that go downward closer to the eyes , a silicone skirt for a lea - free fit , and micrometric adjustable buckles for precise headband adjustment . The low - volume mask features a simple and easy adjustable buckle and a flxible buckle with a 100 % high quality silicone strap . The version I am reviewing is clear and blue with black . It 's important to note that the face mask will fog , so you will need a defogger such as&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/McNett - Sea - Drops - Scuba - and - Snorkeling - Mask - Defog-2 - Pack / dp / B00QFZPV2Q / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">McNett Sea Drops Scuba and Snorkeling Mask Defog - 2 - Pack</a > . The dive mask also comes with a Cressi plastic container as well . Recommended !
4 #### Order down one size that you 'd usually wear for T - shirts . These are oversized , the XL was comically large--2XL or 3XL . The large fits like a slightly roomy XL . The shirts are thick , and heavy duty for a T. Definitely should have lasting power .
5 #### I absolutely LOVE these shoes . I plan on buying other colors as well . Fit is perfect and they are extremely comfortable . I am a 350 pound guy and routinely suffer foot pain after walking . These shoes alleviated that pain . Great product .
3 #### This is a shoe I will wear with black dress pants or jeans when I need comfort and a little style , but I am not impressed . This is a very flimsy shoe with little support at all . Not like any Nike I 've ever purchased in the past . It looks nice , but it 's not comfortable .
5 #### Love the shirts . ! Plan on getting more . Once my paycheck comes in . Size fits as expected . Good for workout and out to town .
5 #### Great price on a product that is life sized . Liked this cause it looked more human then a zombie or other creature . A bit hard to see the anatomy on the back but I did n't buy it for that so it is of no concern for this costumer .
4 #### These are nice and I wear them often , nice size , nice feel . I thought they were a little pricey , reason for 4 stars
1 #### Broom arrived damaged . The entire side of the broomstick had a crack down the length of it . Very cheaply made . The bottom of the broom is also very sparse . We are returning it .
3 #### I bought the bands becasue I needed something with heavier resistance for p90X , assuming that the band would be the same length as the other bands I 've used , but this band was way shorter .... too short in my opinion .
5 #### Got these for my daughter and she absolutely loved them ! ! ! She fell in love with the color immediately and they go with soooo many colors ! She was getting tired of her white one and black ones cause everybody at school had the same thing but she says she 's the first one with this new color lol ! That wo n't last tho because she says every time she wears them someone compliments her on their color lol ! ! ! ! Great buy ! ! ! !
5 #### I really love these shoes . They are attractive and very comfortable . They work well for my daily workout and fit well .
5 #### These are a hand saver , they have kept my fingers from freezing more times than I can remember ! Definitely a necessity for outdoors during cold weather .
5 #### First , the description is as it says , I 've no blame there . I just had n't noticed that it lacked any info about a light - frankly , I did n't even know the older ones had one . My girlfriend has had a previous version of this watch , exact same design and colors and such , for quite a while . Yes , she 's a full grown twenty - something adult , do n't be rude . It finally stopped working fully ( and it had been through a lot , water , dirt , sand , so no qualms there ) , and a new battery did n't resolve it , so I went online to find her a replacement since she loved it and was super excited to find it here . I did n't even know her old one had a light , but lo and behold it does , the bright green indiglo kind . Sadly , this model does not . I ca n't with good conscious rate any lower than 5 stars , because my gosh do these watches hold up , and there was nothing misleading in the description . It 's Timex 's prerogative to decide it 's not worth it to put lights in kids watches anymore . But MAN , do I ever I wish they still did , it was the perfect surprise to replace her favorite watch , and now it 's missing a great functionality that we both pretty much require in our watches .
5 #### Great bike stand . It fits my son 's 14 inch bike perfectly . Easy to install and I love that it extends .
5 #### I looked at compasses in every price range and found more than a few I would love to have just because of their beautiful artistic designs . The old naval ones are by far my favorite and among the most expensive on my list . For my camping gear I chose a good quality , low priced compass with all the features I will likely ever need .
4 #### Bands anchor is too small to use on bottom of the door . Makes certain exercises harder such as bicep curls .
4 #### Purchased for a Mossberg 500C. The holes lined up fine but the gun threads were 6 - 48 and the mount came with # 8 screws . $ 2 later and it was mounted . Just came back from the shop where I sold it . Good service and fast shipping . Ca n't fault the seller , It was the correct mount for the gun . Maybe newer models come with larger threads .
3 #### Size of the product must have something wrong . On the other hand the fabric is very thin , maybe this will be a disadvantage if you fail during a ride .
4 #### The knife itself is well made and comes nice and sharp out of the box . My only minor quibbles are that it appears to not be a full - tang knife , and it also is lacking any sort of good strike surface on the butt . The only other downside is that the sheath that came with it ( the nylon model with the integrated multi - tool pouch ) is n't really that great in my opinion . It 's rather bulky and I personally have no desire to store my multi - tool there , but I have a friend with the same sheath who loves it , so to each their own . That said , I have no qualms about my purchase and it 's a solid , well - built knife that I anticipate will last me quite some time .
5 #### These are very comfortable shorts and I like the fact that they go to just above the knee . The pockets are very handy .
2 #### The fabric felt odd to me : slightly slick and ' oily . ' I did n't perceive it as high quality . The fabric may be perfectly tailored to its intended use but I do n't enjoy wearing it .
5 #### I throw this disc most nights , love the way it flies . Pulls hard to the right
5 #### Had this knife for about a year now , this thing is a tank . I 've cut branches , meat , boxes with it and it 's held up really well . Recommend this knife to anyone who is looking for a solid fixed blade .
5 #### These shoes fit the way I thought they would and got here faster than any other products did . ( I 'm in the Army currently deployed to Afghanistan ) . I highly recommend these shoes .
4 #### Nice but WOW that 's a chunky toe box . You would really have to want a hard core sandal to like this . For kicking around the burbs and city streets , these look more like clown shoes than a nice sandal . Very well designed and comfortable though . For the same sandal in a much better look see the Daytona .
5 #### I have three soccer refs in the family and all three got these . Produces a great , sharp and clear sound . My youngest had a bit of trouble learning how to use this pea - less whistle since it requires a different type of force in blowing it , but that is an issue with any pea - less style . Love the rubberized finger grip that is effortlessly adjustable too . Happy .
5 #### Wow ! Bought this for an icefishing trip with my boyscouts . Buzzed through two feet of HARD ice in a minute , faster than the guys using power augers . By the end of the morning the boys were boring holes just for the joy of it . Impressive tool .
5 #### As another reviewer reported , the T20031 version of this watch sold by Amazon has a shorter band than found in other identical - appearing models . I have a 7 " wrist , and it fits me just fine . I purchased what appeared to be the same watch at WalMart a couple years ago and had to remove links to make it fit .
2 #### When I first received these glasses , I was happy ... lite and perfect ... but , they never aligned properly ... I had one image slightly higher and one slightly slower than the other ... I have to give full credit to Amazon ... they immediately gave me a credit and I purchased the Barska Gladiators which I love ... and they showed up the next day ! ! ! ! !
5 #### Did a bad crash and burn , knee and shoulder messed up but my head was well protected . The visor and side plastic pieces went flying but the helmet did not crack . Comfortable with plenty of vents for the hot rides .
5 #### I bought these shoes for a friend and he loves them . They are very good quality and have held up well . This color choice is very nice also .
5 #### Bought as gift for son . Timex makes a great watch and I know he will enjoy it for many years .
4 #### These seem to be a tad larger than the Carhartt duck bib overall style and they do not have the reinforced knee . But they are fine and probably will be cooler during summer months .
5 #### This fits my son 's face well and keeps water out without fogging up . Ca n't ask for more than that !
5 #### I was hesitant to buy these for my husband based on some of the other reviews that the fit was off and they were not the best quality but these are really nice T - Shirts . He had some other Carhartt shirts that lasted for well over 3 years before being washed so much they came apart at the neckline . These shirts are equally as heavy and I think will last as long as the others . They wash up nice and do n't wrinkle much if you get them out of the dryer immediately . Would certainly recommend to others and will purchase again for my hubby .
4 #### I feel bad about the sizing of these shoes . I ordered a size 9 but it 's kinda big , my feet swim in it a bit . Unfortunately , I ca n't return them as I live in Nigeria and I had them shipped here for me . So upset with this buy !
5 #### daughter loves these shoes for school . fast shipment with no issues . will buy again from this seller .
4 #### i love my hanes pantyhose , sheer pantyhose fit and feel great on my pantyhose legs , i wear no nonsense pantyhose and hanes pantyhose everyday and these pantyhose are another one of my favorite pantyhose nylons , i ve had runs in my pantyhose , but all my pantyhose have had runs in my nylons . these pantyhose are wonderful to pull up my pantyhose legs and make my nylons look sexy and pretty pantyhose . i wear silkies pantyhose nylon stockings , leggs pantyhose and other nylon pantyhose . i wear pantyhose everyday in high heel pumps and my pantyhose nylon feet are in sheer reinforced toe pantyhose . i have sheer toe pantyhose and nylons . nylon pantyhose stockings .
5 #### I love these . I have a bad back and ca n't wear anything tight around my hips but these give me a choice ! These fit as expected . Very comfortable !
5 #### This is a nice , stable shoe . I bought myself and my husband a pair of Keens at the same time . We both like them , though the fit was better for him than for me . Beware of small rocks on gravel . That can make wearing this shoe more trouble than it 's worth . Otherwise , on asphalt and smooth surfaces , this is a great product . My brother orders a new pair every year and wears them all the time .
5 #### Arrived on time and as ordered . I bought two and my daughters and I use them every day . Amazing how working on your balance can help for so many other things . I would highly recommend this product
4 #### I was disappointed they were silk , I guess I read wrong .
5 #### I bought this watch more than 6 months ago I believe , and it is still working great . It is small and simple and attractive . I feel it is a good deal for the price .
5 #### One package per person with some trail bread or pilot crackers seems about right . Although it make about 2 cups - no way enough for 2 people . Directions say 1 3/4 cups water but 1 1/2 seems better , not as soupy . This was the pro - pack so not as much food as regular pouch . Pro pack is vacuum packed & takes less space . Overall it 's very good and filling with an acceptable taste . Great for emergency or the trail & item actually tastes good ........
5 #### this mask is so versatile . it can be used for anything from your everyday run - of - the - mill liquor store smash and grab to a high - stakes casino heist . it 's warm , but not so warm that you 'll get a bunch of sweat in your eyes , which could make it hard to aim , count money , enter security codes , etc . it 's soft too and fits comfortably - no bunchy folds of fabric to snag on a chain - link fence or broken glass . I 'll be committing an art theft this weekend and this mask will definitely be part of my ensemble . Highly recommended for any professional or hobbyist criminals .
5 #### I bought this for my brother in law who broke his while working on a project for everybody else . I figured I would find him a replacement and was pretty amazed to find the exact watch at a great price . My Brother in law was stunned that I noted the brand and got this right - simple pleasure & glad to have been able to do so . Pretty decent watch for a hard worker .
5 #### Very comfortable ( I am 6'2 " and 200 # ) . It is the size of a raft ( for a pool ) . Perfect for the price .
4 #### This strap combo is great very good quality and I 'm sure we will get hours of use out of it . Thanks
5 #### These are the best Mardi Gras Masks ever . Never feel a thing that gets thrown back at you . You can paint them and customize them with lights ; go wild ! I recommend cutting the mouth out so you can still drink with it on .
5 #### WOW , what a deal here . The bands , handles , bag as well as the straps to attach to a post or other vertical object as well as on a door are all top quality . I like the color coded bands and will use these regularly for my workouts .
4 #### The picture makes the shoe look like it has a " boxier " toe rather than the " pointier " toe that it actually has . I have wider feet and generally need to buy a size or half size longer to get a comfortable width ( in any brand of shoe ) . I was shooting for a rounder , broader toe design which is more comfortable for me , and I feel that the pictures of this shoe did n't accurately depict what I received , in that one detail . Otherwise , " the shoe fits . " So I am wearing it .
3 #### I bought this to use as a last ditch fighting knife to keep concealed in my boot . The plastic clip holds secure even when running , and the sheath is of very high quality , You can adjust the retention that you like by shaving off a little plastic . I have used it for about 8 months and have yet to have it come loose or out of the sheath . However , THIS IS A HEAVY KNIFE . Probably a pound or so , so if you are looking for an ultra - light this is not the knife for you . My only beef is that the blade tends to lose its edge pretty quickly , most likely due to its weak steel . Also it is made in china , which kinda sucks . I like to buy American . Overall , not a bad price for the money .
5 #### I have been wanting a broadhead that wo n't rust , is stout , and will still be replaceable . I have tried my hand at sharpening and I get close but not sharp enough IMO . I hunt in pacific northwest where we get lots of rain and my broadheads , if unchecked , will rust . I think these will do the trick .
5 #### Just what I needed for my Marlin 336SS . Wanted a Silver med powered scope to go with my setup , & this was a perfect fit . Was a bit hesitant to go with this Tasco brand , as I had heard less than favorable things about it , but I definitely made a good choice . Picture is clear as all , even when zoomed in max , & eye relief is fantastic . So far put about 200 rounds of 30 - 30 through it with no problems at all ; ranging from nice sunny days , to 18 degrees out in the rain . Have n't had any issues with lens fog or anything . I 'd say I 've definitely got my monies worth .
5 #### I use this for yoga , as it adds incentive to get and stay at a healthy weight- and it 's not too audacious in mixed company- at least in yoga class . I think of it like1920 's swim attire , only way more comfortable than wool :o)
4 #### i wear a 10.5 and needed a 9,5 in this shoes
5 #### I live in the South , it gets hot here with high humidity , it soaks up and keeps sweat out of my eyes whether I am working in the yard , at the firing range , or doing any physical activity .
5 #### I love the shoe and it fit as expected the photos and description are accurate if you 're looking for a shoe that has more cushion or support try a different style but as far as wanting a lightweight and breathable shoe this is it . I am very satisfied with this purchase
5 #### Well made and well balanced . Used to remove and replace pins in a 9 mm Shield . Did the job well . A good solid tool . At first I thought it might be a little on the heavy side but turned out to be just right for the work .
5 #### I purchased these whistles for my daughter who is a drum major at her high school . She thought it was great that her whistle was louder than her band teacher 's whistle .
5 #### This is excellent , very , very light weight and extremely breathable .
5 #### A must have to complete the costume , made well and my kid loves it . Holds air for a few days .
4 #### They are nice shoes . I would buy them again . The quality and style is good . They have a nice selection of colors .
5 #### I 've bought four heavy carhartt jackets in my life . I did n't read the description of this one well , and was a tad surprised at the shiny part - synthetic fiber of the shell . However , it is warm . I 've worked outdoors my entire life and always in Carhartt . This is the warmest one yet , especially in the wind . I was out in 30 mph wind at about 20 degrees F and did n't feels the wind at all . Amazing . I 'm not sure how the shell would hold up to heat ( welding , etc ) so be careful if you 'd use it for that . For any other outdoor work it is great -- warm and durable and a little bit large - perfect for layering . If you 're planning on wearing this jacket on its own , you should probably get a smaller size than you expect .
4 #### We have been very happy with this product , using it for P90X workouts at home . The quality is very good relative to other similar products we have seen , particularly in the stability and manufacturing in the carabiners that attach the bands to the handles . Less expensive varieties often use very thin metal here to save cost at the expense of durability and function . This sets also contains more bands than less expensive sets , including a black band for maximum resistance . The only thing that could be improved would be the addition of one of those foam donuts on a strap that lets you fix the straps to a doorframe by wedging it between the door and the doorjamb . Fortunately we had one of these from a previous pack of bands so it was n't a problem , but if we had n't had that we would have been out of luck for this type of exercise .
2 #### this was small I bought is for my nephew turning 5 and he is average size . It barely fit . plus the cage falls off all the time . His little brother can wear it .
5 #### Super comfortable and go with everything . Converse usually run half a size large so I got mine in a men 's 5 / women 's 7 when I usually wear a women 's 7 1/2 and they fit perfect
5 #### MERINO WOOL SOCKS GR8 ! IF NEVER HAD ANY TRY A PAIR . THESE SMART WOOL ARE A GOOD THICKNESS FOR ME . NOT TO THICK OR THIN . WALK A LOT YEAR ROUND . I WEAR THEM IN SUMMER IF HIKING . KEEP BLISTERS DOWN OR NONE .
2 #### Be very careful with these , You can severely hurt your hands ! ! ! Warm up and start with the guide or sport . I felt a sharp pain in my Palm while using this and my Palm hurt for a few days ! Very scary ! Pain is gone now but I was worried . Not trying to be a pansie , just a heads up .
5 #### Very suprised ! ! ! I was very suprised at the good quality of this cargo holder . The ratchet mechanism was very well thought out and works great on my ford ranger and my f250 . I have had a cheaper version of this before and it rusted real quick . It was junk . I m hoping this one does nt rust . If it does I will certainly edit this post
5 #### The quality met my expectations . The bright color makes it harder to accidentally leave on the golf cart .
5 #### Filled two reels so far . Appears to be good product .
4 #### With the Good Fit of the Galco Ankle Holster It really was n't necessary but I consider it a safety feature in case the velcro on the holster ever came apart . If you have weak knees this will aggravate the problem as my knee was every time I used it . So I 've been gradually been wearing it so my muscles could strengthen in my knee .
5 #### Size 11 m US little kid fit my 5 year old perfectly . He adores his new shoes and I was thrilled with the fast shipping and the quality of the shoe .
4 #### The jeans was ok and some how l like it , I Can not really fault it , it is good buy anyway .
5 #### Great shoes ! They look fantastic with a ton of things ! They 've held to very well .
4 #### Good buy but I am just a tight shredder and just like the others , after a few wears , I ripped these too .
1 #### I took it to the headwaters of the Amazon in Ecuador to camp out . I made the mistake of not trying it out before I left . When I went to blow it up I noticed that the tube which would admit the air to the mattress was blocked . I guess it was an manufacture defect . I tried several ways to punction the obstruction but could not . Needless to say not having it made life difficult in the Amazon .
4 #### I never had a Benchmade before but was always curious due to the axis lock that everyone raves about . After picking up the knife , I have to say that it is probably the best folding knife locking mechanism out there for ease of use and the speed of deployment for a manual knife ( and its fun as hell ) . The axis lock is n't the strongest out there but I like how you can flick it open like a normal folder or just pull on the release and swing it open . The one negative that I have with it is the price . Benchmade still uses 154 cm on this model which is a decent steel but I feel as if they should offer a higher grade steel in 2016 .
1 #### It looks wonderful on the model , but not on me . The lace and seems were itchy , and it created a retro bullet bra silhouette , which if I had been looking for such would be okay . Normally I wear mostly t - shirts , and the occasional sweater . I like a much smoother look than this bra provides .
5 #### My husband has been using these as his work pants for years . So for Christmas I made sure I got him a new pair . He was especially delighted they were Made In The USA . He love them because they are durable , have a great fit and are perfect for the working man .
4 #### I love this watch ! I am impressed that it has a good rating for water resistance . I just wish I was able to find it at a local department store . The four stars are because this wristwatch was very sloppily packaged . When I saw the Timex box it was in it raised concerns that the watch was damaged during shipment .
5 #### Fit 's my 16 year old step daughter perfectly ! True to size and shipped so quickly !
5 #### Ordered them as a gift for my 12 year old daughter and she loves them !
5 #### These undies are well - made and very comfortable . The leg elastic is covered with fabric . The best panties I have ever worn !
2 #### Good looking shoe but it 's not as described on the website . Website says leather upper but on the tongue it says " Leather with man made upper " . Then below it " Leather lining " . That tells me that the upper is NOT leather . After walking around in them for , like , 10 minutes , I noticed the creases on top of the shoe verified that it was n't leather . Overall fit was not that great either . I 'm going to return these and pay a little bit more for Johnston & Murphy brand shoes .
5 #### < div id="video - block - R9MY8DPM95MNF " class="a - section a - spacing - small a - spacing - top - mini video - block"></div><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I / B1059IAczDS.mp4 " class="video - url"><input type="hidden " name= " " value="https://images - na.ssl - images - amazon.com / images / I/61vSmtqR9yS.png " class="video - slate - img - url">&nbsp;I absolutely love thigh highs , and so does my husband so getting these was a no brainer for me . Now , there s two things that absolutely ruin thigh highs for me ; the first is when the nylon material is cheap quality and you do n't even get them on and they snag . These are NOT those thigh highs . These are a very sheer material , so I was worried they would easily rip or get runs in them , but I was able to successfully put them on and wear them for a few hours with no rips or runs . Obviously they 're still nylon and not indestructible , but they are n't cheaply made and going to run as soon as you put them on . The 2nd thing that ruins thigh highs for me is when the elastic on the band at the top does nt keep the thigh highs up . I do n't necessarily want the world knowing I m wearing thigh highs and I do n't want to have to tug them up non - stop and these stay up very well . There s plenty of elastic on these to keep them in place and not have to constantly adjust . I m definitely pleased with these thigh highs . I received this product for free in exchange for my honest , unbiased review .
5 #### My absolute favorite base layer for everything ! I wear it under work clothes and it does n't show or cause static cling , and it 's great as a first layer for outdoor activities too .
5 #### I use these as the primary dock lines for my 20 ft pontoon boat , I backup with standard lines that remain with slack . I plan to change them annually although they have held up all season without too much sign of wear and tear .
4 #### Very happy with the quality of this optic for the price . The glass is very clear . I 've noticed some minor distortion when the scope is at max power ( 3x ) and I 'm viewing distant targets ( 100 yds + ) . 1x setting on the scope seems very close to true 1x magnfication . For the price I do n't think there is any better low power variable scope . I 've mounted my Weaver V-3 on a classic brush rifle , a Marlin 336 in .30 - 30 . The Weaver V-3 adds very little bulk to the rifle , so no impairment to the quick handling of the 336 . At 1x the rifle is very fast on target , and with up to 3x available , there is plenty of magnfication for the typical distances encountered when I hunt whitetails in heavy Eastern woods ( my typical shots are 20 to 50 yards , with a " long " shot being 75 yards ) .
4 #### Nice footwear . Very comfortable . Get a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear .
5 #### Good quality material that 's sure to be durable . Nice length too . Will order this brand again for different colors .
5 #### Great for adults , would have to cut the velcro straps for kids .
4 #### These shoes are probably the most comfortable I own . I 'd been thinking about getting a pair for years because of all the positive reviews so I finally pulled the trigger . Good call , because they are super comfy and easy to slip on and off . On the downside though they are black seude shoes . I must not have looked closely enough because I thought they were just black leather . I suppose I just do n't see myself as the type of guy that wears seude shoes . I power through it though because these things are so comfortable . They 'll work great for casual wear in the winter / fall , but come summer spring I do n't see myself sporting these shoes with shorts . They really only work with jeans . Fit was as expected , unlike Keens that usually need a 1/2 size bigger .
4 #### Seems good so far , but that is from a compass noob , trying to learn how to find may way :)
5 #### These have held up really well with a year of use and are still being used . I 'd consider that great success with preteens :)
5 #### Well I have had this band for about a month and its as good as when I got it so yeah I will be ordering another if this one snaps .
5 #### Excellant : My grandson is way to cute i this and he loves Mickey Mouse
5 #### I bought this for my husband who has a free weight set upstairs which he loves , but he said he likes the bands better and the freedom to use them anywhere he wants . Total score !
5 #### Will not fit a scary black rifle with scope . Works well for normal rifles .
5 #### Bought for my 14 year old because they 're cool and stylish . But they 're also good quality shoes and she can wear them all day without discomfort .
4 #### My 10 year old nephew really likes it . Positive comments from his mom . I 've been pleased with Nite - Ize branded products in the past .
5 #### Perfect fit . Very comfortable to wear all day long after having surgery .
5 #### This resistance band is very nice , provides exactly what I need to get an extra burn in my workouts . Can be used for biceps , resistance running and all other exercise . I chose the purple band , beats all other prices at retail stores and worth the price . It is very durable , it has n't stretched out ... Yet . I recommend this product .
4 #### Other than the band being too tight , is is a GREAT everyday watch !
5 #### exactly what i need to help alleviate my hand and forearm soreness , couple times a week and I 'm good to go
4 #### Used this on my last campout .. Its heavier than I thought and worked really well .. glad i got it for my camp outs
5 #### What a clean looking ... uncomplicated watch ... adjusts to your wrist in seconds ... anyone can do it . No need to go to a jeweler . The little stones at the hour hands are so sparkely ... a nice little pick you up for those winter months . Treat yourself .
5 #### I am a woman , but the Merrell 's for women are too narrow , so I always buy the men 's shoe . They are wider and much more comfortable . This is true for all sneakers . I wear a size 9 women 's , but I wear an 8 mens . The medium width in the men 's shoe is like the D width in the women 's . I love this shoe .
5 #### I have only had this product for a few weeks but my grip strength has already increased significantly . I use it every other day . I love the fact that my hands are getting calloused too . Great product . Puts the ones in the stores to shame .
4 #### I may eventually purchase this for my son if the price goes down . I already know the quality is n't going to be the greatest because they had this at iplay America . My son really wanted it but he needed 3,000 points at the arcade and would n't give it to him for the 400 points he had . It 's not worth the 20 dollars . It 's also not full it 's more on the flat side . As of now we just received the animated one that was on sale for $ 10 and it 's great ! More realistic looking .
4 #### My son and I bought this gun to go on our 50 cal muzzle - loaders . It is clear and I could not see distortions in the glass . After 15 or so shots out of each gun the scope held its position and it adjusted easily .
5 #### Not much to say , they work great and priced cheaper than local store .
5 #### A very good product for a very reasonable price . The quality was good and it was as it appeared . Would recommend it to friends .
4 #### good fit and finish . small blade dull . large blade not centered but not rubbing .
2 #### To much blade play up and down , side to side.maybe i got a lemon.this " knife " does not fit my need 's due to blade movement .. but the knife is really nice - cool looking . "returned back to the seller "
1 #### I wore these shoe one time , from the airport in Omaha , NE to the airport in Phoenix , AZ . When I arrived in Phoenix , the left shoe / sole started squeaking and wo n't stop . I want to return for a refund . Need instructions for returning as no paperwork was in my package when it arrived .
5 #### I 'm still not sure how to classify these KEEN . They 're somewhat open , like a sandal , but have a closed toe like a shoe . I have used mine for all sorts of outdoor activities - including river walking , hiking , climbing up rocky places , gardening . They are comfortable and well - built . Just add some socks and they make great casual shoes . They 're so comfortable and versatile that I have used them as my primary casual shoes for the past 3.5 years ( but not when it 's wet or rainy out ) . They are now starting to show some wear , and some of the stitching is coming apart , but they are no where near the end of their useful life . I plan to keep wearing them for a long time .
1 #### Way too small ! Ca n't even get them on . It 's amazing how everyone else is a perfect fit in my size .
5 #### Product arrived in the expected condition , new and clean . The shoes fit my 7 year old just right , not too small but with enough room to grow a bit . She loves them wears them to school almost every day .
4 #### work great , but , l i wish i had gotten a little larger size
4 #### It 's a pair of Converse . Must add arch support inlay .
4 #### Peel and stick targets that are great for range work .
5 #### So impressed with the quality . fit perfectly and have gotten several compliments on them
4 #### This is a great home or school practice net . The metal poles are solid construction and the yellow net is easy to see . This net is 6'X4 ' which is great for home use because it does not take up the entire yard , but is large enough for practice and play . It contains stakes that keep the net from tipping over , but the poles are heavy enough that it will stay in place under most circumstances . The net is attached with Velcro strips which makes assemble easy , but durability in the weather could be questionable . It comes nicely packed in plastic and can be assembled by one person . Overall the construction , and quality is very good . The only concern that I have is the long term effects of the weather on the Velcro strips .
4 #### It 's ok , I feel like it 's really super cheap , like it 'll break easy but it works
4 #### It works as designed , has a lot of options and can help strengthen muscles that are prone to injury assists with rehabilitation and is a good item for aging persons to keep arm / hand strength
4 #### Carhartt is a great product though when purchasing these shirts , order one or two sizes smaller . Do n't expect them to shrink .
5 #### This was a gift to my grandson 7 years old . According to him and his buddys this is the best scooter out there . What do I know ? I am 60 years old ! I should get the power scooter to keep up with him .
5 #### This is a nice set for that golfer who has everything but could use something a little special . The towel is of good quality . The balls are nice keepsakes if the golfer does n't want to use them or if he thinks they are n't the greatest balls to help his game . This was a big hit as a Christmas gift .
1 #### These shoes appear to be fake . Part of the Converse logo was missing on the right shoe . The left shoe had a red dye stain on it , as if it had rubbed off while in the box . All in all- they looked very cheap . Did n't even wear them- returning immediately . Do not buy these .
2 #### With only occasional wear and no sports or rough usage , these repro Chucks are falling apart after only three months . The sidewall is pulling away from the canvas and they look awful . Truly disposable shoes .
5 #### Works good , did n't have a cold hunting season to really get a good test . Good indoor slippers too !
3 #### Cheaper material but should be able to wear for a few dress ups / Halloweens .
4 #### These shoes have been around forever ! Still cool and fun ! Probably not the best support , but look cool !
5 #### I love it ! the kids love it ! For the price you ca n't go wrong !
5 #### I love these boots they are stylish and comfy . I wear a 8.5 in men 's and a 7 in kids still had a little room . Nice pickup !
4 #### I love the fit & durability of the material . It not stiff its soft to the touch but tough for working . I will be buying more soon
5 #### Love this wallet . I can get everything I need into it and it has a nice stye
5 #### Bigger than expected . Great length and weight . Really flaps in the wind and looks impressive unlike the cheap ones you see every one else driving with . Bottom line = if you 're a Bruin fan or buying for a Bruin fan you/ they will not be disappointed . # StayclassyUCLA
1 #### This one goes to flat out hard sitting in about 15 minutes . I gave it one star because it will at least keep you from getting a soggy bottom if the ground is damp . Not even worth carrying back out of the woods , I left it there for the next guy so he 'll know what not to buy !
5 #### it was a gift for my sister and she loved it , its comfortable and she likes the colour : )
5 #### I am really happy with this release . It is quite comfortable and straps on nice and secure . The build quality seems to be very good on both the materials in the strap and the precision of the calipers , i think it should last a long time . The best part about it is the easy trigger pull , it 's the most sensitive thing I 've ever seen . REALLY sensitive , i can not stress this enough but that is exactly what i wanted . I literally blew on the trigger to see if i could set it off and it worked ( not while it had any load on it though ) . The only bad thing about it is that it is a little more bulky than other models i have used / seen before , but i would still recommend this especially for the price ! Five stars
4 #### Sure , it 's an okay knife . I wanted the false edge on this listing and this is what my invoice shows . Unfortunately i have a double edged boot dagger now . That along with ridiculously long shipping and a dedex handoff to the USPS for no apparent reason made this oder a real pain in the neck . it 's a good thing i did n't need this stuff in a hurry and like knives of all kinds . i still want a false edge boot dagger so now i will have to do without untiul budget permits me to use a catalog that will get it right . on the plus side , this lashed to my pack strap with ease and i like it .
5 #### Just got these this morning and have been wearing them around the house . So far they 're great . Super cute antidote to the giant SUV - looking running shoes out there that just scream with colors . I wear an 8.5 and have a slightly wide foot and these are very comfy and true 8.5 size . There is even a bit of arch support . Especially love that they 're vegan as I 'm phasing out all my non - vegan shoes as they wear out . I 've not gone running yet , but as I definitely prefer less on my feet than the bulky , spongy , cushiony typical running shoes , I think these will be great . I hope they hold up .
4 #### I never thought a long sleeve shirt would be cooler than a short sleeve . And I mean temperature as well as hip . The vented back and underarms let the breeze through . I need to protect my arms from the sun . I also use this when videotaping on location . My video production website is [ ... ] The pockets are aplenty and ample sizes . The Velcro makes me feel secure enough to put cell phone and even wallet in the pockets . The only downside is that it needs cold water washing . My laundry service washes is separately and they do n't add starch . So the shirt , even with their pressing , does not look crisp . The seller even delivers it wrinkled .
5 #### This is the second one of these I have bought , Had such good luck with the first it was a no brainer to buy another . Look nice , works well , and priced right . All good .
5 #### My 7 yr old loves all her converse shoes ! Important to know that converse runs a size larger than other shoes . I knew to expect this , but for first time buyers I would say to buy a size smaller in converse shoes
5 #### I have used these several times so far and they work very well . I have had no problems at all and I suspect these will last years if they are not abused . All the colors arrived as well as the accessories . Looking forward to furthering my strength with these .
5 #### I have a pair of SmartWool hiking socks that are over ten years old and they are still one of the best pairs of socks in the drawer . I 'm going on a trip to Europe and Colorado and will be doing a LOT of walking so I bought five more pairs . When you think of how well these socks are made and how long they can last the price is worth it . You ca n't go wrong with these socks .
5 #### A little small in the waist . It could be me
5 #### This is a very nice bra : Good fit and excellent lift . Under - wire do not dig in . I bought two of the ,
5 #### just what I was looking for . took less than 3 days to breakem in
2 #### So heavy and extremely hard to blow up . Do n't buy this unless you have someone super strong to carry it . And make sure you buy an air pump as well otherwise do n't waste your money ! Too big to use in a pool so only get if you plan to use in a lake or ocean !
5 #### Bought this jacket for my brother , lives in San Diego . He went to Minneapolis to set up NFL stations for Super Bowl . Temperature in SD was 70 . When he got to MN temp 0 . A bit of a change . He said " Jacket works Fantastic " . Fit was perfect . Inside zippered pockets handy .
3 #### It DOES NOT STRETCH ! There is some standard stretchy material where the hook and eyes are , but the lacy part is not stretchy in the least . This just BARELY fits me , I got a 44D
5 #### Got it for my brother for Christmas , and we all enjoyed taking a turn . I would say that it is not a toy for somebody that would be irresponsible . It will put holes in aluminum cans from 20 feet . Cool stuff , but you 'll need to be careful .
1 #### Does n't work . Cause more pain than before . I 've been hanging in there trying it for a week . Do n't know what other reviewers are talking about ? ?
5 #### Great shoe , fits true to size , comfortable and look nice
4 #### This dress was a little bit big when I received it , however once I washed it the dress did shrink somewhat . I 'm a 10/12 & ordered a large , I think I 'd go with a medium next time as it has a stretchy panel in the back . I did get lots of compliments on it .
5 #### Actually , my old one which is about 10 years old still was functional but the lining of some of my purses are black and I wanted something that I could find easily . I just quickly transferred my credit cards etc . to the new wallet in minutes . I thought the credit card pockets were too tight but after a little use , they are fine .
5 #### Great , sturdy and comfortable shoe . Bought it for my husband 's birthday and he prefers it over a similar style by a different brand . He says the cushion is better and the shoe is all round more comfortable . Seems to be a better quality ... so we did n't mind spending a little more than was what was offered at local sports academy for less .
4 #### They were a little bigger than expected . I 've always worn the same size , yet these feel bigger .
5 #### Very good product . I wear these shoes all winter and never catch a cold .
4 #### Gave it four stars as I had to sign for this package . UPS driver said signature required . I 've had flat screens delivered to my home that did n't require a signature
5 #### Now I do n't have to waste time and lose my mind untangling my chains before leaving the house . This velvet organizer is beautiful and keeps all my jewelry in place . Just what I needed .
5 #### Its a Pelican case . Not much else to be said . You know you 're buying a quality product when you get a Pelican .
4 #### Bought this for my 5 year old . She does n't wear it because she 's worried she is going to lose it . But , i give it 4 stars for quality , cuteness , functionality and the price was great ! Also comes with a great warranty !
5 #### Great product for the price . Quick Focus , comes with nice little pouch .
5 #### The design of this watch is very feminine . I have somewhat small wrists and the size is perfect for me . I have always had Timex watches . They are the best for your money .
3 #### I have the t - shirt bra in n this same brand and love it , but this one although supportive , just not attractive . I 'm a 30 G and I know I ca n't expect to wear those lacy cute bras the smaller girls get to wear , but I would like somewhat attractive . I 'm not ready to look like a granny just yet .
5 #### I 've bought many of these . These are n't high tech . They are locks that lock guns . These locks lock guns as they are supposed to . End of story .
5 #### These are really simple , comfy vegan tennis shoes . I like the black an white option too instead of only being offered in outrageous neon colors like most shoes these days . Seem like they will hold up a while too . I like that they came with 2 colors of laces ( black and tan ) , though I will likely just keep the black laces for not .
5 #### all columbia line fits very welll and look better , nice design , very fresh and the color are not very common , so its make special
5 #### Great product and very good quality . This set is great for all family members . Kids also get a great workout with these . Its fun and exercise at the same time .
5 #### My husband loves these Bonehead shirts from Columbia and this one is up the standard .
1 #### Too small to carry or use on camping or backpacking trips . Best to use larger heat tabs . Use this as a fire starter and not to boil or cook anything .
3 #### Look nice but the customer service is questionable and these can not be returned .
5 #### They are so good , he loves to wear them . Last time we walked close to a Converse Store and we wanted to buy the yellow ones too :)
4 #### Do n't even think it was the same type . Says it is a certain brand and that is not true or there is no marking I 've seen as that brand . Connis ...
4 #### Working out great . Might need to added something to secure it over time .
5 #### Replaced the rubber strap on my Suunto Wrist - Top Computer Watch when the original rubber strap broke . This strap fits the watch perfectly and looks great . I like it better than the original strap , as it feels more comfortable when wearing the watch for long periods of time .
4 #### Nice jeans but waist seems snigger than my other brands with the same size
1 #### The shopping the label says the correct size but the shoes are actually a size bigger
3 #### These are comfortable shoes and do fit good all around but the vendor could have but a more deeper tread on them for a better grip on trail walks .
5 #### The Frisbee was awesome for anyone who wanted to play frisbee in the dark , i really love it . Light can change in different colors each 5 seconds , it was amazing . Highly recommended for everyone who love to play frisbee in the dark .
5 #### Just the right size for a lady . Great quality . Very pretty .
5 #### Great multitool Wish is was as pictured with the nuts holding the bits instead of the hex key bolts . Like the satin finish over the black oxide for the bits come out smoother and easier . Read a lot of reviews that say the tool bits are cheap . Having owned many tools as a civilian and in the army , SOG multitools have better tools and replaceable if broken . The pouch with this model is better to me as it can be used with a belt or over the edge of pants and really easy to remove if passing though a security check point .
5 #### Great product , Small price to pay ............ kids are ridding their scooters again !
4 #### This is one of my favorite pieces for my son . the shoe is a bit stiff to get on and was a little tight eventho we order the wide size . The length was fine , but it 's rather narrow . my son could not wear it because he said that it hurt the top of his foot . we had to return , but i think it 's a great piece for a narrow foot . also , the sole is very flexible - this was surprising since i expected it to be stiff . I will buy again next year !
5 #### Plus the mesh back keeps me cool in the summer . I like to carry alot of " things " and " stuff " ( compass , lighter , pills , mints , whistles , camera , batteries , all my " discount cards " , my flash cards , gloves , etc ) with me so I wear safari vests instead of toting everything in a knapsack . My other multi - pocket vests made me feel burdened and weighted down - THIS vest is so well balanced -- it is the BEST one I have encountered in the past 10 years . The mesh back makes me feel much cooler in the summer heat -- in contrast to my other multi - pocket vests which got hot hot hot , even though they are the same " cool " color as my Rothco ( tan ) . This vest is easy to wash , VERY durable , some of the pockets are lined with satin -- nice touch . Pockets ( velcro - fastened ) are also found in the BACK of the vest as well as 3 inner pockets -- one long and zippered , the other fine for cards and sunglasses . And the zipper pull - tabs do NOT jam or get skewed like they do on my other ( NOT inexpensive ) multi - pocket vests . Triple - layered pockets ( with velcro closures ) also help " stack " items in an easy - to - reach format .
1 #### Did n't work when my son opened it on Christmas morning , that was real nice .
5 #### We added clips to one end for PWC use . Pro quality
3 #### If you have plans for car camping , it will work . You should have a pump that plugs into the cigarette lighter , , it will take 2 min . If you do n't , it will take forever and you will get a headache from having use the air that you breath to blow it up .
5 #### I like the vegan Jazz much better than the standard Saucony Jazz because they 're made of canvas so they let your feet breathe . They are comfortable and stylish . I 've owned several pairs . The price on Amazon ca n't be beat . Great deal .
4 #### I 'm pretty strong and I can not expand the purple when it 's stuck in a door stretching my arms out towards my back . It looses one star for making me look weak .
5 #### I love these shoes!<3 They fit perfectly . I recommend ordering a size smaller .
3 #### Love Carhartt but the waist goes way higher than normal pants .
5 #### Love them . These are the exact same Converse as the ones sold in the stores , but a much better price . I notice the price changes frequently , but when they decrease again , I will be buying more pairs . The black ones I purchased have held up well to being machine washed many times .
5 #### Great shoes ! Great choice ! Bought a pair in Black too .
1 #### This watch does just what I wanted , basic time no frills , however it is advertised as a man 's watch and the band wo n't fit around my wrist which I consider average [ .. ]
4 #### In the page is not easy to understand what is the correct set for your car , before you get them check the vendor 's page and get sure that in the SIZE ( YOUR NUMBER )
5 #### Plastic so your lips do n't freeze to the whistle . No pea to freeze . Its cold here ...
5 #### For my granddaughter . Came on time . Fit just right . She loves them !
3 #### This tube died only after one use , doing some overhead presses . I think I must have had a faulty one , because SPRI does n't usually tear that easily . The seller took a refund , so I 'm a happy camper
5 #### First pair of Sperry Top - Siders , and could n't be happier . They fit extremely well and look amazing . Recommend to anyone looking for a good pair of summer shoes !
2 #### These are definitely cheap binoculars . As with most binoculars , these focus by sliding the eyepieces the eyepieces in and out just slightly . However , on my set , the eyepieces can wiggle around a little bit , which makes it pretty much impossible to get a good focus in both eyes at the same time , even with adjusting the monocular . Also , the left side is just not very clear in general and is always hazy around the outside especially . I was n't expecting crazy fancy , but being Bushnells , I was rather disappointed . They work ... ish , but I 'm sure you could find better for cheaper at a thrift store .
5 #### I do n't give many 5 star ratings but these exceeded my expectations . In some shoes I wear a 13 EEE and I was a bit apprehensive about the width because they are only EE . I was pleasantly surprised to find them not only wide enough but also big enough I could wear a heavy boot sock with them . The toe is somewhat rounded which i think helps . They look as good as the picture and are very well made . I do n't buy this style of boots often , but I think they are an excellent value .
5 #### Perfect for my angel costume on Halloween . Wish they had n't snagged ) ;
5 #### Best Targets on the market ! And , use the dots to cover the holes so the target goes a long way !
4 #### it works ! boils 1 liter of water within 10 min ,
5 #### I 've worn this helmet for months and am very pleased with it . It was reasonably priced and I received it quickly .
5 #### Real Converse , not counterfeit . But in learning that these are not counterfeit made me realize I HAD bought counterfeit before .... from my local Fred Meyer .
5 #### Fits with room to add my shemagh or my balaclava .
5 #### I love this trampoline ! IT is not rigid and I leave it in my living room so I can just jump on it whenever I feel the energy or as part of my exercise routine . Fairly quiet and I am very glad I bought it . I have had it for quite some time ( a few years ) just have not taken the time to review it till now .
5 #### I wear a size 32 x 32 typically . I considered ordering the large , but the medium is just big enough . The pants are good quality and are effective during light to moderate snow use . While not fully waterproof , they will insulate and keep the water from making you uncomfortable . My friends could not believe I ordered these on Amazon such a reasonable price . The overall bib style is definitely they way to go vs. regular snow pants . Good pockets with felt liner .
5 #### Great price for a good scope . Put one on the 22 and one on the 17 . Had to use different rings to mount on Weaver rail , but I 'm happy with them .
5 #### The bag part of it is smaller then you would imagine but not too small its a good size for an adult . The material is some type of fabric .
5 #### Fits perfect . I normally wear a 10 but I have to get a 9 or 9.5 in chuck Taylors . A 9 fits perfect but the 9.5 just gives a little more room . I m good with either size .
2 #### Looks nice out of the package ... but lasted about six months and the bristles started coming out of the brushes . Another two months and the wood cracked and the brushes fell out of the frame . For $ 30 , it is not a good product . One other thing - you have to screw it down to a piece of wood that you can stand on with one foot while you clean the other . By the time you 're done fooling around , you could just take your boots OFF and solve the whole problem .
5 #### worked great ! ! was looking for an easy slip on around 7 months preggo and back aches . This did the trick . so easy on and off with no stooping over and I could go for a lot longer walks as it was cushioned my feet did n't hurt so much .
5 #### These were purchased for all of the women in our family , from 12 years old through adults , as a means to attract attention if they find themselves in a threatening environment . We also gave them to our sons , and grandsons , at least the ones who wanted one . I started using Acme Thunderer Whistles over 40 years ago as part of my training program for my Labrador Retriever . I still have my original . An outstanding product that will last forever and when it is blown you understand why it is called The ACME Thunderer .
5 #### This is the BEST suit for little boys that I have ever seen ! It 's super durable and realistic . Except the helmet . Which is kind of average . ) It runs big , so the size 2/3 fits my very average size 3 1/2 yr old . The pants are suspenders , so they adjust lenght wise . It 's worth the extra money .
3 #### Normal razor replacement wheels . There is nothing great or bad about these , they work as expected .
5 #### I purchased this to do physical therapy in my pool . I use it for various kicking exercises , and tuck it under my body for buoyancy . My husband also uses it for upper body resistance in the pool and has said that it is good for strengthening . It has held up well after 6 months of use ; there are no signs of wear .
5 #### I have a smallish head and bought a medium . Fits perfect . I use it for ocean wave ski riding in fairly big surf . Take awhile to drain and dry .
2 #### I got this for my father for Christmas it is so small its more for kids poles he tried to put his in and it just fell right over , its been sitting in a corner since not worth the price
5 #### They came 10 days earlier than expected . Have n't worn converse in over 10 years , if you 're looking to start again i would go with this design
5 #### FINALLY , this fits my 1966 Colt Detective damn near perfect . The grips were a little loose , so I put a couple layers of tape on the handles . I did n't wrap them I cut to size like spacers . This snugged up the grips perfectly . I have large hands and the small colt was uncomfortable to shoot and would shift in my hands . It now fits my hands great and the grips adsorb any kick . I feel a CC firearm should be safe , simple and reliable . A revolver fits all three . Another poster put it perfectly . The grips turned the Colt Detective from a piece of memorabilia to a perfect CC firearm .
5 #### My last bag lasted me 8 years , and it was an Everlast bladder bag . When I took out the original out they had similar feel and texture . I put it in and it 's been working out so far . takes heavy hits and does n't deflate . I 've only had inflate it once since I 've had it , and it 's been over a month .
5 #### Awesome frisbee , wish it was heavier . Do n't get me wrong , it 's not flimsy frisbee , we are used to throwing 200 g . I DO recommend buying
1 #### This costume is very cheaply made . The back is solid light pink and is very see - through . The wig leaves much to be desired . Do n't waste your money .
5 #### I absolutely love these shoes . I 've been looking for a pair like this for quite a while , and after wearing them for the past two months , I 'm in love . The inside of them is not super comfortable , but it 's also not anything super uncomfortable either . I 've had a few people comment on them and say they love them . I typically wear an 8 , so I was concerned if these would be too small or big , but the fit is perfect .
5 #### Comfy and convenient ! My husband loves these mocks ! ! ! He has 4 different pairs but these are his favorites ! I recommend them to anyone !
4 #### Love these shirts for everything from hiking and boating to golf and casual night out . The fit , however , is ~1/2 size larger than advertised .
5 #### I really love the name brand & what got me was the inexpensive price .
4 #### ... overall I like the jeans . The general fit is about what I expected . But the waist is tight on me . But I will be losing a lot of weight soon ... :) Yeh right
5 #### Did n't come at the estimated time but all in all good product
5 #### Good old reliable Coleman cooler . Nothing special , just a plain camping cooler . Gets the job done for the right price . Has a water release valve on the side and an attached lid . Big enough to keep drinks and groceries for a weekend or so . Keeps temp pretty well although it 's nothing like a yetti . But it does n't carry the price tag either .
5 #### Use it for mooring the boat to the dock ; Perfect !
4 #### Shirts are good quality and great price . I 've bought them before . The only issue I have with them is that they are a bit too long .
5 #### Converse All star Chuck Taylor Hi Mens Size 11 Black Athletic Sneakers ... After reading reviews I ordered one size smaller and they fit very well . I wear size 12 and ordered size 11 .
5 #### My daughter loves them and when the princess is happy we are all happy
5 #### Durable , good looking and current . I 'm not willing to call them stylish but they do n't look bad , they are a little long . Also these are work shorts and if I kneel down to the ground I can pull the shorts over my knee to be a bit more comfortable working . This is my 4th pair .
5 #### Purchased one size smaller , based on reading reviews , and they fit perfect . I love the shoes aND plan on buying another pair soon .
5 #### I m 25 - 30 yrs old , 5 4 athletic female . I have a bunions and wide feet so i have trouble finding comfortable but fashionable looking shoes . I 've looked at sneakers from asics , nike , etc , up to 100 $ + even but I finally found a pair that 's versatile and constructed even better . Got the women 's 8 xw . On the box it 's marked as that and as EEE too . But they do n't look bulky , the construction and materials are great , and there is room for thick inserts if you need . They are light weight too . Price is very good . You 'll get more out of these for longer than more expensive sneakers . These will last way longer from daily wear . They 're great as fashion sneakers and as athletic shoes and do n't make your feet look big . I highly recommend !
4 #### This is not the first time I 've baught this item , it is very good fishing line , it more reasonable than buying smaller packages . I love it , my son uses it for lake fishing on his catfish poles .
5 #### Columbia shirts are PERFECT for my fiance 's job as a landscaper / irrigation tech . He wears them every day to keep the sun off his skin . He also wears a hat with a flap on the back - very sun - conscious . He hates wearing sunscreen because it just means everything will stick to him when he 's doing landscaping work , or will wash off when he 's on irrigation jobs . Columbia shirts are his solution and have been for years . He loves the flap in the back that allows a breeze to come through and cool him off . Every time a Columbia shirt goes on sale , he buys it ; does n't matter how many he has already . I have also bought a few and like them for when I work outdoors . He bought a coral - ish color , and it looks a bit like a faded red , but still looks nice .
5 #### I used these for the bottom of metal feet on a bed , worked out awesome . I can now push the bed easily and no scratches on my floor .
1 #### The stiring wheel on the scooter keeps coming lose and my son was riding it and he had hurt himself . This was a piece of junk , I will need buy this thing again . Had this scooter for a year only !
4 #### I had bought a pair of biking shorts a few years ago and these are the same quality . SO I thing that they should work as well . The only change that I noted was that these to not have a string at the waist which was handy . I carry the key bob for the car on it other wise I have to find another place to carry it .
5 #### Shipped quick . Real quick ! 5 days faster than origanly told . That was nice . Targets show great detail with the addition of major body organs in gray scale so no to overtake the targets main objective . Paper is good quality for outdoor / indoor ranges . I have no idea why some people reviewed paper as being too thin . Who knows how they are hanging targets ? Target held up my Taurus Judge SSR both with .45 Long Cold and .410 triple ott buck shot ammo . All - in - all A+ and I will purchase again . Thank You , Amazon and Sportsman Guide . The 10 % discount code from Sportsman was a nice suprise .
5 #### Great socks . Used for a recent trip to Alaska . Felt great while hiking . I would definitely purchase again .
5 #### Excellent and sturdy . My only slight criticism is that the fixing the straps to the door attachment is a bit fiddley because the material is too wide to fit easily into the fasteners at the end of the strapt .
5 #### These sandals are very comfortable and are great for walking . I usually wear size 7 - 1/2 or 8 , and the 8 fits fine . I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a waterproof sandal .
5 #### Merrell Men 's Jungle Moc Slip - On Shoe , Midnight,11 ... Merrell Footwear Awesome shoes for work or casual outings , these shoes can take a beating and are very comfotable to wear . You can buy the suede spray and coat these shoes and let them dry out and they will last longer and look a whole lot better in the long run .
5 #### Its Nalgene . High Quality . Never leaks . I use the 4 Oz container to hold a little olive oil when I go backpacking .
5 #### Great dealer , great shipping , product was as expected . I 'm smilin ' .
4 #### I like it . I was n't sure if I could pull off this kind of hat , but it looks good and fits nicely .
5 #### Just received my resistance bands a few days ago , and must say I 'm pretty impressed . I like must buyers read the product reviews before making my purchase , and after reading one particular review where the bracket snapped in half and cut the persons foot I must admit I had my concerns . So I " rolled the dice " anyway based on price / value and the overwhelming positive reviews . As soon as my package came I opened it expecting to find those poor quality brackets but was shocked to find something else . It actually shipped with some nice decent quality carabiners instead of the snap on brackets . It reassured me that BMP cares about their products and pays attention to their reviews .
4 #### works well and comes with alot of extra stuff a good workout for limited space and if you travel . 15min and you can feel your heart rate climb and a good sweat if used right
5 #### I ordered the black one first and was so pleased with it that I ordered the navy one . Love the satin finish on the back . VERY comfortable with GREAT support and coverage . If the rating went to 10 stars , I 'd try to give 11 . :-)
5 #### Camping must have . There is nothing better than hot tea of coffee in the morning .
5 #### long - lasting , excellent support ! ! recommended for long working hours on your feet ! ! ! very very durable material ! perfect for cellulites as well ! !
4 #### I can inflate my tires to 120psi with this pump , but it definitely does not feel like it 'll last all that long . Also , at high pressure , it does n't actually add air till about the bottom 15 % of the pump action , so that it takes sort of long .
5 #### Its a good shirt . I ordered a 2xl and it was just right , not too tight or too loose . A little thin and has no pocket , but for the price a good deal .
5 #### Mounts easy to any long gun with a sling attachment .
4 #### Seem to be a good value . They are a little bulky for hiking but work well for stargazing and birdwatching .
4 #### I purchased these last minute for a snowboarding trip . The purple is extremely bright . They are well constructed and I believe will hold up . Unfortunately they are too narrow at the bottom and would not fit over my boots . In addition , they were too short ( I 'm 5'4 " / 115lbs ) . Definitely not flattering ... but well priced and shipping was super fast .
4 #### This is my first pair of Merrells and I really like them . I usually wear a 14 or 15 but size 14 in these Merrells is a little small . Next pair I 'll order a 15 .
5 #### I slapped a Penn Battle II 5000 on this and have found a good setup for surf and pier fishing . I like the casting distance without losing sensitivity at this price . Great value for a wide range of use and reliability in a two piece rod
5 #### This product is a good buy . I will not discuss the physical / chemical properties of silicone grease , but I can only say that if you know about this stuff , you will recognize a great price on a great product ! I am glad I found it !
5 #### Priced right timex watch . Comfortable and easy to read at night .
4 #### I bought these shoes about a two years ago and they fit perfect . These however feel a little narrow other than that they are perfect .
4 #### The shoes are true to size . I am used to wearing running shoes so these have been an adjustment . Overall , the shoe is nice and provides well for my HIIT and Grit classes I take .
5 #### These work great ! Very visible target and easy to see each shot .
5 #### My third one in about 15years . Keeps very good time .
3 #### My GSD can still manage to nip at someone if he really wanted to , but at least it will minimize the damage if he does .
5 #### Moved my stuff into 2 different domiciles . Back thanked me both times by not being sore . There are better models to further correct posture when lifting but for me these work fine . I am shirt size medium and suit size 40 short and a size medium was perfect . If you move stuff you should be wearing one of these .
5 #### Nicely constructed . Exactly what I need to carry 70 pounds of lead for my family
5 #### under 0 degrees , this goes on .... it works well ... does wear a bit with a beard though
2 #### Does n't fit scoped rifles . I have a .22 rifle with a small plinker scope and it does n't fit . Too tight . Works great with scope removed .
4 #### just as it says . The price is still a little too high
3 #### UPDATE Since wearing them for 3 months , I 've gone snowboarding . Having them on for 6 + hours , now I can officially complain the tight ankles . The bands really dug deep and broke skin a lil . If you snowboard / ski , you 'll know the boots are really tight so something usually feels uncomfortable , but i was just surprised how much it hurt AFTER i took everything off . ------------------- I just got them today . was totally excited yet apprehensive about the size . I 'm small and compact , 5'3 " , 135 . I was worried when I read about others ' weight and height -- thinking it might be too tight . But , it 's actually not as tight as I thought it would be for compression tights ( would like it better if it was tighter ) . It is a few inches longer , but i like wearing it over under my heel . The ankles are tight , but good for my size . I bought these for hiking and wearing under clothes for snowboarding . But as I sit here in a non - insulated San Francisco apartment , i am not warm enough with just these on ... I think i 'll end up wearing them with dresses and boots .
5 #### I have been wearing this bra style for years and would n't buy anything else . Comfortable and great support
5 #### Run about a full size too large . Too much to make up for with thicker socks . Other than that , they are really cute . True bubble , gum girlie pink
5 #### it works pretty good . then also do a stretching exercise , keeping the elbow straight with arm stretched out and just bend the hand down at the wrist until you can feel the muscle on the top of the forearm straining
5 #### Very nice . Used them to hike in Zion . I never got a blister ! ! !
5 #### If you ve never had a scooter these are great starters
5 #### I was on the fence between buying these or a more expensive type shoe for squats(Nike Romaelo , Adidas AdiPower , etc . ) . I decided to at least try these out first . They are exactly what I want and need . For a shoe that appears to be so basic , they are very comfortable . I get very good support out of these while squatting .
5 #### I bought 4 pair to go cold weather camping . They fit perfectly , provided good warmth with sock liners , in insulated boots . The camp out was near the Canadian border in December and January .
5 #### I purchased all of the bands for use in my household . This bands are great for stretching and working out with resistance . I keep the green one at my desk at work and do arm and leg exercises while reading or on the phone . I can also do 10 minute band work outs watching videos during lunch . I am glad I have these .
5 #### Excelente Do explain why you liked or disliked this product . Do compare to similar products and share how long you 've used this product . Do identify specific attributes ( e.g. comfort & fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera ) and whether they met your expectations .
5 #### It is just a big piece of Latex , but it does all as described . Also , I suffer from Plantar fasciitis , and it turns out this thing makes for an amazing foot massager .
5 #### It replaced the one I had before and I liked the last one . I got another just like it . I like the plain dial with large numbers , the day and date feature , and the Indiglo light .
5 #### I have 2 other pairs of this same shoe , different colors . It 's a comfortable shoe and it 's easy to slip on and off .
5 #### My Buxton bag is so cute . I also love the oranizing features . The inside of my purse is so neat when I use this bag .
4 #### other than being a little big they are nice shoes
5 #### If you go size down you 'll have a perfect fit
5 #### These are good training tools for anyone who is away from the field or maybe you are looking for a cheap alternative to permenent bases . We keep them outside and the are holding up just fine .
4 #### The plastic container " does the job " and does not leak . My only complaint is that the walls are thinner than expected for a Nalgene product .
5 #### Perfect for what I needed on runs . I have an iPhone 6 with an Otterbox protector on it . It 's very hard to find anything to fit that phone . I actually went to a local store and put my phone in it to make sure it did fit . I have my phone in the top pocket , keys and license in the bottom . It does n't bounce when I run and I was very leery of this belt because I thought it would . It does however have a very long end when you tighten it around your waist , you have to tuck it under and through to keep it out of the way . I 've also noticed that it will move as I have it over my shirt and pants and I think it 's the material that makes it shift from where I 've placed it to where it wants to go . The only bad thing I 've noticed after having it for two weeks .
4 #### Very sturdy fabric and a nice rich color true to the depiction . It is a little loose in the waist and I will send it to my seamstress for a minor adjustment . It 's a keeper . I received a positive remark from my wife . She says the pant looks good on me , so there you have it .
5 #### This cloth is much better than using silicone for my purposes . No oily residue to deal with and just as effective for wiping off sweat and oils for my hands . Recommended
5 #### Meets the purpose , good value . The only wish I have that after intensive sweating my hands do not slip on it , but I think this would the issue for all mats .
4 #### True to size . Very adorable low - top shoe . Only taking away a star because mine arrived with an annoying ( permanent ) smudge on the toe that ruins the otherwise flawless " new shoe " look . Low priority , I know .. but I paid for brand new shoes and I prefer if the makers had upped their quality check a tad .
5 #### I like it . I did n't try the other strength versions but this is not too rigid . If you are a decently strong , young person , this version will suit you just fine . Do n't be a p*ssy .
5 #### These are nice quality . I ordered a size larger than I normally where , and they fit just right .
4 #### Not much for wearing anything other than jeans . These fit OK for my size . Nice for lounging in around the house .
3 #### i bought 2 pair but only one fits ok . both same size and same brand and style , but one pair was too large .
1 #### After a couple years of very easy indoor use of maybe three times per week , two of the bands just snapped in one weeks time . One snapped and hit me in the face , so I 'm not happy . I want a refund or replacement set .
5 #### GREAT chalk . Comes out nice and evenly and stays on my hands really well . I do sweat a lot when i am climbing and i can trust this to keep things under control ! Helps me grip the slopers , pebbles and what have you . A must have for any climber . No antiperspirant which is a plus for me . Worth the money all the way !
5 #### The exercises that come with the bar are easy to do and really seem to help ! I changed from a hard serve to a slice and use the bar often and most of my pain is gone !
1 #### Coleman a great company threw my childhood great products . Well move to China and all your great products turn to junk . I have this same model but it 's 20 years old and looks beat up so I wanted a newer one so I bought a new version . There is more wrong with the new one than the beat up one . If you have any brains DON'T buy this if you once trusted Coleman . The old one must have been dropped a 1000 times the new one if you drop it it will be trash . It 's flimsy cheap , it 's on high all the time even set on low , the paint came off the first time we used it in places the old one still has paint . I 'll never or my kids will never buy anything from coleman again .
2 #### I bought these individually wrapped fuel tablets along with the Emberlit Fireant , titanium stove . I plan on using the Emberlit as a backup to my Jetboil system while backpacking . I now also plan on using only wood to fuel the stove , not these tablets . These fuel tablets ( still factory packed ) smell like rotting dead fish ! ! I do n't even know where I would store them at home let alone in my pack - they STINK that bad . When I opened the package from Amazon today I was immediately hit with a very foul and fishy smelling odor . I do n't care how well they may work - I 'm sorry I bought them ...
1 #### The problem with ALL Timex watches is you need to take it in to a jeweler to replace the battery . This is really annoying as I like the design and function of their watches . You can get the back cover off , but CANNOT get it back on without a special tool . Just give it a google - even jewelers have had trouble , I broke the crystal on one of my watches . I understand a tight seal is required to make the watch water resistant , but Timex needs to come up with something better than this . Your Timex watch could be useless after the battery runs out . What I find incredible is that there is nothing on their website about this common problem .
3 #### I have had a few different brands of stadium chairs and this one has good back support but is quite thin -- maybe a half inch of cushion . For me at least , this is not enough as I have to stand up periodically since my butt gets sore .
4 #### Though the cup is a bit large I 'm still giving it 4 stars . I 'm broad around but have a smaller bust . The overall fit is very good & quite comfortable . Overall , I 'm pleased with my choice .
5 #### My husband is really tough on shoes - he wears them everywhere , including in water , mud , snow . Merrell Men 's Jungle Moc Slip - on shoes are the ONLY shoes that have ever held up to his abuse . We highly recommend these shoes for comfort , quality and longevity .
5 #### These work well for tennis elbow . I used it and it helped very much .
5 #### These are sooooo much better than ' little hotties ' . I returned little hotties because they just did n't heat like these . Pop one of these in each of your gloves ( on the back of your hand ) .
5 #### I play ping pong almost every day - Sometimes for 2 hours a day . These balls have the control and weight you need to have an intense game of ping pong . They are durable and as long as the kids do n't get a hold of them - I can see them outlasting my paddle ! Big fan here . Update : It is December of 2015 - almost 2 years after my initial purchase and I still have one ball hanging on ! 2 years of frequent use - ca n't beat it ...
4 #### Works good but I needed a lower resistance to get started . Did not take long before I was able to use it though .
5 #### These shoes are a great throw back to when I was a teenager . My daughters love them . They look super cute with any outfit - it does n't have t be athletic
4 #### yu need 2 sell lea ammo so it can be used as intended , it is not a toy , hope it works
4 #### Very well add product . I recommend starting low , I have a pretty strong grip so I decided to start on the 2.5 haha , it 's still good excercise but I ca n't quite complete it . Should have gone for the 2.0 .
3 #### Stay away from bushes and stucco houses ... the slightest rub against anything not smooth will deflate your jet pack in a heartbeat and your kids smile when he realizes his wings are floppy !
5 #### Although I feel this was crazy that this was the only Lock that would fit my Thule and I feel Thule prices this Item to high even on their site its the same price . This works well and does fit m Thule very well to help protect it and keep the Hitch Rack safe from theft as well as keeps it from moving around while on the hitch .
2 #### They run big and are super uncomfortable and the soles squeak . They do n't breathe at all .
5 #### Love my roller skates they are comfortable and fun it came with adjustable wrench I prefer over roller blades I grew up in the 80 's
4 #### Great shirt . Have always loved the quality . Note ... These shirts run a bit larger than expected . Next time I 'll order the next size down ...
5 #### My son 's first words were " chugga chugga whoo whoo " . Okay , not really but they might as well have been . My son loves everything to do with trains , does n't matter if its Thomas the tank engine or not . This is the costume I had to hide a few weeks ago so we could have a normal family picture without my son wearing his Thomas costume . To say my son loves it is an understatement . I had to pin the sides together so he could walk without falling down , he 's a little on the short side ( gets it from his father ) . But I can see him wearing this for the next couple of Halloweens no problem . The only problem I had with the costume was the hat , it was way to small to fit on his noggin . But since we have a problem with hats and 3 year olds anyways , it was n't that big a deal .
5 #### My home is on a lake and I have a pond as well . Planting flowers is awful ; I have insects flying and biting me . I purchase this item and the jacket and it is a life saver ! No more biting or crawling on my body . Perfect for outdoor work !
4 #### Nice small scope . Glass is OK , good build quality . Mounted on a lever gun to help the old eyes and it has worked nicely .
5 #### Nice net for our backyard set - up . I used pvc pipes as posts . I 'm not sure what to look for in a badminton net , but after a summer of use , it is still in great shape . I ca n't wait for next summer .
5 #### I got an extra large because I wanted it baggy for winter wear . I just what I wanted .
5 #### Yep , this thing works . It is rugged , easy to assemble , very - well engineered and absolutely solves the problem of storing two bikes out of the way in my garage . Assembly took about five minutes --a flawless product .
5 #### Perfect fit . Its the 3rd one , same size for my daughter . She loves this .
2 #### Ordered it 3 sizes bigger than my regular size . Normally wear a 38 B / C. Got a 44 B. It was still too small around my bust . Would not wrap around my gut at all , but I have a big gut . I have no idea how I got into one of these for my wedding , ha ! Color is nice and the quality was nice . Wish it would fit me though .
5 #### This rail mount is branded Remington but actually made by B - Square ( according to the packaging insert ) . It slides on an 870 nicely ( if anything feels a little loose until the bolts are inserted and tightened ) and once mounted , seems to be rock solid . The finish is very nice as well ( although if you 're a perfectionist , I would say it 's a slightly darker black and more - shiny / less - matte appearance than the shotgun bluing itself ) . The raised , see - through rail is a nice touch so you can still see down your sights or the front bead . The only issue , however , is that the optic is raised that much more . I put a reflex sight on mine and even with the raised comb my after - market stock has , my cheek has to be a good inch or two away from the comb to see down the sight when it is mounted in such a raised fashion . I actually prefer it this way so I have better peripheral vision , and so that I do n't get a bruised cheek bone from the recoil ! But if you 're looking for a low - mounted scope where you can rest your cheek on the comb and still look down the scope , this is probably not your mount . Otherwise , it 's a good solid mount -- especially for CQB type sights .
5 #### This is a great knife for the price . I specifically picked model for a few reasons . 1 . The full tang design . The handles are there to make the grip wider and more comfortable , but could easily be used without them if needed . The top of the knife is thicker than most , especially for it 's length . 2 . The hand feel . The ridges on the spine give a good solid position for your thumb . The half finger loop on the bottom holds your index finger securely . The knife sits well in the hand and allows a lot of dexterity without losing grip when working in tight places . 3 . The blade . It 's only sharp on one side so you do n't have to worry about hurting yourself from kick back . You can push the blade through something dense from the top . It 's also a great length for most any task . In addition to those points , the sheath is nice and compact . Many have reviewed having issues with it . If you have problems with this sheath being tight , you should n't own a knife . If it were any looser , it would certainly be falling out of it within a year from purchase . Lastly , it 's designed to be a boot knife . I was n't looking for that , but I evaluated it anyway . Do n't expect the sheath to clip nicely to your boot . If it does , consider yourself lucky . It does however fit nicely on a belt up to about 1.25 " wide .
5 #### I wish I 'd bought this when I was pregnant . As a nursing top it 's a flattering fit that does n't look like an obvious nursing top .
5 #### Has never failed me , I have always caught something either down a river or lake with this .
5 #### Washes up nicely , fits good , does not show any seams under garments , dries fast , feels good on , it is made very good .
4 #### I have been searching for a new bra since Playtex stopped making the style I have worn for a couple years . After ordering and sending back many brands , styles , etc . , I think I finally found one I like ! This is a light - weight , pretty bra with no padding , which is what I like . Padding makes me too hot . The only reason I did n't give it 5 stars are the straps . They are thin and a " slippery " fabric that has no stretch to them so they do n't stay up on my shoulders well . I like a wider strap that is a little padded or at least has a little stretch to them . If you 're hunting for a light - weight bra , give this a try .
5 #### I chose the mini - Griptilian for it 's compact size & light weight . Not exactly an elegant or fancy knife , but certainly a well made & sturdy knife built with modern materials & a modern one handed design . It has a very sharp quality blade & a good feel in the hand & has an axis lock , which some say is among the strongest in the industry , at any rate it 's a strong lock . The blade can be easily deployed with the thumb stud or utilizing the axis lock the blade can be thrown open & locked in position with just a flick of the wrist & closed with the same technique but reverse wrist action . I 've removed the pocket clip partly because I do n't like the tip - up position , but mainly by removing it the knife is thinner & fits well in the coin pocket of my Wrangler jeans ( without coins of course ) where it is completely hidden & secure & readily accessible . I 'm proud to own this knife & appreciate Mel Pardues design & thank Bechmade for developing & producing this knife . I consider it to be a worthy EDC ( every day carry )
3 #### It fits most bikes , but the problem is trying to pick the kickstand down . Its like wrestling with an elephant . My kids ca n't do it by themselves .
5 #### I agree with the last reviewer - except that I have not yet resolved the tennis elbow issue that I have . Of course , I 've only been using the yellow tube for a few days . :) After nearly a month of doing the wrist - bend - pushing - sideways - with - other - hand exercise that my Orthopedic doctor prescribed for me to do 20x per day , I found it extremely awkward , painful , and not helping at all . I ordered the yellow tube , ( weenie grandma here ! ) , and find it much less painful and easy to use - really stretching the right muscle area . I can feel the same stretch the doc 's exercise did , but without the misery ! Also , there 's an added benefit for those of us who far too easily " forget " to do prescribed exercises - it just sits on my coffee table , and beckons me whenever I walk by or when I 'm watching TV . Thus , I am reminded to do 3 of the stretches at least 4 - 5 times each day . I just ordered the red tube for when I " graduate " to it . Oh , and there 's a very nice booklet that comes with the tube and shows numerous exercises for hand , elbow and even shoulder muscles ! I also greatly appreciate how helpful LB Chiro and Med was both with my pre - order information and with my order itself .
4 #### This is thick enough that you ca n't see through it , but it is very long , so be sure to check the dimensions . I ended up cutting it shorter .
5 #### Do n't squeeze them or they pop open . Just rub / roll them
5 #### When you 're climbing , you need it . Also good if you 're playing pool , I suppose .
4 #### I liked the show but it was to big . Retuned it for a smaller size . Smaller size fit but the color wad not the same . The size 8 was more brown and the new one was more gray .
5 #### It is just what I expected from Buxton . Has a lot of pockets and space in them for everything . Perfect for me .
5 #### Third pair of Keens . I wear them for long walks and hikes . Love them !
2 #### I made the huge mistake of using this product ( same as Scotchgard , etc ) to seal the seams of a white canvas canopy top . Now my top looks like someone urinated all over it because the spray stained it yellow . It states on the can that yellowing may occur but gives no details on what will be affected . I feel they intentionally hide the fact that it will yellow anything white so they can sell more product . Use a good solvent based sealer and never use silicon sealers like this .
5 #### I could n't find this color in any store ! I went online and there they were ! The shoes were a perfect fit and the perfect color !
1 #### Worthless rickety piece of junk . Presently looking for one of those sturdy one piece models seen on most kids bikes .
5 #### I ordered two of these helmets . My head is , umm , oversized . My wife 's head is a more normal size . They fit both of us equally well . Adjusting the size is super easy with the knob on the back . For a helmet it 's pretty comfortable too , very well ventilated .
5 #### This pair of shoes fits just like the real adult sized ones - the are sturdy and well - made . Good buy .
3 #### These shorts did not fit and had to be returned for refund . The quality appeared to be good .
5 #### These are very comfortable sandals . Well built , and fit perfectly . They are n't the cheapest shoes in town , but the quality goes a long way with Keen shoes .
5 #### You 've seen these shoes everywhere ... right ? Well there s a reason for it ! They are SO comfortable and virtually go with ANY outfit ! I love them and wear them everyday ! :) BUY THESE SHOES and you wo n't regret it ( unless YOU order the wrong size ! )
1 #### Just tried this on my son for the first time as Halloween is approaching next weekend . The Superman symbol on front is coming off and has started to peel in the middle . There is no way to fix this . Thankfully Amazon is doing right by this and sending out a replacement immediately . It fits a little snugger than I thought it would based on other reviews . My son is a 2t-3 t clothing and it just fits .
4 #### A huge shirt to cover a multitude of strange things about my ancient frame . I love the busy attachments and odd devices which allow me to festoon myself with glasses and gadgets . Probably a good pallet for food droppings as well ! Altogether a good purchase !
3 #### Had to work on the edge a bit to get it sharp
2 #### Bought this mat last minute before a camping trip . It arrived swiftly , but that was the only good thing . Blew it up before bed and awoke on the ground . The air had seeped out during the night . Blew it up again , same thing happened the 2nd night . Great price , but unfortunately it did n't pass the camping test .
4 #### A decent set of glass on an attractively finished optic for an OK price . But here 's my thoughts , the eye relief is long , very very long , even for a pistol scope . The turrets for adjusting are stiff and their adjusters are made of a soft plastic with less than stellar tactile features making them even more difficult to adjust and leaving them damaged and marred by your finger nail ! Ridiculous . This scope does NOT include rings bare that in mind . The good would be packaging and manual and paperwork are all excellent with this scope . Really nice in fact . The fixed 4 power is nice and simple and more than adequate for longer range typical pistol shots . All in all I 'd say an OK to decent scope for the money .
5 #### As one reviewer said shooting at a plain target is deceptive since an intruder does n't look like that , these targets do . The description is a little misleading in that it says the key points of the body are shown , they are but you really have to look close of them as they are rather faint white outlines . You will have to actually physically check your target or have a real good scope to see what you have hit . Great idea at a great price .
4 #### Really great sleeves , originally bought them for my pokemon cards , but they were a bit too large ... they fit perfectly on my baseball cards though ... so far they have done their job . One thing i do not like is that if you accidentally bend one while taking them out of the bag they come in , it leaves a crease . They re very easily creased while they 're off cards but once they 're on cards that fit , they 're great little protectors .
4 #### My son loves this sign . he put in his den with the rest of his seahawk memorabilia . thank for getting it to me so fast for his birthday .
5 #### Expensive , but a very well made product . Seems like it will last forever . I would start with the weakest version , unless you already have a strong grip .
5 #### Beautiful panty hose ! Not a fan of the extra panel in the back .
5 #### These are what they are : targets made by a company who also produces pregnant women and children targets so cops can shoot innocent unarmed civilians without hesitation .
2 #### Really nice but they did n't say how big they were so I got then as an adult they fit like a kids . I 'm giving them 2 because it should say " kids size " !
3 #### sorry i did not return then faster I really need a smaller size
5 #### I have a number of pairs of Sperry products and all are excellent .
5 #### I 've had this knife now for 5 months and love it . Very good quality , light weight , every day knife .
5 #### Great Shoes , got these for the ol lady and she loves them .
4 #### This get daily use by the wearer . Everybody loves Converse . Granted they are a bit overpriced .
5 #### Fits well , looks slick . Ca n't complain at all . Now I need to buy a new color that wo n't get as dirty as the white kind .
5 #### Great product and great durability . My husband wears them frequently working on the farm .
5 #### hold eight cigarettes perfectly , air tight and dry , durable and low profile , I clip mine to a belt loop to free up pockets
5 #### I bought this to get back into working out . I was struggling to find time getting to the gym and I did n't see a point in investing in an elaborate work out machine or getting multiple weights to lift with . After doing some research I decided to try this out . First off , I like that it is light weight . I have taken this on one trip so far and it fit super easily in my luggage without any extra weight . Second I liked how versatile this band is especially with the door weight . So basically , the product comes with an attachable door anchor which allows you to be able to do a variety of work outs such as pec flies or rotator cuff exercises . I found that the anchor was sturdy and I did n't have much trouble with it . The band itself has seemed pretty sturdy along with the handles . I 've gotten some good use out of this band and have had no troubles with it . I feel that I can get in a decent work out when I ca n't make it to the gym .
5 #### I love the timberlands . They are the shoes I needed to have this year and I 'm glad I bought it from you . Thank you very much for your good deals . Have a great day .
1 #### # 1 . NOT AS ADVERTISED . Would NOT fully open , because of weight and the lead weights were NOT as advertised , shown in picture / advertisement . Weights were / should have been ROUND and NOT barrel shaped , long . I took this out of the bucket and ATTEMPTED to throw it in my back yard , in the grass . Only opened up halfway , the shape of the barrel weights created a mess / entanglement . I have 3 other different length cast nets , have NO problem throwing them and opening up fully . This net is for a body builder / power lifter . NOT the handicapped OR weekend fisherman . SHOULD NOT have to pay for RETURN shipping SINCE company sent WRONG ITEM / NOT ADVERTISED ITEM .
3 #### Preface : I am in the Army and work at Ft Polk and spend 1 - 3 weeks a month living out of the back of a humvee . I cook mostly pork chops and eggs on this stove though occasionally other items . My only complaints about this product is that the fuel control knob is WAY too touchy . Full blast is 1/4 turn . I end up doing 90 % of my cooking on the absolute lowest setting possible and even sometimes that is too high . If the knob had more control I would rate it a 4.5 . Also there is a not shown attachment valve that goes on and off easy enough but there is n't anywhere to store it . You end up putting it between the burners and it sort of slides around . Just a few clips would make storing it way easier . This stove is amazing for boiling water as it gets really high super fast but for any type of heat controlled cooking it 's challenging .
5 #### Fits on most buckets , nice if you do n't have a stool to sit on while cleaning wheels and tires
5 #### Does what it 's supposed to , it catches a spark to let you coax it into a flame . I still LOVE storm - proof matches , but this is a nice backup to have .
5 #### Excellent recoil pad . I did feel a major recoil reduction in my .300WM , shooting 180 grain bullets down range . I even got a better length of pull from adding it to my rifle .
4 #### For the money , it 's a very good buy . I have no trouble finding my hits on targets at 200 yards . The tripod is n't the best in the west , but then again I did n't buy it for the tripod . I would recommend it to a friend . I would give it a 4 , not a 5 because of the eye relief being so touchy . Pete
5 #### Although I 'm flat footed , i will make the sacrifice to wear this shows they are awesome
3 #### For the price they are great ! Except I got one left shoe made in indonesia and one right shoe made in china ... To me this is not much of a problem I just like the style and how they feel . They are my cheap shoes to put in a backpack for extras if I go away for a weekend . They are " Real Converse " just not the same attention to detail maybe .
4 #### These were great . They smell like feet , but they do the job ! I will say that one tablet does not boil and pot of water , though . That is the reason for the 4 star rating . However , I have a stove that uses small sticks and brush to fuel , and when the weather was wet , I used a 1/4 tab and the wet wood and started a great fire with it . I would say for the size , weight , and utility , I am going to keep it on my packing list for a long time .
5 #### these shirts are really nice they are heavy but where my husband works he needs sturdy shirts .. i bought 8 , 6 for work and 2 for good . they are really well made , , i am sure i will be buying more if he needs them but as i said they are really not like the ones you buy at a store well made and will last a long time . buy them if you want a t - shirt that is made to last and they wash up really nice , i weny down a size for my husband because they do run big but are great ! ! ! ! !
4 #### I wish I would have known that the band for this watch has a very reddish tinge to it . It 's almost maroon , not brown . I wanted more of a chocolate brown , since I never wear maroon . I have small wrists , so it fits me great with a couple holes to spare . I bought this to replace my other Timex watch that is too big even on the smallest hole . My old watch also did n't have the QuickDate feature , which this one does . You do n't know how big a difference it makes until you do n't wear it for awhile and suddenly realize it 's a week or 2 off ! It takes a LONG time to manually spin through 24 hours to get the date to change by 1 . It 's SO worth it to get the QuickDate feature ! Also I love the gold color trim and the mother of pearl watch face . It looks very professional and classy without having to wear a really flashy fancy watch . I may end up keeping it and just having my local watch shop at the mall replace the band for a few bucks .
1 #### First of all , this very expensive printing stop watch comes without instructions or an owner 's manual . I went online to get a PDF to tell me how to set up the paper , how to work the stopwatch , etc . When it came time to change the paper , the printer stopped working . It no longer prints out the splits , it only prints out the message " STIT TI " . I looked online to see what this might mean and someone else posted the same problem , but there was no solution . Do n't waste your money !
5 #### I 've worn this style for years - comfortable and sized right . Lightweight and soft ! Do n't hesitate to pay the price - Amazon is cheaper than the company web site !
5 #### Just like I remembered converse to be when I was in highschool 10 + years ago . Same quality and love this new pink sapphire color . Its a nice purple color .
5 #### I 've really been trying out a lot of winter and winter wool socks this year ( last year moved over to wool summer socks , way better wicking and comfort ) . Out of probably 8 varieties , I think these are my favorite winter / normal ( not snowmobiling second layer , but daily ) socks . Very warm , soft , thick / padded . I ordered 2 more pair actually .
5 #### Very comfortable shoes like they were made for my feet . I especially like the cloth lace my last pair had a rawhide tie and it was always coming undone . The only way I could keep the tied was to trim the lace and use a square knot to tie them .
4 #### was pretty easy to put together . Took about 20 minutes with my kids helping . works fine . Not super study but does the job . We just have it on our driveway for them to kick balls into and they drag in on the street to play with neighbors .
5 #### I drive a zamboni for a living , which means I 'm always cold . I needed a sock that would wick the moisture and keep my toes warm . This sock does the job well , I 'd never hesitate to suggest these socks to a co - worker .
5 #### Much better than the small hand - me - down soccer goal my boys were using . I can see their ball striking skills improving ! Good value , everything great still after a few weeks of hard use . I can see me wanting more velcro straps as they wear and age from outdoor exposure , but that is an easy one .
5 #### It 's hard to find shirts that take the abuse of every day wear in the shop . These are made from a thick material and hold up great . The tall sizes are a plus . Try finding shirts in 3X Tall . It 's near impossible . Great fitting shirts .
5 #### use these often , glad i can buy them in bulk for a good price
5 #### Very nice jacket , I bought it for my 5 yo son , he is an avid ATV rider and he wanted a leather jacket like daddy 's ! He so cool now lol
5 #### Purchased these for our teenage daughter . She loves them . For both casual wear and sports .
5 #### Love TheraBand exercise products . Just what I need to exercise with while sitting in a wheelchair or recliner . Helps to loosen up my elbows and shoulders after exercising with TheraBand straps .
5 #### This is the most comfortable shoe and fits my wife foot to a T !
5 #### Very helpful for soccer practice on your own . I like it because my son can practice dribbling without me shagging balls !
5 #### This knife look great , I bought 4 of them , for me and my colleges in military , , it 's great product for combat and other use
5 #### I have 4 of these . They are great to keep your dutch oven lid up out of the dirt , but also increase the space between a brazier and the bottom of a skillet . I also use them as a trivet to set hot pots on to save table tops and with some charcoal briquettes it works as a mini stove ...
5 #### I mounted scope on Ruger Mark II target 22 . I am very happy with scope and the results in the field .
5 #### I can find no fault with these binoculars . The smoothly move from one focus setting to the next and the individual eye adjustment is just icing on the cake . I prefer a fixed power and have no need for a 10x power as the woods a simply to thick and close .
4 #### I bought these for a costume . They were more comfortable than I thought they 'd be . There is no arch support so I plan on adding an insert before I wear them for a long time .
5 #### Ca n't go wrong with Timex . Really nice looking , sleek , and great for every day wear . Big numbers , glow in the dark , and date . Everything a guy needs .
5 #### Alot of compliments will order a few more pairs accidentally ordered a small size
5 #### this product is make my expectations , using everyday in my classroom , price was good , shipping was fast , everything was smooth and fast , thank you for good service ...
5 #### Roomy enough to wear a medium thickness sock - very comfortable , excellent support ; sometimes I wear these all day . Designed with enough room for your toes .
3 #### I bought this at a local Walmart . Should have bought it here for cheaper . It 's too short for my 26 " Huffy mountain bike . It 's on it 's longest setting and the bike leans too much and can easily fall over .
5 #### Saw on youtub and it works . Put this on top of 2inch 8x10 foam I got at Joann 's for 4.99 . Bingo , no more back problem . Gets up out of the hole in bucket seat .
5 #### Having this knife on - hand is a game - changer . It 's perfect for opening envelopes or packages with the knife , cuttings loose threads on clothes , and taking care of other small tasks that do not require a larger multitool .
5 #### Very nice knife just as described excellent price very happy with purchase
4 #### These knee and elbow pad are perfect for kids getting there first skate boards or skates they are well padded and give protection kids need .I am happy with this purchase .
1 #### Ordered the wrong size then made another order for an 8/0 size hook and not 8 but still arrived as exact same
5 #### Ca n't imagine how you could beat these binos for the price . Plenty sharp . Just do n't press on the eyepieces , b / c that throws them out of focus .
5 #### This is a really cool vest . It 's got tons of pockets for all your trinkets & do - dads , is comfortable & looks really good . I will caution you that it has a genorous fit . I like my clothing to fit a little looose , not horribly oversized mind you , & I almost went a size large w/ this vest , but did n't & I am really glad I chose my correct size because it would 've be way to large if I would 've sized up .
5 #### No more junk food ..... heats up the food nice n hot , i wish i had found this years a go , i am a 20 year truck driver and this is a great lunch box .
4 #### They looked good . The only problem was they were too small , but this was my fault . Once the refund i made I will order the correct size . Good price
5 #### We are a Converse family . My daughter loves these all black All Star Cons .
2 #### I can get the same product cheaper and twice as many
4 #### I got this for my 7yr old son for making A / B honor roll . So there are some really good things about this scooter , however I have 2 complaints , the battery charge time is too long , around 12hrs which only give you one ride a day , and the runtime , 45min . This uses Lead Acid batteries , same as in your car . they are stable and work well but are an older battery technology . If you are looking for longer runtimes check out the Razor PowerCore E90 which has a 70min runtime and is about the same price . This scooter has s regular tire front wheel with a scooter wheel in the back , I liked the regular tire of the scooter tire on the E90 , I felt it would be more stable and less bumpy . Over all I , and my son are very happy with it . It is durable and well build , assembly was easy . it is a little heavy , its hard for my son to get in and out of the house . At the rated 45min runtime ( which we have gotten it should give abut 7.5 miles of driving before battery dies . I am going to attempt to convert this to lithium batteries when these batteries die , which should give longer run times and a 2 - 3 hr charge instead of a 12hr charge time .
4 #### This is an excellent product easy to use will get your knives rebeveled pretty fast , it does remove steel fast . Excellent size for folding knives and smaller kitchen knives . You can work your unworkable edges and fix chips fast .
5 #### Makes my legs look and feel great as they massage them with my movements . Great Product and I would order them again .
5 #### Very comfortable , easy to slip on , good support . I ca n't speak to durability yet but they seem very well made . Highly recommended .
5 #### What more can I say . Daughter loved it as a B - day gift . Razor scooters are built well for the $ $ Would buy again .
5 #### I bought it for my office to help out between workouts when I get bogged down .
4 #### Cute costume . I 'm about 5'8 and 140 pounds and I found it to be a bit large . I clipped the excess fabric in the back so it was n't too droopy . I find this very common with Halloween costumes
5 #### When they got here they did n't look real . Good price but did not look authentic .
5 #### Caught this on one of Amazon 's random sales / price reductions for only $ 70 . My wife loves it . A truly professional yoga matt . No issues with slipping in any positions so far .
1 #### Bought five and none of them came with the " included lanyard " . had to go out and buy lanyards . waste of my time
5 #### These are absolutely great . I always get shin splints with running and these have really helped . The first thing in 30 year that have helped . I highly recommend these . I feel like the size runs a bit small so buy one size larger .
5 #### This knife has been on my wishlist for a long time . It feels really solid , no blade play whatsoever . The axis lock is a joy to use . The knife came very sharp and it has held it 's edge very well . Very minor , nitpicky cons : The detent is not as strong as it could be . If you grip the handle and without using the thumbstuds or the axis lock , you can open the knife with a strong ( albeit an excessively strong ) flick . I 've dropped the knife and it has opened on me . Any falling knife is a dangerous knife , but this is the only knife I have that has opened when dropped . The detent is still strong enough for this to be a safe knife and it should n't be a problem . The knife is slightly heavier than I expected . The liners are not milled . These cons are just me trying really hard to find something wrong with this knife . I highly recommend this knife .
3 #### To small and to tight . Watch is for a teenager
5 #### These are great fitting hose . The gusset in the back makes them very comfortable to wear . So nice to find comfortable hosiery with reinforced toes and a waist that does n't bind .
5 #### This watch is just what I was looking for ! I needed something with a small face ( my wrist is small ) with numbers that are easy to read . This Timex has both , and it is an attractive watch as well . I highly recommend it .
5 #### As always , Converse are just a great shoe for everyone . These were a gift for my 8 - year - old , who specifically asked for them for her birthday . My much older two children have worn Converse for years , as I did and my father before me . That is your review , in a nutshell .
5 #### I was apprehensive about purchasing this for my&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Galco - Ankle - Glove - Ankle - Holster - for - S - W - J - Frame-640 - Cent-2 - 1 - 8 - Inch-357 / dp / B003UG7HUM / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Galco Ankle Glove / Ankle Holster for S&W J Frame 640 Cent 2 1/8 - Inch .357</a>&nbsp;thinking it would n't really help or that it would be uncomfortable even if it did help . Boy I was glad I went against my initial feeling and got one anyway . While the Galco holster fits well and is surprisingly comfortable the calf strap really helps stabilize the holster and also ensures it does n't slip down your calf / ankle nearly as easy . While the holster would be okay with a set of boots I would highly recommend one of these if you plan on wearing low cut shoes or going barefoot . Without a calf strap running would be a highly risky proposition . With one I have full confidence of being able to run and climb without the chance of my J frame coming loose . Also very comfortable .
3 #### Not as good as the " off - shore " material . Its not as cooling and does n't dry as fast . Better than cotton and cheaper than the off - shore . If you wan't to look like you have one of those expensive fishing shirts , this will work . Otherwise , buy the expensive ones for better performance . There 's a noticeable difference . Looks the same though .
5 #### I already knew what size I wear in converse , and these fit perfectly . Converse brand , comes in converse box , smells fresh and new , and no problems . Arrived quickly . Love these shoes !
5 #### Works perfect in my truck . Paid a few $ more for made in America
4 #### As advertised ; handles .308 all day with out loosing of the screw .
4 #### This is a great at home mat , but it 's far too heavy to carry around to class . I wish It was also a little softer as it still hurts me knees some during floor work . Honestly I use this as a yoga mat and general workout mat at home . which i think it does a fantastic job of . However it was a HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS to get that initially slippery film off and even now it is still a little slippery for me when I start sweating . Maybe I just have really sweaty hands ... but I ca n't use this for yoga without a yoga mat towel as it 's far too slippery still . as a workout mat it 's great to cushion me during HIIT workouts and overall I enjoy this yoga mat very much . I just would n't use it as anything else but a home yoga mat though due to poor portability . I love my manduka prolite for toting around to class
3 #### Tiny watch and not substantial . Okay for casual use . Also , it came already ticking . I really do n't like that . I have no idea how long the battery has been running . Not a good way to sell watches .
3 #### I wear a large in the shirts . I ordered this in large and it is MASSIVE . Fabric quality is excellent tho .
3 #### Do n't trust the included hook to hold anything securely . Lost my badges three times first day . Last time I actually lost the hook thing too . Keys or other things use the ring directly .. Skip the hook entirely .
4 #### This Mickey Mouse costume was adorable . My only recommendation would be to find a different set of ears or to sew some pipe cleaners to the back of these . The little ears on the top of the bonnet flopped forward and could n't really be seen . Also , the bonnet was a little small for my 3 - year old 's head .
1 #### First the band , and then the watch itself , broke within months of purchase . My old Timexes both lasted 20 years each . Do NOT recommend .
4 #### Really cute costume . It fit my 3 year old barely ( 4 T ) , so I do n't think it could fit up to a size 6 like it specified , but overall it was very cute .
4 #### Easy to see face . Love the light available for reading at night . Nice looking .
3 #### The idea is neat , the watchband is good for a young child , and it seemed to fit my daughter 's wrist ( which is on the small side for a 5 - year - old ) . However , as delivered from Timex the knob would n't pull out for time adjustment , and when I tried just a little too hard , it popped off and wo n't go back on . Whoops . I chalked it up to a lesson learned and bought a different brand for the second go around .
4 #### Fits just like a 2xl tall . Runs exactly one size large .
4 #### I wear a size 7 1/2 or 8 , but based on some of the other reviews that these run small , I ordered the size 8 . Glad I did , they fit great . Not quite as comfy as my old leather Venice sandals , but I think the newer Keens just are n't as comfortable as they used to be , sadly :-(
5 #### Love the shoe Have purchased several psi over the years They are so comfortable and practical
4 #### I LIKE THE LONG TAIL ... THEY WILL BE TOO WARM FOR SUMMER , BUT THEY WILL BE APPRECIATED NEXT WINTER .
1 #### Stopped working after a few months . It 's a lemon , avoid .
4 #### Fantastic mask for the price ! I 've been wanting a stormtrooper helmet for a while and I really wanted to get the voice changer version but just could n't justify the $ $ for something I planned on hanging on the wall . And for that , this is perfect ! Up close it is obviously not an expensive prop replica , but from across the room on the wall or shelf it is quite convincing . It comes in 4 pieces -- front and back shell and two earpieces that snap on to hold it together . I ended up using clear packing tape inside on the seams to hold it together and that works fine . It is a bit hard to see out of if you decide to wear it , but I ca n't imagine the more expensive one to be much better in that way . The lenses do seem a bit cheap looking on this one up close , and that is one consideration between this one and the more expensive version , but like I said from a distance this one looks great . Highly recommend as long as you know it is n't 100 % accurate .
5 #### Everything that could be expected . Strong , well built , simple to use , simple to attatch . An excellent product . Better than other swivels I have used .
5 #### They are Chucks , a classic , nothing further to say . :-)
5 #### I 've been dealing with tennis elbow in my right arm on and off for years . Mostly from whitewater kayaking , drumming and mtn biking . This product seems to be helping . I 've been using it for about a week and my elbow feels much better . I 've tried all the traditional healing methods ... ice , rest , advil for days , steroid shots , stretching , elevation etc . I recently had been dealing with it and seriously tried to rest my arm . I had n't kayaked in 2 months , avoided working out at the gym . I even started brushing my teeth with my left hand and have really been avoiding use of my irritated right arm . Rest was n't helping it , so i figured I 'd try this product and truly think it 's helping . I 'd check out the youtube video to make sure you 're using proper form and resistance . I use it a few times a day and hold the stretch for a few seconds with my arms outstretched in front of me . YMMV
5 #### Amazing and fun , material is not to thin , sewn very well , yarn wig good length ! Love this costume
5 #### second pair , what else do I need to say . I really like these comfortable shoes . When these begin to wear , i 'll buy a third pair .
1 #### The panty he 's ripped apart the first time I tried to put them on . It was a total waist of my money . I will not recommend them to any one !
5 #### Very nice solid works well , Just what i was looking for in a holster .
5 #### we broke a pool cue while on vacation and needed to replace it . this fit the bill perfectly . works great . good feel . good build . for a basic cue , this is it .
3 #### they light easily when opened and frayed . I did a google and found much better alternative , if not lazy and willing to do yourself . cotton ball and chap stick , or alcohol hand cleaner and tissue . convenient but not as so as a pill bottle or plastic resealable freezer bag . if near hypothermia would use for ease of use . good backup .
5 #### I would like to address any level of prospective long range or precision target shooter . If you have set up of the rifle and scope so the scope is perfectly aligned Making shots with the scope reticle at a perfect 90 to your rifle assures that your shots will have the best chance of repeatable accuracy . When I installed this low cost anticant gauge I was surprised how off center I was shooting without it . Very pleased with the product and the price THANK YOU
5 #### These Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Lo Tops are exactly what I wanted and expected . Women 's size 7.5 U.S. fits perfectly . Measures approx . 10.5 inches on the bottom from back of heal to tip of toe ( outside ) . These are the real deal !
5 #### My son is over 6 feet tall and 300 + pounds and it is very hard to get a pair of jeans that fit him properly . Although this is a bit expensive for me as I have to get them shipped to South America , it 's worth it ! Will definitely buy more .
5 #### A well made and good fitting shoe ..... worth every penny .... outperforms all other brands on every way . Go ahead and buy them .
5 #### These are great jeans for the money . Very comfortable and well constructed . I have several pair and will buy again .
4 #### These fins are longer then a lot of the fins giving you more power with each kick . The three vents in each fin make it easier on your legs on the up stoke . This helps you legs not get so tired as fast as fins without them . A couple of hours on the lake and your legs will let you know they like them .
5 #### This ball is the size used by grade school teams . It is an outdoor ball so it may be a little heavier . Make sure you have an air pump and air gauge to get the pressure and size right .
5 #### My husband started to wear these shoes 5 years ago . We live on a huge horse property , and he works 12 hour days . He nevers complains about his feet . These shoes are great !
5 #### Authentic Chuck Taylor shoes . Fit and materials are the same as the other pair I bought 2 years ago .
4 #### I went down a size as most reviewers stated . Unfortunately , although they do fit , they are a bit snug . It has taken me over 10 full days of wearing them , where I do n't feel my toes being pinched in the width anymore . I do have a wide foot and am normally a women 's 9 . I bought an 8 but I feel they are just a bit tight . I wish they had them in an 8 1/2 . I think that would have been perfect !
5 #### I was afraid to buy this color but I really like it . It fit a little big for me but still i will use
5 #### Excellent product . Very well made and made in America to boot . Ca n't go wrong there .
5 #### I thought the costume would be cheezy since it did n't cost that much ... well I was shocked to find this costume was better then the one I got from Halloween City for my granddaughter and paid BIG bucks for ! ! !
5 #### shot everything i aimed it at with no pro did a really great job buy it it will please you .
5 #### these earrings are wonderful . beautifully crafted . i have the ring in sky blue to match . they are dressy but not so much that you ca n't wear them with jeans and a tee shirt if you like . very comfortable to wear and a perfect size .
5 #### Good quality and tough . Actually , I did not use this for my garage door , but used it as a seal for my homemade truck cap . I nailed it to my cap bottom as a water seal and to be gentle on my truck 's paint job .
5 #### Mens Military Hat - Boonie Hat , Sky Blue Camo by Rothco I have used these types of hats for years . These hats are comfortable , foldable , give sun protection and last pretty well . I now use the blue color because black , green or desert camo makes some people nervous in public . Maybe I can pass as a fisherman and not seem too suspicious while I wear a hat that works for me .
1 #### I 've had this flag outside for about a month and its already faded to a pale yellow color . The back side of the flag that does n't get much sun is still orange , but the sun - facing side is very faded . Poor quality on the printing , I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS FLAG . Buy a nicer one .
4 #### A little tight around calves , and I have skinnier than average calves . Otherwise no complaints . Good quality .
4 #### 4 - stars for the quality of the product itself as it is well made and attaches easily to Galco Ankle Lite holster ( for Ruger LCR ) but I 'm having two issues with it . The band that goes around the calf is incredibly irritating at the point where the velcro is sewn . I wonder if anyone else is having this problem ? In addition , unless it 's wrapped tight to the point of uncomfortable I 'm not finding that it 's holding the holster up much higher on the ankle than without it . This is a problem for me as I wear a lot of long maxi dresses and I needed the holster to sit just a bit higher than it sits without it . That said I did n't think it fair to rate any lower as the problems may be unique to me .
4 #### Worked great to reduce noise levels but after time became uncomfortable . I will look for another set that allows for more adjustment over the head . I think these would be great for younger children .
5 #### My daughter ordered them almost 3 years ago and is still wearing them . She loves them .
4 #### I bought this helmet because another review talked about it being very large for large heads . I am a 7 1/2 so thought I 'd get it . It will actually go larger than my head as far as the adjustable cage , but the actual shell of the helmet was the problem for me . I have a longer narrow head . I actually was restricted by the shell for the fit . I had to move the helmet to a less than optimal position but it works .
5 #### Good quality for what I needed . I bought this to lay down on in my office . I 'm sure it would not be great for napping or long term though . I just use it to relax on conference calls , etc ...
5 #### Very nice product . Comfortable to wear post - surgeries , if you can wear colors other than white , also plenty of support for small breasts if you want a comfy , soft t - shirt bra . I only wish the straps were n't so wide , especially at the bottom , but I ca n't fault the product as the picture clearly shows them that way . The problem with it is that it can show under some shirts at the top of the neckline or wherever there is a v - neck or scoop - neck . But , I love this bra for comfy - clothes days .
5 #### I 've used mine daily now for two years , carrying it back and forth to shalas and across several continents and it 's help up perfectly . Tough and comfortable , a good price- meets my standards .
5 #### Received this shoe 2 days ago . My son loves it and it looks good too . He said , it is comfortable . I ordered Reebok Kids ' club fashion sneaker and returned it . We like this Swiss ' more than Reebok 's .
3 #### Fits pretty well , a little long in the body . Decent quality , but should be for a $ 15 t shirt .
4 #### I ordered them a half size bigger than what he is now to give him a little growing room . He 's only worn them once , and he seems to be able to walk in them just fine .
5 #### Love this watch . It 's great for work and sporty . I like the fact it has a full set of numerals and they are large .
4 #### These are great sandals , as I find all Keen products to be ; very comfortable , durable , like the look and no break in period . I usually wear a 7.5 and wear an 8 in the Keen products .
5 #### This scope is extremely sharp through all ranges of the zoom lens which is 22x through 67x . You need a very sturdy tripod to use it , though , because of it 's high magnification . With the PROPER NEUTRAL DENSITY FILTER I watched the transit of Venus on June 5 . The tiny " finder " tube works , but do not use to aim at the sun ! Use the shaddow . Focusing is easy and precise and the magnification allowed the image to fill most of the lens . A 500 mm lens provides only a small image of the moon , but this scope fills the lens and you can make out lots of detail , even seening just the top of mountains that are hidden in deep shaddow . Attach a camera and get super photos . Do n't ever look at the sun direct or ever look through binoculars or telescope at the sun . If you do you wo n't ever see anything again , your eye will be burned to a cinder . !
5 #### We purchased this one and a shorter one , this one was fun out in the yard , but combursome for trick or treating and went with the smaller for that activity . This looked cute sitting by the front door over the holiday .
4 #### Comfortable athletic shoe , good for the gym ( ellipical , tredmill , etc . ) Fit is good , and shoe is really lightweight and comfy .
5 #### Great sock . Wore a thin one as some suggested that the boot I bought was too tight and I got a blister . I changed back to these socks and no problem at all . A must buy if you want to hike pain free .
4 #### Great watch , extremely light , nice sinister metal color . I 'd rate it as more than acceptable for dress wear . My friends are green eyed envious and want one . My only question is why does n't the secondhand click evenly on the numerals on the watch face ? I ca n't believe that one reviewer was upset that the watch crystal was n't as bullet proof as the titanium watch case and band .
2 #### Eye relief is awful , gives you a headache after very much use , that being said it is clear .
3 #### This was my combat knife when was in Iraq , I used it to cut metal straps , wood , sand bags , heavy duty straps , and oil cans . The blade is highly durable , but the serrated part is hard to re - sharpen . The handle did n't go well with combat gloves , and the lanyard hole is too small to fit a chord . Get one with a hard case sheath because you can modify it to fit horizontally accross your belt , without other gear interference . The sheath also comes with an open slot for cutting chord with out taking the blade out .
3 #### This thing is okay and not too expensive , but really it is just some powder pellet tubes with a rubber cap tying them all together . It 's handy , but nothing I could n't have lived without . Now if there was some sort of hard case to hold the whole thing in , it would have been really good . As it is the tubes are easily knocked out of the rubber cap causing the thing to spill its contents in whatever you were carrying it in . Because of this , I 'll be sticking with the hard plastic all in one tubes in the future .
5 #### Long - sleeve tee made with regular tee shirt fabric , not heavy , even though it 's long - sleeved . It washes well . Seams are bound . I think it 's good quality for the price . The large seems seems about right but I would n't call it a generous large . We 'll see how long it lasts .
2 #### I have three pairs of Keens and live in them 9 months of the year in my California climate . I was surprised that I could n't get this pair on -- same size I always wear . I 'm sad because I really wanted this color . I am reluctantly sending back . I HIGHLY endorse Keens , though ! You wo n't find a more comfortable shoe -- once you get it on your feet ! Maybe I just got an off - pair .
5 #### I liked the first one so much that I bought a second one in black & white " city camo " . Fits exactly to size , very well constructed and quality materials . Perfect for hot sunny days outdoors .
5 #### I bought a pair of these back in March . I was kicking myself for spending 80 bucks on a pair of shoes , but holy cow i m sure glad I did . They sure felt wierd 1st time I put em on , and i got a blister or two while I was getting used to them ... now for the 1st time in my adult life I do n't have calluses on my feet , and my feet and back do n't ache anymore at the end of an 11 hour shift at the restaurant . After 5 months of abuse , the treads are barely worn . The insoles are getting a little threadbare , but they ll still be useable for a long time before I have to shell out the 20 bucks for some new ones . They stay on your feet nice , they are n't slippery on a greasy or wet floor , they do n't stink , and they are n't hot . So good .
5 #### Converse delivers again . Great shoes . Fit my little man perfectly .
5 #### Works great . A little awkward smoking to the bone , but otherwise a good product . Also use to hold my moist glove . Word of caution : put it back in your bag when your done with your smoke or you 'll leave on the cart ( done it twice )
3 #### Did not like the fit . I found it to be too stiff and binding and ran small .
4 #### Very nice true to color and fit . A bit pricey The other pair I bought in order was a white pair that 's listed as WHITE . NOT WHITe YELLOwish Cream color ! !
3 #### The shoe is too large . When you do lunges it hurts the heel . The shoe size from a local store is the size I ordered from Amazon however the size or fitting seems to be large
3 #### I bought these to wear under dress pants , but they really wo n't work for that , for me . They 're nice briefs , but they have very , very little support . They really are n't much more than nylon panties , even though they claim to be 16 % spandex . I 'm keeping them , but they are n't what I wanted .
4 #### We purchased this for my daughter 's bicycle . It works very well although it is a bit stiff . We sprayed it with wd40 and that helped however , it was still a little tight . I think it shall loosen up over time but it does work exactly as I wanted it to .
5 #### Love these sneakers . Light weight and comfortable even without socks .
5 #### Bought this for my husband for X - mas . He likes this type tee for the winter and I could not find any at any of the local department stores . He loved it ! ! I have washed it at least 6 times since I purchased it and no fading of color . Highly recommend .
5 #### Loving my new wallet . This size is hard to find and with the extra flip - there is plenty of slots ! Love this color also !
5 #### I put REI inserts inside and can walk for miles ! !
4 #### description said back was lace , it was n't . Ran a bit large , and had hoped to tighten up around lace .
5 #### the optic is very nice i am amazed at how i can see very light rain fall 50 yards away .. as for shooting with this i have not yet .. also i have this mounted on my ar 15 5.56 .. well update this review after i take it shooting . 11/13/12 update i have taken it shooting with my AR 15 and it worked great , but now its on my ruger 10/22 take down and its a perfect fit for that as well . It is also short enough to fit in the ruger bag while attached to the receiver . I wish they made this exact scope in a 2 - 7 magnification .
5 #### Shoe was delivered fast , before expected date . Shoe fits great per shoe size . It 's easier to get on and off then expected for a hightop . Shoe looks great on , and really streamlines profile of foot . Black color has nice deep dark color providing good contrasts to pants . All black blends in ; so do n't expect to see details of the shoe . Great for switching laces colors to match other clothing . Great fashion shoe .
4 #### I am happy with this scope considering the price I paid for it . True , I do n't get the field of view nor the clarity that scopes costing 4 times as much or more , but it works well . At the higher powers , focusing needs a little care , but it is sharper and brighter than my 60 mm scope it replaced . It balances well on the tripod ad is not as heavy as I thought it would be . I do have a couple of complaints , but they are minor . First , the rubber eyepiece falls off easily , I am considering a dot of super glue to hold it on . Secondly , it came with just a soft case whereas some of its competitors provide a ( inexpensive ) hard case . That would have been nice . All in all though , it performs better than I would have expected for the price . It is easily capable of picking out .22 cal holes in the target at 200 m and .30 cal holes at 300 m.
2 #### My son was n't a fan . He says they are stiff and feel like flippers . He has worn them a few times , but always complains when he does . I wish I would have returned them .
5 #### Amazingly comfortable . Perfect for the workplace especially if you 're on your feet all day . Buy them cause you wo n't regret it .
5 #### Good fit and comfy . Not so cushiony so definetly better for training and not for running or aerobics . Bought size 8 which is my usual size .
5 #### Bought this to replace the exact same rest I 've had on my old Bear compound bow for 30 years . It 's simple , easy to install and does the job .
2 #### Though I 'm sure this is a great recoil pad , it does NOT fit a savage 16 weather warrior . Amazon was kind enough to allow me to return it .
5 #### Great sandals . Very comfortable to wear all day . Has arch support that 's just right for my foot . I had ordered another style but returned them because they were too big . These seem to fit just right for my size 8 narrow - medium foot . So glad I tried this pair & style .
5 #### I have been using these for years , keeps your guns rust free
5 #### They were exactly as i was Expected . Timely shipping and reasonably priced .
3 #### As far as brushes go , these make due in the pile i ve collected over the years . no better no worse .
5 #### All converse need breaking in , so these need to be worn a few times before they are comfortable . But these are my third pair of black converse over the years , and I wear them for years until they are so cracked and faded that they have to be retired . I will probably be a lifelong customer , because these are classics .
3 #### Helmuts from brand to brand can be a bit inconsistent in the sizing . This one was a bit on the small side as compared with other brands of catcher 's helmets like Armour , which was rated for the same size range . Had to return .
2 #### The red one was too light for me , but both the blue and green really helped me work out some kinks with golfer 's elbow .
2 #### My young son keeps complaining of something pricking his pinky toe ! I 've looked , but I do n't see anything at all . However , my niece who is older complains of the same thing . I would guess it was a manufacturing problem , only what are the chances that their shoes came out the same batch ? !
5 #### Really nice size frame for little soccer players . At 6x4 , it 's pretty portable and relatively lightweight . That said , when I caught my 6yo and her cousin hanging from the top bar like a pair of monkeys , it still took that 90 - ish pounds of weight without bending or bowing at all . The poles lock together with clip pins , ensuring it stays securely together through play and them pops apart quickly for travel or storage .
5 #### I was tempted to buy the Glock version until I examined the specs and pictures and decided to buy this version at half the price . Same Peltor brand . Same Peltor quality . Same db protection level . Same exact design and materials . Extremely comfortable and easy to fold and unfold for action . Fits easily into my range bag . Buy these on Amazon for about $ 17.00 and you will not be disappointed .
5 #### Great Gift - she loved it ! It 's a nice shoe !
5 #### Easy to put together . Very well made and holds two golf bags plus umbrellas and extra clubs .
5 #### I ca n't find half sizes in stores , so I was pleasantly surprised that these fit so well having never tried them on before .
4 #### Super comfortable . I joined Cross Fit and this is the perfect shoe .
3 #### I ordered a 34DDD in White . I usually wear a 34DD but often find the cup is not quite big enough . The 34DDD was slightly too big . However , the biggest turn off was the four hook closure ... spread across 3 inches of material . I wear a 34 band so felt I was being put into a corset . I did like that the girls were front and center but felt like belting out a rendition of " Vogue " with the conical shape . Not an awful bra . Just not for me .
5 #### Keeps my hands nice and dry . This is one of my favorite chalk
5 #### The color on this photo does not give this shirt justice , it is actually darker , the image itself is washed out in brightness , and it gives off a dark grey culpeper sort of look ( in person ) . Honestly , out of all the shirts of Carhartt I have bought , this is the one I wish I had more of .
3 #### The shorts are ok . Thin fabric , but decent construction . My main purchase goal was price and construction . For a little more then $ 20 bucks its a good buy .
5 #### This is a beautiful mat . Mine is purple . I absolutely love it . However , the first time I used it I was slipping during downward facing dog . So I called Manduka and they suggested a salt scrub . So I went to the store and bought coarse sea salt ( Morton makes it ) and apple cider vinegar . I mixed the vinegar and water 50/50 . I sprinkled the salt on the mat ( outside on the patio ) . Then I sprinkled the vinegar / water mixture on top . I waited a couple of minutes and then got on my knees and scrubbed with a rough sponge . If you want the film to come off you really have to scrub hard and put some muscle into it . I hosed it off . The water does not soak into the mat . I just wiped the beads of water off with my hand . It 's drying in the sun right now and when I went out to try down dog I happily stuck to the mat ! I do n't smell the vinegar either . There 's a bit of salt residue on it which I 'll wipe off . Then I 'll spray it with some minty yoga spray . The only gripe I have is why does n't Manduka do this before they sell it ? I had to go out and spend more money to make this a workable yoga mat .
5 #### Really shiny , feel like quality , and fit great right away . Go with almost anything . Very comfortable , considering they 're leather boots .
5 #### I have lots of pairs of the low top chucks . There great and light on your feet . If you are flat footed you may need some inserts as they have no support . Not a good winter shoe as they have no real insulation but they are comfortable to me . They run big too . My regular mens shoe is an 8.5 and I wear a 7 in these .
5 #### This is a good shirt for construction site work or similar jobs . In my experience they run a little large , but this looseness allows you to move around better while working .
3 #### They were pretty easy to attach , and provide a very solid base for the rack system . The only real problem is the little plastic covers you use when there is no rack attached . I pressed all four into place , but one blew away on the first long drive . The covers need to attach more securely and/or have something to stop them from blowing off . Maybe this should be four stars . Maybe I 'm in a bit of a bad mood thinking about how Subaru replaced a perfectly good rail design with one which is heavier , bulkier ( thus uglier and probably less aerodynamic ) , reduces the spread I can get between crossbars , and requires all new mounting hardware .
5 #### It 's a real Razor ( a little surprised at the low price ) . This will make a nice gift for 100'ish lbs . kids .
5 #### It is difficult to find strong panty hose with good color for African American women for work . This fits the bill for me when I must dress which is 2 - 3 days of the week .
5 #### I was looking for an item that can hold all my earrings in an easy location . In addition I wanted to make sure incase an earring fell out it would nt fall onto a counter and that is what is so great about this product . It encases all my earrings and is visually appealing too . Friends always comment on the display .
2 #### Do n't expect it to last very long . Two weeks before mine would n't hold air anymore . Regret not sending it back . It was around 15 bucks so I guess you get what you pay for .
5 #### Purchased this as a gift . For the hundred range targets , this provides stunning clarity . Easy to use , good size , and seems to be solidly made . He is VERY happy with it !
5 #### We ordered these for my daughter . After looking at all the stores in our area we decided to look on here . She loves them . The price is very comparable and the selection it way better .
5 #### This helped completely eliminating the shake of the ceiling where my heavy bag hangs !
4 #### got 2 pairs wear each one twice a week , work in them straps starting to wear after almost a whole year , comfortable , they ve lasted months and months longer than some jeans i ve worked in . the elastic straps gives more freedom of movemet without getting a wedgie , plan to buy more . butt crack wo n't show !
5 #### This is by far the sturdiest case I have come across . Very well made and the locking clasp does not feel flimsy and it looks like it will hold all I need to keep dry
5 #### I love wrapping in shopping bags as it makes my life so much easier . Finding this great medium size bag allowed me to put more then one item in and when I purchased the matching mets wrapping paper it was a huge hit to all those mets fans that got the gifts ( yes everyone does not love the yankees ) there are lots of Mets fans some are just more silent then others . This size allows you to fit many items I bought a shirt , and some glasses in one bag , the small bag would not hold much unless it is for just one item but the value of this bag is much better and will help you not have to squeeze in the gift .
4 #### A little big . But I like shirts a little loose . Thick heavyweight quality . Will last 10 years easily
5 #### I bought this as a prop ( for a book cover photo&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Musashi - s - Dokkodo - The - Way - of - Walking - Alone - Half - Crazy - Half - Genius - Finding - Modern - Meaning - in - the - Sword - Saint - s - Last - Words / dp/0692563490 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Musashi 's Dokkodo ( The Way of Walking Alone ): Half Crazy , Half Genius - Finding Modern Meaning in the Sword Saint 's Last Words</a > ) . As such , I was more concerned about the style than the quality but was very pleasantly surprised when it arrived in the mail . It 's a very sturdy , nicely designed mask , truly an amazing value for what I paid .
4 #### Well , it is definitely disappointing that this is n't included in the purchase of your Thule product . Thule makes some great stuff and you definitely pay the price for it . Be sure to buy a lock to protect your investment . This lock works perfect ... I gave it 4 stars only because you could probably assemble / make your own makeshift lock at home . I was just too lazy to do that , so I purchased this . This seems like a very secure lock ... I never have to worry about my bike rack while I 'm out on a ride .
3 #### The backboard mounting area is plastic . The instructions explain to hand tighten the nuts only - this does not hold the backboard very well allowing it to flex too much . I had to tighten them more than hand tight . They should redesign this area in oder to better support the backboard . The old Lifetime fiberglass backboard had metal bushings to provide better backboard support than this . There is a 5 year warranty - not sure it will last that long . The backboard appeasers blue in the figures but it is clear and was shipped with a plastic anti scratch sheet . Other than the backboard assembly being all plastic , the backboard is Ok but not worth the $ 80 in my opinion . I would think there are better choices out there .
5 #### Rugged quality and dependable life expectancy make this a great value .
2 #### The pole was too heavy so ended up not using it . I sold it during a yard sale for half the price I bought for . Ended up buying a better pole for $ 100 at a sportsmens . I guess you get what you pay for .
1 #### I bought this about a week ago and when I first received it I was exactly what I wanted . It provided the necessary resistance . However , after a few days of using it ( I think I used it like 3 - 4 times ) , there was hardly any resistance . I wish I could get my money back .
3 #### Its okay for the price , band is fairly elastic , durable , nice colour , not cheap looking , my niece should like it
4 #### This product has a very nice appearance and is elaborated with great materials . Because of that I really recommend to purchase this costume . However , I did not rate this with 5 stars because it has some loose threads like a weak sewing especially on the borders of the sleeves .
5 #### I got this two sizes large so which was intentional . As expected these shrunk a little after the first wash . Now they fit me perfectly . I use these to work out in the Sun 100*F temps . Great for sweat absorption and sun protection . I will def buy this again .
5 #### Bought this for my grandson - to keep at my house for when he visits . Fits perfectly on twin size bed - stays put , even when sleeping or playing inside the tent . He , as well as my nieces and nephew , love the tent .
5 #### My daughter loves converse so the fact that it fit her witout us having to return or try on in the store was a plus - it arrived on time
5 #### Just what we needed . This was for my Boy Scout and he needed a durable , functional mess kit . That 's exactly what we got with this mess kit . Some people have commented about it being too thin but I ca n't imagine what they 're doing with it because this thing is durable . If I ever lose it , I 'll buy this one again .
4 #### I received these scope rings in perfect condition . They were exactly what I thought they would be . They are aesthetically pleasing and I feel certain that they would function reliably for any scope mount of the appropriate dimension . ..... Unfortunately ..... I ordered these to maintain a low center mount on a Weatherby Vanguard ( Howa 1500 .. ) . After examining them I determined that they would place the scope too close to the bolt handle for comfortable use . I had considered this possibility before ordering , but assumed ( I know , I know ... ! ) that there would be sufficient clearance . Because of this clearance issue , I chose to return these rings and reorder something just a little higher . But , these rings ARE good quality , and they DO look good ! If your particular application allows low mounting , or if you have a short 45 or 60 degree bolt lift , then these rings would suit you perfectly . No problems or issues of any kind .... Good workmanship . Nicely finished . ..... Good product .
1 #### is not at all the right fit . too big by 1/4 inch . I had to return them so I do not know why they are too big and I compared the size to my other pairs
2 #### I had to return it . Only the brand that works for me is the Barely There style 2803 , now made by Bali , formerly made by another company .
5 #### This bra is one of the best that I have ever worn . Its seamed underwire cups raise your breasts up and outward properly , where they should be . If you have small or large breasts this bra will help shape you like no other . So many bra companies are using foam cups which can smash your breasts , instead of shaping them . Having seamed cups allows your breasts to point outward instead of shoving them into unnatural shape . The firm yet comfortable underwire also forms your breasts comfortably , preventing sagging and helps with a heavier bust . The bra will help give you a conical youthful figure that many of us need . The material is super smooth against your breasts , and very cool not bulky like some bras . Have yourself measured professionally before purchasing this bra . It will fit you so well , like nothing you have ever worn before . Expect to be very impressed and find out how a well designed bra feels ! ! !
5 #### Get these ! They stay on ! ! Yes they are a pain to get on .. But they stay on ... And are super stylish . Good for playing or dressing you little one up on showing him off !
4 #### Not the best silicone cloth material I have used . ( a bit fuzzy ) Definitely works well to wipe down guns after use in the field .
5 #### Like the pant , this top was absolutely perfect ! Light and warm ! Perfect ! Wore it everywhere when visiting the Bay Area !
4 #### When I took it out of the package , I liked the solid feel and matte black finish of it 's composite body . The fire - starter seems quite secure , with 2 rubber o - rings to keep it dry and tight in the holder , and it takes a firm tug to remove it . The blade is sharp , but a little thinner than I would have liked for a survival knife . The blade opens and closes easily with one hand . It can take a lanyard , the pocket clip is removable ( lanyard and tools not included ) , and the whistle was respectably loud . All - in - all , a decent knife . A note , though ... If you are looking for a neck - knife , the Tool Logic SL1 M model might be more appropriate . This one is too big and heavy to be comfortable .
2 #### Worked the first time we took it camping , but leaked at the seams all over the car on the next trip . I did like the valve on this better than the replacement we purchased though .
4 #### Perfect price for the gun range . If they had a little more adjustment to my head would be a little better in fit . But they are fine and I like them .
5 #### These are great T - shirts and the price is not too bad . They wash out very well .
5 #### Love it ! it came a day before school started . They were brand new , and fit perfectly .
5 #### Returned as I already had the same shoes in my closet . Comfy and breathable shoes that are great in the California Central Valley .
4 #### Excellent clarity and light collection . My only peeve is that it is not rubber armored and offered in black or flat dark earth color . Please Tasco put rubber armor on these scopes . Great reticule . Now I just have to get some mounts and dial it in . It 's a great spotting scope for now and worth the money just for that .
4 #### Nice costume , good quality . Wig takes work to get it to lay correctly .
5 #### The 1/3 carat diamond 14 K white gold necklace I ordered was fantastic price and quality . I will definitely order from SZUL again .
5 #### Great small goal which we are using for hockey in the driveway . Perfect for our 5 year old put our older kids shots will probably dent the posts .
1 #### 2 months later and the watch band is broken ... not fixable ! ! ! Junk
5 #### This is a pretty good boonie . Not too many frays when I got it . The print is true and looks authentic . The hat fits a bit snug for the size . The brim needs to be ironed a bit . The hat came folded up in an envelope .
5 #### It works perfectly for my application , which was a bike rack hitch bolt .
5 #### Fits perfect , I prefer my shirts a size larger so I can wear them over thermals and sweaters in the winter for work .
3 #### I am usually impressed with Mountian House entrees and other freeze dried products , not so with the Mac and cheese . The pasta product was fine . The cheese was very blah tasting . Like bland for toddlers or something . Needs a lot more cheese flavor maybe a liquid cheese squeeze pouch . ? ? ? ?
5 #### I 'll have to go one size up . Wish they had more colors . Fight pretty good though .
5 #### I read several negative reviews before purchasing this wallet , but decided for the money I would give it a try . One thing I did not realize from the product description is there are 2 " pages " ( meaning 4 sides of slots ) of credit card holders and 2 areas to store paper money or receipts . These are great for all the card shaped items I carry ..... car and health insurance , AAA , credit cards , etc . There is a slight plastic smell if you put it next to your nose . All the stitching seems secure . And it still snaps closed easily when full . Very pleased .
2 #### Purchased the shoe in Gunsmoke . No wide sizes so bought medium . Shoe fit allright . Did not enjoy the quality of the leather , it was really tough and hard and just very low quality . Have had Merrell 's before , wore them out , wanted the same thing again . Quality has really gone down . I feel like I should have stockpiled stuff from 10 years ago , it was way better quality for the same price . I do n't recommend this product . At all . Sorry , Merrell . We have to part ways here , I guess . It was good while it lasted .
5 #### Works great and easy to use , better then the salt gun . I bought a bunch of these as stocking stuffers .
5 #### Husband wears 10/10.5 in all other shoes . Converse run big . He wears 9.5 in them . Best shoes ever just have to learn your size .
5 #### My son is REALLY into soccer now , so this ball is played with daily . After a couple of months of use , it 's still going strong . It 's the perfect size for my four - year - old . I put air in it when it first arrived , but it has n't needed a top - off yet .
4 #### Works well , band frayed a little , but has held up under repeated uses by my 10 year old . very comfortable . Her only wish is that it was available in digital . otherwise she really loves it . perfect first watch for a school age child .
5 #### Who has n't had a pair of these yet ? There are a lot more comfortable shoes out there , but these are about simple classic style - someting modern sneakers just do n't have . If you want a step up try leather chucks . Run a half size big depending on the shape of your foot . Peace
5 #### You ca n't beat this price . This much silicone grease will last you forever ( for scuba gear ) .
5 #### This is my second pair of these . I like the relaxed fit , the look and especially the price . Better than Levi 's that cost more than 2x the price
5 #### Does the job , helps to start a fire . But would not rely on this alone . Build the fire properly , an try other uses of fire starter too . This helps when you need tinder in a pinch . but remember to stack an prepare the fire correctly . I received a few extras myself so this is a wonderful deal !
1 #### Upon opening the package today for my grandsons birthday we found the cape to missing the Velcro to wear the cape ! ! Pretty disappointed , for a three year old who is so excited to out this outfit on right then ! I bought this a month ago , so what can I do st this point !
4 #### Very difficult to get on and once they were on were quite narrow and she has a narrow foot to start with . One good thing is she has a tough time getting them off and they do keep her busy trying . Will order short style and see if they fit better
5 #### Great selection ... We 've gone out twice now , I 've probably pitched these balls about five times so that 's 150 times we 've hit in the balls are in great shape I can not tell a single defect
5 #### These canvas shoes are attractive , and cool in hot weather . While I would n't use them as running shoes , necessarily , they certainly are comfortable for everyday wear , with good support and cushioning . We bought them because they 're fabric , and they keep his feet cool when he walks around for hours at outdoor swap meets and car shows . I will buy these again . Love the shoes , and love all the colors !
5 #### Bought these to paint on . You can use a razor blade to open up the middle of the rubber logo , then peel off the rubber to expose the canvas . This is my second pair of Chuck Taylors that I 've given the post - impressionist treatment to . They last almost forever if you take care of them !
5 #### As we all know that this is one of the best gripper around the world . This is a must have item , so this is it .
3 #### The product was shipped quickly , is very attractive , and arrived in good shape . It ia made of a thin plastic . I wish it was more durable .
4 #### I have only had these for a few Months . I have only used them a handful of times and the blue one snapped on me this morning during my workout . Seems like they should last longer than that especially since I ve barely used them . Update : I contacted the company directly because my return window through amazon had closed . I told them my blue band had snapped after not very many uses . They immediately sent me a brand new blue band ! Great customer service .
4 #### Length is as expected but the width is definitely tailored towards the larger crowd . Ordered a large and it fits more like an XL
5 #### I needed base mounts for my mossberg 464 tactical and these are a perfect fit . Weaver 's are inexpensive , but good quality .
5 #### Shoes are excellent quality carving is complete and are super lightweight so I think it 's perfect for small children .
3 #### I guess it 's not all that bad , but I 've had it for little over a year and I mean it does what it 's supposed to ... I assume as I have n't had a spill where I 've bumped my coconut . The styling is flimsy as I 've had to glue the thin plastic cover onto the foam helmet and even lost the side after a rain ride . It 's definitely better than nothing . It should fit most size heads . I would probably spend a few more bucks and get a better one .
4 #### i think a size 10 would have fit me better , even though i am normally a size 11 .
5 #### Good lucking watch for the price . The battery still worked which is awesome . I needed something simple and light weight for work and this is perfect . It does tick pretty loudly but my jobs loud so it 's ok !
5 #### Just what I expected and wanted . I bought these for my daughter and she absolutely loves them . True to size .
5 #### Excellent work tee shirt . These are all I wear to work .
5 #### I bought a bunch for my first grade class . They 're the right length for the kids and they have just the right amount of weight and flex . They 're holding up very well after a couple of months of use .
5 #### I ca n't do a review yet . They were bought for a Christmas present . I will give then a rating for the look .
5 #### So far , real good . I have a large noggin - I get joked about it often . " El grande " ..... This fits me with room to spare . 23 " circumference noggin . ( Lotta brains ! ) . ONE thing users need to know , as I see it in some of the questions and reviews - there are the two side ' button ' sized adjusters . They help you set the side straps under the ear lobe . The little twist bar on the button DOES hold tension if you use it correctly - when the ' bar ' / knob is inline with the strap it is loose . Adjust the button , sliding it up and down or pulling the straps through to it where you want - then move the bar / knob on the button firmly and slowly so the bar / knob is perpendicular to the strap . You should feel a small amount of relief where the bar slips into or nests into the horizontal / perpendicular spot where it will keep the strap tight . It ai n't a $ 40 piece , so do n't expect superman grip , but it will work . See two photos . First , on left is LOCKED position . On the right is the UNlocked / adjustable position . Hope that helps .
4 #### It 's hard for me to get really jazzed up about boots but these come close ! Very nice , sturdy boots !
4 #### Very easy to assemble and it 's very sturdy / secure . Our only complaint is the price of this lock , but as long as the rack is secure I guess it 's the right investment .
5 #### Love these . Club does n't slip out of my hands anymore . Also keeps the club from twisting in your hand .
4 #### Was an out of state gift . Recipient was happy with the item it was a bit larger than expected . Perhaps my error . Otherwise they were very satistified with this item .
5 #### when i did buy it i paid a bit over 8 dollars but they charge me for deliver almost the same price i paid for the product , other than that the product is great and it works real nice , also i was contact buy the seller and they are very concern about costumer service .
5 #### I love the Jungle Mocs to slip on to walk the dog or run errands . I am a size 9 medium and the Jungle Mocs fit perfect . They are very water resistant .
5 #### Nicely made for the price . Was perfectly straight . Perfect option for kids and tight spaces .
4 #### The dress is very nice , however , the headpiece was something to be desired . The horns were thin , spongy material and poor quality . I ordered a different headpiece to go with the outfit and I think they look great together .
5 #### It helps me with my tennis elbow a lot . I would recommend for people who not yet have a problem with their arms yet as it is a good way to exercise those muscles
5 #### Great medium insulation and camo pattern is good . Would buy another pair
5 #### Phenomenal little containers . Exactly what you need , nothing more or less . Simple and no frills . I carry a variety of these containers when I go out backpacking . In these I carry such things as seasonings , cooking oils , soap , whatever .
5 #### I love them ! ! Very comfortable and great for hiking in too
5 #### I wear these shoes out and then order another pair . These are my " go to " shoes for cold weather . They are well made , sturdy , lined , have a thick and slip - proof sole and they are waterproof . I have to walk quite a bit on my daily commute to and from work and these shoes keep my feet warm and dry . The pull tab on the back makes getting these on and off very easy . I got these in a half size bigger so I can wear thick socks during the thick of winter . You ca n't go wrong with these shoes .
5 #### Love this beautiful slip . Glad I heeded reviews and got a size bigger . I normally wear a size 36 slip ( 36D bra ) , but got the 38 in this Shadowline . My bust size is 39 1/2 inches and waist is 33 inches . I 'm 5'3 " and 150 pounds . This slip fits beautifully ! Well made . From having worked in retail , I 've known Shadowline to have quality undergarments for over 20 years . Shipped in time allotted .
5 #### My step son wore these converse at our wedding . They were adorable and he said they were very comfortable . Now they are his favorite shoes ! I personally love the leather comparted to the fabic canvas converse , makes the easy to clean when needed .
1 #### I 've not even had them a month and the bottom is coming off . I 'm not happy !
4 #### These shorts are exactly what I expected . The fit is good and the pockets are great . I am 5'5 " 115 lbs and the drawstring is great for my waist as it is very small but my legs are not .
5 #### Size 5 fits well . Comfortable and cute . I wear street dressy shoes in 5 as well .
5 #### I am 53 . My first pair of Chuck Taylor shoes . I love them !
5 #### Boots are great . Just like what you get at those expensive retail store 's , just not that expensive tag price . Boots are a half size bigger than I expected , but no biggie . I put on an extra pair of ankle socks on top of my regular socks and I 'm good to go , plus keeps my toe 's a bit warmer . Great buy , great price . I recommend this purchase .
5 #### This is a good quality piece and functions well at keeping my lids off the dirt , or keeps the hot lids from burning my table . It is a very simple tool , but you really need something to put the hot lid on . Cast iron holds a lot of heat , you ca n't put that lid just anywhere . I have also used this when I take my dutch ovens and skillets off the fire . They balance nicely while everything cools off . This lid stand also folds nicely into a more compact unit for carrying .
5 #### Love . I have it in three colors . I am 6 months pregnant and will definitely use for nursing after birth . Loooove it ! ! ! !
5 #### Cheap unit but does the job . Took it on vacation in the ocean and kept everything dry . I added a elastic band around the body to hold the latch in place as it seemed like a problem awaiting to happen by an accidental brush up against anything . Did n't want to take the chances so an ounce of security and peace of mind . Still give this a 5 for what it does for the price .
5 #### These jeans fit my son just right and he can wear his boots with them also !
5 #### I 've ordered these before and they work great ! We live in Florida , and it does get cold at night in the winter . Iopen a pack about an hour before I go play tennis in the evening and it stays warm through most of the night .
5 #### These jeans are perfect for my husband who is an over the road truck driver . He is in and out of the truck and trailers and sitting for long periods . Good quality product for an affordable price .
4 #### Beautiful watch . My only problem is that it is too loose on my wrist . Will probably have to have a few pieces taken off . But it 's stunning and I love it .
4 #### I read the reviews about the FlexBar and I wanted to try anything that would make my " tennis elbow " go away . I 'm still not sure if it is Lateral Epicondylitis or just pain from the tricep , itself . Regardless , when I do push ups or any sort of isolated tricep workout , there would be pain in both of my elbows . I started doing the twist method on both of my arms starting with the green band . It does seem to help . I know that you need a couple of months to really have it work , but it really seems to be making it better . I 'll revisit this in a few months and report the progress . Even if you do n't have tennis elbow , you can use the FlexBar for strengthening your forearm . The same twist method builds that muscle , eccentrically . I 've since gone to the blue bar for more resistance . Start with the green or red , though .
5 #### My mom was complaining that she could n't find a good wallet anymore and how she wished she could still find Buxton wallets . I quick search on Amazon and I found it . She is so happy with it .
5 #### this is another item I have been using for years SUPER LOUD , easy to blow well made comes in colors
5 #### Ok ladies , pantyhose , in general , are getting difficult to find anymore . Many women hate them . But , for those of us that do n't have a problem with them , it seems as though there are expensive tights or leggings to choose from , and no more ' pantyhose ' . Let alone NAVY . This is the real deal . I plan on buying more for my ' stash ' . These are the tried and true navy pantyhose and I keep a few pair in my desk for that occasional runner that might happen once every other year . You get what you pay for , and these are a bargain for the quality . Love them ! Thanks for carrying , Amazon . Now , I can save gas money from running all over the place looking for navy hose .
4 #### Purchased these for all the adventures of a Caribbean cruise - rafting in Jamaica , swimming with dolphins and climbing waterfalls . The only thing I did n't like - which is silly but noteworthy - is that my little toe shows through the space between the straps . I wanted all my toes to be covered , and they are , except the little one . It just looks odd , especially with neon orange polish just showing through in just one spot .
5 #### The best everyday shirt for all household and outdoor tasks . Use every day . Replacing shirts that I wore that have paint and grease stains so now I can stop for lunch at fast food and believe that I look presentable ...
5 #### Very comfortable slip on . Stylish with jeans or khakis . Great quality . Keep feet warm .
5 #### Just received and used for only one workout so far . The bands and hardware appear to be good quality . I ordered additional door anchors so I do n't have to keep changing positions . So far happy with product and I will try to post later on after good amount of useage .
3 #### Shoes only lasted 5 - 6 months before tearing on the mesh part
5 #### I wear a 7 in womens . Originally ordered a 6 in Big kids . Was way too big ! Exchanged for a 5 fit nice !
5 #### Heavyweight socks that keep your feet warm and blister - free . This is my third pair of these socks for hiking , very pleased with their performance . Turn insideout to wash , set dryer on medium heat , they will stand up to a lot of hard use .
5 #### Fully covered with thick pure white PVC . Oversize fittings at each end make it easy to attach it to anchors and to anchor line . Flexible enough to allow easy storage .
4 #### A little narrow for a wide shoe , but still wearable . The " brown " is quite red . The pictures hint a bit of that anyways , but it 's much more burgundy than expected ; not oxblood , but still reddish brown . I wish it was a little more true to brown as I have no idea where to get a matching belt for this , but I actually do like the color anyways . Just wish the fit was a bit less tight .
2 #### Returned them because they were too large .......... bought some " Margaritaville " brand boat shoes instead .
1 #### I ordered 34 - 32 relax fit but received rugged wear 34 - 32 . My wife washed them before I realized they were not what I ordered so I ca n't return them . I have a pair of 34 - 32 wrangler relax fit and I love them that is why I ordered another pair . I have also worn 34 - 32 Levi jeans for years so It is not that the new jeans do n't fit because I 've gained weight . The tight fit makes me wander if I received a pair of knock off jeans .
5 #### These pair of shoe is so amazing .Strength , quality , weight is perfect .I never knew these shoes where so wonderful . My daughter love them so much .
5 #### love these shoes . Workout in them 3 - 4 times a week at the gym . I do treadmill , stairmaster , cardio classes and weight lifting . lightweight and versatile shoe .
5 #### These are not my first pair of Chucks . My old pair finally wore through , so I just picked up the identical size of Amazon for a good price .
4 #### The sneakers fit fine , though they are very narrow . Otherwise , they 're great .
5 #### Works great for heating up water . You will need to use a wind block with your esbit stove if boiling water is required . Be prepared . The esbit cubes work great as a backup fire starter . They seem to burn strong for about 8 - 9 minutes . Awesome lightweight alternative to cans of fuel .
4 #### The converse where in good shape , but the box was damaged . It was a gift for mi little cousin so I was a bit disappointed ...
3 #### They are ok but not made for someone who has a butt . I understand they are supposed to be somewhat tight but this is too tight and I 'm definitely within the range this size fits .
5 #### Great product ! ! ! ! My grandson has not stopped hitting me with them ! ! ! !
5 #### Great panties for a man . The fit is superb with gentle support and they keep all your male parts inside where they belong . Also , they do not pinch and mash things as some others do . They come in a wide range of beautifulI colors . I 'd recommend giving them a try , especially if you are new to wearing women 's panties .
5 #### Now these are the perfect fit shorts . For any size woman . You will like the look and feel of them .
3 #### So short that my 4X32 scope hits the barrel . NOT medium . Short , low , minimal clearance . I 'm gon na use them for mounting a flashlight or something .
3 #### as a family we have mixed feelings about these . One of my children and I like these but other child who is a serious swimmer hates them . I think it has to do with personal preference and face shape . over all they work fine for 2/3 of us .
5 #### I order a new pair of these every year and delegate my previous year 's pair to chore shoes . These shoes are fantastic . This year I accidentally ordered the " waterproof " moc 's that look just like this and had to return them they were way too narrow in the same size ( 10 M ) as these Jungle moc 's , so be careful which ones you order ! I have wide feet that ache almost all of the time and these shoes are my only relief .
5 #### it 's a brand new watch . both the box and watch are in good condition . The steeles strap is so cool , just for summer .
2 #### black gloves have no " sure - grip " rubber on the palm at all . totally slick polyester / lycra . btw , also runs big if you have small hands and wanted a stretch fit ...
5 #### How can you not love Chuck Taylors ? Old school look , with modern comfort .
4 #### Not bad for the price . Needed these for an astronomy class .
5 #### I was very pleased with the order and the shipping was as expected . Would def recommend to friends . thank you
4 #### I 've been wanting a pair of timberlands for awhile and so glad I happen upon these for the cheap price . I wear a size 9 in women 's and wished I had ordered the size 6 m instead of the 6w . The 6w was a little too roomy . Good overall
4 #### Husband had to buy one size up . Other than that , great work shorts for him .
5 #### Comfortable . I 've only worn it on one occasion so far so feel free to disregard this review .
4 #### These are very cute and stylish but not very comfortable . I 'm normally an 8 and ordered 7.5 and they fit . My feet are a bit wide so I think its taken me a bit to break them in . Overall I 'm happy with them and a bit cheaper than in - stores .
3 #### I received this shirt in good condition and was shipped to me nice and fast . For the price its ok but I expected the " eagle , globe and anchor " USMC Logo to be a bit nicer quality . The text on rear of shirt is fine my only complaint is regarding the USMC emblem on the front breast , its just " ok " kind of looks like a cheap silk screen rendering . The photo on the listing is accurate but because its so small it can lead you to believe that there is more detail than actually . overall i m satisfied I will make sure I look at the pictures better before I buy next time . Semper Fi
5 #### These sneakers give me the motivation to workout because they feel so good and are great for any training
5 #### This was the best price for this type of shoes that I could find . Any I found that were cheaper were very low quality . These are great and are holding up well .
5 #### Great product ! I am going through home physical therapy for my shoulder and was using latex bands that kept ripping . I bought the Black Mountain Resistance Bands and what a difference ! I can really feel the workout on my shoulder . The different degrees of strenght are great for increasing reistence as you get stronger . I 'm sure these are also great for general exercise and strenghening . They are built with high quality parts .
3 #### Fit is fine , but not much cushioning in the footbed . The first time wearing them on a long walk I developed a blister on the bottom of my foot .
4 #### So far so good ; went with the large size for 9.5 men size . Gives about an extra inch from my heel to the end of the zori . Tip of big toe is flush w/ the top of the zori .
5 #### The jeans are good . I 've ordered the same model & size in 3 colours - blue , light blue and black . Black ones arrived 1,5 inch shorter in comparison with others ( on the label same size was indicated ) . Nevertheless I 've resold them to my neighbour and ordered longer one . The only drawback is the wrangler stripe above rear pocket - it teared off after third insertion of belt . The quality is very nice . Will buy more , definitely .
5 #### I have been wearing hi top chucks my whole life . They never disappoint and they last a long time before having blowouts , rips and tears , etc . my last pair lasted 7 years wearing them at least 4 times a week . I 'm sure these will wear the same ! I 'm a size 7 and they always fit perfectly . Great shoes ! Worth the price !
5 #### I was suffering from tennis elbow badly enough that I moved my mouse to my off hand . Looked up remedies online and this came up , and for 20 bucks seemed like it was worth a punt . Completely resolved the pain in about 3 weeks , and I use it regularly . The red flex bar is pretty easy to use and becomes a little easy after you 've built up some grip strength - I 'm currently using the green bar as a preventative and will be graduating to the blue bar when that becomes too easy . I have been doing all 4 twists ( right / left , in / out ) as a preventative to make sure I do n't develop anything in the future .
5 #### I 'm very happy with this mattress . It is cheap and provides way more cushioning than my backpacking sleeping pads . It 's too heavy and bulky for long backpacking trips , but for short hikes I find it worth the weight . I am getting older and sleeping on the ground without pillows is not as fun as it used to be . I also use it for car camping trips . It does n't take up too much of my side of a two - person tent , but provides enough width and length for me to sleep comfortably ( I 'm 5'7 '' ) . I also like the fabric on top -- it keeps my sleeping bag from sliding all over the place . I 've taken it on about six trips this year and it still holds air and is comfortable . Last weekend I took it on a three night trip and on the third night I had to add a few puffs of air to top it off , but otherwise it worked great .
5 #### Recently I got my second one as I had " used up " the first one after several years . I keep it in my bathroom where it is handy for giving my jewelry a quick polish before I put it on . Silver loses it 's luster quickly and I do n't want the mess of using the jar of silver polish and rags every time I wanted to wear a piece of silver jewelry , but this cloth takes just a few seconds to use and leaves jewelry sparkling .
4 #### EasySeat covers the open end of most any 5 gallon bucket , giving you a comfortable seat . MUCH better than turning the bucket upside down , or sitting over the open end . For standing on , the EasySeat seemed a bit flexible with a big guy on it . The top and bottom do pop apart , so I added glue and construction adhesive to firm up the plastic crossbars within the EasySeat . The other improvement I could see would be weatherstripping or an F shaped flange , to create a tight seal to the bucket . As is , the EasySeat falls off if the bucket tips over , and there is nothing close to a watertight seal . I could also imagine a couple of stretchy plastic strips , that hook over the plastic flanges near the top of nearly all 5 gallon buckets . That would n't help the EasySeat to be weather resistant , but it would at least keep things from falling out if the bucket tips over . Still , the EasySeat is a great way to make your spare 5 gallon buckets a lot more useful . You 'll be amazed how often the EasySeat keeps you from going back for a stool or a short ladder ; so long as you have buckets handy , or use them for tool storage .
5 #### Heavy built like a tank Large aperature is a great idea . Casts as far as a spincast possibly can . The spool oscillates reducing line digs . Works reasonably well with select low # braid . Carrying spincast on a setup used to make me feel like a juvenille .. now I feel confident on my trouble - free spincaster . Tips : Best to cast with the handle in oscillation position where maximum exposure of the spool occurs for a longer cast . Dremel polish all areas where line contacts unit .. aperature eyelet etc . Models : GC120 is pretty large sits high off the rod and requires a large hand to comfortably depress the thumb button .. probably not for the ladies but if your hand can handle it , the largest model has the largest spool capacity . GC80 is the smallest model and in my opinion is only marginally lighter and only a tad smaller than GC100 and only good for short - distance casting .. its spool is lax on capacity . I 'd go with the GC100 for a more versatile setup if GC120 is too large for comfort ..
5 #### keeps dust off and just plan helps keep your guns looking new i use mine in safe then usually just threw right into travel case keeps fingerprints to minu
5 #### It is a bit harder for me to see ( my eyesight not the best ) compared to white face watches but it is a nice addition and I like the look of it . Having Indiglo light is a must for me at night ( I 'm very short sighted and no way can I see clocks ! Not unless I shove my face 5 " from the clock ) . This one works just fine for me . My only complaint is the watch band . I 've actually had this watch for over a year . The watch band looks great on the outside but it is decaying ( for lack of a better word ) next to the skin . I am not one who sweats a lot but it seems that might be what causes it . It gets " mushy " and smells funky . No worries , I just have to figure out proper size and get a new band .
5 #### So far , this is the best soccer ball I 've come across when it comes to a combination of weight ( just right ) , handling ( much better than cheaper soccer balls sold at WalMart ) and price ( a good bit lower than Nike or Adidas balls ) . Durability is average and on par for the price . Will last you through a soccer season , but probably not through two seasons .
5 #### I must say I was a little skeptical of the other reviews I read on this product , but I am amazed at the toughness of this model . Fantastic .
2 #### The tights ripped by the middle of the first day I was wearing them . They were also a little darker in color than the picture and description leads you to believe .
3 #### It was hard to tell what size person this would fit in the description . Sent back as were for little kids , not a 12 yr old .
5 #### I bought this for my watches , watch tools and extra straps . It 's the perfect size . I will never take advantage of the capabilities of this case but it is nice to have , in case of a zombie apocalypse where I still care about fashionable timepieces .
5 #### Although the Top - Sider shoe fit somewhat large , I would still recomend them to everyone . I had my reservations about the shoes at first . But after trying them out , I habe to admit they are quite comfortable . I try to wear themnas often as I can with my work clothes .
5 #### Had an older white Lifetime backboard from 10 years ago and the sun baked it . The mounting brackets are still good so I purchased this combo and all the holes lined up perfect from 10 years ago . If you are needing a backboard only and it is a Liftime this is the way to go .
5 #### Perfect length for tying the ' yaks down to the roof racks on the family truckster . Quality and function is tops for the price .
5 #### Like others , I bought these rings to go with a Simmons 22 Mag scope to mount on a Ruger 10/22 standard carbine . I used the standard Ruger supplied scope mount and these rings are great with the scope . The dovetail rings supplied with the Simmons scope are not very sturdy and mount the scope too high for my use . These rings mount the scope very low to the bore and you must fold the rear sight on the 10/22 to clear the scope bell . I still need to go to the range to zero the scope but I anticipate good results .
4 #### This is AWESOME COSTUME the headpiece is practically un - useable as horns . The spikes I am going to try and make them work . I bought an XL and its very ample and an 18 - 20 size person could use it . It has a small Velcro closing head entry but it helps to cover up her neck to make it look for like our images of Maleficent . I got another headpiece on Amazon . Well worth its costume even though totally cost was almost $ 50 but to me well worth it .
2 #### I liked this watch , but it was too big , stretched on the molded container it was in , for my wrist . I was sorry to have to return it .
3 #### I do n't know because , I did not open the bag so I do n't know what they look like , but thank you .
5 #### I bought a cheaper ball at a chain " super mart " and i got what i paid for . My physical therapist recommended i get thera - band brand and make sure to match your height and weight to the ball size . Outstanding product highly recommend it .
4 #### These are nice boots and seem to be holding up well with my 7 year old who is really really rough on shoes . The only gripe that I have with them is that I had to purchase shoelaces for them . These are on the shorter side in length , come untied easily and make it harder for kids who are " learning to tie their shoes " . Longer laces worked better .
5 #### Great vice ! This was my first rotating fly vice and it is great . Some people said they could n't get the jaws to hold the fly tightly I have n't had any such problem . As soon as I read the instructions it was simple and easy to use . I 've tied over 200 flies on this vice and have had zero problems . It works good hooks size 4 down to size 22 .
5 #### Excellent . Put it in 3 months ago , still running perfect . As long as you have the correct model part number for your boat , you 're good to go .
3 #### I just received this today and would highly recommend the Huntsman Swiss Army Knife . It is exactly what I 've been looking for with the saw included . However , the supposedly free leather pouch included ( $ 35 w / pouch but $ 30 for knife alone , meh ) does n't measure up to what I would expect from Victorinox . The knife fits inside , but it is quite the tight fit . Hopefully , it will loosen up with continued use , but the sides are only elastic ( which will also loosen up but in a bad way ) and the knife is n't completely encased , leaving it exposed to the elements . I also dislike that the belt clip is placed low on the pouch , making it difficult to snap closed . I should have paid closer attention to the other less than stallar reviews posted here ... Buy the knife alone for less and save the extra money for a pouch somewhere else .
5 #### This is my third indeglo . The batteries last forever , and I use the gentle glow to light my way on those occasional night trips to the facilities . The watch is designed with a slightly more current and attractive face , the calendar numbers are larger and more usable . The only problem that I have in the past with earlier models of this watch has been that good replacement batteries are very , very hard to find . The good news is that the watch comes with a battery that really does last about 10 years . You will love this watch . I received my in 2 days through Amazon 's prime program . Faster than I could have made time to go shopping .
2 #### This is advertised as a size 13 shoe , but it is too short . It cramps my toes , and causes my toenails to curl .
5 #### Great to play with at night . Fun for all . Unique gift
5 #### Rugged construction , folds up well , firm filling , thick and all around great . Definitely worth the price if you are looking for a good quality mat which can take a lot of use and impact .
5 #### Product came as described and works well at home using the door attachment . I researched a few brands before buying and this was the best for the $ $ !
5 #### The shoes fit great but that 's because I read reviews & knew what to order . I normally wear a 7.5 in women 's but since these are men 's , I ordered the 5 . They are a slight bit too big , I probably could have ordered the size 4.5 , but I was scared they would be too tight . In the future I will probably still order the 5 .
5 #### BEWARE OF THE HUGE SIZE DESCREPENCY IN THESE SHOES ! ! ! ! I bought these to replace a very similar style of Keen sandals that I bought about 4 years ago . The old ones are a size 10 . I thought I wanted the new ones very slightly longer so I first ordered size 10 1/2 . I COULD NOT GET MY FOOT IN THEM ! Thanks to Amazon 's return policy I exchanged them for size 11 1/2 ! ! ! ! These fit great and are EXACTLY the same length as my size 10 's ! ! Why does a fine company like Keen not maintain more consistency in their products ? ? I love the shoes but why must they make it so difficult to get the correct size ?
5 #### I wear these boots when I ride my motorcycle in all sorts of weather . These boots take the punishment and keep going . Yes , they get beat up looking but they stay together and continue to offer protection and comfort . They 're hot in the summer but lace - up boots are hot . Good feel of stability from the lace - up portion too . I 've worn these as work boots too ( the steel toe variety ) when I worked in the chemical plants and they were great for being on your feet all day . Highly recommend .
5 #### Usually I get kids sizes because I have tiny feet . I get 2.5 . Usually I 'm a 3 in men 's and a 4 in women 's .
4 #### Cost and quality are great ( in my opinion ) as you get more for your buck compared to other products . It would be great if the bottle had markings on the side so you could see how much you 're spraying . Followed someone 's suggestion and measured the bottle and kinda market the ounces with a sharpie . This is done because most treadmill instructions seem to suggest to use about an ounce . So , how do we know we 're applying what 's indicated , not too much or not enough . Next improvement , its difficult to spray under the belt if you do n't have enough room around which requires the treadmill to be moved . This could be fixed with an attachment to the spray - head ( like the WD40 or the canned air )
5 #### Purchased this as a part of a birthday gift for my husband who is newly into Fly fishing . He was thrilled !
5 #### I love these stalkings . They fit as expected . However , they are very delicate I do treat them carefully .
5 #### I have used just about all the brands out there over the years and on many typez of rackets . This grip tape is as good as any others I have tried or better . Truthfully I find several of them to be close to identical when doing side by side comparing . I 'm actually using this on my compound hunting bow grip and not a tennis racket this time . I have found over the years that this stuff makes for a great grip on many different things . One friend I have laughed when I told him I put tennis racket grip tape on my bow . Then he picked it up and his whole perspective about it changed instantly . Guess who is now ordering same stuff for his bow ! LoL.
4 #### I like it . I filled mine with sand . The bottom has scraped up my bamboo floors , but I 'll use a floor covering in the future .
3 #### I have very wide feet and could n't get my foot in - it would have been great if the top had been a strap
5 #### Gave two other ( expensive ) watches to my girlfriend for Christmas .. and she chose this one out of practicality .. IT GLOWS .. water proof enough and the band is comfortable .
5 #### Thanks so much for the item , i m so happy with it and hope to get more item later . appreciate it .
5 #### We really hope we do n't need to use this ....... however it looks as if it will work well if needed . Nice and compact and fits into our kayak as part of our safety equipment .
5 #### This lure was an excellent pike bait when fishing in the UP of Michigan . Caught several pike on this lure and the paint held up great . Very sharp hooks , excellent action
5 #### My Chuck Taylors arrived as expected . I have n't worn these since I was in high school , but was in need of a cute , casual athletic shoe for not working out . I normally wear a 6 or 6.5 , but knowing that Chucks run big , I got a 6 , and they are just right . They arrived quickly , and came with extra laces . The hightops are super cute with shorts or jeans . You really ca n't go wrong with a classic like this .
5 #### I only wear chucks and these are great . Fit perfect true to size
5 #### Bought this jacket to replace my Duck lined jacket . Excellent warmth and waterproof , very stiff though which requires washing to relieve stiffness . Other then that very comfortable and warm , I 'm 6'5 220 # bought XLT and the fit is just a little oversized for an extra layer underneath .
5 #### This shipped very fast and was worth the money . It cleans my boot of mud and snow . I live in the mountains of New Mexico . I recommend it to everyone .
5 #### These have quickly become my husbands favorite t shirts to work in . Long enough to tuck into blue jeans and not come out when bending over and large enough thru the chest to allow room for stretching without getting tight . shrinks alittle when washed .
3 #### Well , the first thing that turned me off was Amazon shipped this to me in a cardboard box without the original packaging . I 'm assuming they did this to save money on a bigger box . The second issue is , in my opinion , his ball feels like a size 6 instead of the official size 7 . It 's slightly smaller than my old basketball , but my old ball is close to 10 years old . Maybe it expanded a little ? I do n't know . Other than that , the ball is great . If the above issues were resolved I 'd give this ball 5 stars . You ca n't find a better basketball for under $ 20 . Good tacky feel , solid indoor basketball . Reminds me of Spaldings old Grip Control ball . As soon as I make sure this ball is actually 29.5 " I will come back and give it 5 stars .
5 #### Good for keeping sharp , and keeping pesky critters out of the organic garden . Regained youthful memories and skills great pass time .
5 #### i love this my boy is crazy about this team .
5 #### This recoil pad works great . I have them on a number of defferent caliber rifles and shotguns . The only problem with them is they do n't last more then a couple years and they get spongy .
4 #### Too dark for " barely there " . I 'm 5'1 , 120 pounds , A - B fits perfect . Wore twice so far , no complains except for the color
5 #### I 'm very satisfied with this order ! Great shoes and got here in 2 days like it said they would . Would recommend to others !
5 #### Got a chance to use this last weekend . Works great . Just add 2 D batteries and u are in business . This thing can easily hold 1 - 3 dozen bait depending on size of course . I bought a dozen small bass minnows and I could have held 3 dozen of the tiny ones they gave me lol . I probably would n't put more than a dozen of the size bait I take paylakin . Aerator works great and it kept my bait decently cool also . Not too heavy either . It 's does leak a little from the top if u slop it around or in the car but I did n't expect an air tight seal on a bait cooler .. good quality from frabill as usual
5 #### You have to order a half size up , it 's a given with KEEN , but what an amazing shoe ... so comfy , so durable ... so cute too ! Best price is here on Amazon .
5 #### I 've always loved Converse . Love the color , the fit , look and feel .
5 #### Do n't waste your time or stake your life on a cheap compass or a GPS that could become worthless . This is a solid piece you can rely on that will be with you for many years . Wish I still had mine from 30 years ago but this is as close to that one as I could get without paying for the expensive Tritium version . Do n't waste your money on that one ! !
5 #### I bought this item to replace the smooth wood grips on my RIA 1911 - A1 CS ( Officers Model ) . These grips are a huge improvement , both functionally and cosmetically . The finger grooves and pebbled texture give you a positive grip on the firearm and less perceived recoil .
5 #### I need 700 of these- I love them . So comfy and sleek .
4 #### I love the look and feel of these panty hose but the light weight aspect which makes them look and feels so good also tends to cause pulls and little holes in the material especially at the feet . I rarely need to wear panty hose though . It is hard to find a petite sizing and that gives me a better fit .
3 #### Like the way they play but do not last long enough , would be a great product if they made them more durable . However I do have a higher than average swing speed ( driver approx 120 mph ) and hit the ball quite hard so for players with slower swing speeds I would definitely try these out . Its nice to know you are getting the height the same every time .
5 #### Probably the best fitting and most comfortable pocket T I have ever owned . It retained shape and size after 3 washing 's so far .
5 #### Like most everyone else , I have purchased hundreds of t - shirts from different manufacturers over the years made from a variety of materials and cotton blends . In a " big " size , especially , they are often cut and designed oddly ... the sleeves too short ... the neck too large and the fit unflattering . Then when you wash them , the " odd " features are magnified . Try to fold them after washing and none of the seems line up . They are often twisted and distorted and some just turn into rags . The design , style , fit and durability of the Carhartt shirt is unequaled . They fit well , look good and launder well . The neckline is right and the sleeves are to the elbow . They may cost a little more but they are worth every penny . You wo n't be disappointed .
5 #### LIked the color and style of sandal . Previous pair purchased several years ago fit well , but these fit better .
5 #### These are the only hooks I use when fishing for big channel cats . I use the 6/0 size in red usually , but color is n't critical . Where we go , the average size catfish we catch is 33 - 34 " ( 15 # or so ) , with many in the 20 - 25 # class , and the occasional 30 # . On a normal evening ' outing ' ( 7pm-1am ) , we 'll each catch about 10 cats . None of these hooks has ever broken , and the point stays sharp and ' sets ' in the corner of the cat 's mouth almost every time ( occasionally it sets in the lower lip ) . Once this hook is set , no WAY is that cat throwing the hook . I use this hook on a 15 " snell tied to a swivel , with a bead and a 3 oz pyramid sinker above the swivel ( bead keeps the eye of the sinker from going over the swivel ) . I have caught literally hundreds of cats on this hook . I used to use 5/0 Gammy " J " octopus hooks , but switched to circle hooks about 4 years ago and I do n't think I 'll ever go back .
4 #### You just ca nt beat Kastmaster ! No huge fish yet but the quality is great .
2 #### Very thin and tore easily . I purchased 2 pairs and have not even tried the 2nd pair as I was disappointed with the fit of the first pair .
5 #### That 's what happens in winter . Get one of these . Put it on carpet . This is the bargain of the year for kids indoor exercise toys . It 's incredible for the price ( and FREE SHIPPING ) . That said , it IS the same industrial quality as other items of its ilk , so just be patient . If there are no threads on one leg , just pop off the end cap - they 'll be there . Some people have found assembly frustrating , but just follow the instructions given by at least two reviewers here . To those , I would add a warning : one of the bolted male ends may go too far into the socket to start the bolt in the threads . Just find a metal washer ( they 're either under the sink , in a drawer or in the garage ) slightly less than the socket pipe 's inside diameter and use it as a shim before you pop the vertical side down into bolting position . Your kid can help by sitting or lying on the insert side ( in case you do n't have 3 arms ) while you use an adjustable wrench ( not the tin thingie that comes with it ) to bolt up . BTY , the plastic oops protector must be fitted before you thread the legs on . And no jumping FROM the back of the couch . TO the couch is ok .
3 #### Would not adjust for 45 - 70 but trying it on .22 now will update
5 #### Love these shoes ! Perfect for walking around on campus or for a day of shopping . Got them in white , so you have to be a little careful of where you go so they do n't get dirty too quickly , but the white color looks great and matches with many things .
1 #### Too small . Ticks too loud . Ugly band . Did n't expect much for the price , but even still very disappointed . Feels and looks even cheaper than it is . Have multiple Ironman watches and love them all . I 'll stick with those .
5 #### This has been a tremendous help with my tennis elbow . It 's also helped with strengthening my grip . I use it daily . Watch the videos on the internet for tips and instructions or listen to your physical therapist .
5 #### I own several pairs of low top converse , these fit as expected . Ordered them in charcoal , love the color . Goes with just about everything .
5 #### I bought this as a gift for a friend who enjoys fishing . They liked it . Seems like a great value for the price
5 #### Very well made , durable , and stand up to multiple day wear while backpacking . Just dry them out each night and they do n't even stink ! Ca n't believe it took me so long to realize how much of a difference SmartWool sox make to my comfort and ability to walk much longer without fatigue . Love 'em !
5 #### If you want a real challenge , stick with the CoC Hand Grippers . Like how they also help toughen - up the hands . Do n't forget an Egg ( green one is great ) and Expansion Bands .
5 #### This is a good for bag work . Of course it will tip over if a man TRIES and knock it over . But for bag work this is really nice .
5 #### Great shoes , very comfortable . My wife is happy , so you want the same shoe in another color . Excelent quality . Thanks .
5 #### Great shoes . I ordered size 2 for my 8 year old son and he loves them . Very cute and comfy and perfect for snow .
4 #### Great watch as well , light and bright night setting . The only issue i have with this watch is it is extremely loud ticking . You can hear it in a desk drawer . I got this watch for when I am camping and at the range so the ticking is only annoying when I am in a tent trying to sleep . I am now used to it but just be warned .
5 #### It 's just what I wanted and it arrived on time .
5 #### Sturdy and easily inflated with manual foot pump , I used Intex bellows foot pump - would take too much air to blow up yourself unless you are much younger than I am . Used it to sleep on for 3 weeks daily and it saved my back . Put a quilt or blanket over it for comfort , needs something on the plastic or I do n't think it would be too comfortable to sleep on . Not really backpack practical but if you are car or backyard camping should be fine . Did the job and is reasonably priced .
1 #### Came in the wrong damn colo AGAIN . Third time trying still got the wrong freaking color . At least it 's the right size I guess this time ....
5 #### Was looking for a good looking pair of black boots . At first I dismissed these because I was expecting to pay much more . Eventually I returned to these and am glad I did . They are high quality and look great . A word on sizing ... many people find that a properly fitting western boot is 1/2 size smaller than what is right for casual footwear . Same here . In addition , with these I had to go from my typical D width to E. All my other footwear is D , including western boots .
1 #### Crap , they fell apart in less than a month just wearing them to school . Awful product for the price , cheaply made . Quite annoying .
5 #### Watch was a big hit with my 4 year old cousin for her birthday . Band was able to adjust well to her tiny wrist , and it seemed comfortable . She loved the way it glowed in the dark . The flowers are adorable and the face is great . recommended .
1 #### My skin is not normally sensitive to anything , but whatever the metal is on the inside of the band ( nickel ? ) caused little red bumps within 12 hours . Took days for it to go away . I liked the style and fit of the watch , so had tossed the box before i put it on the next morning ( dumb ) . So have n't returned it .
2 #### I need to return this product for a smaller size I did not realize these are sold in unisex sizes
5 #### Perfect for single user overnight outings and the small dry storage area in the lid comes in very handy .
5 #### I bought several of these so that my family can all have hearing protection when we go shooting . Yes they are plain jane muffs . But , yes they work and have as good a decible rating as many much more expensive muffs out there . When you 're on a budget these are the ticket
5 #### If you ca n't or need to move water around and do n't want to deal with the risk of sloshing water out of an open covered bucket this is the way to go , with a name like coleman standing behind it you ca n't go wrong
4 #### Loved that I got a utensil set with it . although I did n't realize that from the product descrip0tion
4 #### My girl loves this wathc ! It is adjustable and it lights up and everything . I will definitely recommend this to my friends !
3 #### Since moving their production to China , Keen quality has deteriorated . My sandals were not glued well ! In addition , when purchasing other Keen models , do NOT expect to have the same fit / size . I usually wear a size 9 , and the other model in question has to be a size 10 , to have the same fit . INSANE !
4 #### Pretty good , meat is a little chewy but still not bad , also a little sweeter than I prefer but again not bad . This is n't on the top of my list but it 's on there and I may buy this in a # 10 can .
5 #### This is a fun little toy , very inexpensive and seemed to be made well . I like how you can store ammunition in e handle .
5 #### great powerful slingshot and long lasting band . Make sure the band is out of direct sunlight when stored . If not it will crack break over time .
4 #### i bought a pair from DSW for 50 $ and they are very comfortable but i bought a size 6.5 when I normally where a size 7 . and even the 6.5 feels a little roomy . I have wide flat feet btw . i m not sure if I will keep them even though i love their look and comfort . I 've been having feet problems while taking a gym class and I think they wo n't give me enough support when running . they 're great for wearing at home or gym and doing exercises in one place- extremely light weight and flexible , but i do n't know if they 'll last long if you use them everywhere else . :( i really like them but i ca nt just buy 2 different shoes . also , i really like the strings inside the lining on the side of the shoes to adjust and make the shoe fit snug . it makes me feel secure :D
5 #### Perfect for my 6 year old niece . She loves them and wo n't take them off . She even put sickers all over them to give them a personal touch .
2 #### Bought this shirt hoping it would be a soft cotton as advertised . It 's not . Quite rough . But I like the fact that it has a wrist band so the sleeves can be kept up if necessary . But would n't buy it again .
4 #### This is a great product if you are looking for something simple and functional . I use it at work as an EMT and I appreciate the very clear second hand and the illuminating abilities of this watch . The only down side is that this watch is sort of loud . For people with sensitive ears , you can probably hear the " tick , tick " of this watch from across the room .
4 #### Works perfectly . Can see with both eyes open as you 're looking down the scope . I had to use a file to shave off a little on the top so that it would fit under my scope . Badger rings and vortex 30 mm scope .
3 #### The grips are great . The band 's are much weaker than I was expecting .
2 #### ... and a nickle on gluing the sole to uppers as they always start to peel off in the first 6 months or yr . even with only a few hours per week wear . The plastic stiffener failed on one early making the shoe almost impossible to use as the broken end protrudes and stabs into the soft part of my foot . I like the style , fit , feel and quality in most respects but they should be much more durable for this price .
1 #### My twins have had these since they were 2 , and they 've never been a good fit . These tricycles are very unsteady and tip over constantly . It 's like they are too top - heavy ... the wheels should have been designed further apart from each other to provide a more stable base . I can tell my sons do n't feel comfortable riding them , so they always opt for their Radio Flyer Scoot - Abouts instead .
5 #### Perfect for your scoped hunting rifles . I found them to be easy to put on even with a 40 mm objective scope .
5 #### $ 3 a can delivered to your door . You ca n't beat it . Only used one can so far , but balls were in great shape . Actually came from Walmart , which I did n't realize .
5 #### I was in a bike accident with a car last july . I flew / skidded 20 ft nothing broke , just some lost skin . Thankfully i was wearing my helmet which cracked instead of my head and is now in helmet heaven .
5 #### Great price . Good packaging . Quick shipping . Convenient way to protect rifles from dust and minor dings . Feels comfortable to carry .
5 #### I have 9 pairs of these comfortable shoes ! That says it all ! !
4 #### Arrow flies true with these broadheads , but they do dull easily . Still managed to take down a deer with it .
5 #### Absolutely excellent . I bought these for my husband and he uses them to stay out in the cold and pursue his life long hobby of astronomy . He recently wore them to a very very cold football game and told me that he loves them . They are very effective and I highly recommend them .
2 #### sorry , but despite the famous name these are n't good socks two pairs / both seams tore after a few wears / it 's a shame b / c they are comfortable socks
3 #### Loved this watch the first time I purchased it and had it for two years before the face got too scratched and it stopped working perfectly . But for a relatively inexpensive watch I thought I 'd give it another try and buy a second one . The second time I purchased this watch it worked great for a couple of months but now constantly falls behind . Sometimes it stops for a few hours and then restarts and the time is completely off . Unfortunately the problems arose after the return policy expired and now I am without a reliable watch but ca n't get my money back ..
4 #### These shirts appear to be a good quality and were delivered in a short time . I needed the largest they had for my son and these appear to fit the bill .
5 #### I find that I go to the range more often now that cleaning my rifle is so much easier . The kit is great for storing everything .
5 #### I have many Carhartt shirts and these are worth your review . For a 290 lbs 6'3 " man these fit great and hang well . Love the pocket and the quality of material . OVERALL Will buy again as the fit is near perfect and the quality is high . Keep up the great products Carharrt
3 #### Have n't yet seen it glow in the night / dark yet . Not sure if we 're not in the sun long enough , so it 's really hard to say if it works or not . But as a soccer ball , it 's fine .
5 #### I 've camped with this Coleman stove for two years . It has never failed me . I 'd be lost without it . Compact . Rugged . Throws out lots of heat . Boils water and cooks food quickly and efficiently . Wind shields actually work . The hose that connects the propane canister to the stove unscrews and fits nicely inside the stove during storage . Connecting and disconnecting the propane tank is a breeze . Simply twist on a propane tank and you 're ready to cook . No pumping , priming , or filling a tank with flammable liquid . This is the best little camping stove ever made . I wo n't go camping without it . * * * UPDATE * * * 4/1/2012 . I 'm still using the same stove for camping . Never had a problem with it .
5 #### Wore these for the first time hiking the bluffs . Not the best traction on well worn rocks , but super comfy . No blisters , no achilles pain like with other shoes . Will continue to purchase Nike shoes , because my feet love them for all activities ! ( except my home workouts , they drag pretty hard on the carpet )
3 #### Very good knife , creating a spark would n't , work well with mine . I had to send mine back .
5 #### Like it a lot . Ordered few more pairs in different shades
5 #### Perfectly wonderful ! The only one I 've used for 40 years .
5 #### These pants are extremely comfortable and the sizing is true . I am a relatively tall person and have a tough time finding jeans in the length I need . These were perfect and arrived on time .
5 #### Having replaced the stock on my rra lar-8 I was in need of a new sling loop . These were cheap , of sturdy construction , easy installation , and fit my need perfectly .
5 #### Once assembled , it 's excellent . However , the assembly can be a bit of a bear if doing it by yourself . Some of the holes did n't line up perfectly , and since you really have to use opposing Allen wrenches to handle the screws , you need another set of hands when things do n't line up perfectly . However , the extra effort to assemble was worth it . The final product is excellent . Nice touches , from the great packaging to the leveling feet and padded edges , demonstrate the quality .
5 #### Helps to recover from the pain of tennis elbow if you perform the recommended exercises . It works if you have tennis elbow .
4 #### I bought these sneakers for boot camp class . They are very light weight and different than other sneakers that I have owned . Have only used them a few times , but like them so far .
5 #### Have been wearing Cons for 50 years . Have served me vary well all that time but do wish they had an extra 1/8 inch in the area by my little toe . About a decade or so ago I made a stretcher for that spot and leave in for several months before wearing .
5 #### The only lines I use on my bass boat and ocean boat . Makes self docking and loading and unloading easier for me .
5 #### Gone are the days of huffing and puffing and poking and stoking at a pile of twigs for hours to get a decent campfire for cooking when you are at wits end and starving to death after a long day of hiking . These things with a little aluminum collapsible stove are the way to go . They are great for cooking most MREs or dehydrated veggies . You may need two to completely cook your meal , but these things make life so much easier !
5 #### Good tennis balls . I have been using this brand for 20 + years . Great value !
3 #### They seemed very nice but were way too tight on me . :/
5 #### I bought these classic converse chucks to wear to school . I really love them because they came in the exact fit and are incredibly comfortable . They complement every outfit I wear and they allow me to feel better about myself . Anyone can buy a pair of converses and feel good about these shoes because they are comfortable and are fairly high quality and can be worn with almost anything . Overall , great shoes that hold up in almost every condition .
4 #### For $ 30 this is a pretty comprehensive , well made set of bands and accessories to make them useful . However , for my purposes I found the strongest band barely strong enough to get any benefit from exercising with it . The other bands will never be used unless I find some alternative exercises that require less resistance . This is n't a complaint about the product , it has more to do with an individual 's needs .
4 #### Works well , cleaning is a bit of a pain but I also hate cleaning soooo ...
5 #### Great price for such an outstanding item . Ca nt beat the Russell brand of clothing for ruggedness and durability . Outlasts the competition .
3 #### The jetpack is bigger than i thought . The span of the wings does nt fit through standard doorways so when my son goes from room to room the wings get bent back and i m afraid its only a matter of time before they pop . The straps are adjustable velcro which is good but unfortuantley because of the unfinished edges of it the buzz costume he wears it with has some pulls and pilling from it . But the plastic seems thicker than i expected and he loves it . My son is 2 1/2
5 #### My high school basketball team wore Converse Chuck Taylor All Star shoes .
5 #### I have numerous pairs of Converse and they are my go to tennis shoe . I think nothing looks better with a t - shirt and jeans ! This color is great for summer months .
3 #### This is a wonderful grill and I really do like it . Actually all three ( 3 ) that I have owned . Excellent grill . but just one problem , the materials they are made from are not of the best quality . Three grills lass than 9 years . Yes I do keep them covered and during the winter months I put them up out of the cold weather . Grill box rusts out on side and bottom .. Put a piece of stainless steel underneath the grill box and bottom of grill box still fell a[art . Sides of grill - I guess from the heat- start rusting and fall apart . The first one I go some metal strips to put on the sides of that grill , but when grill box fell apart , trashed it , bought another . You got it - fell apart also . Said buy no more of these grills and guess what , yes I bought one more . of these . Like them yes I do , but can not afford to be buying a new grill every 2 1/2 to 3 years . At anywhere from $ 243.00 to $ 300.00 a pop this gets expensive . If Camp Chef would just use better , heavier materials , they would have a grill no one could touch . I start looking for a new grill tomorrow .
3 #### I like it very much for 2 1/2 weeks and today it just stopped so I 'm very unhappy
5 #### Better than any frisbee type . More fun to throw and catch . Softer for dogs to catch . Holding up pretty well , couple little splits in the plastic but our dog is hard on eerything
5 #### Absolutely love the mat . First I have to say ... it 's heavy , so if you are carrying the mat long distances I would probably suggest get the " lite " style . What I love about this one is that it 's indestructible . Randomly I will use shoes on the mat and does n't leave marks . Then it 's a thick mat , perfect for knee issues . The length is great , although might be to long for yoga studios where you only have a allotted space , not at my gym . I can never fit on the mat ... i 'm always over or to short and have to adjust . Not with this one , no matter where I stand I still have mat front or back . I started using a yoga towel on top for the only reason that I sweat a lot and if there 's a lot of sweat dripping of you I slip with hands a feet , so the towel fixed the problem . Super expensive mat but considering that I was buying a new one 2 - 4 times a year it 's totally worth it .
5 #### Did n't realize how much smaller the Youth basketball is from the original .
4 #### ... I know kryptonite is green . But wow , more green on the uppers than shows in the image . The uppers here appeared to me to be a more subtle yellow & gray . That 's Okay - I buy Merrell shoes for the comfort and fit and these have it just like any of their running / hiking / climbing shoes ... always recommend Merrell ... Except maybe not in Pink .
5 #### Another T / C classic barrel , means ordering another Weaver 92A base for the scope . No complaints from this hobby'ist , and T / C affectinado ! ~Jabba
1 #### I actually loved these shoes until all of a sudden one of the inserts seemed to dry and curl up , while the other one is perfectly normal . Of course this happened less than 2 weeks after the exchange period ran out .
5 #### This is a very nice gun sock . I bought both the large scope model and this standard model one . Everything from a scoped 243 to lever rifles fit just fine . Nice product . Too bad the label says Made in China .
5 #### Fit perfectly ordered by bust size . I wear mine under everything and to bed and lace straps stay in place . Love it so much i ordered another .
4 #### Very good support . I have several of these in different colors . I like the support and they are fairly comfortable .
5 #### These fit my face , they are quite comfortable , Tyr anti - fog works well with them so they get 5 stars . Fit is , of course , everything with swim goggles . One style usually does not work for everyone . If new to swimming be prepared to experiment with a few dollars . You 'll find a style that fits . I have a broad face with bone shapes around my eyes that many goggles will not seal .
5 #### BIG HIT with granddaughter NOW I Am the best grandma ever ! Thanks for making me look GOOD XOXO
5 #### Great deal on the " classic " . Little PSA : If you officiate basketball with these , consider wearing ear plugs . These are loud , and will damage your ears over time ( especially when you need to whistle over the crowd in a big game ) . An added bonus of the ear plugs is you hear less heckling :)
5 #### I get these for my dog and he loves them . The lip is a little softer than a real Frisbee . Surprisingly even after being very chewed up the Frisbee will still fly pretty well . I have a German shepherd and he is very hard on toys . I used my last one about 4 - 5 months very heavily with the dog before buying this one . Most other Frisbee were gone in a month even the ones made for dogs . This is also great for people which was my original intention .
4 #### Love the color but they were way too big . I will return and order a smaller size .
5 #### This scope is great . i sighted it in very quickly the click adjusters are accurate , this went on my marlin 22 magnum and its perfect for it . when i went to sight in the sun was very bright and directly in my face the scope did n't pickup any of the glare the crosshairs are nice and thin , it comes only with scope covers . it works great when its basicly dark . you could probly see 100 yards at night under a full moon . it was better than my own eyesight . i woild recomend this to anyone .
5 #### Love them ! Fit exactly as expected in length and width ! I would definitely buy these again .
5 #### I used these to make my Mossberg 702 into a Liberty Training Rifle . They attached to Uncle Mike 's sling screws and took a military type M1 1 - 1/4 " cotton web sling without problem . Solid construction .
5 #### I bought this from the recommendations of other reviewers and am glad I did . I quit wearing a watch when the old Seiko quit for the last time and with the time on my phone , I did n't think I needed a watch . Still , I missed wearing my Mom 's old gold watchband so have had an eye out for a long time for a watch that would fit . I finally settled on this one and love it ! It 's nice to be able to tell the time when my phone is out of reach and it 's really a very attractive piece of jewelry too .
5 #### They work great . No problems thus far after a month of using them several times a week .
3 #### I bought these for my 2 year old little boy . The boots look great and are well made but they are REALLY difficult to get on , even with the laces completely removed . After about a dozen wearings they break in and start to go on easier , but if you are buying these for a baby or toddler , be prepared to spend an extra ten minutes putting these on your little guy for the first few weeks !
5 #### I 've been wanting a pair of converse forever and finally broke down and bought a pair . I 'm so glad I did . They looks great with a skater dress or sweats and a sweatshirt . Very versatile and they even look better as time goes by with a little bit of dirt . I 'm a size 7 and pretty narrow foot and they fit great . You can definitely wear them for long hour like during concerts or festivals . Overall a great purchase !
5 #### I have 5 pairs in different colors , this is a great shoe
4 #### Very nice shorts for summer work in Florida . These shorts fit as expected and the leggings are nice and roomy for a cooler feel . At first the material seems stiff , but another reviewer says it will loosen a bit and feel less stiff with wear . These shorts seem to be made from durable material , much better than the shorts I wore for work before . And yes , no button above the zipper , it is clip - style , like with dress pants . I had to take off one star from what would have been a 5 star rating because the front pockets ( that hold your keys , change , and other items ) seem narrow and shallow . I 'm concerned about losing my pocket items during regular use . I may have to resort to a zipper equipped fanny pack for essential items .
5 #### Just what I needed for my new rifle ... easy to adjust and install .
5 #### My 9 year old loves this scooter . She had a budget version from a big box store that she used for 3 years . Immediately upon riding this scooter she was in love with it . She is super impressed with how much better it rides .
5 #### I m a welder and this came in handy in the winter . Protected me from the wind chill . Very satisfied with item .
5 #### Got these as a second pair to have for a 4 oar vessel , and I love them . From the curvature of the paddle to the grip and the rings , I 've gotten more than I expected out of them . Lightweight and powerful .
3 #### It 's a little cheap looking for the money but it will do .
5 #### They are wonderful ! They fit just right and are well made .
5 #### This is the perfect size pack for walking or running . It easily holds my phone in the larger pouch , and keys in the zippered pouch . It is very low profile and looks flattering LOVE it ! ! ! I bought one 10 years ago and it is still in perfect condition . Just bought another one to have at a second home .
5 #### They are Chuck 's . Lets be honest they are a staple in anyone 's wardrobe and the only sneaker you can wear with dressy clothing and get away with it .
5 #### Bought these to wear in a drysuit for scuba diving . They are durable and do not absorb any water . Also do not develop an odor when wet like my wool soaks did . I recommend these socks , especially for the price .
4 #### I ordered these boat shoes for my husband and he is very satisfied with them . They look great on , fit well and are very comfortable for him .
5 #### Nice quality , thick and durable , and nice colors . I wear a 42 and the large is perfection . Ca n't beat Carhartt quality .
5 #### Runs large . Sleeve length is very long . Great construction and fabric , may need a size smaller .
5 #### These neck gaiters are so warm and comfortable you wo n't be disappointed . There are other neck warmers on the market but they do n't perform like Turtle Fur . We bought one for each of the grandkids ( ages 2 to 18 ) as well as the adult children and they were loved by all ! So soft and minimal pilling after numerous washes . They are perfect for cold and windy days . But if you 're looking for extreme cold and wind protection ( skiing at 12,000 ft with biting wind ) , buy the double - layer .
4 #### had to light up a bunch of wet wood in the backcountry , these did well , a bit of a pain to ply apart but serve as nice tinder under your leaves and mass and whatnot .
4 #### I 'm a size 16/18 and the XXL fit me , Howver , I have large hips so the bottom is a bit tight when zipped . Wish it were elastic there . Love how light weight it is thought ! Awesome for traveling .
5 #### The perfect gift for a little girl learning to tell time !
5 #### Super comfy , true Size , I use them for boot Camp , cross fit and they are great , absolutely recommended it .
5 #### I 'm familiar with Converse CT 's sizing so we knew what to order . S&H was quick & delivered as promised . Since I have other Converse purchased at Converse & its outlet store , these appear to be authentic & made like my other pairs . White was a true white .
5 #### I bought a wide size of these at a local store and they are amazing ! Soft , comfy , with moderate support . Not a cloud to walk on , but not minimalist . The wide size is perfect for my wide feet with high arches . The shoe tends to run about a half size long though , especially for Nike . I am working on getting in shape , and these shoes feel good all day ... No rubbing on my big toe joint or pinkie toe or heel . Very pleased .
5 #### Hands down the best yoga mat you can buy . Well worth the money .
4 #### I think these are good , I love how they look . They are n't the most comfortable things to have on but I do n't bike much so I 'm not sure how these are supposed to feel . If you 're just looking for the occasional wear like me , pick up some of these .
5 #### Perfect for car , boat , or golf car . I have 3 of these .
4 #### I do n't mind the over size , they work great with or without sock ..
5 #### What more can you say about Chuck Taylor 's ? They are a classic show that goes with any style really . Best part is breaking them in .
2 #### I bought a pair of Converse All Stars in April , and they are finished already . The soles were so thin that they could n't even last three months . I did n't expect them to last forever , but I should have been able to wear them into August . I suppose that someone who was light and only wore them on grass would get a longer life from them , but that 's not how it was .
1 #### I have put these together before . It 's hard , but not awful . The instructions literally say that this job requires three strong adult . THREE . Do you have any idea how often there are three strong adults in my house at the same time ? Almost never . So , needless to say , it 's still sitting on my couch waiting for a few strong adults to show up . My husband and I worked on this for over an hour . We got two pieces together , and finally gave up . THEN , the smell is overwhelming . I 'm pretty sure whatever they made it with is highly flammable and could possibly burst into flames by it'self at any minute . It does say " Keep away from open flame " . But , I think this is more like " Do not light a match while this is in the room " .
5 #### Good fit and good price the order arrived fast , very pleased with the transaction .
5 #### My toddler ( 1.5 yrs old ) loves to take off her shoes . She would take off her shoes at daycare all the time to the point where she would have multiple scratches on the bottoms of her feet from the mulch at the playground . Now that she has these shoes , she ca n't take them off ! And , she has n't gotten any detectable fungal infections on her feet from wearing them all day . She wears a size 6 in most shoes and a size 6 in this shoe seems to have a roomy fit . They stay on ( possibly in part due to the high top ) and do not seem overly large . If I had to buy them again , I 'd buy them in this size .
1 #### The headset bearings failed after a month of light use . The company does not support this product and sell replacement parts . Stay away unless you like cheap Chinese garbage .
5 #### Use all Bianchi products for police belt ! Great quality , will continue to use and purchase from Amazon , great price , selection , and arrived quickly !
5 #### These were the perfect compliment to my sons buzz lightyear costume . I love the elastic straps for easy on and off . More durable than I expected . Great price !
5 #### Loved it.it was a little long but now it 's all dress up .
5 #### These have made life much easier for many of my workout buddies . Thought I would give them a try .
5 #### I bought this toy for my almost 2 and 3 year old boys , as well as for a gift for a girls ' 3rd b - day . I admit that it 's not as easy or as fun to use unless you have at least 3 people holding the chute . It will be a big hit at any party , playgroup , or get together . All ages are drawn to playing with a parachute and all have a blast . It also fosters group creativity and dynamic play ; turn taking , cooperation , and collective participation . I love the bright colors that just add to the fun and festivity of play . Get outside and have a blast !
5 #### Great shoes , i like and it fits fine .
4 #### I needed a watch for everyday as I have a nice one for dress . This works very well and is attractive .
5 #### I love to fish , perfect trout fishing line . Please manufacture a greater length spool in the Gold .
4 #### This organizer is good , but not great . It wo n't fit two wide bags next to each other but its close . Assembly was kind of a pain but luckily you only have to do it once .
5 #### never heard of this ' til grandason did science experiment on aerobie rings - was surprised to discover how much fun it was
5 #### These are thinner than the other major brand but seem to work about as well . They last about 10 hours .
5 #### Shorts are stiff before first wash - so do not judge until you have broken these in a bit . Once washed a few times , perfectly comfortable . Not at all that skinny style , just regular shorts .
3 #### Very warm and great fit for my 5'1 130 lb body Just not as much movement allowed . My Columbia girls pants allow for more flexibility and movement
5 #### Love these ! Perfect hose . They stay put and do n't say . I wear them 12 hours a day comfortably . Durable .
5 #### Oerfect whistle . As a former sports official I can attest to their reliability and sound . These are near indestructible and the sound can be heard for a very long distanc . Excellent for females to carry on their key chain . The whistle is so loud it is nearly an offensive deterrent .
4 #### Happy with the total package . You get alot for the money . Would recommend to others .
5 #### I had bought 2 of these wallets fromSears along time ago . They 're very nice and they hold a lot . They have a lot of card slots .. It 's also nice to have the change purse area so accessible . I love the design . I purchased 2 more sincetheother 2 lasted me for years !
3 #### I only have one complaint ... see those fancy studs ... well they have hard nubs on them and they will ruin your wood kitchen chair ! Great pants , but dog gone ... a mans got ta have breakfast , lunch and dinner ! Returned just for that fact !
5 #### HANES HAS GREAT PRODUCTS . I love the color and the sheerness of the hose , however because I love the color and had not been able to find the ' Barely Black " the size " F " is not a good fit for me .
4 #### I like this product , works well but it is n't a sturdy product . I have to be real careful not to break it when using it . You get what you pay for I guess .
4 #### I do n't know why some people like to bash wearing drummers gloves . I 've played for over 25 years and never wore them until recently after getting painful blisters .... and no it 's not from improper stick handling . I drum like I want to play and you can drum like you want to play . I play a lot and even my calluses break open from long play time . I was totally against wearing gloves because of feel and now I 've learned these gloves DO save your hands and feel great . I 'm no longer timid about 64th stick notes when wearing these gloves . They are light , tight and have a good feel . What do you have to loose for 20 bucks is how I look at it . If this matters to anyone ; there are many pro touring drummers out there that wear gloves and not for the look of it . They do n't wear them all the time , but they do on long tour runs night after night . Happy drumming to all !
3 #### The jeans were satisfactory but they were just a bit small .
5 #### I love the Turtle Fur ! I have an old one that my kids have claimed as their own , so I needed to get my own . It fits perfectly , and of course keeps me nice and warm .
5 #### Big enough , sturdy enough ! I wish I had 80 of em ! ! ! I work hard and need a shirt that is rugged .... These are ...
4 #### Ordered for my husband and he wants another one ... so I would say its a good buy
5 #### These sandals are very good and are comfortable to wear all day .
4 #### These arrived fast and are very cute . They are soft plastic so I could see how they could pop easily like others have said , but so far they have lasted for us . We are minimizing their use until Halloween is over to avoid popping them . They are a little wide for my 16 month old but would fit a toddler well . The elastic for the arms is a little snug so might be uncomfortable for extended use . Otherwise these are very cute and I am happy withy them , especially for the price .
5 #### Normally wear 11 - 11.5 D for lace ups , 11 was too big on these , had to get 10.5
4 #### ONLY BUY WHAT YOU NEED ! I bought a whole case of these , thinking that they would last , but I went to pull them out again this fall and noticed that so many of the " Two Packs " had one warmer that was solid as a rock -- as if it was used already . Had to cut them apart and toss out the " used " new ones . Very frustrating . They were still in the box , unopened but one out almost every two pack was unusable . If you open one that is soft and granule feeling , it warms up perfectly , that is what the stars are for .
3 #### Much smaller than I was lead to believe . Still may be able to use the bags on my much smaller trees .
5 #### Love this light - up disc , and you definitely ca n't beat the price ! A must have for late night throwing in the yard .
5 #### In really like these . I wear between a 9 - 9.5 womens , I got the 9.5 and they fit perfectly . They are light weight but have good support . I will buy another pair .
5 #### This is the 2nd pair of these shoes that I have purchased .
4 #### My daughter loves these and is happy with the fit and feel of them .
5 #### My wife uses this product for her recovery therapy for shoulder replacement surgery and it is was recommended by the hospital staff .
4 #### It 's a nice looking watch , but it looked a lot like the other watch I ordered . The color of the watch is more burgandy than brown . But sometimes it looks brown too . Sent it back .
1 #### The material is too thin , it 's not the same as I ordered 6 months ago , I will find a different t - shirt in the future .
3 #### These are lovely ... For the first 5 hours ... Then , they run in the toes ... I 'll stick with reinforced toes ...
5 #### Beautiful case . Can fit three Glock 's ( 17 , 19 and 26 ) with magazines .
5 #### Love it . I am 5'11 195lbs and it fights snugly - runs on the smallish side for an XL . Fits much like a 42L suit jacket .
5 #### Love these ! ! ! ! It gets cold here and running in 20 degree weather is not bad with these pants . awesome buy
4 #### Keeps my house key and iphone in place and tight against the body while running , without being uncomfortable . Bon apetite !
5 #### Really like these for bringing salad dressing to work . Small enough that it can fit inside my salad container . NEVER leaks . A bit difficult to clean , but wide mouth is better than narrow mouth at this .
5 #### You get more than you could possibly use and at a very reasonable price . Very well built , Great hardware . Takes the place of much more expensive equipment . Company is more than helpful ! Fabulous . This is probably my best recommendation ever !
5 #### They work GREAT ! ! ! Almost always get 12hrs and they keep me going in the cold .
4 #### it took a little getting used to but it did start coming back . it has brief instructions on itself and more detailed ones on the packaging . it seems durable . it 's cheap . and it 's cool . it could be even better if you could choose colors and if it came with flashing LED lights . also , you will now hate trees , like a lot .
4 #### This is my third Expedition watch . I love them , but when the battery dies , that 's it . You can replace the battery , or even have a professional do it for you , but the watch never again keeps accurate time - such a shame and not exactly environmentally sound . Otherwise it is a wonderful watch ! FYI : the original battery lasts a couple of years .
4 #### Caught a lot of crappie and perch off this not a bad lure .
4 #### They are still holding up . I will buy another pair
5 #### We 've used HeatMax hand warmers for years and love them . When we lived in Connecticut our kids would keep them in their gloves while they played in the snow . Now that we live in North Carolina it does n't get so bitterly cold but we still use them . They fit in gloves and mittens , but we like them best in our coat pockets . They last all day long and are plenty warm without being too hot . We have n't had any problems with " duds " in our years of using them , and have n't even tried another brand because we like these so much . After several hours , if they seem to be cooling down , we take them out and massage them to reactivate them . I buy this 40 - pack box because we seem to go through them pretty quickly in the winter . I also keep a few packages in the car so we will stay warm if we break down somewhere . They would also work well in an outdoor emergency if you had several of them to tuck into your clothes . With free Amazon SuperSaver shipping and Prime shipping , these are a good value for our family .
5 #### What a great frisbee ! It 's a very well - constructed , balanced frisbee . The battery compartment is easier to work as opposed to other models I 've had in the past . So much fun for camping !
4 #### A good scope for what I am using it for . Put on a .22cal rifle that will be used mainly for " plinking " . I would suggest a better model if going to be used for any serious hunting . But for close range in good conditions ( light , environment ) good buy . I will be using it to shoot mostly 25 - 50yds .
5 #### Four Seasons Survival Tinder - Quik Fire Tab works as described and great for your survival tin or bug out bag . Will buy more and recommend .
5 #### What a fantastic addition for baseball practice . WAY better than those flimsy floosey plastic sheets called bases . These have considerable weight and stay put . My sister made me a customized canvas carrying bag lined with anti - grip slippery vinyl on inside . If I could say anything bad , I wish they came with a carrying bag . If it was n't for my sister , I would be irritated on how to transport these back and forth to practice . Thanks sis ! !
5 #### This watch was purchased for my husband . His old Timex was very similar and recently stopped working . He really liked this watch because it was n't digital and had the day / date . It looked just like his old watch but when he received it he realized the watch face was just a bit smaller than the old one and he really like that . He said his old one always felt too big on his wrist . All in all he was very happy with this purchse .
5 #### This is a great whistle ! It 's super - loud and I think it looks nicer than a plastic one .
5 #### I ordered these for my granddaughter 's birthday . They were shippped promptly , and I was able to track them very efficiently . They were exactly what we wanted ! ! ! They are very attractive and wear well .
2 #### I do n't like how it does n't cover your whole head
5 #### Great pair of jeans that fit and look good too .
4 #### My five year old wears a size 5 - 6 and this was pretty small . Not sure of his height , but he weighs 42lbs . Not tight , just short in the legs and arms . But it was SO super cute we kept it and rolled it up like shorts .
5 #### I have special fit needs that require me to wear a certain type of shoe . Of all the shoes I 've tried , the All Star and One Star shoes by Converse are the best fit . They 're very comfortable and durable , and they hold their shape and good looks . I 'd recommend these Converse shoes to anyone for value , fit and comfort .
4 #### This garment bag does not have a lot of bells and whistles , but it is quite adequate for transporting a couple of garments neatly . I like that there is something to wrap around the hangers , so you do n't lose one , and it is longer than most others at this price point . Also , the pockets in the top are handy .
3 #### They burn , but were much smaller than expected .. After shipping costs your better off making your own using cotton and hand sanatizer . They did however throw in a couple extra tinders ... I got 1 10 pack and 8 loose pieces just floating aroung the envelope . UPDATE - I found even better tinder than the two options above and its FREE .... Just head to your dryer lint tray , All that lint is so fine that it lights up almost to easy . Its very very light to carry , and a softball size of lint can really be compressed to almost nothing at all ... Try it !
3 #### While this is probably good for regular wear or outdoor sports , I bought this for winter running , so it did n't fit my needs . It does n't stay up over your mouth while running .
5 #### Best kitchen shoes I have ever owned ! No slipping , comfortable for 10 + hours and I LOVE that the inserts are changeable so you do n't need to replace the whole shoe .
5 #### I LOVE these shoes ! ! I have received several compliments on these shoes each time I wore them . They are as comfortable as they are stylish . I have only worn them about three times , but they have quickly become my favorite pair to wear to work . I like them far better than the identical black wingtip Stacy Adams and they are as comfortable . I HIGHLY recommend not only the Stacy Adams brand , but this pair as well . They are a GREAT value because they are cheaper than the black and brown pair , but a bit more stylish .
3 #### There nice par of pants , but do n't weld in them . They burn up way too fast
5 #### My family does a Christmas theme every year and this years them was superheros and villains . My sister and I are going as the wonder twins . She sent me the link for the things she bought so I bought the same things so we 'd match . The shorts seem like they are good quality shorts though me being a man will never wear them again and will give them away .
5 #### Great knife , survived Afghanistan , wicked sharp , awesome grip , sticks in hard plastic sheath well
5 #### Much better fit from 12.5 size . My child loves them .
4 #### It fits my German Shepherd just fine . I bought it only so I could muzzle her when trimming her nails , it helps a lot !
5 #### I have put 500 arrows across the FlipperRest II and it has taken a few knocks in the field - still working well with no damage to flights . I cut up the old leather pad to make a cushion ( no plunger installed ) and that has worked . The Flipper replaced a bear rug and the improvement in grouping was immediately noticeable . Update : The FlipperRest II failed after 1,830 arrows . The metal arm failed at the bend . I replaced it with another FlipperRest II .
1 #### I wore these shoe one time , from the airport in Omaha , NE to the airport in Phoenix , AZ . When I arrived in Phoenix , the left shoe / sole started squeaking and wo n't stop . I want to return for a refund . Need instructions for returning as no paperwork was in my package when it arrived .
5 #### The Tikka 30 - 06 is known for a thin OEM recoil pad . I ditched it without ever using it for this one . Works great and have had zero shoulder pain while using this product .
5 #### Bought these as a gift for my god daughter . Just like the All Stars I wore back in the day . Not very comfortble for extended periods of wear compared to a more modern shoe , but they are the latest " thing " to wear .
2 #### Fabric on top seems nice and durable . Vinyl on the bottom ( where punctures are likely to occur ) is only slightly better than that of a pool mattress . Pretty narrow for a camping mattress . Your shoulders may be on the mat , but your arms will be on the ground . Purchased as a backpack camping pad but really its kinda heavy for that . 2 stars as a pad ... 5 stars in the pool !
4 #### Serving the purpose . He wears it to work and says it does help his back feel better .
5 #### Very pleased with this shirt . High quality , great feel for summer wear ! I would recommend it to others . Priced right .
5 #### love love this watch we had it for a while and we still love it . stylish dress up or down . it has n't worn any finish off and the opal face is nice with the indiglo ! ! ! ! I would buy more maybe I still will
2 #### The quality of the shirt is great , but this thing is HUGE ! I got a medium and it fits like an XL . I returned a medium and got a small and it was like an extra small .
3 #### It works ! It just feels like the hooks could slip at any moment ....
5 #### Love these Danskin Women 's Bermuda shorts . They 're comfortable and have a nice fit . They are made of a jersey knit ( similar to sweat pants material but lighter weight . ) They hold their shape well . I can wear them all day sitting or long rides in the car and they still look fresh . I usually wear a top covering the waist ( draw - string waist on the shorts ) , and I feel comfortable wearing them to dinner out to a diner or pub and do n't feel underdressed .
5 #### I always have a hard time finding socks that fit just right and these needed to be perfect because I was going to be hiking all day in them . Most adult socks are too big and the heel part always ends up around my ankle area . I have tried a kids large and , although they fit , they were a little too tight and the thickness ended up getting stretched out too thin . These socks were great . I wore them over another lightweight pair of socks and the fit was perfect . My shoe size runs about a 7 or 7 1/2 . They were perfect for my hiking trip and my feet did n't sweat at all . You can throw them in the washer and dryer and there is no problem with shrinkage . Am going to purchase another pair . These are a great pair of socks . I highly recommend them .
5 #### These are the classic converse that time has proven to be a great shoe .
4 #### Great knife , not a huge fan of the sheath , the button for the clip is difficult to impossible to re - engage with one hand . Great value though .
2 #### I placed this product on my duty belt and my light fell out of the holster at least 5 - 6 times during my shift . I had high hopes for this holster but ...
2 #### Too tight in the waist for a relaxed fit jean . Other relaxed fit jean brands I have fit much better .
5 #### I purchased this mainly because I have hard pergo flooring and I wanted to do some sit - ups , leg lifts , and neck exercises on the floor . This product is exactly what I needed . I also like the design with the single fold ( as opposed to double fold models sold here on Amazon ) because it helps keep the inside layers clean when storing it away ( the side I 'm actually laying down on when I use it ) . Handles are a nice touch . Some people have said that the padding is a little stiff , but that 's what I was looking for . It feels like the old mats I used to train on for martial arts , back in high school .
3 #### These fit way too small , in my opinion , and they are not heavy enough . I like my hose to be a bit thicker .
5 #### iam very happy with my purchase the hockey mask is a perfect fit I do approve of this mask two thumbs up thank you .
4 #### It could be a little easier to shave the magnesium , but its way easier than the coghlans fire starter .
5 #### This replaced the same tubing I wore out after regular use over a year . I like the resistance level and the tubing is nice , high quality . The only reason my previous unit wore out is because of an abrasive attachment point I used ; I 'm sure it could last twice as long if I had a better wall attachment method . I did not realize I bought the version with no foam on the handles , which I prefer . But , I simply cut off the foam part on my previous unit and wrapped them around the plastic handles on this one ( I could not switch out the whole handles ) . I could probably glue them , too , but they are staying on just fine . Not sure if they are still making the foam grip version , but they wanted what seems like a lot more just for some foam . You can come up with something yourself with a little thought .
4 #### They fit as expected . They are good for the price !
2 #### Kind of a cheap glove . Reminds me more of a Halloween costume prop than a well - made set of hunting gloves . They re not too expensive , though . You get what you pay for .
5 #### Love this shirt ! It 's cute , comfortable , looks great with leggings and allows me to nurse discreetly without feeling frumpy !
5 #### Very nice,,exactly as I expected ! I already had a brown one for decades . Buxton is true quality and I love the red !
5 #### It was a gift for my daughter . She loves it . Good quality .
5 #### Fantastic quality shoes , great classic look and very comfortable ! Ca n't really go wrong with a classic style like this !
5 #### Super realistic . If I was a fish I would eat it ... It looks like a real bumble bee , Like fish are smart , this is real as the real thing . I ca n't wait to use it . Small hooks , the wings are awesome . I 'm just going to throw this near a tree and shake it . This is a gimme .
5 #### Just the heavy duty dickies I was looking for . I was having a hard time finding the heavy duty material in stores and wanted the old classic , long lasting Dickies I 've always had . Very pleased to find the color options ( they look exactly as pictured ) and lengths . I went with the 13 inch inseam and they are a little bit longer than I remember , however , it works great since I tend to have a lot of things in my pockets throughout the day and having the longer inseam seems to help with " crowding " . I 'm sure the pairs I just got will last a while , but I will definitely buy these again when I need another pair . They are fantastic .
4 #### It amazes me how other reviewers have blasted this cute little bell as if they thought they were buying a highly precise navigational instrument for a mere 4 bucks . It 's a simple " one ping " bell with a novelty compass attached and nothing more . For me , it does just what I expect it to do , a few pings and I have warned others of my approach . The sound is friendly and well recieved . As for the compass , I have found it to be generally accurate particularly while riding on smooth surfaces where the needle has had a chance to settle . It is often said " you get what you pay for " and I am very happy with my $ 4 investment . If you need more , then be prepared to spend more !
5 #### I purchased these for my daughter . She wears them nearly everyday and loves them ,
5 #### Exactly what you would want in a pair of blue jeans !
4 #### Easy to apply and rub into the string b / c of the silicone formula , but also kind of nasty to get on the fingers for the same reason . Unlike bees wax which you can touch without really having it rub off on your fingers , this stuff starts kind of tacky .
4 #### Super clear , No fog . No leaks . Wife loves it . What more can you ask for .
5 #### This thing WORKS ! I have been fighting elbow pain / tendinitis for weeks and WEEKS . So frustrated ... nothing was really working ... creams , lotions , icing , heat , arm bands and braces . My brother in law tried this a while back and said it worked so I thought ... what the heck . Sure enough ... I have been doing the exercises for 3 - 4 days ... only takes a couple minutes three times a day .. and my elbow feels better than it has in MONTHS . Truly feels like with a few more days ... definitely within another week ... pain will be gone . Do log onto You Tube to have the exercises demonstrated ... just type in flex bar / tennis elbow ... the video does a better job of showing form than the product insert ... but other than that ... this thing works miracles !
3 #### The fit and function is OK but the electronics are open to moisture if you sweat .
3 #### Eh ok . It works as advertised , although the plastic feels a bit cheap . I do n't expect it to last long . -M
5 #### This fishing line has come in very handy , I am glad I invested in it , this weekend I caught a nice fish .
5 #### Used on my Remington 870 express and on my savage 30 06 , keeps my wife less nervous with kids in the house with guns
5 #### Had I known sooner how great these coveralls were my wardrobe would be two insulated ones , two plain . The insulated ones are warm and fit perfectly . I have a bloodhound who likes to get wet on walks and then jump on me like the enthusiastic puppy he is . My carhartts are perfect ! I also have a carhartt jacket . I am pure country , retired and lovey comfort . On a scale of one to five , they get a six !
5 #### Great quality and what I expected . Just a little snug , but still stylish and practical .
5 #### This watch is beautiful , elegant and very cool . Plus the price was great . I like it so much I did a search and found one in Men 's size for my husband 's Xmas gift .
1 #### Knife is very nice , but the sheath is terrible . One of the two buttons was shipped broken , and the other is impossible to open . Would be impossible to take out a knife in an emergency , or if one was in a hurry .
3 #### Nice boots , I have worn Justin ropers for 25 + years . My only complaint is the left boot is much tighter than the right , I 've never experienced this with Justin 's .
5 #### Got this to try as a lubricant , but decided to use something else and use this to touch up the rubber window seals and rubber strips on my Cherokee roof . Excellent . I know I will be using it on 0 - rings and other stuff as a sealant too .
5 #### they are very comfortable feel like you have nothing on .
5 #### Got these for my great nephew and he loves them
4 #### I 'm a skier . Have been my whole life . But I will not spend a fortune on my son 's ski gear bc he grows so fast between seasons . These look like a cool pair of burton pants . I got the grey . They fit over ski boots , which looks way better . They are a little big for an 8/10 but that 's ok bc with long johns and the cool snowboarder look , they do the trick . Think snow !
5 #### Great chair for lawn concerts . Originally purchased the Crazy Creek The Chair- but it was flimsy compared to the original . The Original is made exponential better .
5 #### I bought a pair of these for the kids in my family . They love it , and the adjustable handlebar really helps the shorter kids ride comfortably .
5 #### This review is from the perspective of the user of an old Silva Type 4 baseplate style compass ( over 30 years ! ) . I am impressed by the improvements made to compasses in general , but this is a real gem . The global needle really makes walking / hiking / etc easy while using the compass , as there is less of a need to really hold the base level . The needle just freely swings without any hangups . The built - in declination adjustment is very nicely done : a micro screw driver ( on the lanyard with the compass ) makes the adjustment from the back side of the compass . It stays put . If you 're hiking the AT , then you 'll need to make a few adjustments during your months of hiking , but otherwise , most people will likely leave the declination as it is for long periods . The built in inclinometer is nice and truly functional . The mirror system with notches at the top AND the bottom is a great modification allowing for easier sighting . The notch also allows altitude measurements in the field ( height of trees and mountains ) , as long as you like doing tan calculations in your head ... or carry a slide rule or pocket calculator with you . Good compass . I like it , and recommend it .
1 #### Over the past year I 've purchased quite a bit of Lodge preseasoned cast iron cookware and I simply could not be happier with it . This seemed like the perfect solution for our " where do we put this thing " question when grilling meat in the grill pan and using round grill press . It did work perfectly , for about 5 times . Then the bolt that holds the two pieces together simply snapped in two . I was so frustrated that I threw it away ( stupid as I should have just replaced the bolt ) ... but I 'm still very disappointed in the quality of this item especially compared to the very high quality cookware I have from Lodge . I also wanted to note that mine arrived very clearly marked " MADE IN CHINA " which I was very surprised by as I thought all lodge products were made in the USA and the product description states this to be true . Buy with caution !
5 #### I recently bought these shoes for my son in law . Ordering these shoes online at Amazon made quick work of shopping . It is hard to find this size shoe locally , so being able to order them online saved lots of time . Thanks , Amazon !
2 #### do n't know why but fell apart fast tread was worn out quickly been wearing converse for years this pair was poor quality
5 #### Washed before wearing . A bit stiff but similar to new Original Levi 's so I expect that the pants will become softer as time goes by . Nice color . The pockets will , I expect , hold up well . The fit is very accurate .
4 #### Good quality and simple to install - no directions required . Good choice since it is adjustable for different size small bikes .
5 #### For a shotgun auto - loader it works and feels great . To position the pad on the shoulder I have the loop on the forearm instead of the barrel .
5 #### I do a lot of computer work for my occupation , and it has been vital for me to take breaks and either stretch out or get exercise . This purchase , along with an exercise ball and a yoga mat , have been absolutely essential for me to maintain my flexibility , strength , and overall health . These resistance bands are key for convenient strength exercises . They seem to be built with high quality standards . And the door anchor works great to add new dimensions to the exercises . Highly recommend bringing this set into your home or office , or both .
5 #### The shoes fit about 1 size to big . Other than that they are . I bought them in all black and they are perfect !
1 #### too short , back rubs , hard to get on , uncomfortable , arch in wrong place .
3 #### Not a fan . Shoes looked great but too narrow for most feet .
5 #### I bought these for my hubby ... who is a mechanic , does much better than standard Tshirts . Nice look with Carhart logo , They are aso a litlle thicker to protect from hot engine oil , etc . He loves them .
5 #### Beautiful shoe but it did n't fit . I had too much going on to return or exchange . I bought a different pair of wingtips in a regular size 12 , and they fit perfectly These were too narrow :/ Update - I was too lazy to return the shoe and after many months found myself in a situation where I needed to make these shoes fit . It was a painful process but eventually the shoe broke in and now they are awesome . Sometimes , things are just too classy for my broke self to understand .
5 #### Well made and relatively easy to install with one person . However , follow the directions carefully or you might get near the end of the install process and realize you installed some pieces backwards . Which requires complete dis - assembly .
2 #### You can not tell what size these will fit until you receive them . I returned them because the descriptions and sizes are not accurate .
2 #### I bought this grip for my new Para Ordnance " Expert " model 1911 and it did NOT fit ! ! This grip fits smaller 1911 's . Other reviews may say it fits full size 1911 's and maybe all 1911 's are the same , but NOT for this grip ! ! I had to send it back and get the Government Model grip . Good grip , just did NOT fit my 1911 .
5 #### Nice walking shorts , slightly loose with great pockets on both sides .
3 #### hard to really know ............. I guess I will check the filter in a month or so to see if it is dirty ....
5 #### I do n't know how about it , because it is a gift . I will give it to my mother 's coworkers . Thank you .
1 #### China made china made china made short changed not made in the USA sorry not impressed we should ask more
5 #### Great frisbee - even for children . Easy to throw and easy to catch . Best frisbee I ever bought ... and I eventually bought TWO because my 6 year old niece loved it so much , I gave her my first one .
5 #### This is my 5th or 6th pair or these . They get continuous use all summer 6 days a week 10 + hours a day . Very comfortable easy to walk in all day long . I would n't keep buying them if they did n't work for me .
5 #### This neck warmer looks elegant , very soft , very warm . I 'm using it for visits to cold climate states and countries . I would buy this again .
5 #### Same good quality and affordable price tag that I 've experienced with Tasco products since the mid-1980 's . Best of the economy class scopes . It 's not a Leupold or a Nikon but it gets the job done .
3 #### GOOD OVERALL KIT BUT I THOUGHT ROD TIP WOULD HAVE SLOT FOR CLEANING PAD .
2 #### I expected the costume to be made of fabric , but it is made of thin material , almost like foam / paper , and does not look durable . The hat is even thinner ( like surgery cap ) . It 's fine for an evening of trick or treat and for pictures . My son seems to like it .
5 #### These are the most comfortable and best fit I 've found anywhere . I 'm glad I got them , will get more , and definitely recommend them .
4 #### size is perfect , nice color , but hold in heat , almost no ventilation . Not good for a hot sunny day
5 #### Accurate description , great price & Super fast shipping . Highly recommended !
5 #### This shoe dope as heo ' fits dope on me . I m a be swagging in my school . Fuqk yhu talking about * bang * * bang *
5 #### This is a definite MUST HAVE for dutch oven cooking . It keeps a hot lid off the ground and keeps it clean preventing dirt and ashes from contaminating the lid . This is a very use full product as you can place other items if need be . The stand folds and become more compact so it is easy to pack away . Love this product no complaints .
5 #### Terrific original sneakers . We keep ordering because better than any of the knock - offs .
4 #### These stockings fit very nicely . I have now worn them several times and they have not torn yet - which others usually do after the first or second time . I will buy these again .
4 #### More than I need for space but love the feel of leather . Change area does not stay closed so need to carry in bag to catch fallout .
4 #### They are okay , but a little big . This is why I hate buying clothes from amazon . But still better than going to the store
5 #### 1 . Cut 30%-50 % through . 2 . Insert dog treats . 3 . Throw towards dog .
5 #### How do you rate something you already have 5 of ? Sure , Converse as a general rule a slightly more narrow than a regular athletic shoe and they have less cushion and they are flat with zero arch support .. but then I did n't really buy these for all that . I bought them because the 20 year olds in my life would be embarrassed if I constantly wore the shoes that make my feet feel happy . They are not the greatest most comfortable shoe to ever hit the planet but they come in all colors and while not super cozy they are comfortable enough not to complain about them .
4 #### normally Nike fits small so we go up a half size . These actually fit to my wife 's appropriate size . So be ware when you order .
2 #### I bought a black size M version of this shirt in 2016 and it quickly became one of my favorite shirts . It fit me great and was thick and sturdy but not overly so . Fast forward to June 2017 and I decide to order four more of these shirts since I loved the first one I bought so much . I notice a difference immediately on arrival . The shirt seems thicker and wider , and I noticed it says Made in Honduras , whereas my last one was made in Guatemala . I toss one of the shirts in the wash to see if it 'll shrink down to the size of my old one , but the sizing is still different . It 's wider and longer with a smaller neck opening and thicker fabric . It might fit someone else well but it was n't the same fit I bought last year , which is what I was looking for . Worth a gamble I guess , but do n't expect the same shirt each time you buy .
5 #### Bought this for a female friend of mine and she loved it .
5 #### The tres chic fashion forward digital camo . Fits as advertised . Git some .
5 #### Love this organizer . I have three stacked in my dresser drawer . It 's a great way to store easily find earrings and I have so many !
5 #### Despite everyone 's recommendations to start with the " Trainer " I skipped to the " point five " and I can barely squeeze them together . After 3 sets , I got a blister on the inside of my pinkie . These grippers are not for the faint of heart . Unless you 're grip is already REALLY STRONG , start with the Trainers and work up . The Trainer : Grown men start here
3 #### Very good design but it was broken upon delivery- used super glue to reattach :)
5 #### My Husband is a tall THIN man , so finding clothes that fit him can be a chore . I ordered these because of the stretch straps hoping that would help with the fit . He likes to where these working on outside projects and these will work just fine . They feel and look like they will last . We are both very happy with the purchase . Thanks
5 #### I got them for my girlfriend and they fit perfectly . She loves them , as she can wear them for almost every occasion . Not the best for when it rains , but I think it is well known ( and anyway clear from pictures and descriptions ) .
5 #### I was a bit doubtful , not quite understanding how it would work from the photos , but it 's a terrific little gizmo , especially for $ 20 . Definitely recommended for those of us who ca n't quite kick anyone above the shoulder . ;-)
4 #### I had to return the shoes because it was too large . I will reorder in a smaller size .
3 #### I got this bag on ebay , and it was advertised as leather- since buxton is usually quality leather I was very excited to get this cross body large wallet / bag . Unfortunately it 's vinyl with the vinyl smell to go along with it . Very disappointed ! It 's a nice design but I was expecting a leather product- not a vinyl bag . :( 12/28/12- This bag is now $ 8.99 on ebay with free shipping . I called the number for customer service , pointed out that the time between receiving this item and Christmas , they dropped the price by nearly half . I wanted to return it ( 60 day return policy ) or get the new price and keep it . They refunded paypal $ 9.50 ! ! ! ! Thanks e - bag . Will do business with you again anytime . :)
5 #### seem to be made well and there are doing there job
4 #### it 's a mil boonie hat in my favorite camo pattern
4 #### I bought this watch for my daughter . She is beginning to tell time and I thought this would be good for her . My only complaint is that the face scratches very easily and kids can be pretty rough on watches .
1 #### this is a disappointing one . it 's adorable bike and my son loves it , but i purchased it for christmas and as i was up late christmas eve i had to re - drill pilot holes that were n't the proper size and depth for the screws included for assembly , not to mention the fact that they were n't properly lined up either . the hole thing should have taken about 10 minutes and ended up taking around 2 hours . i had to hammer this thing together like a caveman , and was left with a lopsided crooked scooter bike . i wish it had been manufactured with a little more care . sadly the factory machine assembly line world we live in does n't offer much quality .
4 #### just got them today & i have to say first these things are the real deal , i 've played with hand grips for yrs . but never did any training with them . like other reveiws stated if u are not a workout & grip training freak start out with the lowest weights , everybody says get the trainer but that even takes allot of strength if u ( like me ) just started with this type of workout . I say get the sport 60 or 80 lb . gripper befor the trainer . if u have done this befor then get the trainer and work your way up . they are rough on the hands , i double wraped some electrical tape around them it helps a little . I always say i have hands like bear paws and my pinky barely fits on the grip ( but 4 me that s normal ) 4 me its easier if u hold them up side down and use them .
4 #### Fit my big 6 year old quite nicely . They are bulky , but seem to do the job without limiting mobility .
5 #### Quite a large cloth and works well polishing your silver jewelry or other silver items .
5 #### Little tight to get on if you have a lower fore grip might not work
5 #### You ca n't go wrong with an old school pair of chuck 's ! !
5 #### Nice handles too . The clips on the handles make it easy to combine multiple bands for extra resistance . At the price , I do n't see how you can beat it .
5 #### This bag is heavily constructed . I am an ammo re - loader and I usually put my bullets into ammo boxes ( which is a humbug and waste of time ) . With the bottom holes plugged with a piece of cloth then secured with duct tape , I now just fill this bag with my bullets saving me time in preparation to go shooting at the range . I also have another one that is used to throw my spent shells .
5 #### they are Chucks - you know what to expect . :)
5 #### You can never go wrong with chucks . They fit perfectly .
5 #### Not for extreme cold . Not for extreme light weight backpacking .
5 #### Nicest and most versatile band system I 've seen in over 10 years . My only suggestion would be to increase the thickness of material under the foam in the handles . I fear repeated use at the combined higher multiple band tensions will cause the handles to deteriorate . Otherwise a well conceived product !
4 #### High quality , strong gripper . I 'm 6'3 " 190 - 200 lbs and this was my first gripper . I was n't able to close it completely when I got it but soon built up to being able to close it several time ( after 2 - 3 weeks ) . A great place to start for bigger guys looking for a challenge . only reason it 's not 5 stars is the non - slip grip will destroy your hands . It hurts and will break the skin and leave gnarly callouses so I ca n't use it everyday . Maybe my form is n't perfect but I 've done my research on it so it 's at least adequate and especially on the last joint of my fingers , they really get torn up . Solid product for real men who do n't mind rough hands though . I definitely noticed a difference in my grip strength , finger strength / stability , and forearms . Overall I really like it but next time I 'll opt for the smooth handles to save the skin on my hands .
2 #### for the price I was pleased . And the first few days I used it , it keep steps perfectly . But now several months later , It over counts no matter how much I adjust it ! And do n't even think about using it at home ...
5 #### I like the large numbers and it lights up enough to see at night
5 #### Ordered these for my Brother . He 's very pleased with the fit , comfort and materials . Very pleased with this purchase .
4 #### I love these shoes for all day every day wear . Will definitely buy again .
5 #### This was a perfect gift for a three year old . She is so excited that it has not left her wrist since we gave it to her . She loves to tell us what time it is and the fact that she can push in the bezel and the face lights up just makes it even better . The band is very soft and easily adjusts to a small wrist .
5 #### easy to use while waiting for delivery of my gun safe .
5 #### Chucks always run a bit large , so I always order a 1/2 size down . So , if these were my first pair ( Jeff Bezos probably was n't even out of high school yet then ... ) , I 'd say they run " somewhat large " instead of " fit as expected " . :)
5 #### Really love keen shoes , they fit great and are instantly comfortable .
5 #### My husband has one at home for small jobs on models . .he liked his so much that he had me order 2 for his work .
3 #### sagging crew neck thin material,,all of my other carhartt tee`s ` that i have bought in the past seem to have thicker material,,,don`t know why these particular tee`s fit this way something is different,,,maybe it`s the manufacture from a different country .
5 #### Exactly what I needed . Perfect fit to treadmill we bought at Sears years ago
5 #### Have reorder three yrs in a row . My husband absolutely likes the comfort and look of this shoe . Only downside is he likes the camo print and have not been able to get in past 2vyrs .
4 #### They do the job well and I wo n't hesitate to purchase more in the future .
3 #### Comfortable to walk on but they do n't last long . Shoes should last longer than a year , especially at $ 80 .
5 #### We 've had one of these for 10 years and the brushes finally gave out , so we are on here ordering replacements . My wife loves it , but it is a little harder for me to get my size 12 's into it . It * may * not do for people with even bigger sized feet .
4 #### Small but a good watch . It needs a longer band for thicker wrists . I have an average size wrist for a man and I can buckle it in the last three holes only .
4 #### I got tired of being unable to find my jewelry and ordered 2 of these for my earrings and neckchains at $ 15 each . They work very well as organizers --- easy to see what I have , easy to access it . But at retail $ 20 , I think it 's way overpriced . The bottom tray is heavy plastic ( a plus ) , the insides are felted plastic --- it remains to be seen if they are tarnish - resistant . The " dust cover " is flimsy , clear plastic . If you drop the box , everything will fall out . There is a hard plastic cover available --- for another $ 13 ! ? ! But - AND I like the way they work so much , I went to the local Bed B&B store and got more --- one full - size for necklaces , and two 1/2 - size 5 - compartment organizers --- their regular price is cheaper than on Amz , and they were on sale , to boot ! :-)
3 #### Does the job , simple hand pump for things like swiss balls or pool rafts . It worked fine to inflate my exercise ball
5 #### Jungle Mocs are amazing shoes . I do n't wear anything else if I have e to be on my feet a lot . They last and wear well .
4 #### Works well and fairly easy setup that will take about a half hour .
5 #### Carhartt 's Men 's Workwear are good work shirts . The material is thicker than most work shirts and they are soft and comfortable to wear . The material is heavy duty which makes them last longer and look nice even when they have been worn a lot . They fit well .
4 #### Great for the price . if you max the magnification you will get blurring , but you do n't have to max it out . could use a better eye cup ( glasses ) straight trhrough design I think is easier to sight . just be sure to get a tripod high enough to be comfortable . this is used by me as spotting scope to view wildlife / whales . I got the AmazonBasics 70 - Inch Pistol Grip Tripod and it works great with this
3 #### These are thin and tear easily . Be sure to check size chart closely . Ordering even slightly smaller can lead to ripping .
2 #### For whatever reason Crystal River does NOT put their fly line on any form of spool . My rating of the product reflects my frustration with the 45 minutes I spent getting the line from a loop onto my reel . There may be a straight forward way to manage this process but after spending a considerable amount of time successfully tying a nail knot I was not happy with the huge birds nest I built . Yesssss I 'm a fly fishing newbie . I 'm soooo looking forward to leaders , tippets and flies and , of course , casting .
3 #### The item is cute and looked good with my sons costume . However the elastic and Velcro is very frustrating . Every time the wings rubbed up against something one of the Velcro sides came apart . Eventually we just ended up tying them instead of using the Velcro Cuz we were constantly fixing them . Other than that item was OK .
5 #### I use this a lot more frequently than I would have expected . Once I singed a cheap counter top . This stand lets the lid , pan or pot sit well above the counter / table top , which prevents it from getting burnt . There is also ample room to get your hands underneath with a pot holder , which makes serving and handling easier . Simple and useful . I recommend it .
1 #### Ordered the men 's size 5 so that my daughter got her women 's size 7 , like all real chucks are , right ? Wrong ! Came as a men 's size 5 , women 's size 6.5 . Sending them back immediately ... we will see if I actually get a refund , .
5 #### very nice knife . can be a boot knife as well if you can be a bit creative .
4 #### Right up front the only reason I gave it a 4 is because I have not actually gotten to use it yet . Thick , light and appears well made . Should keep my bottom warm and dry this coming hunting season .
5 #### Tried a lot of shoes for cross training and these were the best !
5 #### I 've bought other targets that at 25 yards , with open sights , you ca n't see the hits . Not with a .22 , .223 , or 9 mm . You could barely see the hits with a 7.62 . With these targets , I can see the hits with a .22 at 40 yards , no problem . I 'll never buy the pink ones again , but I will keep ordering these !
5 #### One of the best knives I ever owned besides Spyderco the Benchmade mini Griptilian I fell in love with Benchmade mini Griptilian instantly I recommend it five star 100 % lightweight beautiful knives by Benchmade company
5 #### Just like the last pair I have worn out . Easily broken in , and fits like a glove . Sperry 's are excellent .
5 #### I was amazed at all of the space in such a small wallet . I had bought a purse and matching wallet with a beautiful western design on them , but the wallet was too big to fit in the purse ! ! This took care of that problem . Buxton has never failed me ! Would recommend that you buy .
2 #### SHOULD SEE IT AND TRY THE SHOES BEFORE PURCHASE . THE PRICE IS HIGH FOR THE QUALITY . DEFINITELY WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN .
5 #### I love this watch ! It 's the perfect size . I definitely would not want anything bigger . The band is super comfortable . For a casual watch , it 's a winner . I especially like the light . It has a date feature , but I never use it because on shorter months , you have to reset the date . Because it is so small ( the date indicator ) , it 's easy to ignore .
5 #### After reading the reviews and seeing the recommendations of ordering two sizes smaller I was EXTREMELY WORRIED that they would n't fit . I am normally a 10 -11 womens shoe . I ordered a 9.5 . I should have gotten the 10 . However , the shoe looks great . Hopefully me wearing really thin socks with them will stretch them out to make them fit comfortably .
5 #### Best sling shot ever and it comes pre assembled and free ammo plus it is extremely accurate
5 #### Heavy duty high quality work pants . The 38 waist fit comfortably .
4 #### I recently purchased a boat with a poling platform and quickly found to be able to haul life vests a bunch of my onboard storage was taken up by the vests . I have seen these on T tops before and thought it might work under the poling platform ( which is dead space ) . So far it works great and does just what I wanted . It does have some extra pockets on the back side but they are hard to access since they are on the backside of the boat . Other than that I could not ask for anything better . I only haul 3 extra vests most of the time which leaves a little room to stow my jacket when it warms up .
5 #### It was just what I wanted . Great Price and shipped very quickly . I could n't find one I liked in a store so when I saw this on Amazon it was just what I was looking for . Glad I made the purchase .
5 #### High quality . Heavy blade . The straight edged blade has worked great so far . I would recommend to anyone interested in a good utility or self defense type knife . Sheath holds knife securely , so you do have to pull firmly to get it out . Which is much better than it falling out by accident .
5 #### High quality t - shirt runs a size large for me ... XL fits like XXL . Unless it shrinks in the wash ? ? Then ... ? ?
4 #### This is a great dart board set if you are new to playing or planning on having it for kids and teens . The board is ready to go right out of the box . The board and the darts feel sturdy and I think I will get years of good play out of these . The darts stick pretty well and the board has held up well so far . You could get a nicer board but this is a perfect addition to a rec room . I 'd definitely recommend giving this a try .
5 #### I just picked these up for my uniform working at A&F , and I got ta say there 's a reason they 'll never go out of style . These shoes are damn fine , and they 're the only thing I own that 'll really fit my flat feet . My roommate / coworker gets a lot of use out of them , too .
2 #### I had forgotten that I had this exact watch a few years ago . My only complaint with it is that it " fogs up " inside the crystal almost daily . This is not caused from wearing it while washing hands , dishes , etc . It does in when you walk from A / C out into the heat , etc . I do n't know if other Timex watches are sealed better than this one . Quite a disappointment .
5 #### He loves it , his favorite work shirt base layer on cold mornings . Note , these sizing appear to be for 22 year olds that just existed the marines , not for us 48 year olds that just existed the office . I normally wear a large size shirt and they are just a bit too large , but medium would never work . A large in this fit like a medium or maybe even a little smaller . I 'm going to get an extra large , and then hopefully if I just lose some weight I wo n't have to give this one away .
5 #### First , shipping was very fast and the company provided their number so you can reach them directly . Bands are incredible - very well made , sturdy and I expect these will last for many years . I think the scale of pounds per resistance bands is true to the rating . I would like something stronger than the red and black bands for squats and lunges . Men will need heavier bands than women , especially for a lower body workout . It does come with a detailed book detailing the various full body workouts using the bands . I will definitely be taking this with me on my work trips as I can do these in my hotel room .
5 #### Bought these for my 16yr old son and he is very pleased . He said these are very comfortable .
5 #### I have several Benchmade knifes ( all of which have a specific purpose ) and this is my EDC . Perfect size for me . Great quality , life time sharpening from factory . Really nice utility knife !
5 #### Used these to mount two kayaks on my garage ceiling . Its a little bit of work , but worth it after it was finished . Lowering and hoisting is pretty easy . Only wish the rope was a little bit thicker to make it easier on the hands . I have had no trouble with slippage . It grips and holds really well and I have my yaks up to within a few inches of my ceiling joists on a non finished garage ceiling . Granted , its was a little bit easier since I did not have a finished ceiling .
2 #### this really did nothing for my tennis elbow .... it really did nothing for my entire arm .... i was very unimpressed and returned it ....
5 #### My daughter begged for these shoes for months before she finally got them and they are her absolute favorite ! They were a good purchase and a happy teen is priceless ! Should we need to purchase another pair we will do so . They are a versatile and can go with any look and have n't had any issues with staining socks due to the dark color , which is always nice ! My daughter can wear them all day long with no blisters and no soreness of feet . They are very comfortable for her and we highly recommend them should someone want this look . She does say they make her feet look big , which i think is silly but , what can ya do ? She still loves them and her friends also have matching pairs , which makes for great fun at school . These also pair well with just about any color as they are black ans white.&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/Converse - Chuck - Taylor - All - Star - High - Black-10 - B - M - US - Women-8 - D - M - US - Men / dp / B000OLRWO2 / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">Converse Chuck Taylor All Star High Black 10 B(M ) US Women/8 D(M ) US Men</a >
4 #### Seems to be good quality , a bit harder than I would like , but I am a light person so may be better for heavier folks .
5 #### They are versatile , comfy , cute , sporty and come in a variety of colors . If you do n't have a pair or a knock - off pair somewhere , who are you , I say ?
4 #### I ordered two sizes bigger because I wear sweatshirt and a shirt underneath it I could 've went one size bigger yet otherwise they 're very nice and more
4 #### I needed 3 of these for my boys , and of course they had to have their favourite colour . These scooters arrived at my Post office in less than a week at a overseas military address . Scooters were exactly as described . Adjustable height for the handle bars . Capable of folding up to a relatively small size for stowage , or travel . Why the 4 stars as opposed to 5 ? This is because the handle bar shaft fits somewhat loosely in the neck of the scooter . I would expect it to be of a tighter fit . Every Razor scooter I have ever seen or handled demonstrated this looseness in the neck . Other than that they are great !
5 #### This watch is great and fun for kids . My niece enjoys telling time from it , and wears it all the time - except to bathe . The wrist band is a little long and sort of wraps around to the face of the watch , but I suppose this can be easily rectified by snipping it a bit , however we tucked it under the band - just in case she puts on some weight during the watch 's lifetime . All in all its a nice starter watch to learn analog time telling . The blue light that lights up the face is adorable .
2 #### No cushion for ankles or soles like the pair I bought my son last year . Support is everything in shoes so not sure if I would recommend these .
5 #### The shirt runs long . It 's the first time my husband did n't need the tall . He likes the shirts quite a bit .
1 #### I bought this for my 14 year old nephew 's birthday . He got it all set up and the netting ripped after the second time he kicked the ball at it . Not sure if it was a defect or very cheaply made , but I was not very impressed with the quality of this product . Unless you 're buying it for a young child who ca n't kick the ball very hard , I would avoid this product .
3 #### Luckily I have a daughther with a foot just a bit smaller than mine . I like the shoe but it 's a bit small .
5 #### Works perfect . You can fit two full size pots on it . Very powerful too - I would say it gets a good bit hotter than my home gas stove .
5 #### My son uses this for In Line skating and bike riding . They are comfortable , offer a nice range of motion without restriction and have saved him on quite a few spills . He says they are comfortable and he wears them for extended periods of time .
3 #### Well I was a little hopeful that this would work for roller hockey with a puck if I used a neck guard with it but after getting it , no luck . A shot to the face would hurt a lot , the foam does n't hug your face like a real goalies helmet does and its really thin foam . Any shot on the lower half sends all the force directly to the front and center of your chin pushing it back instead of evenly on the head / face . I feel like a street hockey puck could break the plastic with a hard enough slap shot . For costing so little I ca n't be upset , just a little dream to have that style helmet in hockey . The protection in the back is n't complete either . Sidenote , it does n't look quite as cool in real life as the picture . The forehead seems a little bigger on it . Conclusion , probably fine for ball hockey , ca n't use it with pucks . ( I 'd avoid any no bounce balls with water in them because of the added weight ) If you open your mouth your lower chin will be exposed . Again for a ball whatever but puck , no way in hell . I guess I have to be Jason next year for Halloween .
4 #### This is my third iteration of this watch . The first two lasted me almost 15 years , One still works and I 'll use as a back up , but the first one which I just retired was never off my wrist for the first 5 years except to replace the bands.swimming in the salt water , light snorkeling and residential construction . It was used and abused . Finally pulled the stem out , and I mean out , and put it back in and it still worked for a year . Never even fogged . Like I said , my third one . The 4 star rating ? I do n't give 5s .
5 #### My daughter has wanted a pair of these for years ! I finally broke down & agreed so began my task of finding a pair for less than $ 100 . She wears a ladies 6 1/2 so I ordered a 5 in big kids , it 's perfect !
5 #### Perfect mat ! I use it for the infamous p90x and I wanted to be equipped with the best product available ! It has n't let me down , great condition and does well with sweat all over the mat ! It is pricey , but it 's well worth it IMO .
5 #### This knife is exactly the right size for me . Years ago had a stainless steal one . Lost it the SS one was thinner but no longer available .
5 #### They look cool , they 're classics , comfortable if you do n't like thick soul Nike 's . They 've survived an entire weeks worth of 12 hour walks through the hot Florida weather and kept my feet pretty comfortable . Little bleach and cotton ball cleans her up nice too .
1 #### Too bulky , too heavy , too slippery . I really wish I could return this mat - it 's a burden to lug around . Tried to give it a couple months to see if it would break in but to no avail .
4 #### Took these out for two nights of tent camping and they were great . They seem very solidly constructed , tough material and held air perfect straight out of the box . I was concerned they 'd sag a bit the first night after the material relaxed , but it was solid two nights in a row ! Great product !
4 #### Does what it 's supposed to do . Both scope and iron sights .
5 #### exactly what i had been looking for to quickly tie my boat up to a dock ! Looks like it 's good quality ! much cheaper than any ropes i could find locally
3 #### tiny band .. i do not recommend for dose with big wrists .. u can get it if u hve a tiny wrist ... its nyc though ..
5 #### Used in Occupational Therapy . If I had purchased at OT , it was $ 30 . EXACT same item . Effective in my therapy .
4 #### Still breaking them in for use at the gym . I think once I get used to them , they 'll work great ! :)
5 #### For the money , this helmet is awesome . It 's pretty sturdy plastic but you might want to glue it together . It will make a really fun Halloween costume and it will also look great sitting on a shelf . It fits big and I can pretty much guarantee you 'll need to put some padding in it . There 's really no possible way that it would n't fit any adult human head with room to spare . It 's not screen accurate , so it wo n't satisfy true nerds . But it looks like a stormtrooper and I 'm sure you could do some customizations if you wanted to fully nerd out . I 'm planning on it myself . PS I was very happy when I received the 2 peice version , not the crap rubber one shown in the pic . If you guys would put up an accurate pic , you would sell more of these .
5 #### Easy to use and light on the carry . I keep these in my car and in my backpack supply .
4 #### The card would not align properly which made it terribly frustrating and inaccurate . However , as is typical of Brunton , they replaced it with a NEW unit , no questions asked . Brunton is a great company to work with . Everyone makes mistakes , it 's how the error is resolved that sets a company apart from the competition .
5 #### Got for my 5 year old son - a must have for skiiing . Fit 's great . Super snuggly . Throw in the washer when needed .
5 #### Great lure and always a good one to throw . The last 5 trips in a couple weeks this lure has yet to leave me skunked .
5 #### I really love this brand . The shoes is durable and feeling comfortable .i like its color . so cool . Recommend to all of you .
1 #### Received two different size shoes and they are both for the right foot ... total fail . I 'll consider changing my review pending the return / exchange process .
5 #### Use this at pre school and a 2 year olds bday party . Is always a hit . Do n't even need balls with it .
5 #### I bought these for my two grandchildren for Christmas . They are very sturdy and work very well . Exceeded my expectations .
5 #### Works as advertised and would recommend for sturdy work pants .
3 #### I am a little bit disappointed cause I was wearing the 1st pair and the elastic was coming thru on the leg . I have worn Jockey underware for 5 years and this is the first time that I had to pay so much for them and then to have the elastic come thru .
5 #### I am very impressed with the quality of this product ... all elements of it . While attempting to put together an add - on not sold by Black Mountain , it was necessary for me to price out some of the parts . I honestly do not see how they can sell a product of this quality for the price they are asking . I also had occasion to call their customer service and found them to be helpful way beyond my expectations . I need it for a rotator cuff injury and it is working out perfectly . Five stars .
5 #### I received my order when promised . The packaging was appropriate n and the shoes fit well and I like them .
4 #### My song love it it is great for him and not so cost like the ones for adult , fair product for the price
5 #### este producto es muy bueno diria q excelente asi que muchas gracias por todo es una buena mercancia y medida esperada
5 #### these shoes are beautiful , there 's nothing like all white shoes , fit is good , size is right came on time
5 #### second pair I have gotten for son -- the first pair was worn all over Africa in Peace Corps -- amazing shoes
5 #### I hit the front shoulder a bit on a 5x5 bull . No problem . This broadhead punched through , hit an opposite side rib , and was sticking out 2 inches on the other side . Got both lungs and he was down after a 60 yard stumble .
5 #### It heats up really well . My hubby is very happy with it , now he can have a hot meal while stuck on the road . Thank you
5 #### Purchased these for our teenage daughter . She loves them . For both casual wear and sports .
5 #### This was a Christmas gift for my grandson , he was very excited to receive his 1st official baseball . Could n't wait to start tossing it around .
4 #### I appear to have too serious a problem for it to fix it but if you learn how to use it properly it does stretch out the area very well . Some people have mentioned a lack of instructions . Mine came with instructions for tennis elbow .
5 #### I 'm a 42 year old guy and an avid golfer . Five months ago I got new clubs and went a little overboard at the practice range . For five months I 've been battling very mild to severe elbow pain looking just like " tennis elbow " . It would get better , then I 'd play golf , and start over with the pain again . I 've iced , exercised , taken ibuprofen , etc . , and nothing made it go away completely . Received my red and green bars yesterday morning . I immediately read the directions and then started to do the " tennis elbow " exercise . You can really feel it working the injured area . On the third rep , I heard and felt a loud pop from my elbow joint . After that the pain went almost completely away and was replaced with the kind of pain you feel after exercise . Did it again this morning and " pop " went the elbow again . I 'm not saying this will work for everyone as good as it did so far for me , but it ca n't hurt . Thank you Theraband !
4 #### I thought this grip would include an end - cap for my racket handle , however , it 's just the tape and a rubber band to put over the end of the tape after it is applied . The grip tape is plenty sticky and easy to apply , however , now I do n't have a bottom to my racket . I guess it will have to do .
5 #### Love these ! I have 3 pairs ... they're so comfortable - I 'm on my feet all day & my feet actually do n't hurt at the end of the day when I wear these :) I 've learned to get these 1/2 size smaller .... I'm normally a size 7 and the 6 1/2 fit perfectly
2 #### You get what you pay for . My pair will not focus and missing lens covers . I put in drawer as a learning experience .
5 #### Bought these Keens on sale for an excellent price , just before going on a cruise to the Southern Caribbean . They fit so comfortably , and dried quickly when they got wet . I did n't experience any of the problems other described regarding discoloring of feet , etc . May have been the particular color I purchased . No blisters caused by these shoes at all , and they worked well for ziplining , which required closed toe shoes . Have never had Keens before , and saw them recommended on CruiseCritic by several regarding shoes that do well when climbing rocks around waterfalls , etc . They have lots of grip and are not bad looking for athletic shoes ! Could n't be happier .
4 #### Good so far . I have had recurring tennis elbow for years . I recently developed an exceptionally painful case of it which has n't subsided despite 2 + weeks of rest and a variety of PT exercises . Ran across the article in the NYT which featured the Tyler Twist and decided it was worth the $ 15 for a try . As I am reasonably fit and active , I went directly to the intermediate green and am glad I did as I do n't find it difficult to use at all . In just two days , the area feels better , but the pain is n't gone . I will update with progress . Step by step instructions for the exercises :
5 #### Genuine Issue Magnesium Survival Firestarter Mine was delivered with the MilSpec designator stamped in the magnesium on one side : 4248 - 01 - 166 - 6618 FSCM 62668 MFR / PN 8608 and on the other side : P.O.

4 #### Very cushion and work well . However the write up makes it sound like it will work on smaller kids . Bought them for my son ( 3yr ) and they are WAY too big . The Velcro wo n't even wrap right enough so they just kind of slide off . Fit me great though ... if only I needed knew and elbow pads ...
5 #### I was cycling in a bike lane in broad daylight . A university bus , turning , did n't see me at all , t - boning me from the side and throwing me and my bike into the street . I remember screaming , and that 's it . My sturdy steel road bike is in rough shape . The handlebars are bent and cracked , and both rims are irreparably bent . I , however , walked away from the accident without a scratch . I do n't remember what I hit , but based on my bruises and helmet damage , the bus hit me in the left shoulder and I hit the ground head first . This helmet definitely saved my life . Since the driver was at fault , the university is paying for my bike 's repairs and a new helmet . Obviously , I bought another Schwinn Thrasher .
3 #### The attached photo shows the pilling and shedding of the surface of a Turtle Fur neck warmer that I wore about 8 times . As you can see , the fibers on the surface ( which give it the unusually soft feel ) have come loose and are forming something like lint on the surface of the fabric . When I take the neck warmer off , balls of the lint cling to my face . I am still using the neck warmer , which is soft and comfortable , but I am using my fingers to pull the clumps of fibers from the surface , so they are not itchy and do not come off on my clothing and face . Knowing what I now know , I would not have purchased this neck warmer . I also bought a similar neck warmer sold by Carhartt , which is the same size , but it is less expensive and the fabric does not shed like this ; initially , it does not feel as luxurious , but in the long run , I prefer it .
5 #### This was such a great costume ! It was definitely a hit ! The size was perfect and the price was even better !
4 #### I purchased this neckwarmer to wear during a winter race . I was looking for something that would keep my neck warm , block the wind and cover my face if necessary and this was perfect . It has a snug fit that was tight when I pulled it over my head , but it was not too tight on my neck while I was wearing it .
5 #### Have searching for an old - fashioned wallet such as this and have been delighted with it since receiving it . Buxton has always had good quality and this is no exception . They have made a few changes that probably cost less to manufacture so time will tell but so far so good . I added window inserts and the leather stretched perfectly so closing it is not a problem .
5 #### I love this tool . it is a bit heavier than expected but it really does a nice job of allowing the user to accurately and consistently hit fly balls , ground balls , or line drives to any part of the field while not exhausting you fully swinging a bat .
5 #### I love these shoes . If I did n't have to wear a suit everyday I would wear these . Even in the snow in Colorado , you could pull these off with a suit if absolutely necessary ... we're a casual state . They rock in the mountains , before / after skiing , and driving . Love the color , the look , the feel , and everything about these shoes . Highly recommended !
5 #### As expected , this is an excellent piece of equipment . I used it earlier this month with my nephew to teach him orienteering skills , and it performed very well ( my nephew , not so much - though , a good time was had by all ! ) . The best compass I have ever owned !
5 #### These are amazing . You can easily see the grouping and adjust accordingly .
1 #### Wearing these sneakers was quite damaging to my left foot . After walking in them for a few hours , experienced significant pain in left calf and then in left Achilles tendon . I did n't wear them again , but subsequently , walking was painful in any other shoes for over a week due to the damage that had been done . The left sneaker is not normal - there is an area that protrudes slightly , but abnormally , where the ball of the foot makes contact . I 've worn shopping mall purchased Chuck Taylors for MANY years and find them very comfortable . In fact , I currently have a pair purchased in such a store and they can be worn ALL DAY w/o any problem whatsoever . I would strongly recommend not purchasing these sneakers . Hoping to save other potential buyers a painful experience .
5 #### These are the only pants that last in his line of work . And they look good on him as well . If you want thick strong work pants like Levis used to be then Carhartt pants should be in your future .
5 #### Love these ! Am giving them for Christmas presents this year ! You kind of wish a fly would appear ....
5 #### vanity Fair has always been a fine product . This one is excellent . I just wish it came in navy as well .
4 #### Love the sneakers .. did n't know they ran a little big .. so my next ones were half a size smaller than I normally get and they were perfect ! !
5 #### Nice shoes . 5 stars because I get alot of compliments on these shoes .
5 #### My 2.5 year old developed a sudden obsession with Superman , so we knew we had to have this costume . It was so cute on him , and he loved it . We bought the toddler size for him- he is about 35 inches tall and 25 lbs- and it fit perfectly . I was happy with the quality- the material is stretchy but thin , but it 's what you would expect for a costume at this price point .
2 #### 7 wide is what i wear , ordered 71/2 still to snug , reordered from zappos sz8 perfect . 7 in boots is my normal size . had to buy full size larger , for these sandals .
4 #### I have many of these t - shirts , this one is same shirt I would buy at a local store .
5 #### Great shoes . Fit perfectly . Comfortable right from the start . Light weight and perfect for a 12 hour work shift . Good price also .
5 #### Wow ! These are perfect ! I 'm pretty surprised because I took the chance to order online without seeing them in person first . I took the advice of those who said to order half a size up and ordered a size 8 . The fit is so perfect and the shoes are nice and lightweight . We 'll be taking a trip to some theme parks in Southern California and I wanted shoes I could wear through some splash parks and water rides . I bought the blue ( Celestial / Blue Grotto ) Venice H2s and I think the colors are beautiful . I was nervous because I normally stick to earth tones but my daughter and I decided to choose a fun color this time . The color is even prettier in person . Even though I already own several Keen shoes that I love , these shoes exceeded my expectations . Thank you , Keen !
4 #### Ok , it 's a fashion statement not an arch support shoe ...
3 #### I 've been wearing this bra for years and ordered my regular size , but this time it was too loose and the cups fit funny . What did you do to it , Bali ?
4 #### I love these shoes they are very comfortable and super cute but I think my next pair I can try a 6 they were just a little bit roomier then I would have liked .
5 #### Well made and durable . Much better than the old FOTL classics we all bought growing up .
4 #### The stays come up a little high in the middle . Not as comfortable as some I 've worn .
5 #### Used this for skiing in Colorado . REALLY keeps your neck warm . Nice and soft so there is not chafing . A GREAT invention .
5 #### Favorite Nike shoe ever ! The flex sole is excellent for someone like me who loves the free feeling of sandals or being barefoot . These move effortlessly with the bend of my foot . I 've worn these for multiple activities and I 've had no foot or ankle pain . The white / green / dark grey color goes with so many outfits and the mesh breathes perfectly on hot summer days . Highly recommend !
2 #### Size A - B is too small for a 5'6 " woman at 125 lbs ... they are comfortable , but they ran due to being stretched too much . Also , the color was closer to tan than nude .
5 #### Very nice and it fits true to size . My son is thrilled .
5 #### These are my FAVORITE knee highs . I work in finance and wear knee highs almost every day . I have tried pretty much every brand on the market and these are the best in terms of appearance , fit , and durability . I like to buy them in bulk and wish they sold them that way here . As it is , I buy most of mine at the outlet mall and only get them here when I am in a pinch . Nonetheless , highly recommended . P.S. , do n't worry that when you look at them right out of the package the weave will look a little large . They go on smooth and beautifully .
5 #### I really like these brand of tights for ice skating for my daughter . I 've bought other brands and the same size runs way too big for my daughter . These fit perfect :
5 #### My wife suggested that I use this shoe when I needed to patch our roof . It 's like what her Daddy wore for roof work . In fact it really did grip the roof . It 's bottom was a lot easier on the roof than my boots sole . In fact the boots wanted to slide ( before I got these shoes ) . They are comfortable . Back in the day , this was about all we had for gym ; we did n't have all these nice varieties , shapes , styles , colors available now . I wore these shoes to school until they wore out . Then I wore them on the farm until the canvas rotted . Then I tied them on with hay baling twine sort of like barefoot except they kept punches out of the bottom of my feet . I 'd walk in the creek with them like that . This is what boys and girls used to play high school basketball . That was when Coach Bell warned every gym student that they would NOT wear hardsole shoes on HIS gym floor , or they would get to run up the benches , or do lots of situps , or whatever else was appropriate and uncomfortable for the violator . As you see , these shoes bring back lots of nice memories for me .
3 #### I like the size of these for my toaster oven , just do n't like the sharp corners and shape of these makes them hard to get out of oven when using pot holders / oven mittens . Less then 6 months the pans starting to rust
5 #### The Good : I love these socks . They are very well built and I feel like I have a sock that will last for years . They are great for walking around the house with no shoes . Their elastic around the calf is well made and I have yet to have a pair start to get loose on me . The warmth is fantastic and they feel comfortable with all types of shoes . The Bad : They are thick , but this is probably why you bought them anyway . Just be aware that you may have tight shoes start to fit strangely because of that thickness .
2 #### They were too big ..... i guess converse come in big sizes if ur a 8.5 u should order 7.5 . When I tried to exchange for diff size there were none avail .
5 #### Got this for a variety of reasons ... this thing is faster than you expect . The extra pumping on the draw really helps , and it 's not that much more strain than a normal pump .
4 #### Shipped fast as expected , looks really good , only con is that the straps are really flimsy but overall , really good !
5 #### Obsessed with these shoes ! I was looking for good all around sneakers ( running , walking , tennis , etc . ) and these more than fit the bill . I was looking specifically for black nikes ( I love the fit ) with white soles ( good for court sports ) ; I was a little reluctant to purchase because I was n't sure whether the black on the soles would contact the ground , but it does n't !
4 #### Not wide enough for my husband but fit my daughter in law and she loves them
5 #### Love these shoes , I have worn them all day and found them really comfortable with no aching feet at the end of the day . Fantastic colour and true to size . I also bought Nike Women 's Flex Supreme Tr 3 Pnk Pw / Mtllc Slvr / Cl Gry / White Training Shoe and these shoes are slightly more comfortable than those even though they look very similar .
1 #### Too bulky , and they are for babies under 3 years old . My kids are around 5 , and their small hands could not get into those gloves .
5 #### High quality , durable , run resistant , comfortable . I will buy again !
5 #### Using this to aggregate multiple solar panels into my charge controller . One side for positive and one side for negative . Works like a champ , and allows for adding or removing panels as needed and keeps the wiring looking good .
3 #### Have n't put it to the test yet . The event I originally bought I for got canceled .
4 #### It is a compass .. It will show you where north is . What more do you need . Columbus sailed the Atlantic with less than this . It is worth the money ... Buy one .
5 #### It 's good to have these for storage . The wooly material gives some protection from moisture , and it greatly reduces all the " mystery " dings and scratches you can get when the guns are in storage or transport . My friend 's father had stored rifles in a safe for a decade . They just sit in there and leaned against the safe foam . When he pulled them out , there was rust in the barrels , and part of the gun had foam that pretty much melted onto them over the years and was a pain to removed . Really messed up the guns ' finishes . I think these gun socks would have prevent all of that . Especially if you lightly grease the guns and put them in the sock .
3 #### Okay but not sure if they 're actually original Converse ! ! Just received them today and they are brand new not in an actual converse box like my last ones ...
5 #### This rack system is great ! However , I only have one bag . I do n't think two bags will fit well . I use the additional space for other clubs , a shoe bag , etc . Very sturdy once assembled , and adjustable feet are great . Not easy to put together , but worth it . I wear a size 15 shoe , and my golf shoes fit on just one shelf . I pile balls on another and still have a 3rd shelf . I like the open basket on top . Other reviewers complained about the steel mesh , but mine was in great shape and is solid .
4 #### Arrived as described . Once organized , installation was straight forward . The product is a great size , but very light . That could be good for some . My biggest complaint is the net is too big . The balls / pucks get tangled and difficult to get out . I tie back excess and it works well .
5 #### The only thing I do n't like about this product is my tendency to lose it . lol . - works great , though , now if I could just remember to not leave it on the golf cart after the round .
5 #### This is well made , not cheap or flimsy rayon . I am 5'2 , 120 before pregnant and I opted for a medium to ensure that it would cover my bum . It does . I 'm happy with this purchase .
5 #### These are great work jeans , the fabric feels 50 % heavier than the same manufacturers jeans in the discount stores . I wear an odd size that you ca n't find in the stores except one or two at a time so I decided to order a weeks worth on line . I bought a pair of Wranglers at the local store to verify the size I wanted but when these came in they were tighter in the waist than the store pair , best laid plans . Anyway , returns were simple and I reordered a larger size . Very happy with the quality .
5 #### I bought this watch for my husband . This is the second one i have ordered for him . They last and last on the job . He is an auto mechanic and very hard on watches , but he loves these . 10 yr . battery and etc . In fact the first one i purchased 3 years ago is still in use .
5 #### A good watch is hard to find . This Timex is worth a look . It 's a dependable and attractive watch . Even though the time and date is always visible on my cell phone , I never leave the house without wearing a timepiece around my wrist . While I do n't need a lot of fancy features on my watches , they do need to reliably keep time , look and feel good , be durable yet require little handling , offer features of either a glow - in - the - dark dial or Indiglo , a second - hand sweep of the analog face and a calendar date function . And all this should be available at a decent price . Timex has always been one of my favorite watch brands , but they really deliver the goods with this Dress Sport Silver - tone model . I loved this style so much that I bought two of them , both the silver and the&nbsp;<a data - hook="product - link - linked " class="a - link - normal " href="/two - tone - Dress - Sport / dp / B00020J0SQ / ref = cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie = UTF8">two - tone Dress Sport</a>&nbsp;(gold and silver ) . The Indiglo puts out a bright , clear and consistent light for low or nighttime viewing . The watch has a good weight to it without being obtrusive or heavy . Like many of reviewers , I had my local jeweler remove about 4 links for a more comfortable fit . It 's casual enough for jeans and a blouse , or sassy enough for business and dress up attire . If you value your time , make time for this watch .
4 #### It was good but to rigid for a beginner exercise . I should have ordered the red flex bar .
4 #### These extensions help make the little P11 a joy to shoot . They do come with some rough / sharp edges however that need sanded / trimmed a bit . I tend to tweak / buff / polish everything when I get it , so that was n't a problem for me , but be prepared to spend a bit of time at the beginning .
5 #### Really nice ! I had a few years without wearing converse but I remember now why I used to loved them so much . They are comfortable and stylish . They run a bit large but I guess that 's just the brand and has nothing to do to with the seller here . They arrived on time . I have no complains . Hope this help .
5 #### This made a GREAT gift for a 6 year old . It is colorful ( flowery)and stylish ( purple and pink are her fav colors ) . She was quite excited and did n't want to take it off for night . By the end of the first day , she was telling correct time . It is simple to explain ! I 'd highly recommend this for any young elementary age female child .
5 #### These Dungs are the real thing ! They are very , very strong and wear like iron . There are a bit heavy but that 's the nature of the beast do to the high end materials used and high quality construction . They are very true to size .
5 #### I have used the boresnake on multiple weapon systems , and it simply ca nt be beat . Takes less than 30 seconds to fully clean the barrel , and I can see serious benefits from carrying something like this in the field where a full breakdown might not be possible . Boresnake FTW ! ! !
4 #### As advertised , but I thought I was getting two . Had to re order
5 #### Love this Mat ! I got the larger size and I 'm very happy I did . It is heavier , and it surprised me how much different that does feel , but its worth biking with the extra weight to yoga . It 's fantastic , my joints appreciate it a lot ! It thick but not overly squishy so I can still balance on it . Love the texture - I have no issues slipping . So happy with this mat . WOrth every penny .
5 #### Very nice tights ! The material is soft and feels great on your legs !
3 #### Way too big , even though I usually wear a 10.5EE . Had to return for a 10 , which was still too big .
5 #### I 've worn these shoes for 20 years and I wear a pair out every year . They 're probably the most comfortable walking shoes I 've ever owned and they 're suitable for almost every occasion . The fit is true to size , and as you wear them , the leather gets softer and will adapt perfectly to your foot . Dark brown is perfect because now because they look better in an office setting . The sole is padded , and makes being on your feet easier . It has good arch support as well . Although these are boat shoes , they will still slip on wet surfaces . The finish of the leather does n't lend itself to polish , and anything you try to put on ( mink oil , neutral polish , saddle soap ) will change the look . The idea is that you embrace the shoe getting beat up because it adds character . You 'll like these shoes a lot . Here 's my tip . If these shoes get so dirty that you need to clean them , throw them in the washer and use lots of neutral polish on them . They 'll get a patina like an old baseball glove .
4 #### It looks a bit nicer on the picture . Its very light in such a way that when I held the box I wondered if there was just paper filling inside . They are comfortable for the most . Good looking training shoes overall .
4 #### I liked the first so much that this was the second Peet I 've bought . Mostly I use one for boots and one for gloves ( with the glove attachment ) . I like the slow , quiet effectiveness of it . It 's perfect for overnight when skiing . My only complaint is that it 's pretty big to store / transport , so will never make it on an airplane trip .
5 #### Great sling attachments . Just make sure to read the description . They come two to a package . So do n't order two sets if you only need two attachments , like I did . Sturdy build and easy installation . Works great with my paracord sling .
4 #### I bought this for my brother ... he could n't fasten them , but I think he has gained a little weight .
5 #### This is a great item . We use ours to haul wood and animal feed . Just bought a second one because our Great Dane dog decided she wanted it as her bed . We had left the hay in it to feed horses again later that day and our dog immediately made it hers ! Much better dog bed too . Stays dry and warm . 34 . Is a Great price for this item .
5 #### This is nice inflable boat , i used on a lake and it hold really good , great product you try out
5 #### This is probably the safest and best frisbee disk for small kids . Light weight and soft plastic makes this safe and easy for kids . At the same time this is fully functional and fun for adults too . The only limitation is that these will not travel as far as the official ultimate frisbee disks , but that could be a good thing for the safety of kids .
5 #### This is a fine knife . Light , durable , and very sharp , Gerber knows how to make a blade . I love the blued surgical steel construction . The locking mechanism is hands down the best design I 've seen on a knife in this price range , and will keep the blade secure even during intense use . Could n't be happier with it . If you want a 3 " lock - blade knife that wo n't weigh you down , this is the one to get .
5 #### I bought for a teacher where I work . He was not prepared for the power of a Fox40 . He has used a metal Acme Thunderer pea whistle for 25 years . He sticks fingers in his ears when he blows his new Fox40 !
5 #### Great shoes that fit true to size ! Amazon beat the outlet price by $ 5 and saved me the trouble of having to find a parking spot !
5 #### Great to learn how to tell time . Pity it is not water resistant
4 #### These work really well . I was in a very windy damp area and these were great to use . Only thing i do n't like is they make everything stink in your pack like chemicals .
5 #### Got exactly what I was expecting , in a timely manner .
5 #### There is about a 1/2 inch of extra space from the tip of my big toe to the front of the shoe . That 's okay , though . I usually wear socks , so it does n't feel too big , even if it does make your foot look a bit long . The colors are vibrant , and the sole has plenty of grip , even on a slippery floor . I wore them for most of the day and they are comfortable . Overall , I 'm very pleased with this shoe .
5 #### I am well pleased with this set . By far the best complimentary band set ( everything in this set compliments each item perfectly ) I 've seen or used . Very well built . Sturdy . ( The stitching is well done and strong).The chrome fasteners on the tubes and " D " rings on the handles and ankle strap are strong and make for super - fast tube changing for tension adjustments . The door anchor is a fabulous addition , easy to use , well made and strong . More importantly , this set is FUN . Having used conventional equipment ( " weights " ) off ' n on most of my life , I can assure YOU that with this set you will get a better and wider range of movement for every exercise typically executed with conventional weights . To enhance the experience and development , try doing your movements " mindfully " and slowly . The " BURN " is perfectly sweet ! Just as important for me is the convenience . Easily stored . You can take them anywhere .
4 #### This box makes it a lot easier to maintain your shoes between the storage and the shoe rest on the top . A marked improvement over trying to do it " freehand . "
5 #### You got to love something to spend this kind of money on it . so far I 'm not disappointed . My only criticism would be that it sits in a hair loose . Got ta put slide on receiver upside down so it will stay in place during re - assembly . I know a swat guy who uses these on all his glocks . He says they last about three years if you fire your glock regularly ( meaning a few time a week ) . PS , I 'm told almost every swat member uses these .
5 #### The earrings are beautiful exactly what I was looking for and I am very satisfied with the quality of the gold for the fair price .
5 #### Loved it ! Was hesitant to buy , but glad I did . I use it to garden at night . Good flexibility and warmth .
5 #### These shoes are extremely comfortable , and fit as expected . Will purchase again .
5 #### I was n't sure what to expect , possibly used shoes that were worn and torn , but that 's definitely not what I got . I ended up with a set of new , pure white shoes . They 're comfortable to wear , low to the ground and are wide so that I do n't have to worry about getting ingrown toenails , but not so wide that I feel ridiculous wearing them in public . I enjoy wearing these shoes .
5 #### Got this while in therapy so I could work at home . It is well made and it does what the Dr. wants .
4 #### It is what it is works can really say a whole lot
5 #### Cool shoe My kid loves it and she has not trashed them yet . very sturdy as most chuck taylor have always been
4 #### This a great back support band . I have been wearing it for a week now and it 's great .
5 #### I bought these for my 2 year old daughter whose feet are measuring in at 5.5 inches . Kids sizes are tricky , and shoes like Converse and Saltwater sandals are even trickier , but the quality and classic nature ca n't be beat . I ordered her a size 6 Toddler , which fit her great with about a quarter to a half of an inch room to grow into . They 're adorable on ! ! ! ! And survive tough play on the playground too . Order them quickly , they go fast !
5 #### i am satisfied with the quality and fit of the shirt .
5 #### Bought these as a gift for my picky son . He absolutely loved them and says they are comfortable and he loves the style . I think they are great too and may have to buy a pair for myself !
4 #### Very very nice ! Made my legs feel silky smooth ! They were actually thicker than most sheer nylons I have purchased in stores before , which was great because it was cold when I wore them ! !
5 #### I have had these boots now for about 1 week . They fit well and are pretty close to broke in . The boots are light weight and can be worn in all day without feeling like you have 2 bricks tied to your feet . But if your looking for more tread you might want to try a different Justin boot .
4 #### The hat that came was more of a green color but still served its purpose and a great print . Very good quality and kept the Utah sun away from my face a neck .
2 #### I bought these and they fit too snug and it 's a pain to get on . I do n't use them and would n't buy them again .
5 #### Super shoes have worn in past . Good support on troubled feet .
4 #### I love converse for my little ones right now . But I know they run slightly big .
3 #### Good quality , good price . This mask is great for minor protection , has some padding , good straps , overall okay for my use .
4 #### Works great and very well made . Keeps my neck very warm .
5 #### Tired of leaking , stained kitchen containers ? We switched to Nalgene lab ware years ago and it just lasts and lasts . More expensive up front but well worth it . Will not leak , can be frozen , thawed , nuked , whatever . Convenient sized . If you send leftovers home with someone , they will always know which container is yours . Does n't stack .
5 #### My husband is a mail carrier and uses these for all the cold days he is out delivering . He keeps them in his gloves or pockets and they stay warm for 6 - 8 hours . Could n't live without these !
4 #### This is your basic soccer ball . It looks as pictured . What a great deal . Quality was fine and standard . If uou are looking for a decent basic ball this is fine .
5 #### Owned this blade for over ten years . Extensively used outdoors , in the wet Pacific Northwest , and still in great condition . The powder coating will come off with heavy use , but the underlying steel has never rusted on me . Sharp . Solid . Well balanced . Full tang , thick steel that wo n't bend sideways when you try to pry with the blade , or bend at the handle when you press hard . Comfortable grip . This knife is just fun to hold . I am an active , long trek hiker , and though this blade is a bit heavy , I would n't leave home with anything else ! ( By the way , a brightly colored lanyard will help you prevent losing it )
